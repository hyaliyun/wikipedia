History In the early 20th century, the Jewish community gathered in the building on Rue du Grand-Ch√™ne in Lausanne. The community grew rapidly and wanted to have a larger place of worship. Upon the death of French merchant Daniel Iffla (\\"Osiris\\"), the City Council of Lausanne received a bequest of 50,000 francs. This donation aimed at building a new synagogue which had to be inspired from the Buffault Synagogue in Paris. The synagogue was built in 1909‚Äì1910 thanks to the financial support of the local Ashkenazi community. The City of Lausanne also allocated 300,000 francs for the construction. The building was designed by Vaudois architects Charles Bonjour, Adrien van Dorsser and Oscar Oulevey and inaugurated on November 7th, 1910. The cost of land acquisition and construction totalled 280,000 francs, including 48,000 francs for the structural system and 28,000 francs for the decoration and the furniture. After WWII, the community grew and integrated Sepharadi Jews, which requested unity in the rites and the use of the synagogue. In 2010, Israelite Community of Lausanne and the Canton of Vaud (CILV) celebrated the centenary of the synagogue and organised events aimed at \\"forging bonds with Lausanne and Vaud people\\", including an exhibition about the history of the synagogue. The synagogue is now listed among the Cultural Property of National Significance. It is used for Shabbat celebrations, but usually the daily service takes place in a smaller underground room. In 1995, a liturgical music concert took place at the synagogue. Architecture The Romanesque-Byzantine synagogue has a long nave that can be reached from the vestibule. Three sides of the nave are bordered by galleries with 160 seats for women. The stalls are dedicated to men only. The Almemohr has a tabernacle with the Torah scrolls, as well as the seat used by the rabbi. The paintings were made by Otto Alfred Briffod and the stained-glass windows were manufactured by the workshop Guignard & Schmid. There is an adjacent sacristy. The underground floor has several locales.

It is mainly built in Kei islands, Southeast direction from Seram. It is mainly used for interinsular transport, but they are unsuitable for long haul voyages between Moluccas, Sulawesi, and Java. It is also known as perahu kalulis, ang kalulis, kalulus, and kulis.  Description  These boats is fairly shallow and beamy, and rigged with tanja rig on 1 or 2 masts, presumably in tripod mast. It is steered using double lateral rudders, and having a deckhouse. These boats is internally dowelled and contain lugs on all the planks. In the past, they are lashed together using fiber through carved lugs on the plank interior, but this technique has been disappeared in Kei islands during 1940s. They are between 4.5-14 m in length, with beam-to-length ratio varied between 1:2.33 to 1:3. The average depth of 5.25-7.5 m long kalulis was 1.3 m.Ellen (2003). p.154. Since 1945, they have been fitted with fixed wooden ribs (gading) and had 5-8 planks. Materials of modern boats were different from older boats: The ropes which was originally made from coconut husk (tali utis) and gemutu (tali nauk) were replaced by polypropylene ropes. The sail which was made from sago leaf matting or karoro (sacking, sorat pisang of Java), now being made by cotton or polypropylene cloth, sometimes polyethylene sheets.Ellen (2003). p.157. Modern boats used the gaff and gunter (nade) rig. The double lateral rudders (cangkilan) generally have been replaced by a centerline rudder.Ellen (2003). p.158. Because they had no keel, stability was an issue, so they are not suited for voyage between main islands of Indonesia.  Role  They are used for middle-distance journey between Geser, Gorom, Watubela, Teor, Kei, Tayandu, Aru, and Papuan coasts. These boats are used for transporting passengers and cargo, and occasionally for fishing, turtle hunting, and collecting agar-agar. These boats is the traditional mainstay for sago inter- island trade.  Replica  * One replica of kalulis built by Tim Severin is named Alfred Wallace. The boat is used in \\"The Spice Islands Voyage\\", the last of Severin's nautical adventures, reenacting naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace's voyage in the archipelago. The 14-metre craft was much smaller than those generally used by Wallace. Severin did have a few modern adaptations: a satellite communications system, a wind generator and a nine-horsepower motor for emergencies.

Set in Hell, themed as a college town, the player navigates conversations, outdrinks Satan, and returns two best friends from the afterlife.  Plot  Lifelong friends and recent college graduates Milo and Lola find themselves in Hell, with no recollection of how they came to be there. After being assigned a Personal Demon, Sister Mary Wormhorn, they meet Sam, a psychopomp cab driver. Sam explains that while demons torture humans during work hours, both groups enjoy the nights drinking and partying together. The only way out of Hell is to outdrink and out-party Satan himself. After procuring an invite to Lucifer's party, Milo and Lola eventually meet Satan himself, who demands they prove their abilities by obtaining seals of approval from his brothers and sisters, the Monarchs of Hell. One of the Monarchs is Apollyon, a judge of the Dead. Milo and Lola sneak into a demons- only bar to find Apollyon, who sees through their disguise and agrees to give them a seal if they serve as lawyers for Roberto, a soul charged with serial murder. Milo and Lola can either throw the trial per Apollyon's wishes or else let Roberto ascend to heaven and challenge Apollyon afterward; either way, Apollyon will give the pair her seal. Another Monarch is the hard-partying Asmodeus, who is trying to forget about his recent breakup with his ex, Beth. Milo and Lola can either get Asmodeus and Beth back together or otherwise beat Asmodeus in a dance-off, to obtain the necessary seal. Having obtained the needed seals, Milo and Lola return to Satan's party, with a team of challengers drawn from the people they have befriended during the night. Apollyon attempts an intervention, feeling that Satan's drinking is out of control and Hell is suffering because of it, but Satan angrily teleports Milo and Lola away to continue the drinking contest. The game has multiple endings, depending on Milo and Lola's performance in the drinking game. If they win, they are sent back to Earth and resume their lives. If they lose the contest or refuse to play, they remain in Hell. Some time afterward, Milo and Lola relax at a bar and discuss the current situation; depending on the player's actions, Satan can be recovering from his addictions or have fallen off the wagon, but Hell appears to be running better. Sam bursts in, having created another plan to possibly allow them to escape Hell, to which Milo and Lola immediately agree.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favourable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. PC Gamer said, \\"I had high expectations for Afterparty. I was expecting a comedy title, set in a fantasy world that could have been from a Noel Fielding sketch. But the very real relationship between Lola and Milo, the witty humour that had me chuckling every minute and the audacity on show from Night School Studio to go where they did, at the risk of their player's discomfort, made Afterparty even more than I thought it could be.\\" IGN said, \\"Night School has crafted an original take on the Biblical location, smartly riffed on moral and societal ideas, and told a personal, intriguing story about Milo and Lola‚Äôs afterlives.\\" The Verge gave the game a positive review, saying, \\"Throughout this all, Afterparty weaves together its bigger questions about relationships, growing up, and what it means to be a good person through its sharp-tongued humor.

Mainetti, a 60-year-old Catholic sister and Sister of the Cross who was mother superior of a local convent which specialised in helping juvenile delinquents, had left the convent the night before to meet with a girl who had telephoned her. Mainetti had been stabbed 19 times. Three weeks later, police arrested three girls aged 16 and 17 on suspicion of the murder. The three girls, Ambra Gianasso, Milena De Giambattista and Veronica Pietrobelli, had no prior history of crime or violence and came from middle-class families. After a witness told police that he had seen the four together on 6 June, the girls' telephones were monitored by police, and in one phone call, two of the girls discussed the killing. A clump of hair belonging to one of the girls was found in Mainetti's clenched hand. In custody, the girls initially said they killed the sister \\"for a game\\", later saying they killed her in a satanic sacrifice. Initially, the girls had wanted to kill the parish priest, but decided that Mainetti, who had previously taught them catechism, would be an easier target. One of the girls telephoned Mainetti claiming to have been raped and impregnated and to be considering an abortion, and they arranged to meet in Marmitte dei Giganti park at 22:00 on 6 June. After walking with Mainetti to the park, the girls made the sister kneel on the ground and shouted abuse at her. De Giambattista beat Mainetti with a brick and Gianasso repeatedly rammed the sister's head against a wall. The three girls then took turns in stabbing Mainetti with a kitchen knife. The girls' intention was to stab the sister 18 times‚Äî6 times per girl, as per the number of the beast‚Äîbut they instead stabbed her 19 times, \\"ruining\\" the ritual. As she was being attacked, Mainetti prayed, asking God to forgive the girls.  Legal proceedings  De Giambattista, Gianasso and Pietrobelli were summarily tried at the juvenile court of Milan on 9 August 2001, with the prosecution requesting sentences of 15 years and 4 months for Gianasso, 11 years and 4 months for Pietrobelli, and 10 years and 4 months for De Giambattista. The latter two were convicted of murder and sentenced to 8 years and 6 months' imprisonment, the court taking into account that they were partially insane at the time of the crime. Gianasso was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity and was ordered to spend a minimum of three years at a youth detention centre. The prosecution appealed for Gianasso's acquittal to be overturned to a conviction with a sentence of 12 years, 7 months and 10 days' imprisonment, and for De Giambattista and Pietrobelli's sentences to be upheld. On 4 April 2002, the appeal court of Milan overturned Gianasso's acquittal and declared her only partially insane at the time of the crime, sentencing her to 12 years and 4 months' imprisonment, while upholding De Giambattista and Pietrobelli's sentences. Gianasso appealed her sentence, and on 17 January 2003, she was released from prison as the Supreme Court of Cassation had not reached a verdict on the appeal. She returned to prison six days later after the court upheld her sentence. Pietrobelli was released from prison on 4 July 2004. Following her release, she participated in a community service program in Rome for two years. De Giambattista was released on 2 May 2006 and also participated in a community service program. From December 2007 until her release, Gianasso was also allowed out of prison during daytime hours to do community service.  Aftermath  Alessandro Maggiolini, Bishop of the Diocese of Como, opened the diocesan phase of Mainetti's beatification process at the Collegiate Church of Saint Lawrence in Chiavenna on 23 October 2005. On 20 March 2008, he announced that the request for the initiation of her beatification process had been approved. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared her a martyr, eliminating the need for recognition of a miracle. The Congregation declared her a martyr again on 19 June 2020. Her beatification is scheduled for 6 June 2021, the twenty-first anniversary of her murder. On 26 February 2019, Mainetti's remains were exhumed from Chiavenna cemetery and placed in the Collegiate Church of Saint Lawrence.

Multiple empires have been described as such, often for the same time period, resulting in a problematic assessment of the conflicting scholarly opinions and points of view on the matter. There is therefore a general lack of consensus between the various authors and scholars in reference to the nations and empires that were allegedly the world's most powerful at various points in history.A Political History of the World The status of foremost power at a global scale implies that of superpower, although it does not necessarily mean that the world is unipolar nor that there is a sole superpower. The United States is usually described as the current global foremost power, as well as the world's sole superpower, although it is generally agreed that the present age is still one of multipolarism. The term \\"potential superpowers\\" describes polities that could rival American primacy in the future. From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776 (Published 2008), by Professor George C. Herring (Professor of History at Kentucky University) History As mentioned above, the label of foremost power has been given to different empires that even co- existed at their peak. This can be explained by the fact that different scholars work on different sources and have different perspectives on what makes an empire the world's most powerful. For the first century, the term has been applied to both the Roman Empire and the Han Chinese Empire. These two empires covered a similar amount of territory and had a similar population. In reference to the 16th and 17th centuries, when globalization emerged, the term has been applied to a variety of empires including the Ming Chinese Empire, the Portuguese Empire, the Spanish Empire, their Iberian Union, the Habsburg Empire as a whole, and the Islamic Gunpowder empires of Ottoman Turkey, Mughal India, and Safavid Iran.A Political History of the World The Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of France were also often considered the foremost powers in Europe, due to their size and population, even if they lacked a global empire comparable to that of other European nations. The Kingdom of England and the Dutch Republic, rising in Europe and globally, have also been described as the \\"foremost powers\\" of this period. Giovanni Botero, one of the first scholars of international relations, identified instead the Papacy as the foremost power of the Renaissance and Counter-Reformation era. During the Cold War, the term has been applied to both the United States and the Soviet Union. The concept of superpower, developed in order to describe these two nations and (earlier) the British Empire, became more common than that of foremost power largely because it was not possible to identity a single hegemonic force in global affairs. This can be considered true for most of history as well.

The more characteristical rules in knockdown karate compered to other styles is that you are not allowed to punch in the face and a point system that only count hits that actually \\"hurt\\" the opponent.

History  The failure of the Dutch East Indies government to take advantage of the swift flow of water from Lake Toba through Asahan River prompted Indonesian government to build a hydropower plant. In 1972, the hydropower development plan strengthened after the government received a report from Nippon Koei, a Japanese consulting company, that the feasibility study of building hydropower plant was possible to be built as well as an aluminum smelter as the main user of the electricity it produced. Following the study, after lengthy negotiations and with economic assistance from the Japanese government for the project - later known as the Asahan Project, the Indonesian government and 12 Japanese companies signed the master agreement on July 7, 1975 in Tokyo. Furthermore, in order to exercise capital investment in then-established company, the twelve companies together with the Japanese government formed Nippon Asahan Aluminium Co., Ltd. (NAA) on November 25, 1975. Inalum was established in Jakarta on January 6, 1976 to build and operate the Asahan Project, in accordance with the master agreement. The shares comparison between the Indonesian government and Nippon Asahan Aluminium Co., Ltd. at the time was 10% and 90%, respectively. The shares later changed gradually: in October 1978 the shares became 25% and 75%, in June 1987 it became 41.13% with 58.87%, and since February 10, 1998 it became 41.12% with 58.88%. To implement the provisions in the master agreement, the Indonesian government issued Presidential Decree No.5/1976 which underlies the formation of the Asahan Project Development Authority as a government representation responsible for the Asahan Project development. Inalum is noted as a pioneer and the first company in Indonesia who engaged in the aluminum smelting industry with total investment of 411 billion Yen. The status change of Inalum into a state-owned company occurred de facto on November 1, 2013 in accordance with the master agreement.

The site comprises two pairs of standing stones to the north and south of a large glacial erratic, the Wren's Egg itself. It was one of the first monuments taken into state care after the Ancient Monuments Act passed in 1882. √Ärainneachd Eachdraidheil Alba notes the site's significance as follows: > Standing stones are a widespread class of monument across Scotland with > notable concentrations in the Western and Northern Isles, Caithness, > Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and Dumfries and Galloway. However, pairs of > stones which appear to have been constructed as an intervisible and discrete > group are less common. These standing stones survives within an area that > has a concentration of contemporary or near-contemporary sites and as such > they have the potential to contribute to our understanding of the > development of the landscape. The pair of stones to the north are in their original settings. They stand oriented east-west, roughly 1.5m apart and 18m from the Wren's Egg. The southern pair are sited 405m from the northern stones, also in an east-welt alignment and roughly 1m apart. The standing stones are no taller than 0.6m. The Wren's Egg is not in its original position; it appears a farmer tried and failed to move it from the field. It was previously thought that the Wren's Egg lay at the centre of two concentric stone circles, but excavations in 1975 showed that this was not case. In 2012 three cists dating to the Bronze Age were discovered 155m to the northeast of the Wren's Egg. One of these cits contained skeletal remains. The Wren's Egg and standing stones were scheduled in 1887 by Augustus Pitt Rivers while visiting Sir Herbert Maxwell. In 1890 the monument was one of the first to be taken into state care, after Maxwell offered it into guardianship. It is notable, and 'puzzling', that Pitt Rivers chose to schedule the Wren's Egg and not the nearby Torhouse Stone Circle.

Originally built as a house, incorporating a doctor's surgery, coach house and stables; it is now used as a pub. The building has been designated as a Grade II* listed building since 1976. History The structure was built in 1905/6 to the plans of the architect Richard Barry Parker of Parker & Unwin, in the style of C. F. A. Voysey. It was constructed for Mr Corbett and Dr Gordon Henry, the latter a local doctor who had previously resided at Blair Lodge. Most of the original interior features are intact, as described in the green plaque situated next to the main entrance, which was placed by the Minehead Conservation Society. The property currently has 12 en suite bedrooms, including a bridal suite with a four-poster bed, available for bed and breakfast styled accommodation. It also has its own restaurant. The pub is listed on the local branch's website of the Campaign for Real Ale, and is included in a recent edition of the Good Beer Guide. It holds two beer festivals each year. Architecture It has been described as \\"the most interesting Arts and Crafts house in the region\\". The building consists of painted roughcast over brick or rubble stone. It has a plain tile roof incorporating a brick stack to the centre of front slope, a ridge stack to the rear left wing and a gable-end stack to the right wing. It is built in a U-shaped plan in the Arts and Crafts style. It has two storeys; with a two-window range. The steeply-pitched roof has deep overhanging eaves, which project at the sides and centre, where it forms a porch over a large stepped semicircular-arched entrance. The half dormer between the centre and left projection has six light leaded casement windows. To the right there is a roofed archway, in which there is a dormer window with hip roof and roof cheeks, connecting to the otherwise separate right wing. In the archway is a pair of tall cast-iron gates. Most other windows are wood-mullioned and transomed with leaded panes; to the far left is a two-storey convex curved window reaching up to the eaves. To the right of it is a semi-elliptical recess, in which a low three-sided plinth to the left supports similar, but has smaller windows with a seat to the right. The left return has a weather boarded gable to the right over two tall windows similar to that at the front. The rear has two projecting gables from the left wing all in keeping with the rest of the design, except for a flat-roofed extension to the rear of the main building. The windows to the rear wings reflect the general style. The interior of the building is complete and is a fine example of Parker's work, which includes stairs to the rear centre, now cased in, with stick balusters, some wide and fretted, leading to a curved landing with similar balusters. The dining room to the left is open to the rafters, with a glazed balcony from the stairs, a large recess containing an open fire with a cast-iron grate and elaborate cupboards with ornamental copper hinges over the lintel. To the rear are steps up to a smaller room with curved planked doors. Mullions, etc, are carved in the Art Nouveau style. To the first floor are planked doors with small windows.

To the north and east, it is bounded by the Northern District of Jackson County, to the east and south by the Eastern District, to the south by Buffalo-Union District in Putnam County, to the southwest by Union and Cologne Districts in Mason County, and to the north and west by the Ohio River. Across the Ohio River are Letart and Lebanon Townships, in Meigs County, Ohio.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Cottageville Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1989).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Elmwood Quadrangle (ed. 1958, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Kenna Quadrangle (eds. 1906, 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Mount Alto Quadrangle (ed. 1994).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Ravenswood Quadrangle (eds.

Sept. 1908). =Streams= The principal streams in the Western District are Mill Creek, which with its numerous tributaries drains the central and southern portions of the county, and Sandy Creek, the lower course of which runs along the boundary between the Western and Northern Districts. The upper waters of Mill Creek arise in western Roane County, and the main course of the creek is formed in the Eastern District, several miles above Ripley. Mill Creek enters the Western District as it leaves Ripley, and meanders westward through a broad valley, turning northwest below Angerona, and continuing to Ripley Landing, where it abruptly turns southwest just short of the Ohio River, and continues across the floodplain for a mile before joining the river at Millwood. Mill Creek's main tributaries in the Western District include Sycamore Creek, which forks several times in the hills north of Ripley; Parchment Creek, which flows northward out of the southern part of the district; Cow Run, with its upper waters in eastern Mason County, flowing northeast into Mill Creek between Angerona and Cottageville; and Lick Run, which drains the hills east of Ripley Landing. The upper course of Sandy Creek is largely within the Northern District, although its upper waters also extend into western Roane County. The creek enters the Western District at The Y, and winds northwest through the hills before emptying into the Ohio at Ravenswood. The lower course of Sandy Creek, between The Y and Ravenswood, is in the Western District, while Ravenswood and the mouth of the creek are in the Northern District. Sandy Creek's main tributary in the Western District is the Crooked Fork, which drains the hills between Ripley and Ravenswood. Other important streams in the district include Little Mill Creek, which flows northeastward out of Mason County, then turns north above Millwood and enters the Ohio below the mouth of Big Mill Creek; and the headwaters of Thirteenmile Creek, which flows out of the hills around Rockcastle, then enters Mason County, where it winds through the hills until emptying into the Kanawha River at Leon. =Communities= There are no incorporated towns in the Western District, but there are several unincorporated villages, of which the largest are Cottageville and Evans. Angerona, Cottageville, Ripley Landing, and Millwood all lie on the waters of Mill Creek, while Evans is on Isaacs Run, a small tributary of Mill Creek above Angerona. Other communities in the Western District include Pleasant View, along the Ohio River in the northern part of the district; Flatwoods and Hemlock, on the Crooked Fork of Sandy Creek; Sidneyville and Pleasant Hill, on the Left Fork of Sycamore Run; Danstown, Mount Moriah, Parchment Valley, and Given on Parchment Creek and its tributaries. The village of Mount Alto is in the westernmost part of the county; Rockcastle is located on Thirteenmile Creek, in the southwestern part of the district; and Foster Chapel is in the hills north of Rockcastle and Given. A small portion of Ripley is within the boundaries of the Western District, although the main portion of the town is in the Eastern District. Similarly, Silverton, on Sandy Creek, lies on the boundary between the Northern and Western Districts, while Fairplain, on the Charleston Road south of Ripley, is on the boundary between the Eastern and Western Districts. =Roads= The main north-south routes through the district include West Virginia Route 2, County Road 21, and Interstate 77. Route 2 runs from Point Pleasant to Ravenswood; it enters Jackson County near Mount Alto, and follows the course of the Ohio River through the district, passing through Mount Alto, Millwood, Ripley Landing, and Pleasant View. County Road 21 forms most of the eastern boundary of the district, running between Charleston and Parkersburg, and passing through Fairplain, Ripley, and The Y. South of Ripley, it is known locally as the Charleston Road, while north of Ripley it becomes the Parkersburg Road. Interstate 77 also travels between Charleston and Parkersburg, but its course is further to the west; there are exits at Fairplain, Ripley, and Silverton. Important east-west routes include U.S. Route 33, and West Virginia Routes 62, 87, and 331. Route 33 crosses the Ohio River at Ravenswood, and forms the northern boundary of the district to Silverton; the district line then continues from Silverton to The Y along Old West Virginia 56, meeting the Parkersburg Road at The Y, south of Sandyville. Route 62 runs along Mill Creek between Ripley and Ripley Landing, then follows the Ohio River past Millwood, and runs into the hills as far as Mount Alto, where it turns west and enters Mason County, continuing along the river to Point Pleasant. Route 331 runs between Mount Alto and Cottageville. Route 87 passes through Evans on its course from Chestnut and Baden in eastern Mason County to Route 62, west of Ripley. History Until 1831, all of the territory that would become Jackson County was part of Mason, Kanawha, and Wood counties. All of the Eastern District was part of Mason County.Michael F. Doran, Atlas of County Boundary Changes in Virginia, 1634‚Äì1895, Iberian Publishing Company, Athens, Georgia (c. 1987). After West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, the counties were divided into civil townships, which were converted into magisterial districts in 1872. Jackson County was divided into five magisterial districts: Grant, Ravenswood, Ripley, Union, and Washington. The only major change to occur in the district boundaries prior to the 1990s occurred in 1866, when a trapezoidal section of Union District in Mason County, including the village of Rockcastle and the headwaters of Thirteenmile Creek, was transferred to Jackson County, and attached to Ripley District. Otherwise, the names and boundaries of the historic districts remained largely unchanged for over a hundred and twenty years. In the 1990s, Jackson County was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. All of Union District was combined with the northwestern portion of Ripley District, and the southwestern corner of Ravenswood District, to form the Eastern Magisterial District. The western boundaries of the new district follow the lines of Union and Ripley Districts, but new boundaries were drawn separating the Eastern District from its neighbors in Jackson County. The boundary with the Northern District follows U.S. Route 35 and Old West Virginia 56 from the Ohio River to The Y, then runs south along the Parkersburg Road until it meets the original southern boundary of Ravenswood District. From there, the Eastern District continues eastward to the original boundary of Washington District, where it turns south until it reaches Mill Creek. At Mill Creek, the boundary runs westward along the creek, encircles the town of Ripley, nearly all of which is in the Eastern District, then runs south along the Charleston Road, Pleasant Valley Road, and Jim Ridge Road to the county line. Because redistricting proved confusing with county records, the West Virginia Legislature provided for the original magisterial districts to continue in the form of tax districts, which continued to serve administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials.W. Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. The current magisterial districts are used for those functions requiring equal representation between the residents of the various district, and as such are currently the minor civil division of record for the United States Census Bureau.

It was part of a broader series of expansion campaigns done under Menelik II, Negus of Shewa, referred to by some historians as the Agar Maqnat. The battle of Azule was important as it represents the crushing of a large Arsi army by one under Menelik; it also demonstrates the dynamic of gun-wielding Shewans fighting Spear-wielding Oromos that many historians like to stress when discussing Menelik's expansions; it also retains symbolic and historic importance in the politics and identities of many. Background A Katama built in the Boroma Country, which gives reference for how Darghe's defenses at Azule may have looked Ras Darge Sahle Selassie arrived in Arsi-country with the Negus Menelik II's army. Though Menelik II eventually left Arsi-country, Darghe stayed and established a Katama (roughly: garrison / camp) at Azule. The Katama had 3 layers, each fortified by a wall. Battle Ras Darge Sahle Selassie, through the use of informants, knew of the Arsi plan to attack his Katama on September 6 1886. Therefore, he organized his gunmen along the second wall of his Katama. Darghe planned for his gunmen to hold fire until the Arsi had successfully entered the first layer of his Katama. This way, they would be trapped when the order was given to start gunfire. When the Arsi Oromo attacked, Darghe's gunmen, either scared or triggerhappy, opened fire before Darghe's order. The result was still an overwhelming Shewan success, but many sources record Darghe punishing his commanders, some of whom were his sons. In the months following this victory, Darge subdued the peoples of Arsi-land, but did not move to annex those Arsi living in the southern Bale lands.

In 1332, Brocardus wrote medieval manuscript \\"Directorium ad passagium fasiendum\\". His treatise was fueled by his dismay at the way Catholics were treated in the Balkans in the Orthodox states in the conditions that followed the fall of the Latin Empire. In the manuscript - which was written for Philip VI - Burcard calls for a Catholic crusade against the Slavic Orthodox countries. In particular, he mentions how the Albanians and Latins suffered under the \\"very hard servitude of the most hateful and abominable lordships of the Slavs\\". He also describes an ethnic and religious persecution of Catholic Albanians. The manuscript is the first reference to the existing of written Albanian and one of the early references to the Albanian language itself.

Lipman was born and brought up in England but chose to play for Malta at international level. Club career Lipman joined Coventry City as a 10-year-old and was playing in their first team by the time she was 14 years old. After moving to Yorkshire to attend Leeds Beckett University, Lipman represented Leeds City Vixens and Leeds United in the FA Women's Premier League. In July 2013 Lipman transferred to Manchester City. When Sheikh Mansour-backed Manchester City successfully bid for an FA WSL franchise in 2014, they handed Lipman a professional contract. Lipman won a contract extension for Manchester City's 2015 season, but the club's purchase of England full-backs Lucy Bronze and Demi Stokes reduced her opportunities to play. In February 2016 she joined Sheffield FC, who had just been promoted into WSL 2. In 2017 Lipman accepted an offer to play in Italy, with AGSM Verona. She featured in 21 of 22 league fixtures as the club secured a mid- table finish in Serie A. That prompted Roma to sign Lipman for their newly- formed women's team. After playing in 17 of Roma's 22 2018‚Äì19 Serie A games, contributing one goal, Lipman signed for another Italian club Florentia San Gimignano in July 2019. In July 2020 Lipman and her Maltese team mate Rachel Cuschieri signed for ambitious Lazio, who had narrowly missed promotion to Serie A the previous season. International career As well as England, Lipman was also eligible for the national teams of Scotland and Malta due to her grandparents. In May 2019 Lipman received a call-up to Malta's squad for a friendly match against Bolton Wanderers. She started Malta's 2‚Äì1 win at the Malta Football Association training grounds in Ta' Qali. On 4 October 2019 Lipman won her first official cap for Malta, in a home UEFA Women's Euro 2021 qualifying Group B fixture against Italy. Although Lipman's handball conceded an injury time penalty kick, converted by Cristiana Girelli, Malta emerged with credit from their 2‚Äì0 defeat. Lipman retained her place in the team for the next qualifier, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Israel.

Briggens House is a Grade II listed 18th century house and parklands near the village of Roydon, Essex, England. It has a number of features from the garden designer Charles Bridgeman from 1720. There are also some remains of the pleasure gardens developed by Lord Hunsden in 1908.  1700-1800  The house was first built and owned by Sir Thomas Foster whose descendant sold it to the Crowley family. Robert Chester, a director of the South Sea Company bought it in 1706 who made many substantial changes to the house and grounds, commissioning Charles Bridgeman to work on the gardens.  1940s: Special Operations Executive (Polish Section)  The house was owned by the 4th Baron Aldenham Walter Gibbs the Deputy Chairman of Westminster Bank. From 1941, Briggens House was used by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) as the main forgery operation to support their secret agents List of SOE agents and undercover special forces. When the house was requisitioned by the War Office the family was allowed to stay in residence which was very rare in cases such as this. = STS 38 Polish Training Section = The house was requisitioned to train elite fighting troops known as the Cichociemni, (Silent and Unseen) selected from the Polish Home Army that had escaped to Britain. They trained in hand to hand combat, sabotage, and subversive activities, etc. Those who passed awaited their turn to be dropped back into Nazi occupied Poland wearing civilian clothing, using fake identities and forged papers. They then faced a long flight in potentially hazardous weather conditions over well defended enemy held territory, a parachute drop at night and locating a reception committee on the ground before leading and organising resistance groups against a vicious and brutal enemy. Eventually, the whole training unit was transferred to STS 43 Audley End when Station XIV - False Document Section expanded and took over the whole of Briggens House. = SOE ‚Äì Station XIV - False Document Section = This section was begun by three Polish forgers in the cellar of Briggens House and quickly expanded when SOE obtained Britain‚Äôs most experienced printers, engravers and artists. This unique group was recruited and led by Commanding Officer Captain Morton Grainger Bisset a highly specialised printer, to provide a multitude of forged documents to enable agents with false identities to operate in occupied countries without being captured.. The passports, identity cards, wok permits, ration books, driving licences needed to be perfect to fool the Nazi SS and police at border and random check points. Any small discrepancy could lead to instant arrest, interrogation, torture and ultimately a firing squad. Documents were provided for agents such as Violette Szabo, and F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas the 'White Rabbit'. The team included Scotland Yard handwriting and other printing experts to run an almost 'same day delivery service' for documents, being able to copy documents and return them before they have been identified as missing. The Nazis were aware of their work. A study found that the forgers‚Äô versions of ration cards were so good they could not easily be detected. The team also produced 43million zloty that were dropped into occupied Poland, in 1944 to disrupt the economy. By War‚Äôs end, Briggens had produced 275,000 forged documents.  Current  In 1979 the house was converted into an hotel and conference centre with a separate golf club occupying the parkland. The hotel closed its doors In 2006. In 2010 it reopened as a wedding venue but this did not have planning permission and was immediately closed down. As of November 2019 the house remains closed to the public but the golf course is still in place.

It is notable for being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles as of date. Taking place in a fantasy world where the evil magician known as Jagula sealed the goddess Lucia in the netherworld, players assume the role of Axis and Bilious in an effort to defeat both Jagula and the unleashed evil spirits from the netherworld. As of 2019, the rights to the game are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other IPs from the defunct studio.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Ghox is an action game reminiscent of Devilish in which the players assume control of Axis (P1) and Bilious (P2), two men from the Eastern Country summoned by King Gitane of the Akuria empire, from a top-down perspective where the main objective on each stage is to break as many bricks and obstacles as possible from the playfield with a single ball by using the walls and/or the paddle to ricochet the ball back to eliminate them, while a boss at the end of every seventh stage must be fought before progressing any further in an effort to overthrow the evil magician Jagula from conquering the world along with his legion of unleashed evil spirits from the netherworld, in addition of rescuing the goddess Lucia from her captivity. Failing in making the ball rebound from the paddle will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. A unique gameplay feature is the ability to launch two balls instead of one at the start of each stage. Another unique gameplay feature is the ability to activate a bomb item that spawns multiple balls from a single ball, however only one bomb item is given to the players with every single live. Scattered on the playfield of every stage are treasure chests containing other useful items such as fairies, additional bomb stocks, money and heart- shaped 1UP icons. Colored crystal orbs (red, blue, green, yellow and purple) are also dropped from opening the treasure chests and by collecting five of the same color grants power-ups for the player characters. These power-ups are kept even after losing a live. After the first area is completed, players are given two areas to select as the next one before reaching the fifth area. Depending on the actions taken during gameplay by the players, two possible outcomes can occur during the final boss sequence; If Jagula is defeated during this battle but Lucia is not rescued, it will automatically trigger the bad ending, forcing the players to restart the game from the beginning in order to achieve the good ending by fulfilling certain conditions.  Development and release  According to former Toaplan designer Junya Inoue, Ghox was initially envisioned to be a vertically scrolling game but due to hardware issues, the project was retooled into a single-screen game instead. (Translation by Gamengai. ). The game was released in arcades worldwide on November 1991. The soundtrack was composed by Miyoko Takaoka, although she is not credited as such in the game. On 30 May 2018, an album containing music from the title, as well as Rally Bike and Teki Paki was published exclusively in Japan by City Connection under their Clarice Disk label.  Reception and legacy  British and Spanish gaming magazines The One for Amiga Games and Microman√≠a gave an overall positive outlook to the game. John Cook of Sinclair User rated the game with a 85% score. In the April 1992 issue of Japanese publication Micom BASIC Magazine, the game was ranked on the number thirty spot in popularity. Retro Gamer regarded it as a graphically superior clone of Breakout. In more recent years, the rights to Ghox and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxtons Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

It is typically instructional or exploratory rather than descriptive, and it engages specifically with the theoretical ideas which underlie and shape typical responses to religion. Theological fiction, as a concept, is used by both theists and atheists, such as in fictional pantheons and cultures in theological fantasy literature. Theological and religious fiction The subject matter of theological novels often overlaps with philosophical novels, particularly when it deals with issues from natural theology (also called philosophy of religion). For example, Roger Olsen notes that the Problem of evil is a feature of some significant theological fiction. Theological fiction also overlaps with religious fiction or Christian novels (also called inspirational fiction), especially when dealing with complex ideas such as redemption, salvation and predestination, which have a direct bearing on attitudes towards religious practices. Some authors try to distinguish a theological novel as one which denotes a more idea driven plot, rather than a novel which is about people who happen to be interacting with religion, but the distinction often proves difficult to sustain when ideas and actions are closely interwoven, each influencing the other. Theological short stories Examples of the genre (also called novellae) include: *Candide (1759) by Voltaire *Book of Judith (1st Century BC) by Anonymus *\\"Hell Is the Absence of God\\" (2001) by Ted Chiang Theological long fiction Examples of theological long fiction include: *Philosophus Autodidactus (originally Hayy ibn Yaqdhan) (12th century) by Ibn Tufail *Theologus Autodidactus (originally The Treatise of KƒÅmil on the Prophet's Biography) (1268) by Ibn al-Nafis *Divine Comedy (1320) by Dante Alighieri *The Pilgrim's Progress (1678) by John Bunyan *The Brothers Karamazov (1880) by Fyodor Dostoevsky *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) by C.

From left to right it shows Gregory the Great, Saint Jerome, Saint Ambrose and Augustine of Hippo. The work was first recorded in Santi Ambrogio e Carlo al Corso, the national church of the Lombards in Rome, where it was mentioned for the first time by Filippo Titi during the second half of the 17th century, though he misattributed it to Pordenone or Titian Filippo Titi, Studio di pittura, scultura, et Architettura nelle Chiese di Roma, Roma 1674, p. 404. It is not known when it was moved to that church, which was built from 1612 onwards Pier Virgilio Begni Redona, Alessandro Bonvicino ‚Äì Il Moretto da Brescia, Editrice La Scuola, Brescia 1988, p.400 \\\\- in 1943 Gy√∂rgy Gombosi theorised that it had been given to the church by the Ottoboni family, though he did not cite his sources for that hypothesisGy√∂rgy Gombosi, Moretto da Brescia, Basel 1943, p.58 However, the Ottoboni family was Venetian in origin and had no known contact with Moretto - the only one of them ever in Brescia was Pietro Ottoboni between 1654 and 1664, long after the painter's death. Gombosi probably therefore interpreted ambiguous sources referring to the Ottoboni owning other Moretto works such as Madonna of Mount Carmel and the Madonna of Mercy Standard. The work is mentioned in documents several times between Titi and 1835, when Passavant records that it had been sold in 1796 to the Roman art dealer Doppieri for 300 scudi and subsequently to Joseph Fesch, uncle of Napoleon I, for 3000 or 4000 scudiJohann David Passavant, Tour of a German Artist in England, London 1835, page 221. It was taken to Paris but returned to Rome in 1845 to be auctioned with the rest of the Fesch collection. At that auction it was acquired by its present owner for around 70,000 lire. The sale became known throughout Italy and led Federico Odorici to comment that the injustice towards Moretto that had consumed Italy, where the work had been sold for only 300 scudi, had been compensated for by foreigners who had bought it for so great a sum.

Taira has been recognized as a Living National Treasure since 2000.  Biography  Taira was born on February 14, 1921 in Kijoka, Ogimi, Okinawa. As a child, she learned to weave cotton and kijoka-bashofu from her mother. In 1944, Taira worked at a spinning mill in Kurashiki, Okayama. At the encouragement of the mill's owner, Soichiro Ohara, she began to study under Kichinosuke Tonomura, the head of a folk art museum. During this time she was heavily influenced by the mingei movement. When she returned to Okinawa in 1946 she found that many of the banana trees had been cut down or died, and was determined to revitalize both the trees and the art of kijoka-bashofu that uses them. After World War II, there was less demand for kimono made from kijoka-bashofu than before the war. Taira made table runners and cushions from coarse fibers, but what criticized for bringing down the quality associated with kijoka-bashofu. After receiving that criticism, she worked more frequently with the finer fibers. She also had a few exhibits of her work during this period. Taira opened a bashofu textile studio in 1963 and hired some local weavers so that she could centralize and increase production. Kijoka-bashofu was named an Important Intangible Cultural Property in 1974. The Kijoka Basho-fu Industrial Cooperative Association was established in 1984, and soon after that in 1986, the Ogimi Village Bashofu Hall opened and began offering training. In 2000, Taira was recognized as a Living National Treasure. In 1992 and 2002 she was awarded an Order of the Precious Crown.

First described in 2007 from East Himalayan forests at altitudes of in the region of Mechuka of north-central Arunachal Pradesh in India, its taxonomic status and position is not fully resolved. it was originally described as P. nigra but has been replaced by mechukaensis because it was a primary homonym of P. nigra Wang 1981. Taxonomy and appearance In 2016, it was proposed that mechukaensis is the same species as the taxon nigra, which was described in 1981 from northwestern Yunnan in China and traditionally has been considered a part of the Indian or red giant flying squirrel. If confirmed and recognized as a distinct species, this means that the correct scientific name for the Mechuka giant flying squirrel is Petaurista nigra. In a genetic study published in 2006, nigra (initially misidentified as yunanensis) was found to be closely related to albiventer. The position of albiventer is itself disputed; although traditionally considered a subspecies of the red giant flying squirrel, strong evidence points to it being a separate species, which has been followed by several recent authorities. Based on genetic evidence, nigra can be considered a subspecies of P. albiventer or a closely related separate species. In 2017, a new subspecies muzongensis that is closely associated with nigra was described from southeastern Xizang, China, quite near to the border with Arunachal Pradesh, India. These two and mechukaensis have ochraceous‚Äìbuff or orange‚Äìbuff underparts, becoming deep rufous‚Äìchestnut towards the edge of the patagium. The head and upperparts are dark chestnut, darker towards the upper back and head, and the tail is blackish. The taxon nigra can be distinguished by the scattered creamy‚Äìwhite guard hairs on its mid to lower back (largely absent from head and shoulder region), resulting in this region having an overall dark but grizzled appearance unlike muzongensis and mechukaensis. The taxa muzongensis and mechukaensis, which were described close to each other but on separate sides of the China‚ÄìIndia border, are extremely similar (if not identical). Based on a small number of specimens, nigra, muzongensis and mechukaensis are relatively large, with measurements in the upper range of that reported for the red giant flying squirrel.

The station was last owned by Pine Tree Media, Inc. History =Early years= R. G. LeTourneau, owner of the Le Tourneau Technical Institute, filed for a construction permit for a new radio station in Longview on June 27, 1947. Though he initially specified 960 kHz, he changed the application to 1280 in order to avoid a hearing. The Federal Communications Commission granted the application on May 19, 1948. Originally assigned the call letters KFRN, they were changed to KLTI before signing on October 27, 1948. LeTourneau, who had previously built America's first all- steel radio studio at a station in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, constructed KLTI's studios using then-new concrete techniques. KLTI was built alongside an FM outlet, KLTI-FM 105.9; the FM license was cancelled at LeTourneau's request in 1955. In 1959, LeTourneau sold KLTI to the Bridge and Mahone families, doing business as Radio Longview, Inc.; the new ownership also ran KMHT at Marshall. The $100,500 purchase‚Äîinadvertently reported as $10,500 due to a wire service error‚Äîclosed in September The new owners renamed the station to KLUE and also expressed their desire to seek authorization for nighttime broadcasts and return to the FM dial. They also attempted to follow through on their promises of improved AM facilities, but their bid to increase power to 5,000 watts was dismissed in 1962. They did, however, return to the FM dial in early March 1963 when KLUE-FM 105.7 made its debut. The new station carried \\"mood music\\" as well as the Mutual Broadcasting System and Texas State Network newscasts already airing on AM. Between 1963 and 1964, the station remodeled and expanded its studio facility. =Beatles Bonfire= A sequence of events in August 1966 would prove the most memorable in station history. Early in the month, the station announced that it would no longer play The Beatles, and its program director expressed hope that \\"the word beetle may soon again simply refer to the insect in this country\\". The controversy started with a statement by John Lennon that the group's popularity was eclipsing that of Jesus Christ. Thousands of Beatles records were gathered by the station for a Beatles Bonfire to be held the night of August 12, while the station needed extra receptionists to answer the telephone due to the number of calls received. (Sister station KMHT in Marshall also banned the Beatles, as did a number of other radio stations in the state.) KLUE's bonfire attracted 1,000 spectators and another 2,000 who drove past in their cars. (Another report estimated the crowd at 7,500.) News director Phil Ransom said that claims made by Lennon in A Spaniard in the Works included \\"anti-Christian comments that would make the godless Russian leaders blush\\". The next day, KLUE's transmitter tower was struck by lightning. Equipment was extensively damaged, and news director Phil Ransom was knocked unconscious and transported to the hospital; the station was able to return to the air the next day. =After the bonfire= In December 1974, KLUE moved again into a new studio building at the same Signal Hill site. The station's reporting on corruption in Gregg County, led by Glen Ivey, earned it a 1979 award from the Texas State Network and other honors from the Texas Association of Broadcasters and United Press International. After more than 20 years, H.A. Bridge announced the sale of KLUE to McLarty Communications of Little Rock, Arkansas in 1980. Among the programs carried by the station in the early years of McLarty ownership was the 1982 The Beatles at the Beeb special consisting of BBC studio sessions unheard until that point in the United States. Pine Tree Media of Texarkana, Texas, the final owners of the 1280 frequency, acquired KLUE from McLarty in 1982; the station continued with its adult contemporary format until flipping to country in June 1984. =KAAW, KLGV, KDOX and KARW= In October 1986, KLUE became KAAW. The station promoted itself as \\"Pure Gold AM 1280\\", returning to an oldies format. In 1988, Ken Tuck bought Pine Tree, and changes followed for KAAW, starting with a change in call letters to KLGV on April 27, 1988. Like KAAW, KLGV aired an oldies format. Phoenix Broadcasting Consultants programmed the station with its \\"Solid Gold\\" oldies format. After filing for bankruptcy in February 1991, the station changed formats again to urban in May. It continued to go by KLGV locally even though its call letters had changed to KDOX on March 11. The format remained gospel after changing call letters one last time to KARW on June 30, 1992. =Silence and license renewal denied= On August 13, 1994, KARW was burglarized and forced off the air. The station would briefly return to the air at the end of September, but after a few weeks, mechanical problems led to the station going silent again. That silence would be made permanent when, on November 18, Southwestern Electric Power Company disconnected KARW's electricity for nonpayment. The silence compounded more serious problems that had already emerged: in 1993, the FCC had designated KARW's license renewal for hearing. The hearing designation order centered around several issues. One of them was a series of unauthorized transfers of control. After Ken Tuck died on May 27, 1990, American Plastics Products, Inc. acquired the promissory note that had been made by Tuck to pay previous owners Herbert Wren and Earl Jones for the radio station. American Plastics then proceeded to foreclose on the note and acquire Pine Tree without applying to the FCC for the necessary consent to the transfer of control. Wren and Jones then foreclosed on the American Plastics note, causing a second transfer of control that was not approved by the FCC, and Praise Media, Inc. then bought personal property of KARW and took over operations in March 1992, leading to a third change in operator, all without the approval of the commission. Even though Tuck was dead, the renewal application in August 1990 was filed in the name of Pine Tree, not American Plastics. In March 1995, the scope of the proceeding was expanded to include the silence of KARW. In 1992, the FCC sent several letters to Pine Tree, requesting additional information and notifying the licensee of deficiencies in the license renewal. However, none of the letters ever elicited a response. As a result of the misrepresentations, silence, and false statements made by Praise Media manager Janet Washington as to the reasons for the incarceration of her husband, FCC administrative law judge John M. Frysiak denied KARW's renewal in August 1995.

In 1967 the book was published by Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren as the twelfth book in the photo novel series Children's Everywhere. Authors like Astrid Lindgren, Leah Goldberg, Eug√©nie S√∂derberg, Elly Jannes and Cordelia Edvardson wrote for the same series.  Plot  Gennet is seven years old and lives in Ethiopia. Her name comes from the Amharic and means paradise. One day, Gennet's little brother Mamo gets bitten by a poisonous snake. Now it's up to Gennet to get help. On her way to the doctor she sees monkeys, vultures and flamingos. When she has to cross a deep river, she is helped by a shepherd boy. Finally she arrives at the doctor's house. Immediately, the doctor drives with his jeep to Gennet's brother to help him. Gennet's brother is cured. As a reward, Gennet gets a yellow dress and a necklace at the market.  Overview  Gennet Lives in Ethiopia is the twelfth out of 15 books from the series Children's Everywhere. While Anna Riwkin-Brick made the photos for the book, the Swedish writer Vera Forsberg wrote the text. Vera Forsberg also wrote the text to another book of the series: Salima Lives in Kashmir. Gennet Lives in Ethiopia has been translated into many languages, including Hebrew, English, Danish and German. In Israel, the series Children of our Earth, which also includes Gennet Lives in Ethiopia, was a great success, thanks to the translations of the poet Leah Goldberg. In 2014, Israeli director Dvorit Shargal shot a 50-minute documentary titled Where is Elle Kari and what happened to Noriko-san?, which deals with some of the books from the series Children's Everywhere. After the film was released, nine stories of the Children's Everywhere series were being reissued in Israel, including Gennet Lives in Ethiopia.

It was the largest mass mailing in American history. The decision to create the pamphlet was made by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.  Contents  The pamphlet contains simple information about AIDS and HIV, and factual descriptions of how it is transmitted through sexual contact and drug use. It advocates for abstinence, monogamy, condom use, and sex education for young people. It encourages the reader not to fear day-to-day contact with people with AIDS, but to instead offer them love and support.  Distribution  Approximately 126 million copies of Understanding AIDS were distributed. Their printing and mailing cost about 20 cents per copy. One million advance copies of the brochure were sent to doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, hospitals, and public health officials to prepare them for questions about AIDS from the public. The 1988 distribution of Understanding AIDS was of an English-language version of the brochure, with a Spanish version distributed in Puerto Rico. Only later would the brochure be translated into other languages or distributed electronically.  Response  A national survey found that at least 60 percent of people interviewed following the mailing remembered receiving Understanding AIDS. Of these, 80 percent read at least some of the pamphlet, and 40 to 50 percent reported discussing it with family or friends. Call centers for AIDS-related questions, which were created or expanded in advance of the mailer, were flooded with calls. As a result of preparatory research on how to make the pamphlet understandable to a wide audience, the authors avoided labels for people like \\"gay\\" or \\"drug addicts,\\" and instead described behaviors like anal sex or needle sharing. This type of explicit description, pioneered by Understanding AIDS, would later become standard in sex education. The frank descriptions of human sexuality in the pamphlet upset some American religious conservatives. Phyllis Schlafly remarked that the pamphlet looks \\"like it was edited by the Gay Task Force\\" because of its avoidance of the subject of homosexuality. Jerry Falwell expressed skepticism of the pamphlet, saying a simple message of \\"no sex outside of marriage would have saved taxpayers' money.\\" Surgeon General Koop was himself an Evangelical Christian and a friend of Falwell's who believed the pamphlet was consistent with his religious beliefs on sexual morality.

Moreover, bone is responsible for blood cell production in a humans body. The mechanical properties of bone greatly influence the functionality of bone. For instance, deterioration in bone ductility due to diseases such as osteoporosis can adversely affect individuals‚Äô life. Bone ductility can show how much energy bone absorbs before fracture. In bone, the origin ductility is at the nanoscale. The nano interfaces in Bone are the interface between individual collagen fibrils. The interface is filled with non-collagenous proteins, mainly osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC). The osteopontin and osteocalcin form a sandwich structure with HAP minerals at nano-scale. The nano Interfaces are less than 2 ‚Äì 3 % of bone content by weight, while they add more than 30% of the fracture toughness .  Deformation mechanisms in nano interfaces  The current knowledge of the structure and deformation mechanisms in nano-interfaces is limited. For the first time, a study unravel the complex synergic deformation mechanism in the nano-interfaces in bone. A synergistic deformation mechanism of the proteins through strong anchoring and formation of dynamic binding sites on mineral nano-platelets were seen. The nano-interface can sustain a ductility approaching 5000% and outstanding specific energy to failure that is several times larger than the most known tough natural materials such as spider silk.

The premiere of the show ran for at least 97 performances and was revived several times over the following decade. Music was supplied by a number of Australian stage personalities including Vince Courtney, Herbert De Pinna and James Kendis. The play relied heavily on comic stereotypes of the time, including a Chinese cook, bumbling Jewish clowns, fierce Aboriginal tribes-persons, and a drunken Australian lout ‚Äì all contending with wattle blossom, the fairy princess in the original story. A Melbourne National Gallery student P. Cohen was enlisted to paint the sets with Australian flowers. namely wattle and waratah, on costumes also. The story opens with a bushfire in which all the bush creatures are bought out into the open. Then it deals with the wanderings of Princess Wattle Blossom, who falls into the hands of the Bush Gnomes, a proud race with a terrible way of doing things. The Lord High Gnome decrees that the Princess shall be turned into a bunyip, and this transformation takes place on the stage. The fairy princess is then rescued by the principal boy from the race of bush gnomes.

Rowe grew up in Oregon where she started playing the flute as a child. She earned a music degree and has held several titled positions with professional orchestras. In 2004, she won a blind audition against 250 other applicants to become the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 2018, she filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the Boston Symphony Orchestra alleging she was paid less on account of her gender. The case was settled out of court in February 2019. Early life and education Rowe was born in 1974 and grew up in Eugene, Oregon. Her parents were both college professors with an interest in music. She started studying the flute when she was 7 years old. Rowe earned a degree in music from the University of Southern California. She was also a fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center. Career In 1998, when Rowe was 23 years old, she was hired as the principal flutist of the Fort Wayne Philharmonic Orchestra. This was followed by positions with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C. Rowe also played with the New World Symphony and is on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music. In 2004, at age 29, Rowe won a blind audition against 250 other flute players for the principal flute position with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), which is one of the \\"Big Five\\" famous American orchestras. Her husband also joined the BSO in 2006. As of 2018, Rowe had been a concerto soloist in 28 BSO concerts. She was also frequently used as a spokesperson in their publicity and marketing efforts. = Discrimination lawsuit = Rowe filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the Boston Symphony Orchestra in July 2018. Her lawsuit is believed to be the first gender discrimination suit filed under the Massachusetts Equal Pay Act, a law that went into effect in July 2018. The lawsuit prompted public discussion about gender biases in the classical music industry. The basis of the lawsuit was that Rowe was paid about $64,000 less than the male principal oboist she sat next to. Rowe claimed this was because of her gender, while the BSO claimed oboists were more expensive than flutists due to market forces. Rowe and the BSO entered mediation in December 2018, and the lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in February 2019.

In 1970 the book was published by Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren as the last book in the photo book series Children's Everywhere. Authors like Astrid Lindgren, Leah Goldberg, Eug√©nie S√∂derberg, Elly Jannes and Cordelia Edvardson wrote for the same series.  Plot  Salima lives on a houseboat in Srinagar, which is the largest city in Kashmir. Salmia's younger brother Nazir goes to school while Salima stays home to look after her younger sister. Nazirs classmates are almost all boys. Only one girl is in the class. Nazir wants his sister Salima to come to school as well. However, his teacher tells him that his father and grandfather have to decide this. Nazir wants to talk with his grandfather, but his grandfather just laughs. He thinks that is a strange idea to send a girl to school. Furthermore he mentions that there are many things that Salima has to learn from her mother at home. Now, Salima wants to prove to her grandfather that she is very smart and is able to go to school. She helps her mother wherever she can. When Salimas grandfather meets Nazir's teacher, the teacher tells the old man, that he should let his granddaughter come to school. Finally the grandfather agrees. Salima is happy. After some time she already is able to read, write and sum up. She reads the newspaper to her grandfather.  Overview  Salima Lives in Kashmir is the last out of 15 books from the series Children's Everywhere. In 1969, photographer Anna Riwkin-Brick traveled to Kashmir to take photos for the book. Later, Vera Forsberg wrote a text to the photos. Vera Forsberg also wrote the text to another book of the series: Gennet Lives in Ethiopia. Salima Lives in Kashmir has been translated into many languages, including English, Hebrew, Norwegian and German. In Israel, the series Children's Everywhere, which also includes Salima from Kashmir, was a great success, thanks to the translations of Leah Goldberg. In 2014, Israeli director Dvorit Shargal shot a 50-minute documentary titled Where is Elle Kari and what happened to Noriko-san?, which deals with some of the books from the series. After the release of the film nine stories of the Children's Everywhere series were reissued in Israel, including Salima Lives in Kashmir.  Reception  Vinayak Razdan praises the photos of Anna Riwkin-Brick. He says that the friendly smile of the children in the book, casts a spell over the viewer. It shows incredible beauty and innocence. Meena Khorana believes that the reader is able to empathize with the life of Salima. It is interesting to read about Salima's desire to break with tradition and to go to school as a girl.

The therapeutic vaccine works by activating immune system of the patient to fight towards infection. The difference in therapeutic vaccine and vaccine is that vaccines are administered to individuals as a precautionary measure to avoid the infection or disease while therapeutic vaccines are administered after the individual is already affected by the disease or infection. Therapeutic vaccine fights the existing infection in the body rather than immunizing the body for protection against future diseases and infections. The therapeutic vaccines are mostly against viral infections. The patients affected with chronic viral infections are administered with therapeutic vaccines, as their immune system is not able to produce enough efficient antibodies. Provenge, developed by Dendreon, was the first therapeutic vaccine approved by FDA in 2010. This therapeutic vaccine helped in treating prostate cancer where patients' own white blood cells (WBCs) were taken and treated with drug (vaccine) to train them to differentiate and fight cancer cells. Functionality The therapeutic vaccines are new form of vaccines that are mostly being used for viral infections and various type of cancers. The therapeutic vaccine helps immune system to recognize a foreign agent such as cancerous cells or a virus. The specific type of therapeutic vaccines includes antigen vaccines. In case of antigen vaccines, the body is introduced to a foreign agent to activate the immune system so that it recognizes the agent when later encountered. Types There are two types of therapeutic vaccines which are: =Autologous vaccines= Autologous means that 'derived from oneself' ‚Äì An autologous vaccine is a personalized vaccine which is made from an individual's own cells which could be either cancer cells or immune system cells. =Allogenic vaccines= Allo means 'other'. Allogenic are majorly cancer vaccines which are made from non-self cancer cells which are grown in a lab. How therapeutic vaccines are different from vaccines The concept of therapeutic vaccines is different. When a person hears the word vaccine, the thought of prevention against a certain disease comes into mind. However, therapeutic vaccines are method of treatment. Like any other vaccine, the immune system is regulated against a specific type of target. The main goal is to enhance the immune system activity. This type of vaccine can be employed for the treatment of various type of diseases and viral infections. Efforts are being made to develop vaccines against various fatal diseases such as HIV, cancer, dengue fever, cholera, Diphtheria, etc. Therapeutic vaccine against HIV HIV have no vaccine up till now, but therapeutic vaccine could be the breakthrough for HIV. Such vaccine would enhance affected patients immune system to fight the disease. Many researchers are trying to develop and test therapeutic HIV vaccines in order to slow the HIV progression to AIDS. People affected with HIV normally have HIV at undetectable level, which is detected by use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). If therapeutic vaccine for HIV worked out, it will save many lives. There are many clinical trails being conducted for HIV therapeutic vaccine. Many clinical trials for therapeutic HIV vaccine are conducted by AIDSinfo, summaries for trails are available at their website. Therapeutic vaccine against cancer Cancer is the major cause of deaths in the recent era. Cancer types and stages have enhanced with time and so has efforts to treat cancer. Currently, there are about 369 cancer vaccine studies ongoing all around the world. There are three cancer therapeutic vaccines which are approved by USA Food and Drug Administration, as following; Provenge is Sipuleucel-T, a dendritic cell based vaccine for prostate cancer.

Historical context  By the decrees of the Synod of Dort, the church services of the Remonstrants were prohibited. They united in 1619 at Antwerp, where the basis for a new church community was laid, under the name Remonstrant Reformed Brotherhood. Uytenbogaert and Episcopius, who had found a refuge in Rouen, and Grevinchoven, formerly a preacher of Rotterdam, now in Holstein, assumed the leadership of the Brotherhood while three exiled preachers secretly returned to their country to care for the congregations left there; for in spite of the unfavorable decree, there was still left a considerable number who would not hear the doctrine of absolute grace preached, and there were not wanting deposed preachers who dared to serve them. In 1621 Episcopius drew up a Confessio sive declaratio sententi√¶ pastorum qui Remonstrantes vocantur [Confession or Declaration of the Remonstrant Pastors], which found a large circulation in its Dutch translation. Episcopius was actually the leading theologian of the Remonstrants. Dr. Mark A. Ellis, states: \\"They intended it as a concise, easily understandable statement of their faith and a corrective to what they viewed as the misrepresentations published in the Acts of the Synod of Dort.\\"  The Confession of 1621  = Purpose = Concerning the purpose and the scope of the Confession Ellis, states: > \\"Many [Remonstrants] were hesitant, fearful of establishing the same type of > creedalism which had resulted in their persecution and banishment. The > Preface to the Confession, which the Remonstrants considered an integral > part of the document, emphasized its non-binding character. The society > eventually judged it more important to prove their orthodoxy to those who > wanted to assist them, to silence the misrepresentations of their > opposition, and most of all, to encourage and unite the now distressed and > scattered Remonstrants. They selected Episcopius and two others to write it, > but in the end, he did the work alone.\\" = The text = The confession was completed and approved in 1620. The Dutch edition was published in 1621, the Latin in 1622. The text itself is composed of one preface and 25 chapters, which deal successively with: * Chapter 1: The sacred scriptures * Chapters 2-6: God nature, deeds and providence mode * Chapters 7-10: Christ salvation deeds toward men * Chapters 11-16: Christian spiritual life aspects * Chapters 17-20: God's election mode, and eschatological considerations * Chapters 21-25: Church and christian ministry aspects  Theological views  = Theological legacy = Roger E. Olson notes that the Confession is substantially aligned with Jacobus Arminius views. Ellis adds that \\"the Confession does not reflect Arminius theology alone. It also represents those who were Arminian before Arminius (such as Wtenbogaert and older pastors), together with Episcopius‚Äü own creative impulses.\\" = Refutation of Socinian charge = In the confession, the Remonstrants gave a clear repudiation of Socinianism‚Äüs denials of the divinity of Christ and the trinity: > Therefore, the Son and the Holy Spirit, although both are divine with > respect to their hypostasis, manner, and order, are truly distinct from the > Father; yet they are truly partakers with the Father of the same deity or > divine essence and nature absolutely and commonly considered [...] = Affirmation of Total depravity = The remonstrants had denied Pelagianism in the original Five articles of Remonstrance of 1610, and repeated the same in the Confession, affirming again the total depravity of man: > Because Adam was the stock and root of the whole human race, he therefore > involved and implicated not only himself, but also all his posterity (as if > they were contained in his loins and went forth from him by natural > generation) in the same death and misery with himself, so that all men > without any discrimination, only our Lord Jesus Christ excepted, are by this > one sin of Adam deprived of that primeval happiness, and destitute of true > righteousness necessary for achieving eternal life, and consequently are now > born subject to that eternal death of which we spoke, and manifold miseries. > It was from this that the highest necessity and also advantage of divine > grace, prepared for us in Christ the Savior before the ages, clearly > appeared. For without it we could neither shake off the miserable yoke of > sin, nor do anything truly good in all religion, nor finally ever escape > eternal death or any true punishment of sin. Much less could we at any time > obtain eternal salvation without it or through ourselves. = Affirmation of Prevenient grace = The Remonstrants had previously denied Semipelagianism and reaffirmed in the Confession the prevenient grace of God: > ‚ÄúWe think therefore that the grace of God is the beginning, progress and > completion of all good, so that not even a regenerate man himself can, > without this preceding, or preventing, exciting, following and cooperating > grace, think, will, or finish any good thing to be saved, much lest resist > any attractions and temptations to evil.‚Äù They differed with their opponents not over the necessity of grace, but in their belief that a person can ‚Äúdespise and reject the grace of God and resist its operation\\". Roger Olson sees here and elsewhere in the Confession a depiction of the Prevenient grace, consistent with the one presented by Charles Wesley. = Affirmation of Conditional preservation of the Saints = In the Five articles of Remonstrance, the Remonstrants proposed that the perseverance of the saints, may be conditional upon the faith and obedience. Sometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the Remonstrants became persuaded of conditional preservation of the saints, and of the possibility of apostasy, which is that a true believer is capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever. They formalized their views in \\"The Opinion of the Remonstrants\\" (1618). In the Confession, the Remonstrants simply confirmed that opinion in several ways. For instance they held that: > Even if it is true that those who are adept in the habit of faith and > holiness can only with difficulty fall back to their former profaneness and > dissoluteness of life, yet we believe that it is entirely possible, if not > rarely done, that they fall back little by little and until they completely > lack their prior faith and charity. And having abandoned the way of > righteousness, they revert to their worldly impurity which they had truly > left, returning like pigs to wallowing in the mud and dogs to their vomit, > and are again entangled in lusts of the flesh which they had formerly, truly > fled. And thus totally and at length also they are finally torn from the > grace of God unless they seriously repent in time. = Rejection of Scholasticism = Ellis says : > We find in the Confession a corollary to the rejection of Reformed > scholasticism, the Remonstrant insistence that all true theology was > entirely practical and not speculative or theoretical. Whatever the modern > equivocations over the meaning of ‚Äúspeculative theology,‚Äù for Episcopius it > signified theology which was derived from reason rather than from Scripture > and served to satisfy theological curiosity rather than promote the worship > of God. [‚Ä¶] This emphasis on theology as a practical science became one of > the hallmarks of Remonstrant theology.  Revisions of 1940 and 2006  The Remonstrant confession of 1621 was revised and published in a succinct form in 1940, losing most of its original details. This revision was made as a testimony against the spiritual pretensions of National Socialism at the start of the German occupation of the Netherlands (1940-1945). Afterwards a slight revision was done in 2006. The text does not start with God the Father (as is customary) but with the person who realizes and accepts \\"that existence is infinitely greater than we can comprehend\\". Next, reference is made to the inspiration by the Holy Spirit ; this leads to Jesus and Jesus refers to God. This change in the classical order of the Christian confession is remarkable, but it also characterizes the current remonstrants views: faith starts with people.

Family L√©on marquis de Sorel (1655-1743) was from a family from the Bailiwick of Noyon. His parents were Charles, seigneur de Villiers and Jeanne du Montel. He was grandson of Robert de Sorel and Antoinette des Essarts, and great-grandson of Florent de Sorel. On 23 March 1699 in Rennes he married Marie Louise Marguerite de Marni√®re. They had a boy, Charles Gilles L√©on (2 January 1701 ‚Äì 24 May 1767). In 1708 he married Catherine Allain, widow of Cosme de S√©ran. His daughter Marie-Catherine married in 1729 to Jacques-Etienne-Louis Texier, Comte d'Hauteville, an army captain. Career L√©on marquis de Sorel, became a captain of the Navarre Infantry. On 3 January 1693 he was appointed inspector of naval troops at Brest, with the rank of ship-of-the-line captain (capitaine de vaisseau), one of three such inspectors in the navy. On 1 September 1718 Sorel was named governor general of Saint- Domingue, succeeding Charles Joubert de La Bastide, marquis de Chateaumorand. He was received by the council at Le Cap (Cap-Ha√Øtien) on 10 July 1719, and by the council at L√©og√¢ne on 13 November 1719. Soon after Sorel arrived in Saint- Domingue he approved a plan by the military engineer Am√©d√©e-Fran√ßois Fr√©zier to replaced the decaying barracks at Le Cap-Fran√ßais with a new masonry buildings, as well as other buildings such as the powder storehouse and the king's storehouse. However, the council also had to approve the expenditure, and the colony could not afford it. Sorel pushed hard for the work to be done, and eventually the superintendent of finance, Jean-Jacques Mithon de Senneville, agreed to support it. Construction of the barracks had begun by January 1720, using stone imported as ballast from France. By August 1721 the barracks were almost complete. The total cost had been 500,000 livres, and the colony's budget was exhausted. In 1723 Gilles, comte de Nos de Champmeslin (c. 1653‚Äì1726) was named commandant-general of all the seas, islands and the mainland of South America, while √âtienne Cochard de Chastenoye, governor of Le Cap, was named interim governor-general of Saint Domingue. On 6 December 1723 Sorel was replaced by Gaspard Charles de Gouss√©, chevalier de La Rocheallart. Sorel was made a commander of the Order of Saint Louis.

He complied, accompanied by other resignations by high-level politicians throughout the day, some citing fears for the safety of their families. The government of Mexico offered political asylum to Morales the following day, which Morales accepted a day afterwards. The second vice president of the Senate, opposition senator Jeanine √Å√±ez, assumed the role of president on 12 November, being the next in line for the presidency after a vacuum had been left following a string of resignations. This was not without controversy, as her initial appointment was made during a brief legislative session that lacked quorum, due to a boycott by Morales's party, Movement for Socialism (MAS). Bolivia's Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal then confirmed √Å√±ez's assumption of the presidency as legitimate and the ruling party returned most members to both chambers, with some assuming key positions such as Leader of the Senate. They have also committed to working with the interim government towards new elections. Morales has called for the Bolivian people to reject the leadership of √Å√±ez. He and his supporters argue that the event was a coup d'√©tat. International politicians, scholars and journalists are divided between describing the event as a coup or popular uprising. The Bolivian Congress, with the majority being members of Morales' MAS party, unanimously approved a bill on 23 November 2019 that annulled the results of 20 October election, allowed for new elections and prevented Evo Morales from participating in the new elections. The bill was signed into law the next day by president √Å√±ez. On 4 December 2019, the OAS released its final report related to 20 October election, detailing what they called \\"deliberate\\" and \\"malicious\\" tactics to rig that election in favor of President Evo Morales. Two subsequent independent non-peer-reviewed analyses of election data from different sources disagreed with the statistical analysis of election data presented by the OAS, with CEPR accusing OAS of doing a \\"basic coding error\\" resulting in what appeared to be inexplicable changes in trend. OAS's counter-response stated that doing statistical exercises on what they described as falsified data does not prove the data is not false, and said that the counter-analyses do not address or discount other alleged evidence of fraud in the report.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/world/americas/bolivia-election-evo- morales.html?auth=login-email&login;=email In September 2020, Human Rights Watch released a report saying that the interim government is \\"abusing the justice system to wage a politically motivated witch-hunt against former president Evo Morales and his allies\\".  Background  = 2019 Bolivian general election and subsequent investigations= On 20 October 2019, the first round of voting for all government positions was held. After the polls closed, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal began to release the preliminary results of the presidential election; at 7:40pm, when 83.8% of the votes had been counted, the preliminary count stopped. The Tribunal's president, Mar√≠a Eugenia Choque, said that the preliminary count had stopped because the official results had begun to be released. At the time that the preliminary count was stopped, Morales led with 45.3%, and his primary opponent, Carlos Mesa, had 38.2%. Less than a 10-point lead would have resulted in another round of runoff voting. At 9:25pm, President Morales declared himself the winner, stating that rural areas would guarantee his victory. Although uncounted votes in rural areas were expected to go his way, one body observing the election‚Äîthe Organization of American States (OAS)‚Äîstated that even if Morales did win outright, his lead beyond the 10-point threshold would be so negligible as to warrant a runoff anyway. The OAS expressed concern about the day-long gap in results reporting: after 24 hours, the updates resumed, but with a surge for Morales at the first update. On 21 October, the Plurinational Electoral Organ reported a still-incomplete count, suggesting that with only 95.3% of verified votes, Morales had too large of a margin above 10 points to overcome, avoiding a second run-off round, and so Morales would remain in power for a fourth term. Based on this result, along with reported irregularities and the two-term presidential limit that the Bolivian Constitutional Tribunal had nullified, the Bolivian opposition and protestors as well as some foreign governments and international observers called for an audit of the process and results, to which Morales agreed. The OAS audit of the election began on 31 October and was observed by Spain, Mexico, and Paraguay. = Protests = By 24 October, Morales began describing the actions taken against him as a coup. On 25 October, when the results were officially announced with Morales as the winner, various countries in Latin America, as well as the United States and European Union, had called for the second round to go ahead regardless. On 31 October, two deaths were announced by the government. The third death during the protests occurred on 7 November when a 20-year-old student called Limbert Guzman was killed during clashes.  Events  = Allegations of electoral fraud and OAS audit = On 6 November, the Bolivian opposition published a 190-page long report containing fraud accusations, including irregularities such as mistaken electoral acts additions, data swiping and electoral acts where the ruling party obtained more votes than registered voters, expecting to send it to international organizations such as the OAS and the United Nations. Although a complete report was not yet due, mounting tension in the country prompted the OAS to release a preliminary report on 10 November concluding that they had discovered sufficient evidence of election fraud to warrant new elections. This led to a string of events culminating in the resignation of Morales. The OAS uncovered multiple irregularities, including failures in the chain of custody for ballots, alteration and forgery of electoral material, redirection of data to unauthorized servers and data manipulation. They added that it was statistically unlikely that Morales had secured the 10-percentage-point margin of victory needed to win outright, saying that election should be annulled after it had found \\"clear manipulations\\" of the voting system, and that \\"The manipulations to the computer systems are of such magnitude that they must be deeply investigated by the Bolivian State to get to the bottom of and assign responsibility in this serious case.\\" An analysis by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) disputed the OAS's preliminary findings and criticized what it called a \\"politicization of the electoral observation process.\\" The co-director of the think-tank, Mark Weisbrot, stated the OAS showed \\"no evidence ‚Äì no statistics, numbers, or facts of any kind\\" to support its claim of electoral manipulation. CEPR concluded that due to Morales' voter base being in more rural regions, the results from peripheral areas received towards the end of the count were more likely to be in his favour. The New York Times noted, however, that this criticism has \\"not addressed the accusations of hidden data servers, forged signatures and other irregularities found by the O.A.S. observers, nor have they tried to explain the electoral council‚Äôs sudden decision to stop the count\\". The OAS also dismissed the report as \\"neither honest, nor fact-based nor comprehensive\\". On 5 December, the full 95-page OAS report was released along with 500 pages of corroborating details as appendices. These included that an outside user who controlled a Linux AMI appliance with \\"root privileges\\" ‚Äî conferring the ability to alter results ‚Äì accessed the official vote-counting server during the counting and that in a sample of 4,692 returns from polling stations around the country, 226 showed multiple signatures by the same person for different voting booths, a violation of electoral law. On those returns, 91 percent of votes went to MAS, approximately double the rate recorded elsewhere. On 21 December, the Technical Mission of Electoral Experts sent by the European Union published a 67-page report that concluded that the election day \\"passed peacefully and with a high voter turnout\\" but \\"a large number of electoral records showed irregularities, which could be due to deficiencies in the training of jurors or deliberate manipulations\\". On 3 January 2020, at a meeting of the Committee for Latin America of Socialist International, it was declared that they accepted the findings of the OAS and that Morales was not a victim of a coup. A document containing discussions of the Bolivian political crisis states that \\"\\"After a broad mobilization of citizens in that country in protest of electoral fraud that was informed and verified by an audit conducted by the Organization of American States (OAS) of the elections that took place on 20 October, the president Evo Morales did not suffer a coup d'etat\\". Independent contract researchers for CEPR, John Curiel and Jack R. Williams disputed the claims of irregularities in the late vote count that were made by OAS with a statistical analysis released on 27 February 2020. They contended that the OAS allegations about irregularities in the vote count were made on two unproven premises: \\"...the unofficial count accurately reflects the vote continuously measured, and that reported voter preferences do not vary by the time of day\\". Later, in August 2020, after Nooruddin published the dataset he used for the OAS audit to a Harvard University digital repository, CEPR released a statement suggesting that the way the data was sorted was flawed due to a coding error which would indicate that the OAS claims about the irregularities in the vote count were also flawed. = Authorities abandon Morales = After weeks of repelling protesters at the Casa Grande del Pueblo presidential palace, units of the Police Operations Tactical Unit (UTOP) tasked with defending Morales assembled a meeting on 8 November. UTOP officers ultimately decided at the gathering to abandon their posts and to call for the resignation of Morales. According to Reuters, UTOP turned away from Morales for multiple reasons: complaints of alleged orders to suppress opposition protestors while avoiding Morales loyalists; resentments over perceived preferential treatment given to the military; and the exhaustion of combating protestors. On 9 November, Morales organized a meeting and ordered the military to put down protesters, with officers present rejecting Morales' orders according to former general Fernando S√°nchez. According to The Wall Street Journal, following this meeting, officers feared of \\"violent military suppression\\" similar to 2003 protests during the Bolivian gas conflict, which happened before Morales become president. At this time, all UTOP officers had left their positions, leaving Morales vulnerable to protesters. At a police station near the presidential palace, officers climbed onto the roofs and chanted \\"The Police with the People\\". Police nationwide began to retreat from protesters, returning to their stations, while other departments began to mutiny against the Morales government, arguing that they did not want to be an \\"instrument of any government\\". Head of the Bolivian Armed Forces, General Williams Kaliman, refused to suppress demonstrations, saying that the military would \\"never confront the people among whom we live\\" and that the events unfolding were \\"a political problem and it should be resolved within that realm\\". After police left their posts at the presidential palace, Morales never returned and was forced into hiding in an improvised office protected by a small group of his guard. He ultimately held a press conference at the Bolivian Air Force's presidential hangar in El Alto International Airport later in the day, leading some to suspect that Morales had already lost control of the government. Franklin Pareja, a professor of the Higher University of San Andr√©s, said that because of the abandonment police, the Morales government \\"lost its shield\\" and that \\"it was totally vulnerable and couldn‚Äôt go on\\". According to members of the Bolivian military quoted by the Wall Street Journal, authorities had questioned Morales' actions for some time. Morales had performed multiple actions that had offended officers within the armed forces, including glorifying Che Guevara after his guerrillas killed 59 Bolivian troops during their insurgency in the 1960s and forcing officers to attend the Anti-Imperialist Military Academy that was led by a convicted former rebel. General Tom√°s Pe√±a y Lillo, who was chief of the Bolivian armed forces until 2010, stated that officers within the military were traditionally conservative and had refused plans proposed by Morales to be guided by Cuban military and intelligence agents, damaging Morales' hold of the military. Roberto Ponce, former chief of staff of the Bolivian military, also explained that Morales spent little on the country's armed forces as he feared that he would be overthrown, which frustrated military officers. = Protesters overrun La Paz = By the night of 9 November, violence escalated throughout Bolivia. The Morales government called on supporters to gather in the capital city of La Paz \\"defend\\" him, with reports of pro-Morales groups attacking buses of opposition protesters. However, anti-Morales protesters had already overrun the streets of La Paz, with some groups of police joining in protests against Morales. Demonstrators began to overrun government offices, with protesters flooding the stations of Bolivia TV and Radio Patria Nueva, accusing them of serving Morales. Relatives of Morales had their homes attacked by protesters, with his older sister's home in Oruro being burned while other regional governors had their homes torched as well. The next day, two miners from Potos√≠ were shot and injured, reportedly by snipers, when cooperative miners where marching to join protests in La Paz. = Calls for Morales to resign = After the release of 10 November OAS audit, multiple Bolivian entities called on Morales to resign. Morales had initially relied on support from civil organizations to protect him from protests instead of the military since he enjoyed popular support. However, the two main civil groups of Bolivia had begun aligning themselves with the opposition to Morales; the Bolivian Workers' Center (COB), Bolivia's largest trade union and a traditionally pro-Morales entity, and the Single Trade Union Confederation of Workers (CSUTCB), an indigenous workers union. CSUTCB had already met with opposition leader Luis Fernando Camacho, announcing an alliance and in the morning of 10 November, the leader of COB suggested Morales resign if it would help solve the violence, and called for new elections. Indigenous and Aymara leader Nelson Condori, the director of CSUTCB, intensified his condemnation of Morales later in the day while at an event beside Camacho, stating, \\"Evo, we have cried, you have made our lives bitter, you have lied to us. ... When have you forgotten the slogan of our ancestors, do not steal, do not lie, do not be lazy?\\" Condori also called for a \\"purge\\" of the Bolivian government, demanding that Morales and his governmental allies be jailed for electoral fraud. After the COB and other civil groups formerly supportive of Morales called on him to resign, Morales held a second press conference at the presidential hangar, changing his position on the October election results and announced that new elections would be held. Morales released a statement, saying \\"As President, my main mission is to preserve peace, social justice and economic stability. Listening to the Bolivian Workers' Center (COB), the Pact of Unity and other social sectors, I have decided first to renew all the members of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal\\". Since popular social groups had abandoned Morales, the military was the only group protecting him from protesters. Officers who feared punishment if they deployed troops against civilians pressured General Williams Kaliman, the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Bolivia and Morales loyalist, to turn away from Morales. Later, Kaliman announced that the military had suggested Morales resign to \\"help restore peace and stability\\" after weeks of protests over the vote, adding that the military was calling on the Bolivian people to refrain from violence and disorder. The military also said it would conduct operations to \\"neutralise\\" any armed groups that attacked the protesters. The military press release invoked Article 20, paragraph b, of Law No. 1405 which states: : > Article 20. The attribution and responsibilities of the military high > command are: [...] b. To analyze inner and foreign troubled situations to > suggest to whom it may concern the appropriate solutions. = Morales resigns = After Kaliman's statement, Morales took the presidential plane from El Alto International Airport to an undisclosed location, announcing his immediate resignation on television, stating that he was resigning to \\"protect the families\\" of Movement for Socialism members. He concluded by stating that he believed Carlos Mesa had \\"achieved his objective\\", and asked protesters to \\"stop burning down the houses of [his] brothers and sisters\\". Vice President √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera also resigned after consulting with Morales. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that Morales was on a plane to Argentina; however, the Argentine foreign minister, Jorge Faurie, said that Argentina would not grant him asylum. Commander Yuri Calder√≥n assured that there was no warrant for Morales' arrest, though armed individuals had entered his home. Later in the day, Adriana Salvatierra, the President of the Senate, Victor Borda, the leader of the Chamber, and Rub√©n Medinaceli, First Vice President of the Senate, also all resigned. Mexico's foreign minister declared that twenty members of Bolivia's executive and legislative branches were at the official Mexican residence in the capital seeking asylum following the resignation. Following the resignation of Morales and his allied successors, protesters called for a board to be convened to oversee the government and new elections, though Mesa disagreed with the proposal, stating protesters should not \\"violate the Constitution so as not to give Evo Morales an excuse that he was the victim of a coup d'etat\\" and that the Legislative Assembly should determine the constitutional successor. Later on 10 November, BBC Mundo published an article suggesting that five main reasons combined to force Morales to resign: the audit results, the opposition from the military and police, the ongoing protests, the growing radicalization of the political opposition, and the public distaste towards his continued re- elections. = OEP detentions and TSE arrests= At 8:20 pm, the Associated Press reported that Bolivian police had detained 38 members of the Plurinational Electoral Organ (or √ìrgano Electoral Plurinacional (OEP)) on suspicion of falsification and other electoral crimes, including the former president and vice president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), Maria Eugenia Choque and Antonio Costas. According to police commander Yuri Calder√≥n, Choque was apprehended whilst disguised as a man. The attorney general's office earlier announced that it was opening an investigation into allegations raised by the OAS report. An election official in Santa Cruz, Sandra Kettels, was arrested Monday morning, with arrest warrants issued for the remaining TSE officials.  Succession of presidency  = Assumption of presidency by Jeanine √Å√±ez = Jeanine √Å√±ez, pictured here in 2016, was the next in the line of succession and became interim president On the evening of 10 November, Jeanine √Å√±ez, the second vice president of the Senate and the highest-ranking official remaining in the line of succession after the resignations, announced she would be assuming the presidency on an interim basis from 11 November onward, with the responsibility of calling new elections. She stated that she would assume the office once the Senate had formally recognized the previous day's resignations. Upon inauguration, √Å√±ez would officially become the President of Bolivia. The Bolivian Constitution does not make specific provisions for the process of a Senator assuming the presidency; article 169 says that \\"In case of impediment or definitive absence of the president of the State, he will be replaced in office by the Vice President and, in his absence, by the President of the Senate, and in the absence of this by the President of the Chamber of Deputies. In the latter case, new elections will be called within a maximum period of ninety days.\\" It also establishes the line of succession. The following day, √Å√±ez arrived at La Paz-El Alto airport and was taken in a military helicopter to a nearby Air Force base; from here she traveled in convoy to the Senate. On 12 November 2019, in a brief legislative session without quorum, due to the ruling party's boycott, √Å√±ez declared herself as acting president of Bolivia while holding a large bible, stating that \\"the bible has returned to the government palace\\". √Å√±ez obtained the favourable vote of the opposition parties, a third part of the parliament, while the Movement for Socialism ruling party did not participate in the voting, rejecting the succession. √Å√±ez's assumption of the presidential office was supported by Bolivia's Plurinational Constitutional Tribunal, which interpreted citing articles referring to the presidential succession of the 2001 Constitutional Declaration, that the next person in the succession line assumes the presidency ipso facto despite not having the required quorum, stating that \\"the functioning of the executive should not be suspended\\". = Reactions and anti-√Å√±ez protests = A demonstration in support of Morales in El Alto on 11 November 2019 Reactions to the transfer of power and to Ms √Å√±ez's assumption of the presidency have been mixed, being met with both celebrations and protests. Demonstrators celebrating the removal of the government chanted \\"yes we can\\" and set off fireworks. Hundreds of supporters of Morales made their way toward the center of La Paz from the mountains surrounding the city, some of them armed with sticks, chanting \\"here we go, civil war\\". The police said the armed group had vandalized police offices, causing panic in some neighborhoods where people blocked their doors with furniture to protect stores and houses. After receiving requests for help from the national police and politicians, the armed forces announced that night they would mobilize to defend gas, water and electricity services around the capital, and also begin joint patrols with the police around the city. On 13 November, a dozen MAS senators were blocked by police from entering the National Assembly building during the session. The next few days were marked by protests and roadblocks on behalf of Morales' supporters. In Cochabamba, Sacaba and Senkata, civilians were killed during clashes with security forces. On 20 November, Evo Morales offered not to run for reelection if he was allowed to return to Bolivia and finish his presidential term.  Capital shut down  The drinking water supplies to parts of both La Paz and El Alto, the second and third largest cities in Bolivia, were cut off. According to Gen. Williams Kaliman, it was the plan of insurgents to leave these cities without water or fuel and counteractions to guard public services were covered under the so-called \\"Sebasti√°n Pagador\\" plan. La Paz's legislature closed down the capital's infrastructure, schools, and workplaces, for public safety. Supporters of Morales also built barricades on roads that lead to the airport. Barricades were placed around the Senkata refinery in El Alto by Morales supporters, cutting power and fuel to El Alto and La Paz. Pro-Morales demonstrators stormed the premises and set fire to vehicles within the compound. The Bolivian military re-took the site on 19 November using armored vehicles and helicopters, killing three protesters and injuring 22 in the process. As a result of blockades from various protests surrounding the city, some goods were also not able to enter. Food supply was affected, leading to rationing and controlled prices in El Alto and La Paz. = Interim government response to protests = In the face of protests against the interim government, √Å√±ez called for police to restore order and, on 14 November, issued a decree that would exempt the military from any type of criminal responsibility when maintaining order, when acting in a \\"legitimate defense or state of necessity.\\" On 15 November, security forces fired upon coca farmers protesting against the government in Cochabamba. The clash left nine dead and dozens injured.  Human rights concerns  Jos√© Miguel Vivanco, head of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, said that the decree \\"sends a very dangerous message to the military that they have carte blanche to commit abuses\\". The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) condemned √Å√±ez's government for issuing the decree. UN Human Rights Chief Michelle Bachelet issued a statement, saying that \\"while earlier deaths mostly resulted from clashes between rival protestors\\", the latest incidents appear to be due to the \\"disproportionate use of force by the army and police\\", stating that \\"in a situation like this, repressive actions by the authorities will simply stoke that anger even further and are likely to jeopardise any possible avenue for dialogue.\\" Bachelet also expressed concern that \\"widespread arrests and detentions\\" were adding to the tensions; according to her office, more than 600 people had been detained since 21 October. Furthermore, Bachelet also declared being concerned that the situation could \\"spin out of control if the authorities do not handle it sensitively and in accordance with international norms and standards governing the use of force, and with full respect for human rights\\", stating that it couldn't be solved through \\"force and repression\\". The decree was later repealed by √Å√±ez. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has expressed concerns over human rights violations that occurred after the 2019 Bolivian general election. Paulo Abr√£o, who heads the IACHR, declared that due to the \\"massive\\" number of human rights violations amid post-election violence, the country may need outside help to investigate the situation and recommended Bolivia coordinate with an international panel of experts to ensure findings are seen as credible. On 5 December 2019, √Å√±ez approved an act to provide compensation to the families of those killed and injured during the conflict. On 10 December, the government and IACHR signed an agreement to investigate the acts of violence that occurred. On 30 Dec, Eva Copa, MAS head of the Senate, stated that a report had been filed with Arturo Murillo to give an account of the deaths in Sacaba and Senkata after the Assembly recess in the new year.  Interim government activities  = New elections = √Å√±ez stated on 15 November that in order to restore faith in the electoral process, a vote would first be held to elect a new Electoral Commission, before having a new vote for president. On 20 November the interim government presented a bill that aimed to forge a path to new elections. The two chambers congress were expected to debate the bill which would annul 20 October election and appoint a new electoral board within 15 days of its passage, paving the way for a new vote. The bill, drafted jointly by MAS and anti-Morales legislators, was approved on 23 November; it also prohibited Morales from participating in the fresh election. In exchange, √Å√±ez's government agreed to withdraw the armed forces from all protest areas (although some servicemen were still permitted to stay at some state companies to \\"prevent vandalism\\"), revoke her decree which granted the army immunity from criminal prosecution, release arrested protesters, protect lawmakers and social leaders from attacks and provide compensation for the families of those killed during the crisis. She approved the bill shortly thereafter. Elections were initially scheduled to be held on 3 May 2020. However, they were postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. On 22 June 2020, √Å√±ez approved a law passed by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to set a date for the election for 6 September 2020, with elected authorities in place by mid- to-late November 2020. On 23 July 2020, the TSE postponed the election to 18 October 2020 due to medical reports that the pandemic will have its highest peaks in late August and early September. Many opposition leaders, including Evo Morales, have condemned the delays, seeing the continued delays as an unconstitutional attempt to remain in power, and some groups, including the Bolivian Workers' Center have planned protests. = Domestic policy = Immediately after his resignation, protests emerged in support of Morales and against the new government. In response, √Å√±ez signed decree no. 4078, granting total impunity to the armed forces to quell protestors. Resulting in the masacres of Senkata and Sacaba, where at least 18 people were killed. This decree was subject to international criticism. Jos√© Miguel Vivanco, Americas Director of Human Rights Watch described the decree as, \\"giv[ing] the armed forces a blank check to commit abuses instead of working to restore the rule of law in the country\\". The √Å√±ez administration appointed government ministers between 13 and 18 November. The first eleven members of the interim cabinet, appointed 13 November, did not contain any indigenous members. The Guardian described this partial cabinet as showing \\"no signs that [√Å√±ez] intended to reach across the country's deep political and ethnic divide\\". √Å√±ez did, however, designate two persons of indigenous origin as ministers of culture and mining as the remaining positions were filled. Morales's first cabinet was majority indigenous (14 out of 16 positions), though this number decreased over the course of his tenure as president. Among the senior ministers in √Å√±ez' cabinet were prominent Bolivian businesspeople. Shortly after taking office, √Å√±ez also appointed a new military high command. The new commander of the armed forces, General Carlos Orellana Centellas, pledged to take orders from √Å√±ez. On 20 November, √Å√±ez granted safe-conduct to Evo Morales' daughter, Evaliz, to receive political asylum in Mexico. From early on, the interim government took the decision to fly the patuj√∫ in addition to the wiphala and Flag of Bolivia. The patuj√∫ is a symbol of the Eastern indigenous peoples of Bolivia and of Santa Cruz, Bolivia's largest city. This flag was also adopted by indigenous opposition to Morales during the TIPNIS protests. The government renamed the state newspaper, known as Cambio under president Morales, as Bolivia on 17 November. On 25 November, the √Å√±ez met with civil groups Bolivian Workers' Center, the country's largest union, and the Pact of Unity, a prominent indigenous grassroots group, to sign agreements on how to pacify Bolivia following previous violent events. Patuj√∫ flag representing the eastern peoples of Bolivia In the week following the inauguration of √Å√±ez, the new government came under criticism. The New York Times described √Å√±ez as \\"reaching beyond her caretaker mandate of organizing national elections by January\\". Javier Corrales, a Latin American politics professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts, said \\"without a popular mandate, [the government] are pushing forward some of the most objectionable aspects of their agenda\\". Oliver Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation in S√£o Paulo, said that \\"the only thing this government was supposed to do was calm things down and call elections, and that‚Äôs just about the only thing it has not done\\". By late November and December, progress was made in passing legislation for new elections, appointing a new electoral body, entering dialogue with representatives from protesting factions in El Alto and cooperating with Morales' MAS party in joint participation in the coming elections, albeit without Morales as a presidential candidate. A survey by Bolivian newspaper P√°gina Siete showed that 43% of Bolivians approved of how √Å√±ez has handled the presidency, while 23% disapproved. On 13 Dec, √Å√±ez approved an agreement between the three main parties over a so-called \\"Law of Guarantees\\" formulated to restore faith among political actors in the process of moving forward, including reparations for those killed and injured after she came to power. This act was welcomed by the Secretary General of the UN. A previous incarnation of this legislation, passed in both chambers by the MAS majority, had not been given presidential approval due to articles that implied immunity from prosecution for representatives of the previous government. This version was described by opposition lawmakers as an attempted \\"cover up\\" on behalf of the MAS party and caused friction among members of MAS itself. On 1 January 2020, √Å√±ez presented a change in the law that would it make it mandatory for presidential candidates to engage in public debate with their opponents to support \\"the strengthening of informed democracy\\". La Raz√≥n says such debates did not take place before. In September 2020, Human Rights Watch released a report saying that the interim caretaker government is \\"abusing the justice system to wage a politically motivated witch-hunt against former president Evo Morales and his allies\\", adding that prosecutors had charged some Morales backers with terrorism for simply speaking to him on the phone. = Foreign policy = Karen Longaric, appointed as foreign minister by Jeanine √Å√±ez, announced the formal departure from the country of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and breaking all diplomatic relations with Venezuela's Maduro government, recognizing Juan Guaid√≥ as acting president of Venezuela in the Venezuelan presidential crisis. Longaric also announced that the interim government was considering leaving the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). A month later, the country announced its entry into the Lima Group, a regional bloc established in 2017 with the purpose of finding a way out of the Venezuelan crisis. The Bolivian foreign ministry said in a statement that it hoped to \\"contribute to a peaceful, democratic and constitutional solution to the crisis in Venezuela, which must be guided by the Venezuelan people\\". On the same month, the interim government announced that they would give refuge to 200 Venezuelans \\"who have fled their country for reasons of political order, of political persecution promoted by the Nicol√°s Maduro government.\\" In January 2020, the interim government suspended relations with Cuba in response to remarks made by Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr√≠guez Parrilla, who called √Å√±ez a \\"liar,\\" \\"coupist\\" and \\"self-proclaimed\\" in reference to her latest statements about the role of Cuban medical doctors in the country.  Diplomatic row over Mexican Embassy  Since the resignation of Morales, several members of the past administration have taken diplomatic refuge in the Mexican Embassy in La Paz. Several of these are facing accusations and prosecution under the interim government, the most senior being the former Minister of the Presidency, Juan Ram√≥n Quintana. Anti-Morales protesters have routinely gathered at the doorstep of the Embassy to voice their discontent and demand that they be turned over to the Bolivian authorities. An increased security presence by police and army in the vicinity of the Embassy has led to accusations of harassment and a \\"siege\\". On 27 December, tensions were further increased when visiting Spanish diplomats were stopped by police during a visit to the Embassy. The Mexican Embassador accused the Bolivian government of Mar√≠a Teresa Mercado violating the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Longaric responded by saying the presence of masked and armed guards aroused suspicion that there would be an attempt to smuggle Quintana from the Embassy to another location. Longarid said: \\"No country in the world could tolerate what happened last Friday. In that case, the Vienna Convention empowers the host State to declare those diplomats who violate the rules of the conventions themselves personas non-gratas.\\" On 30 December, √Å√±ez made an announcement giving a number of Mexican and Spanish diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, Spain responding by declaring that three Bolivian diplomats likewise must leave the country. Eva Copa, MAS head of the Senate, criticised √Å√±ez for the expulsion of diplomats of countries who helped bring stability to Bolivia and urged her to reconsider the action. = Counteractions = On 15 November, Longaric expelled 725 Cuban citizens, mostly medical doctors, after accusing them of being involved in protests. The government announced it arrested nine Venezuelans in the border city of Guayaramer√≠n (near Brazil) with boots and insignias of the Bolivarian National Police (PNB), identification cards of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and microchips containing photos of themselves with other people armed with guns. After the arrest and the discovery of the microchips, the interim government accused the men of participating in \\"violent acts\\" in the country, and transferred them to the Bolivian Special Crime Fighting Forces to conduct a preliminary investigation. Arturo Murillo, √Å√±ez's new interior minister, vowed to \\"hunt down\\" his predecessor Juan Ram√≥n Quintana, a prominent Morales ally, stoking fears of a vendetta against members of the previous administration. He later announced he would start arresting certain members of the previous government who he accused of \\"subversion\\". Roxana Liz√°rraga, √Å√±ez's communication minister, stated that she had a list of journalists who were \\"involved in sedition\\" and threatened them with prosecution. On 22 November, after an audio recording, allegedly of Morales, leaked in which Morales supporters were directed to block main roads to La Paz, the interim government opened an investigation into Morales for \\"terrorism and sedition\\". Hours later, the vice-president of MAS-IPSP was arrested for allegedly using a car of the ministry of the President; in the car, according to T√©lam, police discovered computers and biometric devices that belonged to the electoral commission. =Social media campaign= In December 2019, the interim government of √Å√±ez contracted CLS Strategies, a Washington-based public relation firm, \\"to carry out lobbying in support of Bolivian democracy\\" and \\"in support of holding new presidential elections\\". In September 2020, Facebook closed 55 accounts, 42 pages and 36 Instagram accounts linked to CLS Strategies. Facebook said these were fake accounts used to secretly manipulate politics in Bolivia, Venezuela and Mexico in violation of Facebook's prohibition on foreign interference. Following Morales' resignation, a large anti-Morales Twitter bot network was uncovered by the microblogging site in mid November. The network had published automated tweets which declared opposition to Morales, further adding that the events were \\"not a coup\\". Compared to the extremely low proportion of the population that speaks English, the abundance of English tweets from this network suggests that it was intended to sway opinions beyond Bolivia. The company behind the site had removed many of the tweets by 19 November, but media reports suggested that around 4200 were still up by that point. The Caracas- based TeleSur network alleged that nearly 70,000 fake accounts had been used by the network, many of which were created just days before. A Social Networks head working for the Spanish party Podemos further alleged that fake accounts were used to artificially boost the online following of anti-Morales political figures, including A√±ez.

It is listed as a heritage site of national significance. History The chapel was probably built in 1140 by the lords of Pont for Humilimont Abbey. The abbey belonged to the Order of Canons Regular of Pr√©montr√© which owned land in the village of Posat. Between 1145 and 1159, the chapel hosted the sisters of St. Norbert. In 1362, 58 nuns were still living there. During the Reformation, the nunnery was closed in 1580 one year after Marsens Abbey. The inn- restaurant De la Croix d‚ÄôOr was built over the remains of the convent. The original chapel of Posat was built in the same period than the convent; it was destroyed, then re-built and consecrated in 1675 by the Jesuits. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it became a pilgrimage site in the 18th century: the worshippers came there to pray in front of a statue described as \\"miraculous yet fully worm-eaten\\". A water source under the chapel is said to cure eye diseases. In 1695, the old shrine was replaced with a larger and better- adorned Renaissance chapel donated by Mrs. Colonelle Praroman. The table of the main altar (Visitation), as well as the four other paintings of the choir and the ten others of the nave, show the mysteries of the Holy Rosary. The chapel also has other paintings that represent Saint Joseph, Saint Ann and the Doctors of the Church. The tabernacle, made of carved golden wood, was donated by the court of Louis XV to the Jesuit Fathers. The building was renovated in 2003‚Äì2004 and has been listed among the Swiss Cultural Property of National Significance since at least 1995.

He also served as the first mayor of The Pas after its establishment in 1912.  Origins in the United States  Eva and Gottfried Finger immigrated to the United States from Germany and gave birth to Herman in Brookfield, Wisconsin on 13 April 1856. They lived near Milwaukee for seven years before moving to Outagamie County. Eva and Gottfried had ten children including Herman. In 1878, Herman bought a farm in Waupaca County and some land in Northern Minnesota, and in 1881 he became the foreman of Sherry Lumber Company in Vesper, Wisconsin. In 1886, he acquired a stake in Gerry Lumber Company near Eagle River, Wisconsin, and was put in-charge of running the company. In 1894, he became Treasurer of Vilas County while continuing to run the lumber company. While living in Wisconsin, he and his wife Emma Elizabeth Finger gave birth to seven children.  Pigeon River Lumber Company  In 1900, Herman and his family, moved to Port Arthur, Ontario so that Herman could start his own lumber company called the Pigeon River Lumber Company along with Daniel J. Arpin and William Scott Jr. They initially purchased the Graham and Horne sawmill to process their timber, but by 1901, they finished building their own sawmill at Port Arthur, which was the largest in Western Canada. Pigeon River Lumber Company was the largest employer in the Canadian Lakehead region until 1911 when the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company was created. Many of the logs were shipped by train to the sawmills. The company owned its own railway called the Gunflint and Lake Superior Railroad, and also shipped logs and lumber on the Port Arthur, Duluth and Western Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. By 1906, only around 10-years-worth of the company's timber remained unharvested, so Finger purchased new timber berths throughout the Carrot River Valley in the District of Keewatin and the newly-formed Province of Saskatchewan. The Pigeon River Lumber Company eventually shut down in 1919.  Finger Lumber Company  With these new Carrot River timber berths in-hand, Herman Finger established the Finger Lumber Company, and planned to build a sawmill, and a pulp and paper mill. He chose to build the mills near a Hudson's Bay Company Trading Post where the Carrot River flowed into the Saskatchewan River since the Saskatchewan River already had well-established trade routes, and because the Canadian Northern Railway planned to build a rail line through the area on their way to the Hudson Bay. In 1900, the Canadian Northern Railway had reached Erwood, Saskatchewan with their northern line. However, instead of continuing their construction north towards the Hudson Bay, they continued building eastward towards Melfort to collect lumber from closer sawmills and also grain and other agricultural products from the prairies. By 1907, Finger and the Canadian Parliament convinced the railway to continue building north, and by 1910, a line was completed that connected the mill to Hudson Bay Junction, Saskatchewan. Between 1906 and 1910, the company had acquired of timber berths, and in October 1910, they began building their first mill. Finger also created a village near the mill where the employees could live, and named it Fingerville. Parts of the mill were steam-powered from boilers that burned waste wood, and other parts were powered by diesel generators, which also supplied electricity to Fingerville, and later to The Pas. In 1912, the Town of The Pas was incorporated, and Herman Finger became its first mayor. Fingerville was absorbed into The Pas, and a train station was built for the town on the Canadian Northern Rail line. The 1910s were the best years for the company due to a depletion of the forests of Wisconsin and Minnesota leading to increased lumber demand from the US. However in 1919, the company barn burned down, and one of Finger's old financial partners died, so he decided to sell the company to David Winton of Minneapolis, who changed the name of the company to The Pas Lumber Company.  Legacy  Herman Finger retired in Winnipeg and died in his home at 353 Maplewood Avenue on November 26, 1929. His son Orley Finger also became a mayor of The Pas in 1919.

He was the son of the cantor Borukh Leib Shulman (1870-1963) and was great-grandson of the writer Kalman Schulman (1819-1899). He was one of the most well known Yiddish singers in the Soviet Union alongside some of his contemporaries such as Mikhail Alexandrovich, Emil Gorovets, Anna Guzik, and Sidi Tal.  Early life  Zinovy's father, the cantor Borukh Shulman, had six children; he was also a tenor and was said to have been Zinovy's first teacher. By age ten Zinovy was already a talented singer and was a soloist in his father's synagogue choir. The family's life was severely disrupted by the 1917 Russian Revolution; the Odessa Synagogue where his father was cantor was burned down, and thereafter the family moved around so that Borukh could continue singing. After graduating from the Odessa Gymnasium, Zinovy studied under the tenor Viktor Selyavin. Shulman's first performances were in the mid 1920s.https://eleven.co.il/jewish- art/music/14958/ His earliest concerts consisted of Yiddish songs, arias, and romances. In 1929 the Odessa Department of Education sent him to Moscow to audition for the People's Commisariat of Education; they were so impressed by the arias he performed that they intitially planned to send him to Italy to study, although this plan was not successful. Thereafter he studied at the State Institute of Theater Arts, from which he graduated in 1934.https://eleven.co.il/jewish-art/music/14958/ His teacher there was the tenor Roman Isidorovich Charov.  Musical career  In 1934‚Äì35 he was made soloist of the K. Stanislavsky Opera House (now the K. Stanislavsky and V. Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theater). https://eleven.co.il/jewish- art/music/14958/ However, he remained more interested in Yiddish art song than Opera, and resigned in 1935 to dedicate himself more fully to Jewish music. He was known for arranging traditional Yiddish folksongs, translating well-known arias into Yiddish, and for soliciting Yiddish writers and composers to create new works for him to perform. He continued to perform during the 1930s and 1940s and in 1948 famously performed for Golda Meir, future Israeli Prime Minister, who was then the Israeli ambassador to the USSR.  Arrest and detention  In 1949, after a concert in Kislovodsk, he was arrested. His arrest was part of a broader shift in Soviet official policy towards Yiddish culture which saw a near-complete disappearance of Yiddish and Jewish culture from the stage and airwaves. After the concert he was sent by Kyiv where he was interrogated, tortured, and accused of support for Jewish nationalism; he was eventually sentenced to ten years in a labor camp. He was sent to the Karlag (Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp in the Kazakh SSR) where his hand was permanently injured from the difficult manual labor.  Second phase of career  In the mid-1950s, following the death of Stalin, Soviet policy towards Yiddish was revised and a period of revival of Yiddish entertainment began.Estraikh, Gennady. Yiddish in the Cold War. Routledge, 2017, p.57. Shulman was rehabilitated in 1956 or 1957, and he returned to Moscow and resumed performing. However, despite official support and large audiences, Shulman and other Yiddish singers such as Anna Guzik were encouraged to incorporate more and more Russian language material in their performances and even occasionally asked not to perform in Yiddish at certain events.Ro'i, Yaacov. The Struggle for Soviet Jewish Emigration, 1948-1967. Vol. 75. Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.319. This period also saw the return to print of some Yiddish literature and, after 1961, the publication of a literary journal Sovetish Heymland which promoted Shulman and other Yiddish artists. One such promotional material, which was distributed widely in 1961, described a \\"conference devoted to the development of Yiddish songs and music, organized by the Soviet-Yiddish magazine SOVETISH KHEYMLAND. [...] Nehama Lifshits, Eddie Thal, Emil Horovits, Mihail Alexandrovich, Anna Guzik, and Zinoviy Shulman have in the past few months given concerts of Yiddish songs in some of the best concert halls of Moscow.\\" After 1963 he appeared regularly with Shvartser's Moscow Yiddish Drama Ensemble.Frankel, Jonathan, and Benjamin Pinkus. The Soviet Government and the Jews, 1948-1967: A Documented Study. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1984, p.480-481. Some records were released of his songs in the late 1930s and 1940s under the labels Gramplasttrest and V.S.G. (–í–°–ì), the greatest number were released in the 1960s and 1970s on the Melodiya label. In his late career, as his health worsened Shulman also turned to educating a younger generation of performers. In 1973 a collection of his repertoire was published under the title Jewish songs from the repertoire of Zinovy Shulman (Russian: –ï–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ –∏–∑ —Ä–µ–ø–µ—Ä—Ç—É–∞—Ä–∞ –ó–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏—è –®—É–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–∞).http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/234104584 Shulman continued his good relations with Golda Meir and the Israeli Embassy in Moscow; he held regular performances there, and in 1969 when Shulman became seriously ill, and Golda Meir attempted to send him medicines, although they did not reach him. Shulman died in Moscow in 1977 and was posthumously awarded the title of Prisoner of Zion by Israel in 1997.

It was first released in Japan on July 26, 2018 for the iOS and Android. The game is a retelling of SNK's The King of Fighters games with the player being able to create their own team as they battle across multiple annual tournaments. It was released in English regions on October 22, 2019. Gameplay Gameplay featuring Kyo Kusanagi as playable character and Benimaru Nikaido as Striker. The bottom right options indicate what special moves he can perform. The game is a beat 'em up with elements of a role-playing game. The player controls one character as he engages multiple enemies until reaching the boss of the stage. The character possesses normal techniques and special moves as well as Desperation Moves. The last two cannot be used consecutively as the player is given time to prepare for the next usage of the move. When first playing, the game offers the player a choice of the characters Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard and Ryo Sakazaki. However, upon passing the first stage, the player can select randomly new characters developed by SNK. All characters carry a number of stars depending on how strong they can become and from what title they originate. For example, the first Kyo is his incarnation from The King of Fighters '94 but can be replaced by other incarnations of Kyo who possess more stars. Every time a stage is cleared, the player obtains different types of objects for multiple purposes such as increasing experience and raising stats, as well as rubies to summon more characters or restore their health. The game often offers alternative versions of the characters that can only be obtained through events such as Halloween versions of Yashiro Nanakase or Kula Diamond. Plot =Main Event= The player meets a young woman named Noah who is concerned of his amnesia. Knowing that the player can fight with great skills, Noah invites him to participate into the tournaments \\"The King of Fighters\\" in hopes of regaining his identity when crossing paths with rivals. There are also three other characters overseeing Noah's role but their identities remain in secret: Ryugo, Kaya and Ein. The player is able to alter time across the future due to visions he has, by winning each tournament and defeating foes such as Rugal Bernstein and Goenitz. However, after Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura defeat and seal the demon Orochi, Noah goes missing. In the next tournament, the player meets Kaya who is related to Noah. Kaya guides the player through the 98 fighting competition. Following his fights, the player meets Noah once again who has become distant towards him and claims she is only using him. The player then becomes possessed by Orochi but manages to reach the finals. Noah releases Omega Rugal in the finale where Kaya finds out about what Noah's true mission is and why she became associated with Ryugo. Although the player defeats Omega Rugal, he is unable to follow Noah due to his wounds as she leaves the area. Sometime later, the NESTS saga begins, as the player and Kaya met Leah, who informs them that the letter she was about to send was stolen. They accepted her request to find the letter, and on their way there, they encounter Whip, a mercenary from the Ikari Team. After the fight, Whip gives them the letter, in which it says that the player is invited to participate in a new King of Fighters tournament, where each team will participate with four members, one of which will support a team. Then, they met K' and Maxima, who are the player's teammates, while Kaya will be a support character. Soon after, they participate in the tournament until they reach to the finals, where the player's team are heading to the underground basement to go face to face with Krizalid, a clone of K'. The player and his team defeat Krizalid, but a mysterious voice was heard, and Krizalid was crushed by a rubble. After a sudden fight against Kyo Kusanagi (who was missing sometime after the Orochi saga), the player and Kaya escaped from a collapsing basement, while K' and Maxima suddenly disappeared and found their own way out. One year later, the player and Kaya fought more enemies and found their invitation, but unfortunately, it was all crumpled and they may not be able to participate in another tournament. However, they met Benimaru Nikaido, Kyo's former teammate, and Shingo Yabuki, a fighter who idolizes Kyo, along with their new partners, Agent Seth and Lin of the Hizoku clan, who met each other in some other place. But, after a sudden fight against Lin, Seth was injured by Lin earlier and cannot fight for a while, so with no other option, the player and Kaya join Benimaru's team to participate. Team Benimaru fought their opponents and defeated them team by team, even Iori Yagami who was searching for Kyo. Suddenly, after the fight against Team K', they were ambushed by a mysterious girl with ice powers named Kula Diamond who froze the entire area. After a sudden fight, Kula gets away and Team Benimaru reached to the finals to confront the host of the tournament, Zero, the one who is responsible for infiltrating Heidern's base with a clone of himself under his fake name \\"Ling\\". Although they defeated Zero, he reveals that his plan all along is to kill everyone with his Zero Cannon satellite. However, his plan has been foiled and NESTS aimed the cannon at Zero, obliterating him in a process. Meanwhile, K' remembers who his sister was, and it was revealed that his sister is Whip, right after Zero tells her the truth before he dies. Elsewhere, the player and Kaya are somewhere at the destroyed area, despite what Ein told Kaya not to trust the player. =Epic Quest= After the events from the Orochi saga, Noah reveals her true villainous self and plans to open the Phantom Gate. She then proceeds to possess Blue Mary with a power of envy, revives Rugal with a power of greed, and possesses Chizuru with a power of wrath. However, the player with Kaya herself managed to defeat them and they met Noah again. In a last ditch effort, she creates a cyborg version of Goenitz and adds even more power to him. Eventually, the player destroys Mecha Goenitz, but Noah escaped and met Ryugo again where she introduces him to her new partner named \\"Shine\\". Meanwhile, the player and Kaya encounter Saisyu Kusanagi, who is being controlled by an unknown berserk power. Soon after, the player fights a revived Yashiro Nanakase, now with a new power of the Orochi. But then, after the player defeats him once again, Yashiro informs them that Orochi will soon be released from the seal once again. Later, they fight a revived Chris, and just like last time, Orochi itself has been resurrected with far greater powers. However, using the powers of the three sacred treasures, the player defeats Orochi once more, thus sealing him away. The player and Kaya celebrate their victory as they walk away on sunset. =Crossover with Tekken= A martial artist named Jin Kazama and his antagonistic relatives, Kazuya Mishima and Heihachi Mishima, are invited to Rugal's tournament. Jin takes advantage of the tournament in order to kill both of his relatives and end the war between the generations. Across the tournament, Jin is pursued by the competitors from the King of Fighters tournament who believe that Jin's Devil Gene that causes him to mutate is related to Orochi. As Jin goes through the tournament, he is successful in defeating Heihachi and Kazuya. However, before he is able to kill Kazuya, Rugal interrupts him and fights him. After the final battle, Jin finds himself back in his own original dimension where he receives a letter from his uncle Lars Alexandersson in regards to the chaotic war and that he needs to finish it. Playing the crossover with Iori Yagami results in the character being sought by other people from Tekken who believe he possesses Jin and Kazuya's Devil Gene rather than the Orochi curse known as Riot of the Blood that causes him to go berserker. Seeking to find his rival Kyo, Iori goes through the tournament facing members from Mishima family as well as people related to them. As he is about to kill Jin, Iori finds himself back in his own dimension where Kyo challenges to a fight. =Crossover with Samurai Shodown= A samurai named Haohmaru finds himself in a modern world where he challenges both Choi Bounge and Chang Koehan, while mistaking them for his opponents from his own world, Genan Shiranui and Earthquake. Following their defeat, Haohmaru defeats their mentor Kim Kaphwan who, noticing the potential Haohmaru has and the issues of his own fighting style, requests his enemy to take care of Choi and Chang. Haohmaru accepts and enters into the King of Fighters tournaments to find strong rival, which he later encounters Ukyo Tachibana after the Psycho Soldier team, Charlotte Christine de Colde after the Women Fighters team, and Rimururu after the K' team. While Choi and Chang are relieved that Kim is no longer testing them, they are still scared by Haohmaru and tried to eliminate him. During the tournament, Haohmaru sees Kyo and Iori in a one-on- one fight and learns from his teammates that they are rivals. This reminds the samurai of his own rival, Genjuro Kibagami, whom he fights soon after. Finally, Haohmaru confronts Shiro Tokisada Amakusa, the one responsible for the world crisis. After defeating Amakusa, Haohmaru finds himself back in the modern world and challenged Choi once again. =Crossover with WWE= Three WWE Superstars, Kofi Kingston, Seth Rollins, and Becky Lynch, are invited to a tournament by an unknown figure. Though Kofi knows about the King of Fighters history, Seth and Becky were unsure about participating the tournament, but Geese insists that they should compete. The Superstars then encountered the competitors throughout the tournament, such as the Women Fighters team, the American Sports team, Kim's team, the Art of Fighting team, and the '97 Special Team led by Geese's henchman Billy Kane. After the Superstars defeat the Fatal Fury team, they finally go face to face with Geese Howard. Then, they defeated Geese and won the tournament, as both Kofi and Becky celebrated their victory. However, Seth suddenly disappeared and took out Billy, announcing that he defeated Geese, thus taking over as the new crime lord of South Town. One of the WWE Legends and \\"The People's Champion\\", The Rock, was invited by an unknown figure in the King of Fighters tournament, where his first opponents are Terry Bogard and his pupil, Rock Howard, son of Geese Howard. After defeating them, The Rock encountered the Ikari Team, followed by the Three Sacred Treasures Team and the Orochi team, where Yashiro informed him that the Orochi will soon be resurrected. However, The Rock does not care for any of that stuff as he proceeds to defeat the Orochi team. In the final match, The Rock went face to face with Orochi using Chris as his vessel. However, after he was defeated, Orochi became annoyed with The Rock's ego and decided that he will return to nothingness. The Rock then celebrated his victory by having a feast with Terry and Rock Howard. The next WWE Legend is John Cena, where he was invited by an unknown figure to the tournament. His first match is against Kyo Kusanagi and Shingo Yabuki. After winning, Cena took Shingo as his new pupil for the tournament and encountered his opposing teams such as the Fatal Fury team, the Agent Team with Seth Rollins (whom Shingo thought it was Agent Seth from The King of Fighters 2000), and the Yagami Team. Cena then reached to the final match against the CEO of NESTS and the self-proclaimed \\"God\\", Igniz. After John defeated him, Igniz was about to activate a bomb to blow up his base. However, Shingo managed to get Heidern and all units to deactivate the bomb, foiling Igniz's last ditch effort. Igniz became disappointed, but suddenly, Cena suggested that Igniz should be a pharmacist to make some medicine. After that, Cena went with Kim Kaphwan to the \\"army\\" that he mentioned. In the epilogue, Chang and Choi found a shiny golden urn, unaware of whom does that object belong to. The last of the WWE Legends is the \\"Dead Man Walking\\" himself, The Undertaker, where he was invited by an unknown figure to the tournament. His first match is against Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, who were trying to steal that golden urn. After winning, The Undertaker fought the other teams, such as the American Sports Team, the K' Team, and the Yagami Team, as his opposing teams felt their presence from him when they heard a bell toll sound and saw a mist out of nowhere. He then reached to the final match to go up against Omega Rugal, the real host of the tournament. The Undertaker defeats him, but in a last ditch effort, Rugal activated the self-destruct sequence to blow up his base, and then he disappeared. The Undertaker vows to take Rugal's soul one day the next time they meet each other. One month later, the King of Fighters tournament has been announced, and the American Sports Team are the first team to fight. But suddenly, they felt the presence that is very familiar to them. =Crossover with Gin Tama= An odd-jobs freelancer Gintoki Sakata is hanging out in the Yorozuyan shop with Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura, while they break the fourth wall by noticing that they are in a crossover with The King of Fighters All Star. When suddenly, they've been transported to the world of The King of Fighters, where they meet the player and Noah, and Shinpachi only appeared as a floating pair of glasses. Noah explained to them that what they're holding is an invitation letter to participate in the King of Fighters tournament, and the only way for them to get home is to win. Since Shinpachi can't fight due to being glasses, Gintoki and Kagura team up with the player so they can all participate as a team of three fighters. Meanwhile, somewhere in a city, two of the Shinsengumi Police Force, Toushirou Hijikata and Sougo Okita, have also ended up in the King of Fighters world with the invitation letters, and they believe that the Yorozuyan Gin-chan crew is the one behind all of this, so they split up to find them. Elsewhere, the player, Noah, and the Yorozuyan Gin-chan crew were transported to Kabuki District, but it's not the same Kabuki District the crew knows. Then, Gintoki and the others encountered Kyo Kusanagi and defeated him. Thinking that it's over, Gintoki, Kagura, and Shinpachi bid the player and Noah goodbye. But unfortunately, they ended up in a loophole with them. Noah explained further that they must win the entire tournament in order to go home, not just one match. As they move on, they encountered an unknown person in a white penguin sheet wearing the costume of Terry Bogard. It was then revealed that the one they encountered was Elizabeth, although Shinpachi pointed out that it's a fake Elizabeth, and Noah wonders what does the real Elizabeth looks like. Then, they fought another fake Elizabeth, and this time he was wearing the costume of Mr. Big. After that, they encountered Hijikata, whom Gintoki recognize his obsession with mayonnaise. Hijikata thinks Gintoki and his friends are the culprits who are causing trouble, so the crew was left with no choice but to defeat him, while being transported to another location. After they beat Hijikata, Gintoki explained to Noah about Elizabeth. Elizabeth is a pet that belongs to Kotaro Katsura and he only communicates with other people with his picket signs because he can't talk. As Gintoki and Kagura were yelling their made-up special moves (and insulting Shinpachi), they fought another Terizabeth. Afterwards, Gintoki complained that they were figting a lot of men and not a single woman, but Noah tells them that there are women participating in the tournament. As they were transported back to the false Kabuki District, they encountered Mai Shiranui, whom Gintoki and Shinpachi are both attracted to her, until Kagura kicks Gintoki when she became annoyed with jealousy. After they win another match, they saw the real Elizabeth filming them with a camera for some reason. They tried to catch him, but he quickly got away as Gintoki and Kagura end up on the trash cans. Later, Shinpachi gets insulted about being a pair of glasses and doing nothing at all, and after being called \\"useless\\", he cries and runs away (or in this case \\"floats away\\"), although he quickly got back soon after they defeat yet another Terizabeth. Gintoki and the others then encountered Isao Kondou, commander of the Shinsengumi Police Force and the \\"gorilla\\" whom they explained that to the player and Noah earlier. They called him a \\"gorilla\\" because he was being a pervert who is in love with Tae Shimura, Shinpachi's sister. Nevertheless, Kondou is a formidable swordfighter who never backs down from a fight. Gintoki and his team began to fight Kondou and defeated him, while ending up on yet another location. As they didn't notice Elizabeth filming them again, Gintoki decides that he should stop searching for Elizabeth and that he would rather stay in the KOF world than going back to the real Kabuki District. However, Kagura and Noah point out that they don't sell the Jump magazines in the KOF world, because those magazines don't exist. This irritates Gintoki as he changes his mind and continues the search for Elizabeth while fighting and defeating another Mr. Zabeth. The player has a plan to lure Elizabeth out, and that plan is to fight the Shinsengumi as he films that fight, so they can capture him. Gintoki and the others follow through the player's plan as they encounter the remaining member of the Shinsengumi, Okita. The crew explained to the player and Noah that Okita is a foulmouth and a sadist who tortures anyone with a whip and he frequently uses a bazooka. This scares Noah as she hid behind Gintoki. Nonetheless, Okita is the best swordfighter and he shows them no mercy. The fight began and, while being transported yet again to yet another location as Gintoki expected, they defeated Okita. The plan to lure Elizabeth out worked as they trapped him to a dead end. He explained to them that he was filming the fights to produce a sequel to an action film, which the crew find that hard to believe. But before they take the camera from him, a swordsman with an eyepatch suddenly stops them. The crew knows who he is, his name is Shinsuke Takasugi, one of the Kiheitai, and he's the most dangerous swordsman they have ever encountered. Takasugi explained to Gintoki that the real reason why they ended up in the KOF world is because of the cursed camera Elizabeth was holding. As they were all transported to a final area, the final battle between Gintoki and Takasugi has begun. It was a tough battle, but with the help of Kagura and the player, Gintoki defeated Takasugi. As they celebrated their victory, the Shinsengumi arrived to find out what's going on, but Shinpachi breaks the fight between the Yorozuya Gin-chan and the Shinsengumi by explaining to them that the real culprit is Elizabeth and the cursed camera. However, Elizabeth claimed that he's not really Elizabeth, he's the director of an action film, and thanks to them, he can make a sequel. But, Shinpachi gets angry at him when he finally figures out that he is a pair of glasses because Elizabeth made his real body disappear. The Yorozuya Gin-chan and the Shinsengumi then beat up Elizabeth and break the camera, thus breaking the curse. As their bodies become transparent, Gintoki, Kagura, and Shinpachi are finally going back home where they belong. With the last fist bump between the player and Gintoki, the cast of Gin Tama vanished. In the epilogue, Shinpachi and Kagura woke Gintoki up, but when Gintoki explained to them that they were at the KOF world with the player, they didn't believe him and said that he was just being drunk last night. Gintoki soon believes that this entire collaboration event was all a dream, or so he thought, because right under him, he was holding the KOF invitation letter. But before the story ends, Shinpachi complained and asked why he was never put on screen, which Gintoki and Kagura claimed that the creators of this game don't have enough money to reveal him, so they cut him out. Shinpachi ends on a note that he will never work with Netmarble ever again. In the sequel, Gintoki is snoring in the Yorozuyan shop, as he dreamed about himself as his \\"White Yaksha\\" form, fighting against an army of robots. When suddenly, Gintoki woke up as he was being crushed by two people who fell from the sky and made a huge hole in a ceiling: The player and Kaya. Gintoki then read the KOF invitation letter, which says that they are invited to participate in the KOF tournament as a team of 3 fighters, and the winning team will have a pork cutlets party. Gintoki is uninterested to participate at first, but after Kagura convinced him that she wanted to eat the pork cutlets, he was then forced to participate, forming a team of Gintoki, Kagura, and the player once again. The host of the tournament has a name that starts with a \\"K\\", and they wonder who is that host. Then, as the landlord heard the noise and bangs the door, Gintoki and the others make a quick getaway from being scolded. As they arrived at Kabuki District, Kaya gets freaked out when Shinpachi became a pair of glasses once again. Shinpachi then asks the player what happened between him and Noah, in which the player explained that she betrayed him and that Kaya is his partner from now on. Then, Kagura suspects that Kaya is the host whose name starts with a \\"K\\", although Shinpachi stops Kagura from blaming someone. Suddenly, Jhun Hoon appeared in front of the crew, along with Kim Kaphwan and Chang Koehan. Kaya claims that Kim is the host whose name starts with a \\"K\\", and after Chang steals a pickled seaweed from Kagura, Gintoki and his team start fighting against Team Kim. After winning the fight, Gintoki asks Kim if he is the host, but Kim makes a rebuttal by saying that he is not the host, he was only there to participate with his team. Meanwhile, Choi Bounge was wandering around the street, being separated from his teammates, until the Shinsengumi appeared and captured him. Later that night, Gintoki complained that it is no fun fighting against men and he demands the producers to bring back a certain bombshell kunoichi for fan service. Speaking of which, Mai Shiranui appeared, along with Yuri Sakazaki and King, whom Kaya claims that King is the host whose name starts with a \\"K\\". Gintoki and his team fight against Team Women Fighters and ended up winning as Kagura made her finishing blow to rip off the clothes from Yuri and King, for fan service, and even Shinpachi was nose bleeding despite only being glasses. As they went to a rooftop, the player, Kaya, and the Yorozuya Gin-chan encounter a trouble- making robot named \\"Stein\\", who was responsible for turning men into women, with Chang as an example of that. After they defeated an army of robots, Stein gets away, but Gintoki remembers that he saw it in his dream when Stein was with Elizabeth and that unknown swordsman. and that Stein may be involved with the host of this tournament. The next day, they encountered someone familiar to the crew, and they tell the player and Kaya that his name is \\"Zura\\", although Zura claims that it is not his real name. Suddenly, Gintoki and the rest were ambushed by the Shinsengumi, but fortunately, they managed to fight them off and they managed to escape. Then, they claim that the host of the tournament might be Kondou, whose name also starts with a \\"K\\". Later, they once again encountered Kondou, Hijikata, and Okita, and they witnessed that Joe Higashi and Choi are both in chains. Kondou and Hijikata framed Joe and Choi for being part of the Jouishishi, and as Kaya tries to prove them wrong, the both of them became too stubborn to admit they are wrong, which Okita finds it amusing. After Gintoki and Kagura insulted them, the battle between the Yorozuya Gin-chan and the Shinsengumi has begun. The Yorozuya Gin-chan won the fight, and after freeing Joe and Choi, they started taunting the unconscious Shinsengumi, which Kagura now regrets freeing them both. Back to the Kabuki District, while the crew were complaining about the progression of this story, they encountered Kula Diamond, Maxima, and K'. Kagura lured Kula out with a pickled seaweed, which Kula likes her snack. As Kaya claims that K' is the host whose name starts with a \\"K\\", the crew fought and defeated Team K'. After that, while Kagura introduces Kula her pet Sadaharu, Maxima informs Gintoki that K' is not the host, as Team K' were only on a mission to find the Amanto's spaceship and go to space to arrive at Rakuyou. Team K' decided to help the crew go to Rakuyou in order to find the host. After arriving at Rakuyou, they encountered Kamui, a member of the Yato tribe and Kagura's brother. Kagura knows his brother well, she does not believe that he is the host whose name starts with a \\"K\\", and his smile rubs them the wrong way. After they fight him, Kamui got up like it was nothing, not a scratch on him, knowing that Kamui is the most dangerous man they have ever faced. But then, Gintoki encountered Takasugi again, and Takasugi was about to kidnap Kaya to bring her to Stein in order to re-write the world. Kamui stops Takasugi and claims that Gintoki and the player are his prey, but Takasugi is not looking for a fight, so they teamed up to fight Gintoki and the player. Thankfully, Gintoki and the player barely made it out alive as they defeated Kamui and Takasugi. Unfortunately, the crew were all disappointed that there is no one left whose name starts with a \\"K\\" after defeating the final boss. Suddenly, Zura returned, and he corrected them all that his real name is Kotarou Katsura, thus revealing himself as the real host of the tournament whose name starts with a \\"K\\". Then, Stein appeared again, being in cahoots with Katsura. After Gintoki breaks the fourth wall by bringing up the previous collaboration, the WWE, Elizabeth appeared right next to Katsura, and Katsura calls him by his new name \\"Neo Elizabeth\\". Katsura then tells Gintoki that he and Elizabeth want their revenge for not appearing in this collaboration 2 years ago, as the real final battle begins. In the end, Gintoki and his friends defeated Katsura and Elizabeth, while the player and Kaya have finally apprehended Stein. With their mission accomplished, the player and Kaya are bidding the Yorozuya Gin-chan crew farewell, hoping that they will meet again, even though Jinpachi will never get his body back. However, right behind the crew, there is Katsura's bomb placed behind them that is about to explode. In the epilogue, the entire story reveals that Jinpachi was playing this game on his smartphone, until it explodes and breaks a hole on a ceiling, again, causing the landlord to rush in and scold the crew. In the post credit, the player and Kaya went back to their own world with Stein. However, Stein woke up and faked its apprehension. And then, Stein got away, forcing the player and Kaya to go after it and going back to square one. Development and promotion The game was first announced in Chokaigi 2017 where the developers stated they would bring the franchise composed of fighting games to role- playing games. The first teaser was released in May 2018. Global version manager Ying Chen states that the developers aimed for players to make their own types of teams per preference. In regards to the timing between the original Eastern and Western versions, Chen said that the developers wanted Westerns to receive the same treatment. SNK wanted to create a mobile game offering fun of control. They focused on letting our players to enjoy multiple combination and powerful sense of hitting through simple moves. The cards were added in order to provide a sort of strategic feeling. It was developed be appealed by a wide range of players. In order to make the game stand within other mobile phone games, the team added multiplayer options, something rare in the market. SNK stated that Netmarble already had a large experience within mobile phone games worldwidely and wanted them to continue with this tradition. The translation from the fighting game system to a side-scrolling game was felt be well executed by the developers. The game was created with the Unity engine with SNK wishing to create appealing graphics in the process. While the game offers the player the idea of buying different features, the company wanted to still give them freedom in regards to what they could do. The development team worked to make everything seem unique, that the basic attacks seem like signature moves. Writer Akihiko Ureshino stated SNK will not use characters from the EX spin-off games from the Game Boy Advance and instead Maximum Impact characters from the PlayStation 2 as the former were noted to be less popular than the latter. All Star has made crossovers with other series. One is Samurai Shodown, another franchise by SNK involving Haohmaru, Genjuro Kibagami, Ukyo Tachibana, Charlotte Christine de Cold, Rimururu and Shiro Tokisada Amakusa. In promoting the cellphone game, Kyo was portrayed by Yuichi Nakamura for a commercial alongside Hiroshi Fujioka as Haohmaru. Nakamura reflects enjoying this work due to admiring his superiors, most notably Fujioka. The next one is Hideaki Sorachi's manga series Gin Tama in October 2018. For this promotion, the characters of Gintoki Sakata, Kagura, Shinsuke Takasugi, Isao Kondo, Sougo Okita, Toshiro Hijikata appeared as guest characters. The Gin Tama collaboration made its return on July 2020, making its debut on the Global version, with four more characters from Gin Tama being added: Gintoki Sakata in his \\"White Yaksha\\" form, Kamui, Kotarou Katsura, and Elizabeth. In July 2019, Jin Kazama, Heihachi Mishima and Kazuya Mishima from Bandai Namco's Tekken series were revealed to be playable characters in the game. More characters from Tekken were revealed and made their debut in November 2019 including Armor King II, Paul Phoenix and Ling Xiaoyu. In May 2020, Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson, The Undertaker, John Cena, Seth Rollins, Kofi Kingston, and Becky Lynch from WWE were revealed to be playable characters in the game. Shin Hwa Cho from Netmarble expressed excitement in regards to this collaboration as it would appeal to newcomers to the series. Brian Flinn from WWE shared similar feelings as it would popularize the wrestlers throughout the game. Reception All Star got a 16 out of 20 by Jeux Video. Multiplayer scored it a 7.3 out of 10. Kotaku praised the presentation and gameplay but noted that the usage of microtransactions might leave players with mixed thoughts in regards to the need of collecting as many fighters they want. All Star also made it to Apple's Best of 2019.

It is native to Asia, but has been established as an invasive species in the United States since 1999. Description Cnestus mutilatus adult females are mainly black in color, and are large and robust compared to most ambrosia beetles, ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 mm in length, and about 1.7 times longer than wide. This makes C. mutilatus the largest ambrosia beetle species found in North America. Their body shape is also distinctive compared to most ambrosia beetles, with an abdomen that is shorter than the head and thorax, and a sharp slope to the posterior end that gives them a severed or \\"squished\\" appearance. Adult male beetles are smaller, and flightless. Distribution Cnestus mutilatus is native the Asia, where it is known from Burma, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Guinea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. In 1999, it was collected in traps in Mississippi (USA), and subsequent survey work found it to be widely established there. It has since spread throughout much of the eastern United States, from Florida north to Pennsylvania, and west to Illinois and Texas. Ecology and Behavior Like other ambrosia beetles, Cnestus mutilatus carries a symbiotic species of fungus that it introduces into the host plant, and which serves as the primary food source for the adult beetles and larvae; the ambrosia fungus associated with C. mutilatus is Ambrosiella beaveri. The female beetle tunnels directly through the bark and into the wood of the host tree's branches, attacking stems that are relatively small (typically 1 to 5 cm in diameter), and entering through circular holes that are about 2 mm in diameter. Their galleries (tunnels) typically extend horizontally into the stem for a short distance, before branching into long (up to 3.8 cm) vertical tunnels. Damage to Fuel Containers Cnestus mutilatus has been documented as damaging vessels and lines containing gasoline fuel, such as plastic fuel storage containers, lawnmower components, and boat fuel lines. They tunnel in through the plastic, creating small (~2 mm), circular entrance holes. This \\"accidental\\" damage (which often results in the death of the beetle) is apparently due to the fact that standard gasoline fuel in the United States contains up to 10% ethanol, which is a primary attractant of C. mutilatus, as a chemical released by stressed host trees.

While simple horizontal split or vertical split resembles a presentation technique used in movies and on televisionTV Sports: here it is not merely done in order to allow the simultaneous presentation of (usually) related graphical and textual information on a computer display. Various methods to display multiple signals on a 4:3 screen: 1+3, 3+1 (1:1), 2√ó2, 3√ó3, 4√ó4 (4:3), 1+1 (2:3 vertical, 8:3 horizontal), 4√ó3 (1:1), 1 in 12 (4:3). Editors Having two or more source files on the screen allows both for maintaining related program modules but also for looking up documentation for the programming language being used. Among the early editors supporting split screen were Brief (text editor) and EMACS. Screen management The original non-dynamic split screens differed from windowing systems in that the latter always allowed overlapping and freely movable parts of the screen (the \\"windows\\") to present related as well as unrelated application data to the user, while the former were strictly limited to fixed non-overlapping positions. Computer terminals such as the DEC VT52 and VT100 had a split-screen: the last line was reserved for status information or error messages. In contrast to the above fixed position split screens, Windows Explorer has a mix of (relatively) fixed (Toolbar) and variable display sections. Other uses The split screen technique can also be used to run two instances of an application, possibly with another user interacting with the other instance. Developers, when given more than one screen, can overcome the limitations of split screen, particularly when not having to worry about the \\"focus\\" while typing commands. They also save time since they \\"don‚Äôt have to toggle back and forth.\\" One screen can be dedicated for testing the application being developed. Sales data showed 49 million more monitors than machines sold in 2011, and a major manufacturer noted that more than 30% of corporate purchases were multi-screen configurations.

Route U4 operates out of Southern Avenue division during the weekdays and Bladensburg division during the weekends. The route mostly utilizes the 2012 Orion VII BRTs (3041-3044) out of Southern Avenue and 2006 30 ft Orion VII CNGs during the weekends but also regularly uses the XN40s based out of Bladensburg. History U4 originally operated as part of the \\"Sheriff Road-River Terrace\\" streetcar line, between the Deanwood & River Terrace neighborhoods of Northeast Washington D.C. The U4 streetcar line was later replaced by buses during the 1950s and eventually became a WMATA Metrobus Route on February 4, 1973 when WMATA acquired all four bus companies that operated throughout the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area and merged them all together to form its own, \\"Metrobus\\" System. U4 kept operating on the same exact streetcar routing it had been operating on since 1949, even after becoming a WMATA Metrobus Route. =1978 Changes= On December 3, 1978, U4 went through a minor rerouting change to divert into/serve the newly opened Minnesota Avenue station. The rest of U4's routing remained the exact same. The line was named the Minnesota Avenue Shuttle. =1984 Changes= On January 22, 1984, route U4 was rerouted to operate between Sheriff Road and Capitol View passing Minnesota Avenue station in both directions. =Proposed Changes= In 2014, WMATA announced a series of proposals for route U4 that will be implemented in June 2015 if it was approved by the Metro Board. It went as the following: * Route U4: Daily service at all times between River Terrace and Deanwood Station via the current route between River Terrace and Minnesota Avenue station, then via the current route of V7 and V8 from Minnesota Avenue Station to Deanwood station. * Route U4 would no longer serve the portion of the current route between Minnesota Avenue Station and Sheriff Road. * New Route U7 would serve the portion of the current route between Minnesota Avenue Station and Sheriff Road. This rerouting was to create a better balance of capacity and demand on lines serving the Minnesota Avenue station. Incidents * On September 5, 2017, a passenger was arrested after he spat on a U4 bus driver along Minnesota Avenue. The driver was taken to a hospital.

A split screen is a display technique in computer graphics that consists of dividing graphics and/or text into adjacent (and possibly overlapping) parts, typically as two or four rectangular areas. This is done to allow the simultaneous presentation of (usually) related graphical and textual information on a computer display. TV Sports used this presentation methodology in the 1960s for instant replay. The original non- dynamic split screens differed from windowing systems in that the latter always allowed overlapping and freely movable parts of the screen (the \\"windows\\") to present related as well as unrelated application data to the user, while the former were strictly limited to fixed non-overlapping positions. The split screen technique can also be used to run two instances of an application, possibly with another user interacting with the other instance. In Video Games The split screen feature is commonly used in non- networked, also known as couch co-op, video games with multiplayer options. In its most easily understood form, a split screen for a two-player video game is an audiovisual output device (usually a standard television for video game consoles) where the display has been divided into two equally sized areas so that the players can explore different areas simultaneously without being close to each other. This has historically been remarkably popular on consoles, which until the 2000s did not have access to the Internet or any other network and is less common today with modern support for online console- to-console multiplayer support. Split screen is useful for people who want to play with other players, but with only one console. In recent years, split screen hasn't been used very often because the new frontier of video games is playing with other players online, without screen sharing.  History  Split screen gaming dates back to at least the 1970s, with games such Drag Race (1977) from Kee Games in the arcades being presented in this format. It has always been a common feature of two or more player home console and computer games too, with notable titles being Kikstart II for 8-bit systems, a number of driving and racing games (such as Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge and Road Rash II on 16-bit systems), and Lemmings on 16-bit systems all employing a vertical or horizontal screen split for two player games. Xenophobe is notable as a three-way split screen arcade title, although on home platforms it was reduced to one or two screens. The addition of four controller ports on home consoles also ushered in more four-way split screen games, with Mario Kart 64 and Goldeneye 007 on the Nintendo 64 being two well known examples. In arcades, machines tended to move towards having a whole screen for each player, or multiple connected machines, for multiplayer. On home machines, especially in the first and third person shooter genres, multiplayer is now more common over a network or the internet rather than locally with split screen. Advantages and disadvantages =Advantages= *Users can see where the other players are while playing co-op *Users can communicate with the players who are near them *Only one console needed *Only one copy of the game needed *No need for internet access or to pay for an internet subscription service *Wider FOV in some cases *No internet connection problems or connection lag *Equal chances of winning for all players as everyone is using the same hardware and software (excluding controllers) =Disadvantages= *Smaller screens *When playing against each other, players can cheat by looking at the other players' screens, also called 'screen-cheating' or 'screen-peeking' *Rendering more screens taxes the hardware, often reducing frame rate or graphical detail *More distraction, especially from game sounds *Lower active resolution for each player *Some games enable interlacing when playing in co-op mode, with the intention of achieving a higher overall spatial resolution, but this can cause distractive flickering on CRT screens or additional input lag on LCD screens due to enabling the screens internal deinterlacing chip See also * Screen tearing * Split screen (video production) References Category:Computer graphics Category:User interface techniques ","title":"Split screen (video games)"},{"id":"62309008","text":"Ann Walker (20 May 1803 ‚Äì 25 February 1854) was an English landowner from West Riding of Yorkshire. She and her partner Anne Lister were the first known women to have a same-sex wedding ceremony, without legal recognition, at Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York in 1834. Early life Ann Walker was born on 20 May 1803 in Lightcliffe, West Riding of Yorkshire to John and Mary Walker (n√©e Edwards). She was baptised 1 July 1803 at Old St Matthew's Church, Lightcliffe and lived her early years at Cliffe Hill with her parents, older sisters Mary and Elizabeth, and younger brother John, until her family moved to Crow Nest when she was six years old. Ann's sister Mary died 1 February 1815. Ann was 19 when her father died on 22 April 1823, and her mother died later that same year on 3 November 1823, when Ann was 20. Ann's brother John inherited Crow Nest, the family's estate. In early November 1828, Ann's sister Elizabeth married Captain George Mackay Sutherland and moved to Ayrshire. Subsequently, after the death of their younger brother John while on his honeymoon in Naples, Italy in 1830, Ann and her sister Elizabeth became sole inheritors of the Crow Nest Estate, offering significant wealth. Ann continued to live at Crow Nest through her 20s, until 1831, when she moved into Lidgate, a smaller home on the estate. It was at Lidgate that Anne Lister began to court Ann after a re-acquaintance on 6 July 1832. Marriage Walker and Lister became neighbours when Lister moved to Shibden Hall in 1815, but met only occasionally. It wasn't until 1832 that the pair became involved in a romantic and sexual relationship. Their relationship intensified over the next few months. Walker and Lister exchanged vows on 10 February 1834, the date they considered their union official, and exchanged rings on 27 February 1834 as a symbol of their commitment to one another. They took communion together in Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York on Easter Sunday (30 March) in 1834 to seal their union, considering themselves married. The building now displays a commemorative rainbow plaque. Walker gave up her family home to be with Lister and moved to Shibden Hall, Lister's ancestral home, about September 1834. The couple travelled widely together until Lister's death, age 49, in Georgia in 1840. Walker had Lister's body embalmed and shipped, six months by land and sea, back to England so that Lister could be interred in the same church as her beloved aunt and uncle in Halifax. Lister's will gave Walker a life interest in Shibden Hall and its estate. Faith and philanthropy Walker's Anglican faith was important to her, as were her philanthropic endeavours. She worshipped regularly at St Matthew's Church in Lightcliffe throughout her life, and read prayers and scripture to her family and servants on Sundays. Walker was fond of children and created her own Sunday school. She took great care of her servants and tenants, as is evidenced by letters written back home while she was travelling abroad in 1839‚Äì1840, where she lists out the gifts that each of them should be given for Christmas in her absence.Letter from Ann Walker to Booth, 17 December 1840. Stored at West Yorkshire Archives, ref: SH:7/LL/406. Transcribed by Anne Choma July 2019. Mental health Walker struggled with mental health issues throughout her life. She was prone to bouts of anxiety and depression, which appeared in part to be linked to her religious faith. Walker struggled to accept her own sexuality, which put additional strain on her mental health as well as her relationship with Lister. On 1 November 1832, Walker faced a difficult decision to choose to be with Lister or accept a traditional marriage with a man: In 1843, three years after the death of Lister, Walker was declared to be of 'unsound mind' and removed from Shibden Hall and treated by Dr. Steph Belcombe in York. She returned to Shibden Hall after a brief stay under Dr. Belcombe's care and later moved back to her family's estate in Lightcliffe, living at Cliffe Hill until her death in 1854. Death Old St Matthew's Church, where Ann Walker's brass memorial plaque now hangs. Walker died on 25 February 1854, aged 50. As per her death certificate, her cause of death is recorded as 'congestion of the brain, effusion'. She was buried on 3 March 1854 under the reading pulpit of the Old St Matthew's Church, Lightcliffe. Ann's parents John (d. 22 April 1823) and Mary (d. 3 November 1823), siblings William (d. 26 April 1798) and Mary (d. 1 February 1815), niece Mary Sutherland (d. 16 June 1845), as well as her aunt Ann Walker (d. 29 October 1847), are buried in the Old St Matthew's Churchyard. The Old St Matthew's Church was demolished by the church authorities in 1974, although the tower still remains, and Ann's original brass memorial plaque now hangs in the tower of the Old St Matthew's Church. A special viewing of the brass memorial plaque took place on Saturday, 14 September 2019 when the tower was opened to the public for the first time since its closure in the 1970s. Ann's brother John (d. 19 January 1830) died in Naples on his honeymoon, nephews John Walker Sutherland (d. 1836) and George Sackville Sutherland (d. 1843) died in Scotland, and sister Elizabeth (d. 1844) died in London. Legacy No known portraits of Walker exist, but a few of her letters are held in the West Yorkshire Archives. It's known that Walker kept a journal, yet none have ever been found. Much of what is known about Walker comes from the journals of Lister, who kept detailed diaries throughout her adult life. Walker's legacy lives on today. Her courage, resolve and mental health struggles have inspired many. Popular culture Gentleman Jack is a historical drama television series created by Sally Wainwright, co-produced by HBO and Lookout Point (for the BBC), and starring Suranne Jones as landowner and industrialist Anne Lister and Sophie Rundle as wealthy neighbouring heiress Ann Walker. The series begins in 1832 in Halifax, West Yorkshire and is based on the collected diaries of Lister, which contain over five million words, one-sixth of which are written in code. Series one premiered on 22 April 2019 in the United States, and on 19 May 2019 in the United Kingdom. It was renewed for a second series by BBC One on 23 May 2019. Penguin Books published a companion volume to the series Gentleman Jack: The Real Anne Lister by the series' senior consultant, Anne Choma, which includes newly transcribed and decoded entries from Lister's diaries. The drama's end credits acknowledge that it was \\"inspired by the books Female Fortune and Nature's Domain\\" by Jill Liddington, who acted as consultant and whose own website summarises Lister's extraordinary life as \\"dazzling worldly achievements plus unbuttoned lesbian affairs.\\" O'Hooley & Tidow's song \\"Gentleman Jack\\" serves as the series' primary theme music.

Innovation through intercultural and interdisciplinary cooperation is the main focus of his work.  Biography  Rendel studied industrial design at the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences (h_da), Germany, and communication design at Art Center College in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland. During his studies he worked in the design studios of Aldo Cibic (Milan), Matteo Thun (Milan) and Dieter Sieger (Harkotten Castle, Sassenberg). His final work, a water-closet, attracted a great deal of media interest after AP photographer Karsten Thielker became aware of the project during a private stay in Darmstadt in 1992 and had the photos distributed via Associated Press. TV presenter Roger Willemsen then invited Rendel to his talk show \\"0137\\" Roger Willemsen interviewing Martin Rendel broadcast 20 February 1993 while Sueddeutsche Zeitung celebrated the work as a \\"cultural revolution\\".published 6 February 1993 Testing the \\"K26 Film Award\\" with Ai Weiwei, 2015 As winner of an international design competition, Rendel was invited to France after his studies on a Moulinex scholarship, which led to an encounter with the architect Isabelle Galzin. Both opened a studio for design and communication, first in Hamburg (1994) and then in Paris (1996). They collaborated with Federico Restrepo and clients such as Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci Parfum, Fred Joaillier and others. From 1996 to 1999, Rendel was also involved as Art Director in an art project on rails initiated by the Italian sculptor Gianpaolo d'Andrea Moravecchia and the Amsterdam artists' association \\"Stichting de Blinde Schilders\\", which took a train as a rolling exhibition through Europe (Denmark, Greece, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Poland and Holland). \\"Beyond Bauhaus\\" lecture at the Beijing Institute of Technology Zhuhai 2019 Opening of \\"Invisible Things\\" at TCDC Museum Bangkok with the German Ambassador to Thailand Georg Schmidt, 2019 In 1998 Rendel founded the advertising agency rendel & spitz together with the communications consultant Ren√© Spitz, which in 2006 became a consultancy for strategic brand management. From 2001 to 2006, the office building (architects: b&k;\\\\+ / Arno Brandlhuber, Bernd Kniess), Cologne's narrowest building on Eigelstein 115, offered space for installations during the Cologne furniture fair IMM as part of the so- called Passagen programme. Designers and architects like Konstantin Grcic (Munich), Johanna Grawunder (San Francisco), Timo Salli (Helsinki), Ross Lovegrove (London), Greg Lynn (Los Angeles), Tokujin Yoshioka (Tokyo), Andrea Branzi (Milan), Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec (Paris) and Stefan Ytterborn (Stockholm) took part in this programme. The Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich has included Greg Lynn's spatial sculpture from the 2002 installation in its permanent collection. From 2008 to 2014, together with Spitz, he was curating exhibitions at Haus der Gegenwart (Munich), Neues Museum (Nuremberg), Museum of Applied Arts (Cologne), Dortmunder U, Museum of Ethnology (Hamburg) and Today Art Museum (Beijing). Exhibitions followed under his own direction in Shanghai, Tianjin, Tianshui, Chiang Mai and Bangkok. In 2015 Rendel and the Chinese artist Li Xue founded the art association K29 in D√ºsseldorf, which advocated freedom of expression in art. Personal differences in the founding phase led to the refounding under the name K26. One of K26's first major projects in the same year was the performance of the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF) during Filmfest Hamburg, which director Albert Wiederspiel made possible as a festival within the festival. The project found renowned supporters such as Alexander Kluge, Michael Kahn-Ackermann and Ai Wei Wei. However, it created diplomatic tensions between Germany and China. The Chinese festival director Li Xianting and his team had to be uninvited and the cooperation ended with immediate effect. The festival nevertheless took place and the winners of the \\"K26 Film Award\\" K26 Film Award for Independent Film received their prizes at the opening ceremony in Hamburg. Since then the activities of K26 focus on the field of photography.Ziehn, Sascha (5 January 2016). Radio interview with Martin Rendel. WDR 3 Resonanzen. At the end of 2018, there was cooperation with Germany - Land of Ideas, a joint initiative of the Federal Government and German industry, represented by the Federation of German Industries (BDI). As part of the international Beyond Bauhaus - Prototyping the Future competition, Rendel initiated a cooperation with the Zhuhai campus of Beijing Institute of Technology, which co-organized the competition in the People's Republic of China. This was followed by a guest professorship and the appointment as honorary professor (Prof. h.c. P.R. of China). The managing director of \\"Germany - Land of Ideas\\", Ute E. Weiland, appointed Rendel as Ambassador to \\"Germany - Land of Ideas\\" in China. In addition to Zhuhai, Rendel has also been a visiting professor at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang in Bangkok since 2019. Numerous guest lectures and lectures have led him to Peter Behrens School of Arts (D√ºsseldorf), Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts (Tianjin), Communication University of China (Beijing), Sichuan Fine Arts Institute (Chongqing), RFH University of Applied Sciences (Cologne), College of Arts, Media and Technology (Chiang Mai).

The animation is broadcast at 11.00am and lasts the duration of the traditional two-minute silence. The film sees World War I as experienced by a group of animals living in a battlefield. As their peaceful wildflower meadow is interrupted by the outbreak of war, a rabbit, bird and snail take shelter underneath a Brodie helmet. At the end of the conflict, a single poppy blooms in the battlefield and is soon joined by hundreds more. The battlefield returns to meadow, and the rabbit and family gather together in peace. The development of the film was instigated by a letter from a viewer to the BBC scheduling department which generated an internal discussion about how to mark Remembrance week in an age-appropriate way, while introducing the concepts of the poppy and what it symbolises. The Executive Producer of the animation, Jackie Edwards, noted: > War is a very tricky issue to cover for even the upper end of CBBC but an > almost impossible thing to cover for the other end of CBeebies, so we were > looking to emote the feelings of war rather than do a graphic visual > depiction of war. The animated animals were made using traditional hand-drawn techniques, with a watercolour tone palette used for backgrounds. Impressionistic shell bursts in the sky were created by overlaying the spread of Indian ink droplets in water. The director was Simon Partington and designer was Rachel Tudor Best at Flix Facilities. The animation features a full orchestral score by Steven Price performed by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The composer was involved from the beginning of the process, and the animation was created to fit his music. The film was first broadcast on 9 November 2014 and has been broadcast every year since. It is also used by schools to introduce children to the subject of remembrance. The two minute duration was intentional, with the producer noting that the film's intention \\"is to engage even our youngest viewers to quietly focus for two minutes, while older viewers will be more aware of the context and deeper meaning of the film.\\" It was nominated for a BAFTA for best Children's Short Form in 2015.

His father was a printer who twice became SPD Prime Minister of Anhalt during the Weimar years.Anthony James Nicholls, Freedom with Responsibility: The Social Market Economy in Germany, 1918-1963 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000), pp. 369‚Äì370. Heinrich Deist entered the Prussian civil service and reached the position of Regierungsrat by the time Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in 1933. He was subsequently dismissed, whereupon he worked for his wife's stationery company. He then qualified as an auditor, working freelance until the end of the Second World War. He also earned a doctorate in political science from Cologne University. After the end of the war, Deist was appointed the trade union representative on the supervisory board that controlled the German iron and steel industries. He was also a trade union representative on the mining industry board before he was elected to the Bundesrat in 1953. He became the SPD's primary economic expert and his aim was to move the SPD away from wholesale nationalisation and class- war attacks on private property. At the SPD's 1958 Stuttgart conference Deist put forward his plan for freiheitliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft (freedom-loving organisation of the economy). Similar to the concept of the social market economy, this proposal included indirect controls of budgetary planning and has been called \\"a market economy of the left\\". It was passed by a huge majority of delegates.Nicholls, p. 383. In a speech to the conference, Deist said: > We should not give ourselves up to the illusion that through transfer into > public ownership the problem of dependence and bondage of the worker in the > factories is already solved. ... And if we ask our English comrades how the > worker problem and codetermination of the worker in the nationalised > industries has worked out, then we will hear from them that his problem is > not solved through nationalisation alone.Harold Kent Schellenger, The SPD in > the Bonn Republic: A Socialist Party Modernizes (Springer, 2012), p. 99. Deist was the principal author of the SPD's 1959 Godesberg Program, which committed the party to welfare capitalism in place of its traditional Marxism.Carl Cavanagh Hodge, 'The Long Fifties: The Politics of Socialist Programmatic Revision in Britain, France and Germany', Contemporary European History, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Mar., 1993), p. 24. Deist explained in the Neue Gesellschaft that the experience of Communism and Fascism had taught the SPD the dangers of a huge state bureaucracy. Public controls and the distribution of economic power were preferable to socialisation: \\"A free order demands variety in every respect. Its decisive criteria are therefore pluralism, decentralisation, autonomy\\".Heinrich Deist, 'Gemeineigentum in der freiheitlichen geordneten Wirtschaft', Neue Gesellschaft, 6 (September‚ÄìOctober 1959), p. 356, quoted in H.

Ige and the Department of Transportation issued a press release informing the public of upcoming closure of Mauna Kea access road beginning July 15 in order to move large construction equipment to the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) construction site. In response, the Royal Order of Kamehameha, along with Mauna Kea protectors on July 13, 2019, began the process of designating Pu ªuhuluhulu as a pu ªuhonua which, historically, has served as a space of protection during contentious times. The Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu boundaries were secured through ceremony and the approval of the Royal Order of Kamehameha, establishing a site of protection, sanctuary and refuge for Mauna Kea protectors have staked off 5 acres around Puuhuluhulu. Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu sits directly across from the Mauna Kea access road, Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu have access to food, medical supplies, education, cultural practices and ceremony.  Governance and Code of Conduct  Kapu Aloha is the governance model for Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu. Under Kapua aloha there is a subset of rules that include: # Kapu Aloha always # NO weapons, NO smoking of any kind and NO alcohol. # MƒÄLAMA each other. # Ask consent for any pictures or video. # Pick up  ª≈çpala you see. # BE PONO.  Mauna Medics  The Mauna Medics hui was co-founded by Dr. Kalama O Ka Aina Niheu in 2017 order to provide medical assistance should any of the protector need medical assistance. The Mauna Medics hui is on site at Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu 24 hours a day and are available to treat minor medical issues such as altitude sickness. Due to the altitude and harsh weather conditions at Puuhonua o Puuhuluhulu, the Mauna Medics treat illnesses such as hypothermia, sunburn, and dehydration. Medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, and paramedics volunteer their time at Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu and all medical supplies are also donated to make sure that protectors are cared for. The Mauna Medic hui provides sunscreen, water stations, and basic medical advice to all visitors of Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu free of charge.  Pu ªuhuluhulu University  On Maunakea at Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu exists Pu ªuhuluhulu University. A key component in the movement to prevent the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Maunakea is the creation of access to education rooted in Hawaiian history and Hawaiian culture. ‚ÄúPresley Ke ªalaanuhea Ah Mook Sang, a Hawaiian language instructor at the University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa, said she first came up with the idea to start a community-led school or ‚Äúteach-in‚Äù after witnessing the crowd swell in that first week from hundreds of protesters to thousands‚Äù. The grassroots establishment of Pu ªuhuluhulu University at Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu has created a platform for the lƒÅhui (Hawaiian Nation) and facilitators of the University to co-create a reciprocal and place-based style approach to learning that is accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. Pu ªuhuluhulu University provides free classes to anyone who visits Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhulu. The course offerings range from Introduction to Hawaiian Language, Hawaiian Law, the history of Hawai ªi , and tours of Pu ªuhuluhulu. The common goal across the wide variety of courses is the intent to uplift the community with  ªike Hawai ªi (Hawaiian knowledge) through their teachings. Classes at Pu ªuhuluhulu University are taught by kia ªi (protectors) of Maunakea, community members, and professors at the University of Hawai ªi. One of the most consistent courses offered at Pu ªuhuluhulu University is Hawaiian Language. Kaipu Baker, a recent graduate of the University of Hawai ªi who has taught Hawaiian language courses at Pu ªuhuluhulu University noted that learning the Hawaiian language creates access to knowing cultural stories and their significance embedded in the language. In addition to the daily course offerings by Pu ªuhuluhulu University are several community services created by University facilitators to support the well-being of both long-term and daily visitors at Pu ªuhonua o Pu ªuhuluhlu. These services operate as stations on the University Campus that include Hale Mana MƒÅh≈´, where you can learn about queer history and theory from a Native Hawaiian perspective, Hale K≈´kƒÅk≈´kƒÅ where people can discuss and unpack their experiences on Maunakea, and a lomi (massage) tent. The motto of Pu ªuhuluhulu University is ‚ÄúE Mau ke Ea o ka  ªƒÄina i ka Pono‚Äù which can be translated to ‚ÄúThe Sovereignty of the Land is Perpetuated in what is Just‚Äù and the hope to fufill this mottol is in the daily creation of a true Hawaiian Place of Learning. For more information please see www.puuhuluhulu.com/.  Daily Protocol  On the Mauna Kea access road in front of what is now known as the kupuna (elders) tent there is daily protocol at 8am, 12noon and 5:30pm, in which protectors and visitors are able to learn and participate in Hawaiian cultural practices such as oli (chant), hula, and ho ªokupu (offerings). Some of the oli and hula that are taught and performed during protocol are: E Ala E, E KƒÅnehoalani E, E H≈ç Mai, NƒÅ  ªAumakua, E Iho Ana,  ª≈å HƒÅnau ka Mauna a Kea, MaunaKea Kuahiwi, Kua Loloa Kea ªau i ka NƒÅhele,  ªAu ªa  ªIa, I One Huna Ka Pahu, Na Kea Ko ªu Ho ªohihi ka Mauna,  ªAi Kamumu Kƒìkƒì, K≈´kulu ka Pahu, Ka ªi K≈´kulu. Indigenous peoples from all around the world have attended protocol to offer solidarity with the Protect Mauna Kea movement.

ArtistWorks was founded by David and Patricia Butler in 2008. The company developed a proprietary patented system for interacting with teachers based upon online Video Exchange Learning which students use to upload videos of themselves playing and ArtistWorks instructors respond with video feedback with both videos paired together and made visible for all students in the online course. ArtistWorks has enlisted over 35 different well-known master musicians including Paul Gilbert, Nathan East, Tony Trischka, Peter Erskine, Mike Marshall and many more, who have recorded extensive online music lessons that players can learn from, whether or not they submit a video.  Headquarters  ArtistWorks, LLC.'s main office and headquarters are located at 68 Coombs St., Suite C1 in Napa, CA 94559  Background  After his retirement as an executive from AOL in 1999, David Butler began his quest to learn jazz guitar but had difficulty finding an adequate local instructor. He turned to many books and tapes but found those resources frustrating and inadequate. The idea of ArtistWorks stemmed from his desire to democratize access to master musicians. His wish to connect students from all over the world with accomplished players was the basis for developing ArtistWorks. In 2008 the company was launched by Butler and his wife, Patricia Butler, who went on to develop this platform for quality interactive online instruction. In 2018 ArtistWorks launched the \\"ArtistWorks Music Certificate Program,\\" a 12-week structured online learning experience with four skill levels. The Program uses both patented technology and academic accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges as a Supplemental Education Provider(2017). ArtistWorks has also made this program available for high schools, offering school credit to students. Courses include instruction in blues guitar and ukulele. ArtistWorks has developed an industry-unique automated scoring rubric that will be used for mass assessment of Certificate Program students‚Äô performance skills. In 2019 ArtistWorks launched a new podcast focusing on interviews with master musicians called the ‚ÄúArtistWorks Music Series.‚Äù The first episode includes an interview with Mike Marshall and is titled ‚ÄúThe Blurring of Bluegrass.‚Äù  Patents  ArtistWorks applied for the first patent on its video management system referred to as the Video Exchange Learning¬Æ platform in 2008. The first patent (US 9,165,473) that was issued in June of 2015 provides for online students of any subject to learn from an online video lesson library that has within it, a request for students to submit a video to the teacher for evaluation. When students upload a video for review, the teacher receives their video in a management queue and responds with a newly recorded video of instruction and guidance specific to the needs of the student who submitted the video. The system then keeps both videos tied together and displays the paired videos to a library that is visible to all online students of the course being offered. The second patent (US 9,812,025) issued in November of 2017 broadened the original claims pertaining to the teachers‚Äô end of the video management system. The third issued patent (US 10, 147,333) in December of 2018 further broadened other existing claims pertaining to the processing of the two videos. The current Video Exchange Learning¬Æ platform teaches music to learners within 35 different music courses offered at ArtistWorks, LLC although the underlying concept of the patented system is subject agnostic.  Launch and Courses  ArtistWorks, LLC. was founded on September 25th, 2008 but the first online music lesson course did not launch until May of 2009. The first course was led by artist DJ Qbert.

It was designed and built to show that intercontinental airship travel was practicable. Its operational history included several long flights, such as a polar exploration mission, a round-the-world trip, trips to the Middle East and the Americas (operating five years of regular passenger and mail flights from Germany to Brazil), and latterly being used as a propaganda vehicle for the ruling Nazi Party. The airship was withdrawn from service following the Hindenburg disaster. Proving flights During 1928 there were six proving flights. On the fourth one, Blau gas was used for the first time. Graf Zeppelin carried Oskar von Miller, head of the Deutsches Museum; Charles E. Rosendahl, commander of USS Los Angeles; and the British airshipmen Ralph Sleigh Booth and George Herbert Scott. It flew from Friedrichshafen to Ulm, via Cologne and across the Netherlands to Lowestoft in England, then home via Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden, a total of in 34 hours and 30 minutes. On the fifth flight, Eckener caused a minor controversy by flying close to Huis Doorn in the Netherlands, which some interpreted as a gesture of support for the former Kaiser Wilhelm II who was living in exile there. First intercontinental flight (1928) alt= In October 1928 Graf Zeppelin made its first intercontinental trip, to Lakehurst Naval Air Station, New Jersey, US, with Eckener in command and Lehmann as first officer. Rosendahl and Drummond-Hay flew on the outward leg. Ludwig Dettmann and Theo Matejko made an artistic record of the flight. On the third day of the flight a large section of the fabric covering of the port tail fin was damaged while passing through a mid-ocean squall line east of Bermuda (35¬∞N, 42¬∞W). With the engines throttled back, the riggers (including Eckener's son, Knut) repaired the torn fabric while roped together for safety; whenever the airship descended too close to the ocean, they retreated into the ship so the engines could be restarted to maintain lift. Eckener directed Rosendahl to make a distress call; when this was received, newspaper headlines speculated that the ship was lost, US Navy vessels prepared for a rescue mission, and the radio station WOR broadcast a prayer and minute of silence. Graf Zeppelin was able to complete its journey with the repairs of its crew. When news broke that it was safe, it was deluged by radio calls of congratulation and requests to overfly particular places. It crossed the US coast at Cape Charles, Virginia, around 10 am on 15 October, then flew up the eastern seaboard via Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City, landing at Lakehurst at 5:38 pm. There was some annoyance from the Lakehurst personnel that the ship had not answered repeated calls for its position and estimated arrival time. The crossing, the longest non-stop flight at the time, had taken 111 hours 44 minutes. Eckener was welcomed with a ticker-tape parade in New York and an invitation to the White House to meet Calvin Coolidge, the US president. alt= After the tail had been repaired, Graf Zeppelin left Lakehurst at 1:24 am on 29 October. Clara Adams became the first female paying passenger to fly transatlantic on the return flight. The ship endured an overnight gale that blew it backwards in the air and off course, to the coast of Newfoundland. The wind caused the structure of the ship to bend visibly. A stowaway, 19-year-old Clarence Terhune, got aboard at Lakehurst and was discovered in the mail room mid-voyage. On arrival in Germany he became well-known and received job offers. The airship returned home on 1 November. On 6 November it flew to Berlin Staaken, where it was met by the German president, Paul von Hindenburg, who praised the achievements of the ship, and those who had designed, built, and flown it.

The consignee's address is in Hama, Syria, and is hand-written. With the cotton tail surfaces replaced by linen for added strength, Graf Zeppelin visited Palestine in late March 1929. It carried 28 passengers, some in the crew quarters. It had to leave port at 12:45 am because France only permitted it to overfly its territory in darkness, and above 3,600 feet. At Rome it sent greetings to Benito Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III. It entered Palestine at Jaffa, flew over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and descended to near the surface of the Dead Sea, 1,400 feet below sea level. The ship delivered 16,000 letters in mail drops at Jaffa, Athens, Budapest and Vienna. The Egyptian government (under pressure from Britain) refused it permission to enter their airspace; the Egyptian journalist Mahmud Abu al-Fath, who was on board representing Al-Ahram newspaper, wrote that this was caused by British jealousy over the success of German technology. Eckener sent a telegram to King Fuad from just outside Egyptian territory, expressing regret that \\"contrary winds prevent us from flying over the land of the wonders of a thousand years.\\" It then returned after a journey of in 81 hours. The second Mediterranean cruise flew over France, Spain, Portugal and Tangier, then returned home via Cannes and Lyon in a flight of 57 hours on 23‚Äì25 April. Forced landing in France (1929) Shortly after dark on 16 May 1929, on the first night of its second trip to the US, Graf Zeppelin lost power in two of its engines off the southeast coast of Spain, forcing Eckener to abandon the voyage and turn back. Flying against a strong headwind up the Rh√¥ne valley in France the next afternoon, two of the remaining three engines also failed, and the airship was blown towards the sea. With Eckener struggling for a suitable place to force-land, the French Air Ministry allowed him to land at Cuers-Pierrefeu, near Toulon. Barely able to control the ship on its one live engine, Eckener made an emergency landing. Graf Zeppelin was kept in the hangar which had housed the Dixmude (LZ 114) and the M√©diterran√©e (LZ 121). The engines were replaced with working ones sent by rail from Friedrichshafen, and the ship returned there on 24 May. The incident, and the forced comradeship it engendered, softened France's attitude to Germany and its airships slightly. The incident was caused by adjustments that had been made by the chief engineer to the four engines that failed. On 1 August 1929, the airship made a successful journey to Lakehurst, arriving on 4 August. Aboard both flights was Susie, an eastern gorilla who had been captured near Lake Kivu in the Belgian Congo and sold by her German owner to an American dealer. After a touring career in the US, Susie went to Cincinnati Zoo in 1931, where she died in 1947. Round-the-world flight (1929) alt=A black-and-white photograph of an interior scene.

Returned to Germany () The American newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst's media empire paid half the cost of the project to fly Graf Zeppelin around the world, with four staff on the flight; Drummond-Hay, Karl von Wiegand, the Australian explorer Hubert Wilkins, and the cameraman Robert Hartmann. Drummond-Hay became the first woman to circumnavigate the world by air. Rosendahl and Lieutenant Jack C Richardson represented the US government; Japan's Commander Fuiyoshi and the Soviet Union's Comrade Karklin were also aboard. Hearst stipulated that the flight in August 1929 officially start and finish at Lakehurst; the Germans considered that the trip began and ended at Friedrichshafen. Round-the-world tickets were sold for almost $3000 (), but most participants had their costs paid for them. The flight's expenses were offset by the carriage of souvenir mail between Lakehurst, Friedrichshafen, Tokyo, and Los Angeles. A US franked letter flown on the whole trip from Lakehurst to Lakehurst required $3.55 () in postage. The $100,000 Hearst paid for exclusive media rights would be the equivalent of $ in 2018. Graf Zeppelin flew back across the Atlantic to refuel at Friedrichshafen, then continued across Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Tokyo. The Soviet government requested that it overfly Moscow, but Eckener declined for operational reasons, irritating the Soviets. While crossing Siberia it carried hunting rifles and other emergency supplies in case of a forced landing. The ship dropped a wreath near Yakutsk in memory of the dead German prisoners of war buried there. Crossing the inaccurately mapped Stanovoy Mountains in the Russian Far East, it had to climb to 6,000 feet to pass through a high mountain pass. After five days in Tokyo, at a former German airship shed that had been removed from J√ºterbog and rebuilt at Kasumigaura Naval Air Station, Graf Zeppelin continued across the Pacific to California. Eckener used the remnants of a typhoon to advantage, picking up a tailwind to boost ground speed. He delayed crossing the coast at San Francisco's Golden Gate so as to come in near sunset for aesthetic effect. The ship passed over Hearst's San Simeon residence during the night, and landed at Mines Field in Los Angeles, completing the first ever nonstop flight across the Pacific Ocean; in 79 hours and 54 minutes. alt=A circular silver coin, with a raised edge. Inside this is written, in raised capitals, \\"Graf Zeppelin/Weltflug 1929\\". The two halves of the inscription are separated by a depiction of the airship flying from left to right, against a background showing the northern hemisphere of the world marked with stylised lines of latitude and longitude. At the bottom of this is a letter \\"A\\".The takeoff from Los Angeles was difficult because of high temperatures and an inversion layer. To lighten the ship, six crew were sent on to Lakehurst by aeroplane, and the minimum of fuel, food and spares were carried. The airship made a dynamic take-off with full power on four engines; it suffered minor damage from a tail strike and barely cleared electricity cables at the edge of the field. The , 51-hour-13-minute flight across the US took Graf Zeppelin over 13 states and El Paso, Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit, before arriving back at Lakehurst from the west on the morning of 29 August, three weeks after it had departed to the east. Flying time for the four Lakehurst to Lakehurst legs was 12 days, 12 hours, and 13 minutes; the entire circumnavigation (including stops) took 21 days, 5 hours, and 31 minutes to cover . It was the fastest circumnavigation of the globe at the time. Eckener remained in the US for discussions with the Goodyear Zeppelin company about plans for a future world airship network, leaving Lehmann in command for the last leg back to Germany. A passenger was caught smoking, which was very strictly forbidden on board; the culprit was held in contempt by the other passengers, but Lehmann had no means of punishing or confining him. At the end of the flight, on 4 September, the Graf Zeppelin was losing no more lifting gas than when it had departed. Eckener became the tenth recipient and the third aviator to be awarded the Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society, which he received on 27 March 1930 at the Washington Auditorium. Before returning to Germany, Eckener also met President Herbert Hoover and successfully lobbied the US Postmaster General for a special three- stamp issue (C-13, 14 & 15) for mail to be carried on the Europe-Pan American flight due to leave Germany in mid-May. Germany issued a commemorative coin celebrating the circumnavigation. Europe-Pan American flight (1930) Graf Zeppelin over alt=A black-and-white photograph taken between two trees. The Graf Zeppelin is flying at low level from left to right above a rocky coastline. In the background is the distinctive point known as Sugar Loaf, which marks the entrance to Rio de Janeiro harbour. On 26 April 1930 Graf Zeppelin made a brief visit to England commanded by Lehmann; it flew low over the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, dipping in salute to King George V, then briefly moored alongside the larger R100 at Cardington, before returning to Germany with Eckener in command. On 18 May, it left on a triangular flight between Spain, Brazil, and the US, carrying 38 passengers, many of them in crew accommodation. At Seville the Infante Alfonso, cousin of the Spanish King, boarded on a goodwill visit to Cuba. At 9:30 am on 20 May, a ceremony on board celebrated becoming the first airship to cross the equator. Drinking and washing water ran low in the hot conditions. The ship arrived at Recife (Pernambuco) in Brazil, docking at Campo do Jiqui√° on 22 May, where a temporary mooring mast and fuelling station had been set up, and 300 soldiers helped land it. It then flew to Rio de Janeiro, where it arrived ahead of time and spent some hours flying around the city. When it landed, there was no post to tether to, so it was held down by the landing party for the two hours of the visit. It flew north, via Recife, to Lakehurst; adverse weather led to the planned stop at Cuba being cancelled, to the annoyance of passengers who had booked to go there. Alfonso, an experienced flier, was philosophical about it. The storm damaged the rear engine nacelle, which had to be repaired in the hangar at Lakehurst. During ground handling of the airship there, it suddenly lifted, causing serious injury to one of the US Marines who was assisting. From Lakehurst it flew over New York City, across the Atlantic on 2 June to Seville, where Alfonso disembarked, then back to Germany. A few hours from home, when the Graf Zeppelin flew through a heavy hailstorm over the Sa√¥ne, the envelope was damaged and the ship lost lift. Eckener ordered full power and flew the ship out of trouble, but it came within 200 feet of hitting the ground. The Europe-Pan American flight was largely funded by the sale of special stamps issued by Spain, Brazil, and the US for franking mail carried on the trip. The US issued stamps in three denominations: 65¬¢, $1.30, and $2.60, all on 19 April 1930. With the US in the depths of the Great Depression, only about 7% of the stamps had been distributed when the issue was withdrawn from sale on 30 June. Over three million unsold stamps were destroyed by the US Post Office, making the three Graf Zeppelin issues by far the USPOD's smallest of the 20th century. Despite the poor sales, the US Post Office Department paid Luftschiffbau Zeppelin $100,000 () for the carriage of US franked mail on the flight. Graf Zeppelin flew to Moscow and back on 9‚Äì10 September 1930 to make up for not going there the previous year. It landed briefly at Moscow's October Field to collect souvenir mail. Graf Zeppelin above Helsinki, 24 September 1930 during its Baltic Sea excursion. In late September Graf Zeppelin toured the capitals around the Baltic Sea. The flight was planned to visit Riga, Tallinn, Helsinki and Stockholm and to drop mail during its visits. Three of its 15 passengers were meant to get off in Helsinki, but the planned landing had to be cancelled due to strong winds. The ship dropped flowers and chocolate to the wife of the German consul in T√∂√∂l√∂ district. In October Eckener and Hans von Schiller attended the funeral service in London for the 48 people killed in the R101 disaster.

In the foreground, three people in Egyptian dress are sitting or kneeling with their backs to the camera, watching the scene. The airship's image is slightly further to the left on the right-hand image; when viewed through the correct apparatus this would give the illusion that it was further away. The second flight to the Middle East took place in 1931, beginning on 9 April. It carried Booth, now commander of the grounded, but not yet scrapped, R100. Al-Fath again covered the event for Al-Ahram. Graf Zeppelin was allowed to overfly France in daylight this time, and crossed the Mediterranean to Benghazi in Libya. It flew via Alexandria, to Cairo in Egypt, where it saluted King Fuad at the Qubbah Palace, then visited the Great Pyramid of Giza and hovered 70 feet above the top of the monument. While in Cairo, Eckener met Flight Lieutenant H F Luck, from the British airship station at Ismailia, who had been sent there to receive the R101 on its maiden voyage to India, before its accidental destruction the previous October. After a brief stop, the ship flew to Palestine where it circled Jerusalem, then returned to Cairo to pick up Eckener, who had stayed for an audience with the King. It returned to Friedrichshafen on 13 April. Polar flight (1931) alt= alt= The idea of using airships to explore the Arctic had been a dream of Count Zeppelin 20 years earlier, but was put on hold during World War I. Roald Amundsen had taken a Dornier Wal flying boat to the Arctic in July 1925, and commented that an airship would have been a better vehicle for the journey. Arctic exploration was one reason used to justify the restoration of Germany's right to build airships. Eckener had taken Graf Zeppelin on a three-day trip to Norway and Spitsbergen in July 1930 to test its performance in the region. This was followed by a three-day flight to Iceland. Both trips were completed without technical problems. The International Society for the Exploration of the Arctic by Air (Aeroarctic) was interested in getting Eckener involved in a polar flight. Fridtjof Nansen, the president of Aeroarctic, died suddenly, and Eckener was offered the presidency. Overwhelmed by the offer, he consulted the German Chancellor, Heinrich Br√ºning, who was unable to help him. Wilkins then suggested a polar rendezvous. The initial plan was to meet the Nautilus (SS-73), the submarine in which Wilkins was attempting a trip under the polar ice. The submarine suffered technical problems and was later scuttled off Bergen, Norway. The polar flight (Polarfahrt 1931) lasted from 24 to 31 July 1931. Graf Zeppelin carried emergency equipment including tents, inflatable boats, fishing equipment, petrol stoves, and of food. To save weight, luxury fittings were removed and the beds were replaced by lightweight bunks. The ship rendezvoused with the Soviet icebreaker Malygin, which had the Italian polar explorer Umberto Nobile aboard. It exchanged of souvenir mail with the airship, which Eckener landed on the Arctic Ocean, using canvas buckets of sea water to descend to the surface, flotation aids, and a sea anchor to hold position. Fifty thousand cards and letters, weighing , were flown. The costs of the expedition were met largely by the sale of special postage stamps issued by Germany and the Soviet Union to frank the mail carried on the flight. The writer Arthur Koestler was one of two journalists on board, along with a multinational team of scientists led by the Russian Professor Samoilowich, who measured the Earth's magnetic field, and a Russian radio operator, Ernst Krenkel. The expedition photographed and mapped Franz Josef Land accurately for the first time, and came within of the North Pole. It deployed three early radiosondes over the Arctic to collect meteorological data from the upper atmosphere; they were released through a specially built large hatch in the keel, with a weight that dropped away, allowing them to climb.

From the beginning Luftschiffbau Zeppelin had plans to serve South America; there was an early failed plan to charter the ship to a Spanish company to carry mail from Seville to Buenos Aires in Argentina. There was a large community of Germans in Brazil, and existing sea connections were slow and uncomfortable. Graf Zeppelin could transport passengers over long distances in the same luxury as an ocean liner, and almost as quickly as contemporary airliners. After its single trip to Brazil in 1930, Graf Zeppelin made three in 1931. On 7 September it completed its eighth transatlantic flight, to Recife and back, in under nine days; it had left home on 29 August. In December 1931 it was laid up for a complete overhaul in preparation for regular transatlantic service. All nine round trips during 1932 were made on schedule. The final one returned to Germany on 3 November. The route to Brazil meant flying down the Rh√¥ne valley in France, a cause of great sensitivity between the wars. The French government, concerned about espionage, restricted it to a -wide corridor in 1934. Turning right at the Mediterranean, it followed the coast of Spain to Gibraltar, then the coast of North Africa as far as R√≠o de Oro, turning right again over the ocean to the Cape Verde islands, then Fernando de Noronha and direct to Recife where it could be replenished with fuel and lifting gas. The service initially terminated there, and was later extended to Rio de Janeiro to meet demand. Graf Zeppelin was too small and slow for the stormy North Atlantic route, but because of the Blau gas fuel, could carry out the longer South Atlantic service. The Great Depression led to a reduction in its flights from almost 200 in 1930‚Äì31 to fewer than 60 in 1932. On 2 July 1932 it left for another visit to Britain; it arrived with a Junkers G.38, moored at Hanworth Air Park assisted by Rover Scouts, then flew a 24-hour tour of Britain, flying over Portsmouth, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Cardiff and Bristol. While returning from Brazil in October 1933, Graf Zeppelin stopped at Miami (NAS Opa Locka) and then in Akron, Ohio, where it moored at the Goodyear Zeppelin airdock, the only time the airdock's international facilities were used. The airship then appeared at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago. It displayed swastika markings on the left side of the fins, as the Nazi Party had taken power in January. Eckener, aware that the Nazis were unpopular in America, circled the fair clockwise so that the swastikas would not be seen by the spectators. The ship returned to Akron for two days, visited Canada, overflew the White House, then left for home with an overnight stop in Seville. The United States Post Office Department issued a special 50-cent airmail stamp (C-18) for the visit, which was the fifth and final one the ship made to the US. It made twelve return trips to South America in 1934; on the third one it flew to Buenos Aires to gauge interest in starting an airship service there. This did not materialise, and connecting services were provided by aeroplane from Rio de Janeiro. alt=A sepia photograph of the airship from below. It is flying from right to left above a city. There is a tall ornate building just below the airship and the silhouette of more masonry in the bottom left foreground. All five engine nacelles are visible, and the two nearest and the control room are in sunlight. There are swastikas on both the vertical fins. In spite of the dope, the cotton envelope absorbed moisture from the air in humid tropical conditions. When the relative humidity reached 90%, the ship's weight rose by almost . Exposure to tropical downpours could greatly add to this, but when under way the ship had enough reserve power to generate dynamic lift to compensate. On 25 April 1935 it made a rough forced landing at Recife after it was caught in a rainstorm at low speed on the approach to land and the added weight of several tons of water caused it to sink to the ground. The lower rudder was lost, the outer envelope was ripped in several places, and a petrol tank was punctured by a palm tree. A crewman extinguished a cooking fire close to the landing site. The damage was repaired on return to Friedrichshafen. In late 1935 the existing postal shuttle service between Recife and Bathurst, in the British African colony of the Gambia, had to be suspended so that the ships supporting the Dornier Wal flying boats which operated it could be serviced. Graf Zeppelin was put into service as a replacement, carrying mail only. There was no landing facility at Bathurst, so mailbags were exchanged by rope. The first of three return journeys left Recife on 15 November. On 24 November, during the second trip, the crew learned of an insurrection in Brazil, and there was some doubt whether it would be possible to return to Recife. Graf Zeppelin delivered its mail to Macei√≥, then loitered off the coast for three days until it was safe to land, after a flight of 118 hours and 40 minutes. It returned to Germany on 10 December, having made 19 South American trips in a year. In May 1936 the new airship base at Frankfurt am Main opened, and Graf Zeppelin started operating from it; higher payloads could be carried as it was nearer sea level than Friedrichshafen. Brazil also built a hangar for airships at Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o Airport, near Rio de Janeiro, at a cost of $1 million (equivalent to $ million in 2018 ). Brazil charged the DZR $2000 ($) per landing, and had agreed that German airships would land there 20 times per year, to pay off the cost. The hangar was constructed in Germany and the parts were transported and assembled on site. It was finished in late 1936, and was used four times by Graf Zeppelin and five by Hindenburg. It now houses units of the Brazilian Air Force. Graf Zeppelin made 64 round trips to Brazil, on the first regular intercontinental commercial air passenger service, and it continued until the loss of the Hindenburg in May 1937. Propaganda (1936) alt=A black-and- white photograph of a man sitting in a small, polished-wood sports glider, underneath the bulk of the zeppelin. He is wearing a white flight suit, and a white fabric flight helmet. His elbows are resting on the sides of the cockpit. Behind and around him are nine men in military officers' dress uniform. The glider is secured to the airship by a cable at its nose and a mechanical attachment at its centre. In 1932 Eckener had declined permission for Graf Zeppelin to endorse Hindenburg's electoral campaign against Adolf Hitler; he later made a speech on radio supporting the moderate policies of Br√ºning. He was outspoken about his dislike of the Nazi Party and was warned by Rudolf Diels, the head of the Gestapo, but faced no other sanction. When the Nazis gained power in 1933, Joseph Goebbels (Reich Minister of Propaganda) and Hermann G√∂ring (Commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe) put millions of marks into Luftschiffbau Zeppelin, on condition it was reorganised. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin would continue to build airships, but a new airline would operate them, Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei (DZR). The Nazis sidelined Eckener by putting the more sympathetic Lehmann in charge of DZR, and used Graf Zeppelin as a propaganda tool. On 14 May 1934 over Berlin, it released a glider from under its hull. On 7 March 1936, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaties, German troops reoccupied the Rhineland, Germany's western border region which was designated as a demilitarised buffer zone. Hitler called a plebiscite for 29 March to retrospectively approve the reoccupation, and adopt a list of exclusively Nazi candidates to sit in the new Reichstag. Goebbels commandeered Graf Zeppelin and the newly launched Hindenburg for the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. The airships flew in tandem around Germany before the vote, with a joint departure from L√∂wenthal on the morning of 26 March. Millions of Germans watched from below as they toured the country for four days and three nights, dropping propaganda leaflets, playing martial music and slogans from large loudspeakers, and broadcasting political speeches from a makeshift radio studio on Hindenburg. The vote, held under the new Nuremberg Laws which disenfranchised the Jews, resulted in overwhelming support for the Nazis. After Eckener complained publicly about the propaganda flights, Goebbels made him an \\"unperson\\"; his name was not to be mentioned nor his photograph published. On 1 May 1936, Hitler ordered that Graf Zeppelin fly over Berlin again as part of the May Day celebrations; later in May, it transported Goebbels on a visit to Italy, and gave the Marshal of the Air Force Italo Balbo an aerial tour of Rome. It was used later in the year as a backdrop for one of Hitler's Nuremberg Rallies.

History While cousin marriage is legal in most countries, and avunculate marriage is legal in several, sexual relations between siblings are considered incestual almost universally. Sibling incest is legally prohibited in most countries worldwide. It was historically practiced in ancient Egypt and indigenous Inca tribes. Innate sexual aversion between siblings forms due to close association in childhood, in what is known as the Westermarck effect.

It is an eclectic and innovative indie venue due to its location in a converted church from the 18th century, its multiple interior event spaces (including four stages, a recording studio, multiple bars, and a restaurant), and its hosting of thousands of national, regional and local artists since its inception as a venue. Mr. Smalls has been the live music venue for many touring national acts over the years including Fall Out Boy, Bill Clinton, Snoop Dogg, Muse, Smashing Pumpkins, Bone Thugs N Harmony, Kesha, Interpol and Metric. It has a capacity of over 1,000 people amongst its various interior event spaces, namely the two performance spaces: the Theatre (800 people) and the Funhouse (175 people).  History  Located in Millvale, Pennsylvania, the building in which Mr. Smalls resides once belonged to the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh as the site of St. Ann's Catholic Church, which was founded in 1874. The building was purchased in 2000 by current owners (and married couple) Mike Speranzo and Liz Berlin. Together, they founded Mr. Smalls in 2002. Speranzo is a musician and former competitive skateboarder, and Berlin is a longtime member of Rusted Root, a worldbeat rock band who attained commercial success in the 1990s. The name of the venue was inspired by the childhood nickname of their son, Jordan. When it was purchased, the building underwent extensive renovations in order to convert it to its new use as a music venue, recording studio and skate park. In addition to those functions, Creative.Life.Support offers services such as artist career development and professional opportunities in conjunction with the venue. Over the years, the venue has grown and evolved to accommodate its audience and demands. It has become one of the only venues in the area that can house large national acts as well as small ones. Professional skateboarder Evan Smith references Mr. Smalls as a venue that had a major influence on the development of his skating and music. Mr. Smalls is an independent venue, event space and recording studio to this day, and is known for supporting the careers of many talented artists and bands. Interior layout and rooms Baroness performs at Mr. Smalls Theatre Stage Inside the building, there are many spaces each serving various functions: * The Theatre Stage is a large performance space with a capacity of 800 people. For the Theatre Stage audience, there is a main floor viewing area (standing room) and two bars, plus the VIP Balcony section. The Theatre Stage space was the former church's main congregation room. The 40 foot ceilings and many windows of the former church have been fixed with custom coverings and acoustic sound paneling. * The Funhouse Stage is a smaller performance space, opened April 2016, with a capacity of 175 people. * The Funhouse Restaurant is open during shows which take place on the Theatre Stage and the Funhouse Stage. * The Skatepark was a large part of the venue's early years, but has since been closed. Its materials were repurposed in the building of the Funhouse. * The Great Hall connects the Funhouse Restaurant and Theatre Balcony and has seating and a bar. * The Satellite Stage is located in the Great Hall and is used as a side stage for smaller, generally acoustic acts during events and festivals. * The Courtyard is a multi-level outdoor area with a stage. The Courtyard can accommodate bands or DJs. * The Recording Studio was formerly located in the same building as the rest of Mr. Smalls, but is currently located in another neighborhood of the city, the North Side. * The War Room is a full bar in the basement of Mr. Smalls. It is used for pre-show, mid-show and post-show gatherings. * The Sanctuary Stage is located in a former Methodist church across the street from Mr. Smalls.

Winter weather in the US was a bit on the inactive side as most of the US experienced a warmer than average winter which is all thanks to the strong polar vortex throughout much of the winter. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2019 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2020 occurred on March 19. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 29. Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years. Seasonal forecasts indicated a milder than normal winter across most of the United States and even parts of Canada. These forecasts were verified after the United States experienced their 6th warmest winter on record and many cities in the Northeast Megalopolis received <1\\" of snow all winter. Fewer significant events occurred during the season and many of them occurred in April and even early May which is quite unusual as most winters tend to have significant winter weather events in January and February. Significant weather events includes an early season winter storm in mainly the northeastern US, a series of brief cold waves in the Northwest and the upper midwest in late January through early February, a historic blizzard in Atlantic Canada in late January, significant lake effect snow in the Great Lakes region late February, a bomb cyclone nor‚Äôeaster in March that provided a yet another near-miss to the New England region, and a late-season blizzard that impacted the much of the Midwest and the Rockies. Seasonal forecasts On October 17, 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center released its U.S. Winter Outlook. The El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation was in its neutral phase and was thus not expected to be a key predictor for the season. As a result, other oscillations such as the Madden‚ÄìJulian Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation were anticipated to be more significant drivers of the seasonal weather, particularly in the form of large temperature and precipitation swings. From the outlook, the greatest likelihoods for above-normal temperatures were for Alaska and Hawaii, with lower but still above-normal odds of above-average temperatures for most of the lower 48 states. The exception was for the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes regions, which were ascribed equal changes for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. No area in the United States was favored to have below-average temperatures. In terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions were most likely in Alaska, Hawaii, part of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. Drier-than-average conditions were favored for Louisiana and parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as parts of central and northern California, with the rest of the U.S. having equal changes of above-, near-, or below- average precipitation. The drought outlook highlighted the presence of abnormally dry conditions across much of the Southern U.S, with improvement expected in part of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Alaska, and Hawaii. Drought was expected to persist in central Texas and the Southwestern U.S, with further development anticipated in parts of central California.  Events  = Early November winter storm = Record breaking temperatures and snowfall caused disruption throughout the Midwestern United States in early November. Approximately 1000 flights were grounded at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as 3.7 inches of snow fell on November 11, breaking the previous record of 1.9 inches on November 11, 1995. In areas of Michigan's lower peninsula, over two feet of snow fell. In Canada, Southern Ontario and Southern Quebec had their first major winter storm of the season on November 11 and 12 respectively, which was followed by record January-like cold. 10‚Äì20 cm of snow fell across much of the region crippling large cities such as Montreal and Toronto. In Montreal, local officials announced the city's earliest ever snow removal operation in the aftermath of the storm. Over 10 school boards province-wide closed the day after the storm. = Late November - Early December bomb cyclone & blizzard = Satellite imagery of winter storms crossing the US November 27, 2019 Moving ashore November 26‚Äì27 near the Oregon/California border as an over-achieving bomb cyclone, it produced wind gusts in excess of 100 mph near its point of landfall. The storm produced a record low pressure reading of 973.4 millibars in Crescent City, California. From November 27‚Äì30, the low merged with the subtropical jet as it tracked slowly eastward across the Rockies, plains & Midwest. The combination of cold air, moisture and high winds produced a wide swath of blizzard conditions from Colorado through western South Dakota, including the Denver Metro. In Rapid City, 14.5 inches of snow fell on the 30th, breaking the one-day snowfall record for November. In Duluth, where 21.7 inches of snow accumulated, it was the city's heaviest snowstorm in 10 years. As the first major winter storm of the season in the northeast, it dumped 22.6 inches of snow in Albany, where it was the heaviest snowfall since the 1993 Superstorm. Widespread totals in excess of 20 inches occurred in the Albany Metro, Southern New Hampshire & Northwestern Massachusetts with a regional peak of 36 inches of snow in New Ipswich, New Hampshire. The low finally moved out to sea December 3. = Late December Great Plains and Midwest blizzard = The winter storm had the largest impact on the Midwestern states, as it affected Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Minnesota. In Fargo, North Dakota, there were many closings of schools, businesses, and roadways, from December 28 to December 30. Freezing rain lead to over 470 reported traffic accidents in Minneapolis.https://www.fox9.com/news/slippery-road-conditions-lead- to-470-crashes-across-Minnesota Plains being impacted by blizzard, as seen from space = Early January storm complex = A large complex of low pressure systems began developing January 9 over Central North America. A large trough dug into the jet stream over the Southwestern United States, providing arctic air that had been settled over Canada to move southwards and clash with warm, moist air moving northward from the Gulf of Mexico. In the warm sector, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes broke out in the south central United States on the morning of January 10. Tornado warnings were issued for more than 1.7 million in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, at 7:52 pm CST a PDS tornado warning was issued for Scranton, Arkansas and surrounding communities and more than 111,000 customers were left without power in Texas alone. Severe weather continued in the deep south into following day, with Alabama being affected particularly severely. North of the boundary, a mix of heavy snow and freezing rain caused travel woes across the Midwest. Along the Great Lakes, winds were forecast to whip up 23 foot waves as lakeshore flooding had already begun in Chicago. Central Michigan through Eastern Ontario received a swath of crippling ice accretion. Several January rainfall records fell in Southern Ontario, as event rainfall totals over 50 mm were widespread, which is highly unusual for that time of year. = Mid January snowstorm = Beginning on the west coast January 15, much of southern British Columbia, including the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, received an unusually heavy snowstorm. Combined with high wind, some localities were put under blizzard warning, which is rare in British Columbia. 15 cm of snow fell in Vancouver and 20 cm fell in Victoria, closing schools, disrupting transportation and cutting power to 23,000. Across the Plains and Midwest, the snow also caused problems for travelers, closing a 175-mile stretch of I-29, a 63-mile stretch of I-90 as well as all of I-85 within the state of Idaho. A plane slipped off the runway at Kansas City International Airport and the Quad Cities region declared a snow emergency. In Southern Ontario, up to 20 cm (8 inches) of snow fell breaking a few daily snowfall records for January 18, including at Ottawa International Airport where 19 cm of snow fell (14.3 cm of which fell on the 18th), and Pearson International Airport, which received 17.2 cm of snow. The heavy snowfall was severely disruptive to transportation, particularly in the GTA, where 250 collisions occurred. = North Atlantic bomb cyclone = A low pressure system brought moderate snow to the Great Lakes region it crossed the Northeast before emerging over the North Atlantic. While south of Nova Scotia, the storm became a weather bomb and the following day, January 17, it moved just to the south of Newfoundland Avalon Peninsula, bringing with it 2 to 3 feet of snow and hurricane-force winds that produced a large swath of blizzard condition in the Southeast Corner of the island. 76.2 cm of snow accumulated, becoming St. John's heaviest 1-day snowfall since records began, with winds gusting to 100 km/h for 14 consecutive hours, the city was paralyzed. Several locations were evacuated due to a significant avalanche risk. At high tide, a storm surge of 60 ‚Äì 80 cm occurred, with 9 to 12 m waves on top. Several communities in the region declared a state of emergency. = January‚ÄìFebruary cold waves = A major arctic outbreak affected western Canada and the Pacific Northwest from January 12‚Äì19. Extreme cold warnings were issued across all of Alberta, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, most of BC, most of Saskatchewan and part of Manitoba during this period, as a cross-polar flow caused arctic to settle in the region. Much of Central Alberta dipped below -40 ¬∞C, colder than it was in Siberia at the time. Following the storm that would go on to become the North Atlantic bomb cyclone, the Ohio River Valley area and parts of the Midwest suffered brutally cold temperatures on January 19. On February 14, the Ohio River Valley region suffered brutally cold temperatures again this winter with temperatures plummeting to a low of -2 ¬∞F at Chicago O'Hare Airport, regionally the coldest temperatures recorded in the 2019‚Äì2020 season. Considering the windchill factor, temperatures ranged from -10 ¬∞F - -20 ¬∞F; dangerously cold for anyone outdoors. It was Chicago's coldest Valentine's Day in 77 years. Temperatures in Minnesota were also record breaking; an overnight low of -35 ¬∞F was reported at Preston. New Hampton, Iowa broke a near-century old record when they fell to -18 ¬∞F. North of the International border, temperatures fell into the -20 ¬∞C range as far south as Toronto, where several frostquakes occurred. = Early February storm complex = Large storm complex over Eastern North America February 6 February 4 and 5, snow fell in the deep south, primarily in Texas and Oklahoma, where several highways were closed. Snow fell as far south as Austin, 14 inches of snow fell in Jayton, Texas, and thundersnow occurred in Big Spring. I-70 in central Missouri was temporarily shut down as road crews cleaned debris in the aftermath of a collision. Schools closed in portions of Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri. 9,000 were left without power in the Oklahoma city metro. The following day, severe thunderstorms produced flash flooding and tornadoes in the Southeastern United States. In Simpson County, Mississippi, a possible- tornado destroyed several mobile homes. A PDS-tornado warning was issued for Charlotte, where those at the airport were relocated to the building's interior. Severe thunderstorms and tornado warnings occurred as far North as Maryland and Delaware. Winter weather advisories were issued from Tennessee to Maine, with warnings concentrated over North-central Pennsylvania, Western New York, Northern portions of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. With a precipitation shield of 2500 km, the storm impacted 16 million across 6 provinces in Canada. The storm was dubbed \\"Winter Storm Kade\\" by The Weather Channel. = Mid February Southeast U.S snowstorm = A broad area of low pressure brought snow to parts of the Southeast beginning on February 19, when snow began to fall in the mountains of Tennessee. 4.2 and 4 inches of snow accumulated in Waynesville and Mount LeConte respectively. Similar but slightly lesser amounts occurred in surrounding areas of Eastern Tennessee and Western North Carolina. Another swath of snow occurred in Eastern North Carolina and Southeastern Virginia on February 20‚Äì21, ending a 400+ day snow- free streak in the region. In preparation for the storm, most school boards closed or had delayed openings, hundreds of flights were cancelled and all of North Carolina was put under a Winter weather advisory. = Late February Great Lakes winter storm = On February 25, heavy snowfall and winds caused travel disruption in South Dakota and Wyoming, where portions of Interstates 80 and 25 were closed. 31 inches of snow fell in South Dakota's Black hills. The following day, the storm impacted the Midwest, with accumulations peaking at 8.7 inches in Salem Center, Indiana. Major cities in the Midwest, such as Chicago or Indianapolis, avoided the heaviest snow as they received fewer than 3 inches of it. However, strong winds caused minor lakeshore flooding and delayed 900 flights in the former. 1 fatality was reported in Missouri as the result of a car crash. The entire 401 corridor from Windsor through Southern Quebec was impacted by heavy snow, high winds and/or freezing rain. The inclement weather resulted in 250 collision in the Greater Toronto area alone. 19.6 cm of snow fell in Ottawa, however, the storm may have produced over a foot of snow in nearby, sparsely populated Cottage country. Due to the Great Lakes being relatively ice free and warmer than normal, unusually heavy lake- effect snow squalls followed along their leeward shores, prompting Blizzard warnings in some localities. (As of 11 PM February 28) 48 inches of snow fell in Carthage, New York, downwind of Lake Ontario. The heaviest snowfall downwind of Lake Erie was 25 inches at Springville, New York. 33.8 inches of snow fell at Watertown. = March nor'easters = Bomb cyclone Nor'easter at peak intensity March 7, 2020  1st nor'easter (March 6‚Äì8)  An area of low pressure off the US East Coast began intensifying when it merged with a weaker area of low pressure over the Great Lakes. Between the morning of March 6 and the morning of March 7, the storm's central pressure dropped 40 mb, qualifying for the 24 mb drop in 24 hours to classify a bomb cyclone. Due to the sharp pressure gradient, very strong winds were reported on the islands off Massachusetts' coast, with a peak gust of 66 mph reported on Nantucket, where 2.4 - 2.5 inches of snow was recorded. A 62 mph wind gust was reported on Cape Cod while nearby coastlines of Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire were affected by winds in the 30 - 45 mph range. Light snow fell in Southeastern Massachusetts, peaking at 2.6 inches in Dighton. The storm achieved a peak intensity of 965 mb early on March 7, as it was pulling away from New England.  2nd nor'easter (March 22‚Äì25)  An area of low pressure moved offshore of the Mid-Atlantic and began organizing and strengthening slightly. Remaining offshore, enough cold air was in place for it to deliver moderate, locally heavy snow to the interior northeast. Syracuse received their 2nd heaviest seasonal snowfall with 6.8 inches. The Albany metro area also saw >6 inches of snow. Higher elevation locales received much heftier totals; 9 inches of snow accumulated at Lake Desolate and 8.8 inches in Savoy, Massachusetts, for example. The most snowfall accumulated for this storm in the United States was 11 inches and occurred in 3 different locations; Mildford, New Hampshire, Quechee, Vermont and Norridgewock, Maine. Beforehand, light snowfall was experienced over a swath of the Midwest and 2 inches of snow accumulated at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Atlantic Canada also experienced impacts from the storm. In the Maritimes, wet snow fell ahead of moderate rainfall and mixed precipitation lessened snowfall totals. However, the island of Newfoundland experienced much heavier snow and stronger winds, producing near-blizzard conditions. At Stanfield International Airport, 27.1 cm of snow fell on March 24. St. John's, Newfoundland saw 18.4 cm of snow March 24‚Äì25 and winds there gusted to 91 km/h. = Mid March High Plains blizzard = GOES 16 water vapor image of the Northern Rockies as the late season blizzard moves over. An area of low pressure incoming from the Pacific drifted down the California coastline the week of March 16, bringing scattered thunderstorms with hail to Southern California. Continuous flow of moisture into California's mountains produced extreme snowfall totals during an otherwise unipressive winter there. 114 inches of snow fell at Homewood, 92\\" at Sierra-at-Tahoe and 77\\" at Kingvale, for example. Several rounds of severe thunderstorms occurred in Texas during this time period with the Dallas Metro being especially hit hard. Following >4 inches of rain, street flooding was reported. The responsible low pressure area was observed to finally move ashore mid-day on the 18, and the Colorado low began forming shortly afterward. In the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains, blizzard warnings were issued March 17 in anticipation of a very heavy snowfall to be accompanied by strong winds. Snowfall totals in NWS Boulder's forecast region peak at 23 inches 4 miles NE of Nederland. Combined with winds gusting >62 mph, widespread blizzard conditions occurred. At Denver's airport over 1,000 flights or ~80% of air traffic that day, were cancelled.

She was the interim president of Bolivia until the 2020 Bolivian general election, in which she was replaced by Luis Arce of MAS-IPSP. She was Bolivia's second female president, after Lidia Gueiler Tejada, who served as interim president from 1979 to 1980 before losing the 1980 Bolivian general election. √Å√±ez was previously an opposition senator from the northeastern department of Beni, belonging to the center-right Democrat Social Movement, which belongs to the Democratic Unity (UD) coalition of parties in Bolivia's legislative assemblies. From January to September 2020, she ran for president as part of the \\"Juntos Avancemos\\" alliance, a coalition of the Democrat Social Movement party and four other parties. She is a strong critic of Evo Morales. Early life and education Jeanine √Å√±ez was born in the small Amazonian town of San Joaqu√≠n in the Department of Beni, Bolivia, on 13 August 1967. She was the youngest of seven children born to two teachers. Her background has been described as poor mestiza and lower-middle-class. During this time, San Joaqu√≠n lacked proper roads, depended on diesel generators for power and rationed its water supply. √Å√±ez has recalled, \\"We grew up with many limitations, with many needs, but nevertheless I had a beautiful childhood, very free.\\" √Å√±ez attended the local school, a girls' school of which her mother later became director. At 17, she received her baccalaureate and left San Joaqu√≠n to pursue study in La Paz, first at the Bolivian Institute and then at the Abraham Lincoln Institute. She studied to become a secretary. √Å√±ez continued to Santa Cruz, where she took further courses, including computing and some English. After getting married at the age of 23, she moved to Trinidad, Bolivia, where she enrolled at the Autonomous University of the Beni Jos√© Ballivi√°n and obtained a graduate degree in law and legal sciences. √Å√±ez passed the bar in 1991. Political career before presidency Before becoming a politician, √Å√±ez was a media presenter and director at Totalvisi√≥n. =Constituent Assembly (2006‚Äì2008)= Between 2006 and 2008, √Å√±ez served as a constituent assemblywoman for the drafting of the new constitutional charter, also working as part of the judiciary. =First senatorial term (2010‚Äì2015)= In 2010, √Å√±ez was elected to the Senate as a member of the party Plan Progress for Bolivia-National Convergence (P.P.B - C.N), representing the Department of Beni in the National Assembly. She ran for governor of Beni in 2012. In 2011, √Å√±ez spoke out against the Morales government's approval of a finance bill for the construction of the Villa Tunari-San Ignacio de Moxos highway. She claimed that it was not approved with due consideration for the native peoples and institutions of the region, saying, \\"indigenous people's rights were violated\\", a sentiment echoed by leader of the natives of the Isiboro S√©cure National Park Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS), Adolfo Moye, who said the bill was enacted \\"without considering the serious impact on the ecosystem and natural reserves of the region.\\" In 2012, √Å√±ez and fellow party legislator Adri√°n Oliva presented a report to the Human Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies of Uruguay in an effort to publicise human rights violations in Bolivia. According to the UN refugee office, UNHCR, there were around 600 Bolivian exiles or refugees, 100 political prisoners and at least 15 cases of torture at the time. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Bolivia had a \\"crisis in the administration of justice\\". Also in 2012, √Å√±ez was selected as a Bolivian representative to the Amazonian Parliament. In 2013, there was a series of nationwide strikes and protests against the MAS government about the reduction of seats in the Chamber of Deputies for Beni, Potos√≠ and Chuquisaca. As Senator of Beni, √Å√±ez joined picket lines and was among six legislators and a dozen indigenous representatives of CONAMAQ to go on hunger strikes in protest of the legislation being passed by the MAS majority in both chambers. In 2014, √Å√±ez made complaints about the government's lack of financial transparency. Opposition legislators' requests for reports with which they could audit the activities of the state were delayed and, in 499 out of 1979 cases for the 2013-14 period, received no response. According to the regulations of the Chamber of Deputies, authorities were given 10 business days to respond to a request for a report, and 15 days in the Senate. If a request for a written report is not answered, an injunction can be issued to give a time limit of 48 hours. √Å√±ez said that in many cases, these injunctions were ignored and there was a \\"denial of information\\". Many of the projects had large budgets with several interested parties for whom access is even more restricted. She said of many requests that did receive replies, \\"they are responses without response\\". Responses included two sheets of photocopies, material unrelated to the request or boxes full of documents that did \\"not intend to clarify the doubts, but to hinder the work of the legislators.\\" In 2019‚Äì2020, many of these cases are under investigation. =Second senatorial term (2015‚Äì2019)= √Å√±ez has spoken out against the proliferation of drug trafficking in South America. In 2017, her nephew was arrested in Brazil for smuggling 480 kilos of drugs. The security minister Carlos Romero criticized √Å√±ez and called her position in the Senate \\"rogue\\" because of the relationship; √Å√±ez responded that she is not responsible for her nephew's actions, and criticized Romero for being \\"responsible for the growth of drug trafficking\\" because of his position in government. It was later revealed that another Bolivian arrested with drugs at the same time was the nephew of another politician, this time belonging to the MAS ruling party. In 2018, √Å√±ez was one of three Senators to make a complaint against Gisela L√≥pez, then Minister for Public Works. This involved the management of the state-owned Bolivia TV and undocumented expenditure of more than $40 million. The case had already been the target of more than 30 obstructed complaints by a former minister. In 2019, this became the centre of the Neurona case, in which L√≥pez and 22 others \\"are suspected of the alleged crimes of improper use of influence, negotiations incompatible with the exercise of public functions, breach of duties, contracts harmful to the State and uneconomic conduct\\". Also in 2018, √Å√±ez presented a bill to the Senate to combat \\"sexual blackmail\\", saying, \\"Social networks lend themselves to everything. We have seen that the viralization of intimate videos has become an extortion mechanism and on some occasions it is to blackmail psychologically and economically, so the intention is to penalize and specifically typify it\\". After she became president, anti-√Å√±ez posters spread a pornographic video on social media supposedly depicting her, which she denied and called a \\"vile attack\\". During her second senatorial term, √Å√±ez was associated with legislative work to combat violence against women, which has become a continuing theme for her politically. By 2019, √Å√±ez was elected the second vice president of the Senate. Her alternate was Franklin Valdivia Leigue. This role placed her fifth in the line of succession to the presidency. Before the 2019 presidential election, √Å√±ez had questioned the reliability of opinion polls, based on unclear methods and inconsistent results. In early 2019, √Å√±ez called for an investigation into prison wardens in Beni after speaking to victims of rape and abuse by guards. She aimed to set a precedent to bring in new legislation that can be upheld. Interim president of Bolivia (2019‚Äì2020) =Initial protest period= On 10 November 2019, after more than two weeks of protests and marches stemming from allegations of electoral fraud, Morales and his vice president, √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera, resigned from office, due to pressure from political opponents and civic groups and loss of support from former political allies, the police and the military.Ernesto Londo√±o, Bolivian Leader Evo Morales Steps Down, The New York Times (10 November 2019). This was followed by the resignation of Adriana Salvatierra Arriaza, the president of the Bolivian Senate, who was next in the constitutional line of successionKay Guerrero & Dakin Andone, Bolivian President Evo Morales steps down following accusations of election fraud, CNN (10 November 2019).‚Äîleading to a situation where all constitutional successors were exhausted. The role of acting president of the Senate would normally fall to the vice president of the Senate, Rub√©n Medinaceli, but since he also had resigned, the position fell to A√±ez as second vice president. Thus A√±ez became the highest-ranking official in the line of succession to the presidency of Bolivia and said she would fill the role if needed. The succession was not automatic, however, as the Legislative Assembly needed to hold emergency meetings to accept the president's and vice president's abdications and determine who was next in line due to the lack of constitutional guidance. √Å√±ez could not attend an emergency assembly until the day after Morales's resignation, as she was in Beni and there were no Sunday flights from there to La Paz. On 11 November, A√±ez arrived at La Paz-El Alto airport and was taken in a military helicopter to a nearby Air Force base. From there, she traveled to the Bolivian Senate. At 4 p.m., an emergency vote took place to formally accept the resignations of the previous day. Morales's MAS party, which still held a majority in the upper chamber, boycotted the vote. Constitutional experts Paul Coca and Israel Alanoca said that, while the normal quorum would have been desirable for purpose of quelling accusations of a coup d'√©tat, there was no specific regulation to deal with the resignation of leaders and an emergency vote on the grounds of human rights concerns and establishing social peace was legally valid. On the evening of 12 November, per article 169 of the Constitution of Bolivia, √Å√±ez was declared acting president of Bolivia in front of a session of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly. MAS also boycotted this vote, calling it illegal. √Å√±ez received the votes of the remaining parties, a third of parliament. The Plurinational Constitutional Court later upheld the vote, making √Å√±ez Bolivia's second female president, after Lidia Gueiler Tejada, who served as interim president in 1979-80 before being overthrown in a coup after the 1980 Bolivian general election. On 13 November, Salvatierra contended that √Å√±ez's resignation was not valid because the Senate had not accepted it, and therefore that she should not be able to assume the presidency by becoming president of the Senate. This prompted a further Senate session on 14 November, this time with MAS's involvement, that affirmed Salvatierra's resignation more formally and elected M√≥nica Eva Copa from the Movement for Socialism as the new president of the Senate. After √Å√±ez took office, the governments of Canada, Brazil, the European Union, Russia and the United States recognized her as the acting president of Bolivia. Amid a pledge to \\"rebuild democracy\\", √Å√±ez unveiled her new cabinet. Her senior ministers included prominent businesspeople from Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The first 11 members of her cabinet did not include any indigenous people, which The Guardian called a sign that she did \\"not intend to reach across the country's deep political and ethnic divide\\". Later appointments included two indigenous people. Morales's first cabinet was majority indigenous (14 out of 16 positions), but the number steadily declined, and by 2017 it contained only three indigenous members.  2019 Senkata and Sacaba attacks  On 15 November, amid continuing protests, violence and shortages in several main cities, A√±ez issued Decree 4078 to enlist the police and army to pacify the country. Article 3 of the decree reads, \\"The personnel of the Armed Forces who participate in operations to restore internal order and public stability will be exempt from criminal liability when, in compliance with their constitutional functions, they acted in legitimate defense or state of necessity, in observance of the principles of legality, absolute necessity and proportionality.\\" This decree was criticised by several human rights groups, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN Human Rights Commission, who all called for its immediate revocation. Amnesty International described it as \\"carte blanche\\" for human rights abuses. The same day, there was a confrontation close to Sacaba with pro-Morales protesters, mainly coca growers, attempting to cross a bridge on which a police cordon had been set up. Nine people were killed and 17 injured, 11 with bullet wounds. According to the preliminary OAS investigation, the group was initially met with verbal instructions that the UN Ombudsman‚Äôs Office was on its way to intervene. Moments later police and military officers allegedly opened fire on the civilians and attacked them with teargas and by beating and kicking them. The police report states that 201 people were involved in \\"violent acts\\" and 10 men were arrested for the \\"crimes of armed uprising, possession and carrying of firearms, and manufacture and trade of explosive and suffocating substances\\", and state authorities maintained that the police had not opened fire but that the protesters had shot one another. On 28 November, A√±ez repealed the controversial decree, but not before another massacre occurred in the Senkata district of El Alto, in which another nine people were killed and more injured. Protesters had blockaded the Senkata gas refinery plant in previous days. The government's response was, again, that it had not fired shots and had been under attack. In the immediate aftermath, seven people were arrested on charges of terrorism and sedition, specifically on destruction of part of the Senkata refinery wall, which the defence minister warned could have ended in a tragedy if gas tanks and other fuels exploded. √Å√±ez said, \\"We deeply regret the deaths of our brothers in El Alto. It hurts us because we are a government of peace\\", and called for dialogue with the protesters. In addition, she asked international organizations and the church to accompany this process in order to stop the violence. \\"Let's unite to reconcile, to build the Bolivia for which we are all fighting and so that one Bolivian is never above the other\\", √Å√±ez said. At the government's invitation, the IACHR investigated the deaths and injuries that occurred during this period of violence. On 10 December it published its preliminary observations, based on interviews conducted with eyewitnesses. It wrote, \\"it is appropriate to describe these events as massacres, given the number of people who lost their lives in the same way and at the same time and place, and because the acts in question were committed against a specific group of people. Furthermore, the patterns of injuries that have been recorded point strongly to extrajudicial killing practices\\". The report \\"reminded the Bolivian state that lethal force cannot be used merely to maintain or restore public order\\" and urged that those responsible be prosecuted, investigated, and sanctioned. On 7 December 2019, the government offered compensation of 50,000 Bolivianos ($7,500) to victims' families, with a clause that dictated that they must give up their right to file international judicial complaints on the matter. The families rejected the offer and human rights activist Ruth Llanos called it an attempt to \\"silence the complaints of the victims' families\\". After the IACHR's preliminary report and ongoing talks, the proposed agreement was changed to remove the clause that prevented international complaints, and the compensation offered was increased to 100,000 Bolivianos ($15,000) for families of those killed and from 12,500 to 50,000 Bolivianos for those injured, the amount depending on severity. By request of the families, the amount is to be given in humanitarian aid (including 12 months of food) rather than a single payment. A final agreement has not been reached as there is general mistrust that the government will follow through on its promises. As of 22 September 2020, 11 of 35 families have received this payment. Affected families also qualify for scholarships at the school and university level for the next academic year. On that same day, a tenth victim died of wounds from the Sacaba massacre. The Bolivian Human Rights Ombudsman said the victim had \\"not received any assistance and died completely abandoned by the state\\" and demanded compliance in particular with the parts of Supreme Decree 4100 that mandated the financial coverage of medical care for victims. They also denounced that, after seven months, no advances had yet been made into the investigation into the massacre, saying, \\"seven months after what happened, the victims are still waiting to receive justice for what happened and the compensation promised by the State.\\" In March 2020, the Plurinational Assembly convened a multi-party commission of members of MAS, PDC and UD to investigate the deaths at the two locations. Their findings were delayed until 20 August and further postponed until 27 September, and have still not been released. =Policies as president=  Political and electoral changes  Early on, √Å√±ez said that Morales would not be permitted to run for a fourth term, should he return to Bolivia. The Constitutional Court confirmed this, reversing its decision to overturn the 2016 Bolivian constitutional referendum (the results of the referendum barred all public figures from having an unlimited number of terms). This also prevented the vice president from running for a fourth term. The decision was further ratified on 23 November when a bill was approved by the legislature, both houses of which are dominated by Morales's Movement Toward Socialism party. On 23 November, √Å√±ez rejected a bill presented by Morales's party that would have prevented him and all others in his party from being tried for crimes committed during their tenures in office. \\"With respect to approving this bill in favor of those who have committed crimes and who now seek impunity, my decision is clear and firm: I will not promulgate this law\\", √Å√±ez said. The bill did not have MAS's full support; one member of the Chamber of Deputies said, \\"I ask the president [Morales] to reflect and really listen to the Bolivian people,\\" and claimed that for years the \\"oppressed wing\\" of MAS suffered discrimination from within the party. Since then, √Å√±ez's government has led numerous investigations into members of previous administration and those linked to them, charging many with corruption. Most of the charges involve embezzlement or misappropriation of state-owned companies and awarding state contracts where there was a conflict of interest. These include Entel, a state communications company that saw losses of $250 million and was called MAS's \\"petty cash\\", the Neurona case, the Bolivian Highway Administrator that saw $310 million disappear into uncompleted or unobserved projects, investments in state-owned petroleum projects that were not developed and the diversion of money from the Indigenous Fund. All these cases involve government ministers and several were subject to complaints from members of the opposition in the past. Corruption watchdogs have observed that corruption was common under the MAS government and continues to be a problem in the interim government. The number of prosecutions has led to accusations of political persecution from human rights groups. Similar observations were also made during the Morales era. In response, the government has said, \\"it must be remembered that the current judicial branch, be it the Supreme Court of Justice, the Constitutional Court, the Council of the Magistracy, all have been appointed by MAS and in other cases have been preselected by MAS.\\" On 10 December, √Å√±ez created a committee to facilitate the return of an estimated 1,300 political exiles created during Morales's presidency, saying, \\"The committee will not help people who are prosecuted for crimes against humanity or for drug trafficking.\\" These exiles include Manfred Reyes Villa, Mario Coss√≠o, Branko Marinkovic and Elsner Larraz√°bal. On 31 December 2019, √Å√±ez sent a bill to the Plurinational Legislative Assembly mandating that candidates take part in debates. She said of electoral debate, \\"it is an obligation. Democracy thrives on freedom and the freedom to be responsible requires information\\". During the almost 14 years that Morales ruled Bolivia, he never debated another candidate. This bill was rejected by the opposition-controlled Assembly; √Å√±ez appealed to it to reconsider, on the grounds of \\"making democracy\\". On 8 January 2020, the government decided to ratify the 22 January public holiday Morales created to celebrate the founding of the Plurinational State of Bolivia via the 2009 constitution. On that day the president of Bolivia normally addresses the nation, but doubt had been expressed whether the holiday would go ahead due to its strong connection with Morales and MAS. In a public statement, minister for the Presidency Yerko N√∫√±ez said, \\"January 22 is a holiday by presidential decree. We are going to respect that decree and our president is evaluating if she is going to make a report about the pillars of this government, which are transition, pacification and management.\\" √Å√±ez gave the traditional address, in which she thanked the indigenous people of Bolivia for \\"having accompanied the process with wisdom and firm decision\\". On 6 March 2020, The Washington Post reported that \\"Since being sworn in, the fiercely anti-socialist √Å√±ez has presided over the detention of hundreds of opponents, the muzzling of journalists and a 'national pacification' campaign that has left at least 31 people dead, according to the national ombudsman and human rights groups\\". On 7 June 2020, The New York Times echoed this, writing that √Å√±ez's government \\"has persecuted the former president‚Äôs supporters, stifled dissent and worked to cement its hold on power\\".  Social policy  On 6 February 2020, √Å√±ez invited the people of Bolivia to attend a march in Santa Cruz in support of the fight against violence against women and children, an issue increasingly highlighted by the Bolivian press. On International Women's Day, 8 March 2020, √Å√±ez announced a $100 million investment in the fight against violence against women. She declared 2020 the Year of the Fight Against Feminicide and Infanticide in Bolivia, saying, \\"I am the worst news for all those murderers of women, users of violence, abusers, stalkers and rapists, because I will not get tired of closing against these aggressors\\".  Foreign policy  According to The Straits Times, √Å√±ez's government has \\"denounced foreign influence in the country since taking power, naming Colombians, Peruvians, Cubans and Venezuelans at different times... blaming foreigners for provoking violent clashes during post-election violence.\\" Bolivia has had long-standing problems with foreign groups involved in organised crime, largely the drug trade. Police arrested an Argentine national and fugitive since 2017, Facundo Morales Schoenfeld, in the eastern province of Santa Cruz. He was previously a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and was among the protesters in Yapacan√≠. Facundo Morales's family contests the government's version of events, claiming that he worked in Bolivia as a photojournalist and that his detention is arbitrary. Around the same time, four Cubans were discovered in El Alto with 90,000 Bs ($13,000) in two backpacks. Venezuelan migrants, fleeing the unrest in their country, were subject to accusations of \\"political activity\\" and involvement in criminal activities under the Morales government, with human rights groups expressing concern about persecution of Venezuelans in Bolivia. While police and interim government ministers have cited involvement of armed and politically aligned Venezuelans in pro-Morales protests, they have also granted Venezuelan refugees amnesty, extended permanence and transit of Venezuelan citizens, and approved a resolution to help Venezuelan children and adolescents. On 27 November 2019, Bolivia expelled 702 Cuban doctors. The Cuban doctor program had been controversial in Bolivia in previous years, with the Bolivian medical workers union (FESIMRAS) complaining that Cubans needed only a simple photocopy to practice medicine whereas the requirements for Bolivians were much more stringent, and that many medical professionals were unemployed. √Å√±ez's government said that the Cuban embassy was paid $147 million over 13 years for the program; Medical College of La Paz president Luis Larrea said there was \\"indiscriminate use of state assets, the waste of state money deposited in private accounts to supposedly pay Cubans, when these resources should be in a fiscal account\\", and that Bolivian doctors felt \\"belittled\\". There have also been suggestions that only 205 of the 702 Cubans were doctors, the others working as drivers, technicians and in other areas that had nothing to do with medicine \\"but were assigned salaries of 1,032 dollars\\" as if they were doctors, and that documents for these workers were falsified. The former head of the Cuban doctors program in Bolvia, Carlos de la Rocha, faces charges of breach of duties, destruction of documents, theft, and other crimes. He maintains his innocence. √Å√±ez's government has explicitly signaled an attempt to disassociate itself from countries that were political allies of Morales and \\"anti-imperialist ideology\\". Chancellor Karen Longaric said, \\"The relationship with Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba was aimed at consolidating an ideological current that had a geopolitical project. Bolivia did not benefit at all. It has always contributed more than it received and we are a developing country that cannot afford to make contributions or invest outside the country and sustaining other economies\\", adding, \\"Bolivia did not want to participate in the association agreements with the EU, unlike Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, which did and that benefited, for example, with the elimination of visas to travel to Europe. Bolivia at the time moved away demonizing free trade agreements and treaties.\\" √Å√±ez recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as acting president of Venezuela in the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, 24 hours after he took office. Her government also severed diplomatic relations with Venezuela's Maduro government, giving its diplomats 72 hours to leave the country. √Å√±ez has called on Guaid√≥ to appoint a new Venezuelan ambassador to Bolivia, \\"who will be recognized immediately by our government.\\" A month later, √Å√±ez's government announced Bolivia's entry into the Lima Group, a regional bloc established in 2017 with the purpose of finding a way out of the Venezuelan crisis. The Bolivian foreign ministry said in a statement that it hoped to \\"contribute to a peaceful, democratic and constitutional solution to the crisis in Venezuela, which must be guided by the Venezuelan people.\\" The same month, her government announced that it would give refuge to 200 Venezuelans \\"who have fled their country for reasons of political order, of political persecution promoted by the Nicol√°s Maduro government.\\" An intention to move away from the previous government's ideology was further highlighted in the closure and replacement of the General Juan Jos√© Torres Anti-Imperialist Command School, an institution that made many military and political opponents uneasy as it was viewed as an attempt to align the military to a political ideology more sympathetic to the MAS party. A ministry of defense press release stated, \\"The core of the teaching focuses on anti-imperialist content with different components for the benefit of sergeants, second lieutenants, lieutenants, captains and above\\". Taking and passing these courses was compulsory to gain promotions. In 2016, the defence minister of Nicaragua, Martha Ruiz Sevilla, and of Venezuela, the controversial Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez, attended its opening. √Å√±ez's government had previously made it no longer compulsory to shout the phrase Patria o muerte (\\"Fatherland or death\\") during military activities. In 2010, Morales had integrated the phrase, popularised by Fidel Castro in a 1960 speech, into the military, replacing the traditional subordinaci√≥n y constancia, viva Bolivia hacia el mar (\\"subordination and constancy, long live Bolivia towards the sea\\").  Terrorists and Drugs  On 3 December 2019, the formation of a new anti-terrorist group, Grupo Anti- Terrorista (GAT), was announced to combat terrorist groups and narcotics traffickers.  Coronavirus in Bolivia  Since early March 2020, √Å√±ez has implemented numerous controls for the COVID-19 pandemic, including closing all borders, prohibiting all international and interdepartmental flights, a strict nationwide curfew and restricting driving to those transporting foods and supplies and those carrying out essential services. During total quarantine, the population was restricted to their homes except for one day a week, determined by national ID card, for essentials and emergencies. So-called \\"mobile markets\\" are in operation to bring goods into neighbourhoods. The crisis had also resulted in the postponement of the 2020 Bolivian general election, the delay having been agreed upon by all parties involved. On 21 April 2020, √Å√±ez and her cabinet pledged to donate 50% of their monthly salary to a fund to help those affected by the pandemic and encouraged other parliamentarians to do the same. The president's monthly salary is Bs 24,251 ($3,520); that of a Minister of State Bs 21,556 ($3,130); and that of a Vice Minister Bs 20,210 ($2,930). The initial sum is Bs 250,000 ($36,290) per month. There is also an account managed by the ministry of health that anyone can donate to. On 13 May 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights asked the Bolivian government to modify Supreme Decree 4231, which was passed during the pandemic, stating, \\"Supreme Decree 4231 about the diffusion of information during the pandemic must be modified in order to not criminalize freedom of expression and make it completely compatible with the government's international obligations.\\" √Å√±ez repealed the decree the next day. The United Nations High Commission on Human Rights in Bolivia praised \\"the openness and willingness of the authorities to the concerns of national and international actors.\\" The IACHR also welcomed the decision, with presidential candidate Carlos Mesa calling it a \\"citizen victory\\". As of 15 September 2020, the government had paid 12.8 million bonds totalling 5.76 billion BOB ($840 million) to support those suffering from the quarantine and affected by later closures and poor economic climate. This was claimed by all households in extreme poverty and 90-96% of those in moderate poverty. The payments continued and included support for families, students, the elderly and the disabled. The government also pledged to pay domestic electricity and water tariffs from April through June 2020 to ease families' economic burdens. Eight in 10 households received a 100% discount in May. On 9 July 2020, it was announced that √Å√±ez had tested positive for SARS-COV2. On Twitter the next week, she announced that she and her son who had also tested positive were in good health. 2020 presidential candidacy On 5 December 2019, √Å√±ez stated that she would not run or support any candidate in the upcoming presidential election. Minister for the Presidency Yerko N√∫√±ez reiterated this on 15 January 2020, saying, \\"[√Å√±ez] will not be a candidate. The President has stated on several occasions she will not be a candidate. This is a government of peace, transition, and management because you can not stop the state apparatus.\\" Nevertheless, √Å√±ez announced her candidacy on 24 January 2020. A Los Tiempos poll found that, while 43% of respondents considered her to have done a \\"good or very good\\" job as interim president (compared to 27% bad or very bad), only 24% of respondents believed that she should run in the upcoming election. In the same poll, 63% of respondents agreed with the statement that \\"as interim president, Jeanine √Å√±ez should call elections and not take advantage of her power to become a presidential candidate.\\" Her running mate, who was previously critical of her decision to run for president, is Samuel Doria Medina, a former presidential candidate and leader of the centre-left National Unity Front party. They are standing under the newly formed Juntos alliance. On 17 September 2020, √Å√±ez withdrew from the presidential race, saying the opposition needed to consolidate to beat front- runner Luis Arce, who represents Morales's Movement for Socialism. Race relations Around 41% of Bolivia's population identifies as indigenous, and this population often encounters discrimination, mainly related to poverty and ethnicity. After the 2006 election of Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia, polarization between the indigenous peoples and others increased as Bolivia's political system shifted from left-right politics to indigenous- urbanist politics. Shortly after √Å√±ez's inauguration, her opponents circulated tweets dating back to 2013. These tweets, directed at indigenous peoples, have been called \\"racist\\" by The Guardian and \\"provocative\\" by The New York Times. On Twitter, √Å√±ez called the Aymara people's New Year celebration \\"satanic\\" and said that \\"nobody can replace God\\", and she implied that indigenous people were not genuine for wearing shoes. She later said, \\"I‚Äôve seen a couple of tweets that I never wrote and that we already stated were false\\" and that she never made \\"ill-intentioned\\" comments. Agence France-Presse confirmed that three of the four circulated tweets were legitimate. In the opening days of her presidency, Mar√≠a Galindo, an anarcha-feminist and psychologist, called √Å√±ez's government \\"anti-indigenous.\\" Of √Å√±ez, she later said that \\"her hatred of the Indian is of all hatreds the most painful, because it is a hatred of herself\\", referring to √Å√±ez's mestizo background. Galindo is equally critical of Morales with regard to indigenous rights, calling him a \\"fraudulently indigenous president who tramples on the rights conquered in decades by the indigenous peoples of the East.\\" As acting president, √Å√±ez has kept wiphala, the flag of indigenous Bolivian communities, as a co-official flag of Bolivia, as it had been under Morales, declaring that she was committed to the fundamental task of \\"highlighting the unity [of the] plural and diverse\\" nation of Bolivia. In addition to the wiphala, she has the patuj√∫ flag displayed prominently.Colocan la bandera de la Flor del Patuj√∫ junto a la wiphala y la tricolor en Palacio Quemado  EL DEBER The patuj√∫ is a symbol of Bolivia's eastern indigenous peoples. This flag was also adopted by indigenous opposition to Morales during the TIPNIS protests.Radio Patuj√∫ 95.2 FM: IM√ÅGENES \\"POR EL TIPNIS NO\\" On 26 November 2019, √Å√±ez was presented with and wore a red poncho (a traditional Andean garment worn by community leaders) by representatives of the indigenous community upon the inauguration of Rafael Quispe as director of the Fund for Indigenous Development.A√±ez viste poncho andino obsequiado por comunarios  Los Tiempos On 28 January 2020, she signed a bill to provide cultural recognition to the seven different identities of the country's indigenous women. After signing, she said, \\"This bill is a demonstration of the value of the pollera woman as the main character in the fight for the equality of indigenous, rural, migrant and mestizo women\\", adding, \\"the principle of equality must transcend laws and transform society and create more opportunities for indigenous and rural women.\\" On 26 September 2020, at a ceremony attended by indigenous leaders, √Å√±ez apologized on behalf of the state for the oppression and violence suffered by indigenous peoples of the TIPNIS region nine years earlier under the Morales government, saying, \\"the right of the [indigenous] peoples to self-determination deserves permanent respect from the those in power.\\" Personal life At age 23 √Å√±ez married Tadeo Ribera Bruckner, a lawyer and a former mayor of Trinidad, the capital of Beni, representing the Uni√≥n C√≠vica Solidaridad (UCS) party. They had two children together, Carolina (born 1990) and Jos√© Armando (born 1995). Ribera died in Santa Cruz de la Sierra on 29 January 2020. √Å√±ez's second husband is H√©ctor Hernando Hincapi√© Carvajal, a Colombian from Tolima. He is a politician in the Colombian Conservative Party. Hincapi√© ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Colombian Senate in 2018, and as a member of the Tolima regional assembly and House of Representatives in 2010 and 2014 respectively. Until recently, they travelled between Bolivia and Colombia to see one another, although this has become easier since his failure to win a seat in 2018. √Å√±ez describes herself as a Christian, and held up a large Bible while declaring herself the interim president; The Guardian called this an \\"explicit rebuke\\" of Morales, who has a strained history with the Catholic Church. Political analyst Carlos Cordero stated, \\"She is a believer, but she does not use her religiosity politically, she expresses it, she lives it.\\" Notes  References   External links  *Jeanine A√±ez Ch√°vez *Biography by CIDOB Category:1967 births Category:21st-century women politicians Category:Bolivian politicians Category:Bolivian Christians Category:Female heads of government Category:Living people Category:Members of the Senate of Bolivia Category:People from Beni Department Category:Presidents of Bolivia Category:Women members of the Senate of Bolivia Category:Women presidents ","title":"Jeanine √Å√±ez"},{"id":"62310339","title":"2019‚Äì20 Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns women's basketball team"},{"id":"62310409","text":"Jemma Dallender (born 4 June 1988) is an English film and television actress.

Profile @ RKD Biography He was one of eight children born on his family's estate in a small village near Bia≈Çystok. His father, Roman (1826-1906), served as a Justice of the Peace. His mother, Maria (1835-1912), was a niece of the novelist and feminist, Narcyza ≈ªmichowska, who advised her not to marry Roman. Poor management caused their farm to fail and the family moved to Warsaw, where his mother opened a tailor shop and gave piano lessons. From 1874 to 1876, he studied at the Realschule there. Then, in 1878, when his father found work as a railway clerk, he was able to enter the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology. However, he also attended classes at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts and soon abandoned his technical studies. He was awarded a small silver medal for his paintings in 1882. The following year, he took specialized classes in landscape and battle painting.

He served the position only for 10 months, but he made a remarkable accomplishment in 1988, with Seoul Olympics approaching, by lifting the ban on works by 100 writers who had defected or had been kidnapped to North Korea.After the Korean War, the South Korean government strictly banned books related to leftist ideologies. In 1951, the government issued the list of 75 writers who defected to the North and prohibited publication and any activity associated with them. In addition, it was not allowed to mention the names of the writers who defected to the North and the names of those who were kidnapped to the North were not allowed to be printed. The cultural communities strengthened their self-monitoring activities by issuing a list of 100 people who had leftist ideology.

It was said that he was so passionate for complete Korean literature including literature of the two Koreas that he taught poems by North Korean poets without revealing their names during his lecture.

He succeeded Metropolitan Pavle Nenadoviƒá. He assumed the office of the Metropolitan of Karlovci in a dramatic period (1769-1773) when orders were issued from the highest place for a revision of the Orthodox calendar. It was at a time when prelates of the Metropolitan See of Karlovci were powerful \\"Princes of the Church,\\" though their power gradually diminished with the passage of time, though they had considerable influence on the Austrian court at the time. The Metropolitanate tended to look towards Imperial Russia when things were wanting in Austria and the same the other way around. In 1770 the Austrian authorities finally issued the necessary permits for the establishment of a Serb Cyrillic press in Vienna (given to Josef von Kurzb√∂ck) with the proviso that there be no more importation of books from Imperial Russia, an aim of lessening Russian influence among the Serbs. At the request of Empress Maria Theresa to reduce the number of religious holidays celebrated by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, as many as fifty-six feast days were abolished in the Orthodox calendar, thanks to the expedient efforts of Metropolitan Georgijeviƒá. It was a measure that caused great discontent among Serbian critics of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, though Georgijeviƒá was least fazed by it because he believed that it was for the best. Also, he was a great benefactor of Serbian art as well as an eloquent interpreter of national ideas in all foreign-occupied areas of the Empire populated by Serbs. He wrote and disseminated religious and secular literature in cities, towns, villages and all remote rural regions contributing to the advancement of education and literacy among his people and their co-religionists, Vlahs and Greeks. In addition, he commissioned three important engravings for the needs of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, where the first attempts at reforming Church Cyrillic in 1762 were made.

History In 2013, Jabhat Thuwar Saraqib was jointly in control of the city of Saraqib through a city council administered alongside Ahrar al-Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra. On 8 July 2014, the group released a statement, stating the group's concern over a large rebel convoy abandoning front lines against the Syrian government, however Jabhat Thuwar Saraqib did not mention the rebel group by name but it was believed to be referencing Liwa Dawud, a group also from Saraqib which defected to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant after the group's 130 vehicle convoy switched directions from Aleppo to ISIL's capital in Raqqa to join it. In August 2014, the group was involved in a joint campaign in northern Hama code named \\"Greater Badr al-Sham raid\\" alongside the al-Nusra Front and several other Free Syrian Army and opposition groups to drive Syrian government forces out of Mahardah, and clashed with the National Defence Forces based in a monastery in the town that had been shelled by the FSA. In 2015, a member of the group fired his gun in the air after a football match after the team he was a fan of missed a goal and lost the game, however firearms were banned at the field in Idlib where the game was played. In December 2016, Mohammed Abu Trad, one the group's commanders announced that the group would merge with any faction that he described as \\"loyal to God and homeland\\" after it was announced that several FSA groups and Ahrar al-Sham had formed a unified military council in Idlib. In July 2017, Jabhat Thuwar Saraqib negotiated a cease-fire between Ahrar al-Sham and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham during fighting between the two in Saraqib. The group also released a statement saying that it would fight all hostile forces in Saraqib and that they wish for Saraqib to be excluded from the fighting between HTS and Ahrar al-Sham. Despite negotiating a cease-fire between Ahrar al-Sham and HTS, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham later stormed the headquarters of Jabhat Thuwar Saraqib and reportedly killed a media activist affiliated with the group during the raid.

The name \\"tomako\\" is used in New Georgia in the Roviana language. It is also known as magoru in Marovo, niabara in Vella Lavella, mon in Bougainville, ora in Makira, and iola or ola in Malaita and Ulawa. Tomako were narrow and usually between in length. They did not possess outriggers or sails and were propelled solely by paddling. They were built by fitting planks edge-to-edge which are then \\"sewn\\" together and caulked with a paste made from the nut of the tree Parinarium laurinum. They could carry 30 to 50 warriors, and were used in raiding expeditions for slaves or for headhunting. They were characteristically crescent-shaped, with sharply upturned prows and sterns (reaching up to high) that were decorated with fringes of cowrie shells, nautilus shells, and mother-of-pearl, as well as intricate carvings (Roviana: nguzunguzu; Marovo: toto isu). These carvings are usually of spirit animals or warriors like the kesoko (a bird or sea spirit) and Tiolo (a warrior deity). The body is commonly blackened to contrast with the decorations. Tomako usually took 2 to 3 years to build using traditional stone and shell adzes. They were kept in sacred houses known as paele, which also housed human heads taken during battle. Tomako is similar to the lisi, another common boat type in the Solomon Islands which also lacks outriggers, but differs in that the topmost strakes of the lisi have a gap in the middle. It also resembles the orembai of the Maluku Islands, except the latter usually has a sail. The last canoes used for war were confiscated by British authorities in the early 1900s to stop headhunting raids. It was eventually bought by a private German collector. However, new canoes were built at around 1910-1912. They were used for canoe-racing, encouraged by the British government to preserve the traditional boat-building practices. In the 11th Festival of Pacific Arts in 2012 hosted by the Solomon Islands, several Tomako were built and displayed.

History Acipcoville was named for the American Cast Iron Pipe Company, which built a community around it. In 1905, southern investors organized and wholly financed ACIPCO in Atlanta. They selected Birmingham as the site for a new pipe plant and in 1906 constructed a pipe foundry, powerhouse and machine shop and \\"Quarters for about 40 black families. Guided by John J. Eagan, principal stockholder and first president, the company succeeded from the start. Under Eagan's leadership, it also inaugurated a now- celebrated program of corporate welfare benefits. The first of these benefits was a bathhouse constructed in 1912 at the plant site. From its inception in 1905, the company established a tradition for innovative pipemaking practices. During World War I, ACIPCO experimented with the direct delivery of molten pig iron from the blast furnaces of Republic Steel Corporation's Thomas plant to its pipemaking foundry. In the early 1920s when the Birmingham District led the industry in the adoption of centrifugal casting techniques, ACIPCO developed the Moore method of centrifugal casting in sand-lined molds. Company President John H. Eagan's Plan of Business Administration, which became permanent company policy in 1924, featured employee profit sharing. Eagan's profit sharing idea became a model widely emulated in American industry. In 1921, Eagan brought workers into corporate management and, in 1922, created a profit-sharing arrangement. At his death, he created a permanent trust of all the company's common stock. ACIPCO's operation has continued as a beneficial trust ever since.

History The group was established by Saddam al-Khalifa and Rashid Tukwa and held a strong presence in the eastern countryside of the Hama Governorate, but the group also operated in the Aleppo and Idlib Governorates in northwestern Syria. After the breakout of fighting between ISIL and other anti-government factions the group distanced itself from both ISIL and the Free Syrian Army, however continued to hold ties to ISIL and handle ISIL's affairs in areas of Hama underneath their control. However after al-Nusra and other opposition groups expelled ISIL from northwestern Syria, Saddam al-Khilafah allegedly pledged allegiance to ISIL secretly. On 30 March 2014, the Islamic Punishment Brigade attacked a Syrian government checkpoint near Khanasir, with heavy and medium weapons, reportedly killing several Syrian army soldiers then withdrew from the area. The Free Syrian Army's Hama Military Council said that the attack was carried out in order to relieve pressure from the then ongoing rebel offensive to take Murak. In October 2014, the group stoned a woman in Hama for committing adultery. On 17 October 2014, after the break out of fighting between al-Nusra and the Syrian Revolutionaries Front, the Islamic Punishment Brigade joined the conflict on the side of al-Nusra against SRF and fought alongside them in the Jabal Zawiya and Maarrat al-Nu'man against SRF, allegedly to exploit the conflict and help expand ISIL's influence in Idlib and facilitate its return to northwestern Syria by fighting SRF and the western-backed Hazzm Movement that SRF was allied with against al-Nusra. Soon after however al-Nusra established checkpoints near the then besieged Abu al-Duhur Military Airbase, and arrested members of the Islamic Punishment Brigade. On 23 December 2014, Jabhat al-Nusra raided the group's headquarters in Qasr Ibn Wardan because of the group's closeness with ISIL. During the raid the group's leader Saddam al- Khalifa was captured by al-Nusra and several of the Punishment Brigade's fighters were killed in heavy clashes with al-Nusra in Qasr Ibn Wardan that began on the previous day. On 25 December 2014, the group beheaded the nephew of Syria's defense minister, Fahd Jassem al-Freij in Hama, activists claim Freij's nephew was a member of the Shabiha and was involved in massacres against civilians.

The university plans to situate its campus in the East Bayfront neighbourhood of downtown Toronto, near the Toronto waterfront. The university was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in April 2018, although it did not offer its first academic program until September 2019. The institution plans to accept its first cohort of full-time students in 2021.  History  Efforts to establish a Francophone university in central and southwestern Ontario emerged during the 2010s, with several Franco-Ontarian groups, including the Francophone Assembly of Ontario, releasing a report that recommended the creation of a Francophone university within that region on 3 October 2014. A private member's bill to establish a Francophone university was later introduced in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on 26 May 2015. However, the bill failed to pass as the legislature was prorogued. While the legislature was prorogued, a report released from the French Post-Secondary Education Advisory Committee in Central and Southwestern Ontario noted that post-secondary Francophone services were insufficient in central and southwestern Ontario, and recommended establishing a Francophone university within Greater Toronto to help rectify the issue. The private member's bill was reintroduced on 21 September 2016, after the legislature reconvened. On 22 September, a planning committee was created to help establish the institution, and included the former federal Commissioner of Official Languages; members from other Toronto-based universities including Ryerson University and the University of Toronto; the president of the provincial French-language public broadcaster TFO; and members from other Ontario-based Francophone organizations. The legislation to establish the institution, the Universit√© de l‚ÄôOntario fran√ßais Act, 2017 was passed in 14 December 2017, and formally went into effect on 9 April 2018.Universit√© de l‚ÄôOntario fran√ßais Act, 2017, S.O. 2017, c. 34, Sched. 43 (English); Loi de 2017 sur l‚ÄôUniversit√© de l‚ÄôOntario fran√ßais, L.O. 2017, c. 34, ann. 43 (fran√ßais). Normand Labrie was named as the institution's interim president on 4 July 2018; and served the position until August 2020, when Andr√© Roy took his position as the university's first formal president. Members of the university's board of governors were appointed on 31 December 2018. However, following the 2018 Ontario general election, the newly formed Progressive Conservative government had announced plans to cancel funding for the establishment of the institution. The issue of funding became a major political issue for the new government among the province's Franco-Ontarian residents. However, in September 2019, the governments of Ontario and Canada announced they had signed a memorandum of understanding, which would see both governments provide C$126 million to fund the institution over the following eight years. The university offered its first academic program in September 2019, a higher education pedagogy program offered to student teachers at Coll√®ge La Cit√©. The university's first graduate certificates were issued for those who completed the program. The institution plans to accept its first cohort of full-time students in fall 2021. Campus The Universit√© de l'Ontario fran√ßais is situated in downtown Toronto, near the shoreline of Lake Ontario. The university plans to situate its first campus within 9 Lower Jarvis Street, a high-rise in the East Bayfront neighbourhood of downtown Toronto. The university plans to lease of space within the building, with plans to open the campus to the public by June 2021. Administration The governance of the university is conducted through the board of governors and the university senate, both of which were established in the Universit√© de l'Ontario fran√ßais Act, 2017. The board of governors is responsible for governing and managing the university. The board's members includes the university's administration, faculty, student body, and members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council for Ontario. The senate is responsible for the university's academic and education policy, including standards for admission and qualifications for degrees, diplomas, and certificates issued by the university. The university's president and vice-chancellor serves as the university's chief executive officer, with Andr√© Roy assuming the position as the university's first president on 1 August 2020. The board of governors is also empowered to appoint a chancellor, who acts as the ceremonial head of the institution. However, the university has not yet appointed a person to the position. Academics The official instructional language of the university is French. The university is the province's first public university where French is the sole official language of the institution.

It is the land that surrounds (and excludes) the suburbs of Mount Isa. In the , the locality of Mount Isa had a population of 118 people.  Geography  The shape of the locality can be loosely be described as a doughnut (torus) where the \\"hole\\" is the excluded urban area of Mount Isa, consisting of the suburbs (from north to south): Kalkadoona, Lanskey, Ryan, Soldiers Hill, Winston, Sunset, Menzies, Pioneer, Miles End, Fisher, The Gap, Mount Isa City, Breakaway, Townview, Parkside, Mornington, Healy, Happy Valley, Mica Creek and Spreadborough. The Mount Isa Mines facility is in the locality immediately west of the surburbs (from north to south): Kalkdoon, Soldiers Hill, Miles End, Parkside, Happy Valley and Mica Creek. The suburbs are separated from the mine facility by the Mount Isa railway line with the Mount Isa railway station in Station Street, Miles End (), almost on the boundary between that suburb and the Mount Isa locality and the mine facility. The railway line exits the urban area at Mica Creek. Although the line is heading to Cloncurry to the east, the line travels south and exits the locality via Waverley, and then passes through Duchess and Kuridala. This indirect route is to avoid the Mount Godwin Range. The Barkly Highway enter the locality from the west (Cloncurry), passes through the Mount Godwin Range and enters the urban area at Breakway. It exits the urban area at Kalkadoon and continues north, exiting the locality at Gunpowder. The Mount Isa Duchess Road exits the urban area at Spreadborough and travels south-east exiting the locality at Duchess. The Boulia Mount Isa Highway commences just west of Mica Creek and travels south exiting the locality at Waverley.  History  The locality takes its name from the city, the name of which was suggested by prospector John Campbell Mills who established the first mineral lease in the area in February 1923. It is thought to be a corruption of Mount Ida, the mining town in Western Australia.

She was the first woman to translate Russian literature to Japanese.  Early life and education  Senuma was born Ikuko Yamada on December 11, 1875 in what is now Takasaki, Gunma. She grew up as a member of the Eastern Orthodox church, and attended a religious girls' school in Surugadai, Tokyo. She earned excellent grades and graduated in 1892. After graduation she began writing for a literary magazine, and was published in many issues. In 1896 she received Russian books from Nicholas of Japan, and learned to read them with the help of Senuma Kakusaburo, a priest at the Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral. They married in 1897 and had six children.  Career  Kakusaburo introduced her to Ozaki K≈çy≈ç, who took her on as a disciple and welcomed her into his literary group. She published many of her early translations jointly with him until his death in 1903. Senuma was also on the staff of the Seito feminist literary magazine. Senuma primarily translated works by Anton Chekov and Fyodor Dostoevsky. She was the first Japanese woman to translate directly from Russian to Japanese during a time when many Japanese translators translated from English. One of her most well-known translations was a partial translation of Dostoevsky's Poor Folk, from which she only translated Varvara's story. She also translated Chekov's Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard, Aleksei Nicholaevich Budischev's Northeast Wind, and works by Ivan Turgenev. Her penname was Senuma Kay≈ç. She visited Russia twice, once in 1909 and again in 1911. There is some concern that some of her translations, most notably an incomplete translation of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, were actually translated by her husband. Scholar Satoko Kan suggests that while Anna Karenina was probably translated by Kakusaburo, Poor Folk was not.

It might also have been derived from the common name Heinz, or from the followers of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, Henry I K≈ëszegi, or Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, under whose reigns the settlers came.; Hugo Kastner: Von Aachen bis Zypern.

The Two-Day Republic On December 5th, 1918, two weeks after the German-Austrian Provisional National Assembly demanded the self-determination of German-speaking settlements in Western Hungary, Social Democratic politician Hans Suchard, with the help of workers and local Social Democrats in Mattersburg, proclaimed the Republic of Heinzenland. This was done, apparently, without sufficient knowledge of power relations in the region. This might have been done to bring the German- speaking parts of Western Hungary under Austrian control.August Ernst: Geschichte des Burgenlandes, R. Oldenbourg Verlag Munich, 1991. . However, one day later, the Hungarian military and Sopron vigilantes put an end to the Republic, quickly occupying its territory. Suchard was arrested and sentenced to death.

The line operates every 30‚Äì40 minutes on weekdays and 60 minutes on weekends. V12 trips are roughly 35 minutes long. Background Route V12 operates daily between Addison Road station and Suitland station connecting Capitol Heights, Coral Hills, Walker Mill, District Heights, Suitland neighborhoods to both stations. Route V12 currently operates out of Landover division. History Route V12 was created as a brand new Metrobus route by WMATA on December 3, 1978 to replace the former B12 Metrobus route that was discontinued. Unlike the B12 which operated between Federal Triangle in Downtown Washington D.C. (11th Street NW and E Street NW) & the Penn Mar Shopping Center, V12 would operate as part of the Pennsylvania Avenue-Maryland Line, between the newly opened Potomac Avenue station & Penn Mar Shopping Center, via Potomac Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Donnell Drive. The B12 former routing between the intersection of Potomac Avenue SE & Pennsylvania Avenue SE and Federal Triangle was replaced by the Pennsylvania Avenue Line (routes 32, 34, and 36). =1981 Changes= On January 4, 1981 two months after Addison Road station opened, route V12 was truncated to only operate between Potomac Avenue and Addison Road stations. The segment along Pennsylvania Avenue between Silver Hill Road and Penn Mar Shopping Center was replaced by the existing K12 and K19, and new routes V14, and V15. Route V11 was also discontinued on the same day. As a result of the change in V12's routing, V12 was renamed the Addison Road-Potomac Avenue Line. New routes V14 and V15 would operate along the former V12 routing between Addison Road station and Penn Mar Shopping Center via the Coral Hills, District Heights, and Forestville neighborhoods, while also operating through Capitol Heights. =2001 Changes= On January 13, 2001 when Suitland station opened, the V12's routing was truncated even further to only operate between the Addison Road and Suitland stations. V12's routing between Addison Road and Potomac Avenue stations, was replaced by a new route V11 which would only operate on early Saturday morning trips prior to Metro's opening. As a result of these route changes, the Addison Road‚ÄìPotomac Avenue Line, was renamed the District Heights‚ÄìSuitland Line. =2007 Changes= On June 24, 2007, route V11 was discontinued as both the Blue & Orange Line trains began operating during the earlier times on Saturday mornings. =2014 Proposed Changes= In 2014, it was proposed for the P12 and V12 to swap routings between Addison Road station and the intersection of Addison Road and Walker Mill Road which will provide a more direct route for the P12 as the V12 is focused to become a neighborhood focused route. This was because swapping P12 and V12 routing on Wheeler Road and Shady Glen Drive will provide a more direct route for the P12 as the V12 is already designed to be a more neighborhood-focused service. =2015 Changes= On June 21, 2015 as part of Metro's \\"Better Bus Service\\" initiative, routes P12 and V12 swapped their routing between the intersection of Addison Road and Walker Mill Road and Addison Road station. Route P12 would operate along Addison Road while route V12 would operate along Shady Glen Drive, Walker Mill Road, and Central Avenue. Route P12 became a more direct route while route V12 a neighborhood- focused route. =2020 Proposed changes= On September 26, 2020, WMATA proposed to eliminate all route V12 Sunday service due to low federal funding. Route V12 has not operated on Sundays since March 15, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He is Professor Emeritus of Integrative Biology and Curator of Amphibians and Reptiles at Oregon State University, Corvallis. He has served as president of the Society for the Study of Evolution and the American Society of Naturalists. Arnold was elected a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society in 1992 and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed articles.  Early life and education  Arnold was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on 11 October 1944, and grew up in southern California. He enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley in 1962, declared a major in Zoology and immediately began working in the herpetology laboratory at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, under the supervision of Robert C. Stebbins. Graduating from Berkeley in 1966, he took the Organization for Tropical Studies ecology course that summer and began graduate school at the University of Michigan in the fall. He studied the evolution of courtship behavior in salamanders for his doctoral dissertation, supervised by Arnold G. Kluge. In 1971, he moved back to Berkeley to begin a Miller Postdoctoral Fellowship with David B. Wake, launching a new research program on the behavioral ecology of garter snakes. He is the brother of former baseball player Christopher Paul Arnold.  Career  Arnold joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1973. A year later he moved to the University of Chicago, where he was a faculty member for the next 23 years. During this period, he was especially influenced by his colleagues Michael J. Wade and Russell Lande as his interests moved in the direction of evolutionary quantitative genetics. Those interests continued to develop after he moved to Oregon State University in 1997 as chair of the Department of Zoology. That administrative work ended in 2002, and he became curator of the amphibians and reptiles in the Oregon State Natural History Collections. Arnold served as the President of Society for the Study of Evolution in 1998, and of the American Society of Naturalists in 2012. He has been the Co-chair of OSU research collections since 1997, where he oversees and supervises research collections at OSU. Arnold was an Associate Editor of Evolution from 1981 to 1983 and of Theoretical Population Biology from 1988 to 1991. From 2004 to 2009, he was the Director of Oregon State Arthropod Collection.  Work  Arnold's work has been mainly focused in the field of evolutionary quantitative genetics, specifically on evolution of phenotypic traits (body size, morphology, behavior, whole organismal performance) that are affected by many genes. Arnold has also made key contributions to the understanding of how polygenic mutation and inheritance evolve. Arnold has developed a variety of quantitative methods in evolutionary quantitative genetics. In 1983, he co-authored 'The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters', with Russell Lande. The paper has been cited over 4000 times. He has also developed novel methods to characterize behavioral variation in natural populations,Arnold, Stevan J. 1981. ‚ÄúBehavioral variation in natural populations. I.

History  The Soyuz station was opened on December 3, 1982, during the 28th Soviet Antarctic expedition as a support base for prospecting in the Prince Charles Mountains during the summer season. Scientists stationed in it conducted geological and geophysical research. Meteorological research was also regularly conducted there, mainly for the needs of aviation. The more accessible Dru≈ænaja 4 Station, located on the coast, provided logistical support for the Soyuz station. The station was closed on February 28, 1989, in connection with the changes accompanying the collapse of the USSR.

She is credited by The New York Times with \\"originating the fusion of classic French and Indian cuisines\\". Early life Rajeswari Rampalli was born in May 1949 in Hyderabad. Because of her father's work as a high-ranking diplomat for the state of Andhra Pradesh, her family traveled often to Europe. She married Panduranga Jallepalli, a physician, and moved with him to the United States in 1969. Raji had trained as a microbiologist and transitioned to working in laboratory work as a medical technologist in the U.S. They initially lived in New York and New Jersey, and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in the early 1970s. In Memphis, she was a stay-at-home mother for her two sons with occasional work assisting in her husband's medical practice. Career as a chef Jallepalli opened her first restaurant, The East India Company, in Memphis in 1989. Although the initial menu reflected a curry house, she later transformed the menu as a fusion of French and Indian cuisine; she renamed it Restaurant Raji in 1992. The new menu was well received and Jallepalli was invited to cook at the James Beard House six times in the 1990s. She was nominated for two James Beard Foundation Awards, in the Best Chef: Southeast category, in 1996 and 1997. She was honored by the White House in millennial celebrations in 2000 as part of a program called \\"Imagine the Future\\". Jallepalli's cookbook, Raji Cuisine: Indian Flavors, French Passion, was published by HarperCollins in 2000 and featured Indian-French fusion recipes designed by Jallepalli. The same year, she was chosen by Avtar Walia to be the executive chef of Tamarind, a fine-dining Indian restaurant in Tribeca, New York City. Tamarind opened in January 2001 and was called \\"a clear-cut victory for the cause of Indian food\\" in an early review by The New York Times food critic William Grimes.

Founded in 1857 by a group of social reformers, the journal was one of the earliest magazines aimed at a women's audience in India. The magazine was launched to aid in the improvement of female education and improve the overall quality of female domestic life. Advocacy for social reforms was nearly absent, contrary to popular perceptions. It is primarily seen as a medium in conforming upper- and middle- class women to then-prevalent standards of Victorian morality. It ceased publication in 1952.  History  Stribodh was established in January 1857 by a group of Parsi and Hindu social reformers: K.N. Kabra, editor of the progressive newspaper Rast Goftar, along with businessman Mangaldas Nathubhoy, lawyer Nanabhai Haridas (who would later become the first Indian justice of Bombay High Court), and Karsandas Mulji, a social reformer. played an important role as well. It was published from Duftur Ashkara Press and was the earliest magazine directed towards a female audience in Gujarat. From 1857 to 1863, the magazine was jointly edited by Beheramji Gandhi, Sorabaji Shapurji, Karsandas Mulji, Mangaldas Nathubhoy and Nanabhai Haridas. Karsandas was the editor from 1865 to 1867; thereafter, K.N. Kabra held the position until his death in 1904. It was later edited by his daughter Sirin (who was probably Gujarat's first gynecologist) until 1914, before his daughter-in-law Putlibai Jahangir Kabaraji took over. After Putlibai's death in 1941, Keshav Prasad Desai (who was already co-editing the magazine with Putlibai for the last few years) took over the entire business and editorship. It was discontinued in 1952.  Readership  Stribodh was primarily aimed at upper- and middle-class women of leisure, because males from those families were most open to primitive gender reforms due to their own dealings with varied elements of the British Raj. The subscription fees were initially set at ‚Çπ3 per year but it was halved in 1914. In its initial years, it also gifted a book to the annual subscribers.  Contents  = First issue = The preface to the first issue noted its core purpose was to aid in the improvement of female education and improve the overall quality of female domestic life. The journal was intended to be a good recreational read, which would help to inculcate a proper interest in reading and then follow up with introductory skills in a variety of menial tasks, so that rich women could spend their time creatively whilst poor women could contribute to the income in their household. = General format = Issues usually had about 20-22 pages of double-demy size and contained illustrated stories and articles ranging from fiction and poems to travelogues and discourses about historical events, inventions and everyday science. The motto, which was printed on the first page of every issue, was a quote from Napoleon and emphasized the role of female education in nation building. = Authors = The prominent writers were primarily local Parsee businessmen and social reformers. Barring Dalpatram, Narmad and few others, there was an absence of mainstream figures from the establishment of creative literature in their author roles; this was exacerbated with the increasing affinity of the literary establishment towards conservative cultural revivalism after the 1870s (since referred to as the Pandit era in Gujarati literature). This is reflected in the magazine not being an accurate representation of contemporary vernacular literary styles. = Themes = Most of the articles were designed to instill general moral values; vices of greed, vanity, laziness, disloyalty, superstitions et al. were denounced whilst the virtues of hard work, honesty et al. were praised. There were frequent pieces about being a \\"loving house-wife\\" or an \\"effective governess\\". An article that discussed the general necessity of women to preserve their youth garnered widespread popularity among readers. Other pieces offered instruction on domestic topics from sewing and embroidery to arranging furniture and using Western eating utensils. Some of the articles provided health advice (e.g. to menstruating women and pregnant mothers). Shukla notes that the magazine almost completely distanced itself from advocating for social reforms. During the heyday of advocacy for widow remarriage, a few fictional pieces published in Stribodh described the plight of widows in a negative tone, but nowhere was widow remarriage explicitly called for. There was similar lack of coverage of other contemporary issues of social reform, including sexual exploitation of devdasis, abolition of female infanticide, restitution of conjugal rights in case of child marriage and raising the age of consent for sexual intercourse for all girls. This was contrary to other publications by social reformers, aimed at a general (primarily upper-caste male) audience, which were vocal advocates for various social reforms and covered them extensively. All these issues were not mentioned in the magazine until years later, long after the issues had been conclusively settled. The fictional articles increased over the course of time, especially as European classics were adapted and serialized under Kabra's tutelage; this led to a considerable increase in readership.  Reception  Scholars have challenged the popular view of the magazine as an advocate for social reforms. In light of the aforementioned themes, scholars now deem Stribodh primary purpose as to merely conform women to then-prevalent standards of patriarchy. It viewed women as deserving of chivalrous treatment from men but not fit enough to engage in public discourse about social reforms.

Gazma Cave is located 3 km northeast of Tananam village, 1450 m above the sea level. Discovery The ancient site of Gazma cave was discovered in 1983 during the Paleolithic archeological expedition headed by M.M.Huseynov and A.G.Jafarov in Ordubad and Sharur regions. Archeological excavations were carried out there under the leadership of A.G.Jafarov in 1987-1990, and A.Zeynalov in 2008-2013. Findings A large number of archaeological materials were found in the cave during the researchs. More than 17,000 unearthed fauna fossils were examined by D.V.Hajiyev and S.D.Aliyev and it was found out that they contained 24 species of fauna, some were used as tools. In addition to fauna fossils, 874 stone tools were also discovered in the cave. Among them there were 780 obsidians, 93 flints, and 1 tuff tools. Despite the fact that the obsidian reserve is located in Kalbajar mountains, the research has revealed that these stones were collected by cave dwellers from the bed of Arpachay. The form of the tools is similar to those derived from Azokh and Taƒülar caves. The presence of several hearths in a small area in the cave indicates that primitive people living in Gazma utilized fire and lived here for a long time. During Mousterian culture period hunting played a particular role in the lives of Gazma inhabitants. Layers 6 cultural layers were discovered in the cave. The first layer ‚Äî consists of black soil. No archeological findings. The total thickness of the layer was 15-20 cm. The second layer ‚Äî consists of light- yellow clay soil. The difference between the first and second layers is clearly visible. No archeological findings. The total thickness of the layer was 20-25 cm. The third layer ‚Äî consists of dark-yellow clay soil. During the excavations, bone fossils were beginning to be discovered. This layer is slightly thicker. The total thickness of the layer was 35-40 cm. The fourth layer ‚Äî consists of light-yellowish clay soil layer. Rock fractures and stalactite fragments fallen from the upper part of the cave were recorded. Beginning from the fourth layer, stone tools were also discovered along with bone fossils. 8 pieces of stone tools were found in the layer. All of them were obsidian. The total thickness of the layer was 25-30 cm. The fifth layer ‚Äî consists of dark-yellow clay soil and light-gray layers in some areas. Rock fractures and stalactite fragments were recorded. Bones and stone tools were unearthed in the layer. 13 pieces of stone tools were found in the layer. 11 of them are obsidian and 2 are flint. The total thickness of the layer was 30-35 cm.

It is situated immediately west of Brackendale, northwest of Squamish, and southeast of Mount Tantalus, which is the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. Its nearest higher peak is Omega Mountain, to the northwest, and Mount Pelops lies to the west- northwest. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Squamish River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1942 by R. McLellan, H. Parliament, and F. Roots. The mountain was named for Thyestes, son of Pelops, and grandson of Tantalus according to Greek mythology. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Thyestes is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Thyestes.

The trade permit waived customs or transicharges for personal goods. The power to issue trade permits was conferred upon Company officials by the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar after William Hamilton, a surgeon associated with the Company cured him of a disease. The practice of using dastaks for almost any goods was consolidated by Robert Clive when he overthrew the then Nawab of Bengal, Mir Quasim after he opposed the British East India Company's position that their dastaks meant that they could trade without paying taxes (other local merchants with dastaks were required to pay up to 40% of their revenue as tax). The British then seized control of the province of Bengal by reinstating puppet ruler Mir Jafar. The dastak was a important reason for the impoverishment of Bengal. Company officials were able to make personal fortunes by using the dastaks which allowed them to skip paying custom duties altogether. This led to a drain in wealth from Bengal. The practice of abusing trade laws was institutionalized such that any gain made by the Indian products in foreign markets translated into a financial gain for Britain. The practise of issuing dastaks to traders was abolished by Warren Hastings due to the disadvantage the dastaks offered to the local Indian traders.

History Located at the extreme southern tip of South Vietnam, NƒÉm CƒÉn was a swampy fishing and charcoal-collecting village which had been overrun by the Viet Cong (VC) during the Tet Offensive and almost totally destroyed. The few primitive old roads were abandoned and useless. Until 1969 the area had been left to the Viet Cong. U.S. leaders recognized that to sustain a military presence deep in the C√† Mau Peninsula they had to develop a permanent logistics capability in the region. The repair ships, self-propelled barracks ships, and LSTs deployed to the Gulf of Siam in December 1968 were too distant from the inland operational areas so the Allies had to find another way to supply the riverine forces. Admiral Elmo Zumwalt ordered the construction of an Ammi barge pontoon base mid-point in the C·ª≠a L·ªõn River opposite NƒÉm CƒÉn. Zumwalt hoped that the base afloat would serve as an essential element in an operation called Sea Float to assert the South Vietnamese government‚Äôs presence in the Ca Mau region. The eventual 13-barge complex, a mobile advanced tactical support base (MATSB), provided berthing, messing, and supply support for U.S. Patrol Craft Fast (PCFs), riverine assault craft and a patrol gunboat; RVNN ships and craft; and Navy SEALs. A Huey gunship from the HA(L)-3 detachment operated from a landing platform on one of the barges. On the morning of 25 June 1969, Navy Dock landing ships towed the barges to the mouth of the Bo De where they were taken in tow by tugs and moored off NƒÉm CƒÉn. The weapons of the U.S. and South Vietnamese combat vessels as well as emplaced mortars and automatic weapons made Sea Float a defensive porcupine. The river's 6 to 8-knot current provided the most effective defense against VC swimmer-sappers. In November 1969, COMUSMACV General Creighton Abrams endorsed Zumwalt's first-priority effort to establish a permanent South Vietnamese government presence in Ca Mau, in Operation Solid Anchor. Additional resources poured in. U.S. Air Force planes defoliated the terrain surrounding both NƒÉm CƒÉn and Sea Float with Agent Orange to deny the VC cover and concealment. South Vietnamese ground troops reinforced the area's defense forces. As security improved in the area civilians began to return to NƒÉm CƒÉn. The initial building operation at Nam Can was to install a floating base on concrete pontoons to provide security while the Seabees worked on the shore to build an Advanced Tactical Support Base, called Solid Anchor, however the swampy sands weren't up to carrying the loads of a modern naval base, neither the heavy equipment nor the naval base structures. The contractor took over the dredging and fill needed for the base and a runway. Eventually, by 1970, Nam Can was going to need 640,000 cubic yards of fill to support a base and airfield. This meant a fill of on most of the base. The base eventually had 12 Butler buildings, 41 SEA huts and a fleet of 39 patrol boats of various kinds, and about 1,000 people in the base population including RVNN dependent housing built by Seabees. In April 1970, guards on Sea Float frustrated an attack by VC swimmer-sappers equipped with Soviet-made underwater gear and explosives, killing 4 VC with grenades and rifle fire. That July, mines tore a hole in anchored in the C·ª≠a L·ªõn but failed to sink the ship. Later in the month the VC mined and capsized the RVNN‚Äôs LSSL-225, killing 17 RVNN sailors. In September 1970 the Solid Anchor base ashore was ready to take on the logistic support job and Sea Float was disestablished. Soon after that date, the Navy towed the Ammi barges out of the area to serve other needs. In April 1971, the Navy turned over control of the Solid Anchor base which had cost US$50m to construct to the RVNN. American naval advisors continued to serve at Nam Can until February 1973, one month before the final withdrawal of all U.S. military personnel from South Vietnam. The RVNN 5th Coastal Flotilla operated 27 patrol craft from the base.

Background  After being recognized as an independent state in 1648 by the Peace of Westphalia, Switzerland maintained a modern market economy as craftsmen gained a reputation across Europe for quality and skill. After the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), Switzerland experienced a period of large economic growth. There was improvement in the agriculture sector and tourism, especially from England, began to rise. The industrial sector of Switzerland was the sector that increased the most during this time. Due to England enduring a blockade in the textile industry, Switzerland was pushed to modernize textile production and start mechanical spinning. A large scale cotton plant was created in 1802 in Z√ºrich, leading to a boom in the fabric manufacturing industry. With the increase in textile production and the modernization of spinning techniques, Switzerland soon began exporting surplus textiles. With the rise in the textile industry, there was an increased need in inexpensive labor and raw materials, which Switzerland was lacking and thus began importing from other countries. In 1848, after uniting the state under the federal constitution, Switzerland was politically stable and free from war, which could not be said for other European countries at this time. Using this to their advantage, Switzerland began focusing solely on improving its industrial, agricultural, and financial sectors.  Trade agreements  Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, has been a part of the European Free Trade Association since May 1960. Within this association, Switzerland and the countries with which it has an agreement are able to remove customs duties and generally protect intellectual property rights. The European Free Trade Association also regulates their trade in industrial, fish and processed agricultural products. This does not cover agricultural trade due to each member country having differing policies. Rather, agricultural trade is discussed in separate bilateral agreements. Other free trade agreements, like with Japan and China, expand on the regulations of EFTA, regarding trade in services, investment, and public procurement. The Agreement on Free Trade and Economic Partnership with Japan was completed in February 2009, strengthening the already strong relationship between Japan and Switzerland. A free trade agreement between China and Switzerland was signed in 2013, leading to a decrease in tariffs and a decrease in nontariff barriers as well. A free trade agreement in services is important as many Chinese service providers show interest in Switzerland as a business hub and many Switzerland service providers operate in China. Overall, Switzerland has thirty free trade agreements with forty countries. Negotiations are currently being held with Indonesia, India, and with Mercosur countries. The European Union is the main trading partner of Switzerland, with around fifty-two percent of exports going into the EU. This trade relationship began when the EU and Switzerland had created the Free Trade Agreement of 1972. This gave each country the ability to trade industrial products free of a customs duty. The FTA also ensured that no quotas could be set on the number of goods traded. Later in 1999, the EU and Switzerland formed a package of seven agreements, called the Bilateral I agreements. Within these agreements are included the free movement of people, nontariff trade barriers for health, safety and environmental protection, public procurement, agriculture, and air and land transport. Another set of agreements, called Bilateral II, were implemented in 2004. These new agreements added new economic interests, such as tourism, the food industry, and financial centers. It also improved political affairs between the EU and Switzerland, including world affairs, asylum, and internal security. While Switzerland is largely involved in the international economy for industrial goods, the agricultural sector is protected. Due to Switzerland being strict with their food regulations, many trading countries have to adapt their products to fit in with European guidelines. Switzerland has been a member of the World Trade Organization since July 1995. Under the WTO, Switzerland is committed to lowering customs tariffs and to keep open services markets. WTO ensures all member countries are following requirements set upon them and that the requirements are being implemented correctly. With their membership, Switzerland is able to calm any trade disputes with other countries through WTO. Switzerland uses the Harmonized System to guide their trade policies, which was first implemented in 1988. Every product that is intended to be imported or exported requires an eight-digit tariff heading, given by the Harmonized System.  U.S. relations  The United States of America is the second largest export market for Switzerland. The U.S. and Switzerland established diplomatic relations after Switzerland became an unified state in 1853. One agreement that the U.S. and Switzerland have is the U.S.- Swiss Joint Economic Commission, which covers various topics such as anti-money laundering efforts, counterterrorism, intellectual property rights, and regulatory cooperation. There is also an agreement in which both countries assess areas in which the other government could improve trade flows and investments. The U.S. and Switzerland signed three new agreements in 2006, which strengthened the economic cooperation between the two countries. The three new agreements are the Enhanced Political Cooperation Framework, the Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum, and the Operative Working Arrangement on Law Enforcement Cooperation on Counterterrorism. In 2008, the U.S. and Switzerland signed a Joint Declaration on e-commerce, showing their mutual commitment of encouraging e-commerce.  Export policies  Switzerland is the 18th largest export economy in the world, with exports at a total of $285 billion in 2017. The top countries that Switzerland export to are Germany, the United States, China, India, and Hong Kong. Exports in the past five years have increased at a rate of 0.4% per year. Exported items include precious metals such as gold, chemical products such as packaged medicines and human blood, and plastics. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs can refuse to export any product if there is reason to assume that said products could be intended for the development, production, or use of biological or chemical weapons or could within its nature, endanger regional or global security. Switzerland exported $310.5 billion worth of goods in 2018. 45.9% of exports were to other European nations while 35.1% were exported to Asian countries and 14.9% exported to North America. The top ten exports (2018) include: #Gems and precious metals (26.2% of exports) #Pharmaceuticals (24.2% of exports) #Machinery-computers (8%) #Clocks, watches- including parts (7%) #Organic chemicals (6.7%) #Various medical apparatus (5.6%) #Electrical machinery and equipment (4.1%) #Plastics and plastic articles (1.8%) #Perfumes and cosmetics (1.2%) #Articles of iron or steel (1%) Exports increased 8.2 percent from September 2019 due to higher sales in chemical and pharmaceutical products, jewelry, and metals. Exports increased to Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, the Middle East, and Singapore.  Import policies  Switzerland is the 17th largest import economy in the world, with imports at a total of $273 billion in 2017. The top countries that Switzerland import from are Germany, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, and France. Imports in the past five years have decreased by 2% each year. When importing biotech feed or animal feed products, the products must go through a lengthy approval process, along with getting proper labels for every biotechnical ingredient and ingredients that result from a biotechnical product. Animal products imported into Switzerland must have special health certificates stamped by certain authorities in the country of origin. As of 2009, Switzerland has implemented a common space with the EU, allowing animal or animal products to flow through Switzerland's market after inspection at EU border posts. Any products that are imported are required to be declared within a certain time period, dependent on the type of transportation. If imported by road, the item must be declared within 24 hours; 48 hours if by river; 7 days if by railway; and 7 days if by air travel. Switzerland imported $279.2 billion worth of goods in 2018. 63.1% of those imports come from other European nations, with 20.7% from Asian countries, and 8.8% from North America. The top ten imports (2018) include: #Gems and precious metals (31% of imports) #Pharmaceuticals (10.7% of imports) #Machinery- computers (7.2%) #Vehicles (5.6%) #Electrical machinery and equipment (5.3%) #Organic chemicals (4.6%) #Mineral fuels including oil (3.5%) #Various medical apparatus (3%) #Plastic and plastic articles (2.5%) #Furniture, bedding, lighting, signs, pre-fabricated buildings (1.7%) Imports dropped 1.4 percent from September 2019 due to decreased purchases of chemical and pharmaceutical products, jewelry, metal, and energy products. Imports decreased from Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan.

Administratively, Shouka is at the border of Shizi, Pingtung and Daren, Taitung. Shouka is a major intersection in road travel in Taiwan, bringing together traffic from Kaohsiung, Taitung City, and Kenting. It is the highest point of the South-Link Highway and the intersection of Provincial Highway 9 and County Highway 199. The point is also a popular destination for road cyclists. The character \\"Â≥†\\" is a kokuji, a Japanese character that does not appear in Chinese, which is why \\"Âç°\\" is occasionally used in its place. History The South-Link Highway was originally built by during Japan's rule over Taiwan. Construction of the highway ran between 1933 and 1939 and became an important link between Taiwan's east coast with the rest of the island. The highest point of this highway was named \\"Kotobuki Pass\\" at its completion. A police checkpoint once stood at Shouka, but has been abandoned. The building is transformed into a rest stop for cyclists. Recreation Shouka is a popular destination for road cyclists. Cyclists attempting to cycle around the island of Taiwan must climb up to Shouka, as there is no other road possible between Pingtung and Taitung. It is also one of two sections with substantial elevation gain, the other being Suhua Highway. Taiwan Cycling Route No.1 passes through Shouka. The 22.2 km climb along Provincial Highway 9 from Daren is listed as one of the top 100 cycling climbs in Taiwan, with an average grade of 4.2%. On April 11, 2009, the Pingtung County government turned a former police checkpoint into the \\"Shouka Cyclist Rest Stop\\" (Â£ΩÂç°ÈêµÈ¶¨È©õÁ´ô) to accommodate for passing cyclists. The staffed rest stop provides water, toilets, and repair tools free of charge for cyclists. The Water Resources Agency also operates a rain gauge on top of the rest stop.

The present church was built in the 15th century in Late-Gothic style, a home for Premonstratensian friars from a dissolved monastery. Mari√§ Kr√∂nung is a significant cultural monument in southern Germany, because it retains many original Gothic features, such as the rood loft and fused stained-glass windows. It has been the parish church of the village since 1815.  History Tradition says that a shepherd followed the singing of a wonderful voice to a hollow tree beside a spring, in which he found a statue of Mary, mother of Jesus. The site became a place of pilgrimage, and successive structures were built to house the statue. Records of the church site date from 1190. The statue has been venerated since at least the 1300s. In 1303, the All Saints' Abbey charged with the church and its pilgrims. The current church was built to replace an older chapel. It was begun in 1471, in order to offer the increasing numbers of pilgrims a larger prayer room. The church was also intended to serve as a burial place for the local nobility. Construction was supported by local families belonging to the lower nobility, especially the Schauenburgs, as well as peasants. The first master builder was Hans Hertwig, who had learned his trade in Strasbourg. The new church was consecrated in 1483 by Albrecht, Bishop of Strasbourg, and was completed in 1488. At the time of consecration, the friars of All Saints' Abbey took over the supervision of the building and its funding. The church is dedicated to the Coronation of Mary, John the Baptist and John the Evangelist. In the 16th century, a two-storied hospitium was added to house pilgrims; it was later used as the parish house. In 1895, expanded the church, adding two bays and a neogothic steeple. Surprisingly, both church and parish house remained undamaged by the wars which ravaged the Rench valley over the centuries, including the Thirty Years' War, which devastated the region. The poverty that followed meant that the church was not renovated, preserving the original Gothic elements.  Architecture  Mari√§ Kr√∂nung consists of a nave with six bays, crowned by a net vault. The steeple connects to the north side of the nave. The Gnadenkapelle (Chapel of Grace or Mercy), housing the statue of Mary, is located at the south side, at the location of the earlier chapel around which the church was built. The rood screen separates the nave from the choir. When its two-winged gate is closed the choir serves as an intimate prayer room for the friars. The bells are still rung by hand; they consist of a peal of five bells poured in 1928, hung in the steeple, and one bell from the 1700s, hung from a ridge turret above the west gable (sound files).

Stained-glass windows are usually made by joining pieces of coloured glass with H-shaped lead cames, a cold process. Here, however, the glaziers used glass fusing: pieces of coloured glass (60-80 per pane) were fitted into a mosaic on a piece of clear glass, and the stack was then gently heated to soften and fuse the layers without melting them into a puddle. This is a difficult technique: it requires careful matching of the physical properties of the glass, to avoid internal stresses which can cause the glass to fail. However, done properly, it can produce a strong, even window pane. Details were painted onto the glass; traditional stained-glass window painting is lasting, as it uses a glass-fusible paint, fired before the pieces are assembled. The windows show religious themes, and include depictions of the donors.  Altars  The high altar is believed to have been completed by 1488 when the church was consecrated. It is carved in the center and has paintings on two side panels by an unknown master of the Strasbourg school, known in art history as the Master of the Lautenbach Altar. It is believed to be the only pre-1500 altar of the Strasbourg school which survived both the Reformation and the French Revolution. Two side-altars, thought to be the work of the same artist, are located under the rood loft. The statues of the altars were required to be covered during fasting-times and Advent; this is why the statues have wooden panels which can be closed over them. The exteriors of the panels carry paintings of the statues.

He was the son of Hendrik Frans van Lint, one of the leading landscape painters in Rome in the first half of the 18th century. Like his father he supplied a clientele of local patrons as well as European travelers on their Grand Tour with views of the ancient and modern monuments of Rome as well as views of the Roman Campagna.Edgar Peters Bowron, Joseph J. Rishel, Art in Rome in the Eighteenth Century, Philadelphia Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 2000, p. 236-237A. Busiri Vici, Peter, Hendrik e Giacomo Van Lint. Tre pittori di Anversa del '600 e '700 lavorano a Roma, 1987, Ugo Bozzi ed. Life Giacomo van Lint was born on 8 February 1723 in Rome where he was baptized in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo. He was the son of Hendrik Frans van Lint and his wife Ludovica Margarete Tassel. Giacomo was the eldest of the couple's 10 children of whom only six survived. His father was a Flemish landscape painter from Antwerp who himself was a son of Pieter van Lint, a painter of history paintings, genre scenes and portraits in the Flemish Baroque style.Peter van Lint at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Hendrik Frans van Lint had settled before 1700 in Rome where he had become a successful vedute painter.Edgar Peters Bowron, Joseph J. Rishel, Art in Rome in the Eighteenth Century, Philadelphia Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 2000, p. 236-237 Genre scene at the Trajan's Column Giacomo learned the art of painting from his father and became a landscape painter like his father. Following the death of his father on 24 September 1763, Giacomo assumed the same nickname with which his father was known, i.e. Mons√π Studio. This nickname was coined as a reference to his father's practice of producing many preparatory studies for his paintings. By adopting this nickname Giacomo strengthened the link of his work with that of his father so as to exploit the popularity of his father's works. He thus hoped to be able to sell more paintings to foreigners visiting Rome, who had a preference for his small-scale views and landscapes which were easily transportable. View of Piazza del Popolo, Rome As a result Giacomo was very successful among foreigners, so much so that almost all of his paintings are found today in private European collections, particularly in the United Kingdom. Giacomo never married. He resided throughout his life in a house that he and his sisters Teresa and Maria shared with their brother Giovanni Rocco's family, although they lived on different floors. The house was located on the Strada del Corso towards Via di Ripetta. He died in Rome on 1 August 1790. Work Van Lint was specialized in vedute of Rome. He painting detailed topographical views of Rome in the manner of his father. He was able to create a distinct personal style. Whereas his father painted vedute of Rome and its surrounding areas as well as idealised landscapes, Giacomo responded to the demand in the market for views of the ancient and modern monuments of Rome. This explains his many views of the Quirinale palace, Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo, the Colosseum, Saint Peter‚Äôs Basilica and Piazza Navona.Giacomo Van Lint, The Basilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome, Dorotheum sale of 9 April 2014 in Vienna Lot No. 523 Shepherds and resting soldiers in front of an ancient city gate Henry Hoare's print collection at Stourhead in England is thought to have been hand-coloured in a collaborative effort by Giacomo and his father Hendrik Frans van Lint. In a manuscript catalogue the colouring of these prints is attributed to a 'Mr Studio'. The technique is consistent with Hendrik Frans van Lint's paintings but evidence, including a recorded comment regarding the 'young Studio', suggests that the colouring may have been a family enterprise.

Her career continued beyond the changes of 1989/90. Prior to that, as an East German citizen, she enjoyed privileges which enabled her to travel abroad. She is nevertheless best known for pictures taken in and around her home cities of Leipzig and Dresden during the 1950s and 1960s. Her work embraced photojournalism, portraiture and landscapes. For historians, some of her most interesting pictures deal with daily life during the years of postwar reconstruction in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In the late 1940s Renate Winkler teamed up with fellow photography student Roger R√∂ssing. After this they worked closely together: authorship of their pictures was attributed to \\"R√∂ssing-Winkler\\" or, following their marriage in 1951, simply to \\"R√∂ssing\\". In most cases it therefore becomes impossible to know which of them was holding the camera for any individual picture. Rolf Richter, a journalist who was also a close friend of the couple, recalls that Renate was often the more adventurous of the two when it came to selecting locations. She would crawl to the edge of flat roofs on tall buildings in order to capture a more striking panorama. It was also generally Renate who took responsibility for image composition and for the placement of image and text. Biography Renate Winkler was born and grew up in Dresden. Willy R√∂ssing, her father, died young in 1934, the year of her fifth birthday. On the night of 13 February 1945 the family home was completely destroyed by British and American bombing. Renate survived, buried for several days under the rubble: Margarete Winkler, her mother, died. For the rest of her life Renate's body carried the phosphorus scars from the skin burns she received that night. Following her rescue she got hold of an old basic camera from somewhere and set about photographing the bombscape that had been Dresden. Although her work was not overtly political, it was never any secret that throughout her adult life Renate R√∂ssing-Winkler was a committed pacifist. She applied to study at the Film Academy in Potsdam in order to study for a career as a documentary film maker but was informed that the class was already full. She had more success with the Academy for Book and Graphic Artistry (\\"Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst\\") in Leipzig, however. She enrolled to study photography in 1948. Student contemporaries included the man who later became the academy's long-standing director, Bernhard Heisig, the sculptor and graphic-artist Wolfgang Mattheuer, the painter Werner T√ºbke and G√ºnter R√∂ssler who would later gain fame (or notoriety) for his pioneering work in nude art photography. The focus of her course was on advertising and reportage. Her photography tutor was Johannes Widmann who found her hugely talented, but very shy and withdrawn. He asked another of his students, Roger R√∂ssing, to look after her. Shortly afterwards they set up home together in a couple of rented rooms at Leipzig-St√∂tteritz on the southern edge of the city. They lived at the same address till Renate R√∂ssing's death in 2005, although during that time some rooms were added. They had married in 1951. After two or three years she lost her student funding because, it was said, she had failed to fulfill her social obligations (...wegen \\"Nichterf√ºllung der gesellschaftlichen Pflichten\\"): in 1951 she was obliged to quit her course. Roger R√∂ssing showed solidarity by leaving the academy at the same time. As students and directly after abanding their courses the R√∂ssings supported themselves primarily through photo-journalism in and around Leipzig. As matters turned out, their shared artistry ensured that they would be able to pursue a long and successful freelance career in photography despite the evident setback of their shortened student careers. The R√∂ssings' active career ran for approximately 55 years, most prolifically in Leipzig itself, and in Dresden, but also of cities, landscapes and people in Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. In addition, there was at least one working visit each to North Africa and Central Asia. Although they started out as photo-journalists, supplying newspapers and magazines, over time there was an increasing emphasis of publishing books containing photographs of people, scenes and places. There are suggestions that in the end approximately 90 volumes were published: the R√∂ssing Foundation website makes mention of \\"over 100 books and written works in which it is pointless to [try and] separate out the contributions of Renate and Roger\\".

Furthermore, the court found that applicant minors enjoy a constitutional right to be in the care and company of other family members, including their siblings in the state. The consequences of this ruling were significant in that it prohibits the state from deporting the parents and other family members of minors who are applying for asylum until the process is resolved. The case established the \\"primacy\\" of the family unit. However, the ruling also resulted in the finding that an Irish citizen who is a minor could, nevertheless, be deported if their non-national parents were deported.  Background  The applicants in two separate proceedings joined for appeal purposes. They sought leave to apply by way of judicial review for an order quashing the relevant deportation order. In each case, the Court was asked to determine whether, as minor children and Irish citizens the applicants were entitled to the company, care, and parentage of their parents in the state, thus prohibiting the minister from deporting their non-national parents, and other family members. In essence the court had to evaluate which of the two constitutional principles must prevailed: the inalienable rights of Irish citizenship (in this case, the minors) versus the sovereign right of the state to control immigration and asylum. In the first appeal, the applicant and family were Nigerian nationals who arrived in Ireland May 2001. During the course of his asylum application, this applicant denied having previously resided anywhere except Nigeria or having claimed asylum anywhere except Ireland; in fact, prior UK asylum had been refused. He was ordered to be deported from Ireland. In the second appeal, a child was born while deportation proceedings were underway. The minister refused the asylum application, and ordered deportation. If valid, two children legally in Ireland as of right would be separated from their deported families, if the children remained in Ireland. The court referred to prior judgements based on the European Convention on Human Rights jurisprudence (including cases like Mahmood), which found that fundamental Convention family rights nevertheless in some instances yield \\"to the right of the state to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory.\\"A.O. & D.L. v. Minister for Justice [2003] IR 1 In this case, the court found that the applicant minors enjoy in general terms, the right not to be expelled from the state. Of the extensive case law canvassed by the court (over 300 paragraphs are devoted to assessing various authorities), the court placed emphasis on extracts from (M) v Attorney General. It is technically correct to conclude that an infant child has citizenship rights that they can enforce at law, but the child's best interest, and their overall welfare require adult care. For example, parents may lawfully make decisions affecting their child so long as these are consistent with the child's best interest.It is noted that the court majority upholds the 1990 Fajujonu v Minister for Justice reasoning as sound, but not applicable (the three Irish born children in that case had lived in Ireland for an \\"appreciable period\\").  Holding of the Supreme Court  The majority concluded that in these particular circumstances, the child does not have \\"...right of the society of its parents in the state,\\" meaning that an Irish citizen child's parents (who are not citizens) may be deported, even if this means the child is essentially deported also. The minority (Fennelly J) would have allowed the appeals, giving priority to the child over State interests.  Subsequent developments  This case remains an influential study, given the ways in which the court seeks to resolve the inherent supremacy conflict between individual citizenship, and powers of the state.

Although the facility was founded in the 16th century, the neoclassical entrance is from the reign of Fernando VII. castle on the skyline The Coining House is a former royal mint in Segovia, Spain, which dates back to the 1500s. Today, it is a museum dedicated to coins, industrial heritage and Segovia's famous aqueduct.  History  The royal mint was a coining factory that Philip II ordered to be built in the end of 1580. He was aware of the new rolling and coining system in which the involvement of the use of machinery and devices were moved by hydraulic wheels. The hydraulic wheels technique had been already operating in several cities in Europe. Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol managed to get all the equipment necessary in order for the king to proceed. The coining house was the first mechanized factory in Spain. In 1582, a team of experts travelled to Spain from the Austrian territory of Tyrol in search for the most fitting location in which they could construct the building that would stock the machinery. The property chosen was owned by Antonio de San Mill√°n and was located on the banks of the Eresma River. Previously, the property was used to grind cereal and to fabricate paper. The construction of the new building began on November 7, 1583 in which they used plans drawn from Juan de Herrera, who at that time was considered the most famous Spanish architect. Together, Herrera, the king, and the German technicians met at the old mill to mutually decide the upcoming procedures. The technology was updated in the 18th century with the introduction of the flywheel press. Coin of eight maraved√≠s. During the Napoleonic Wars the mint fell under the control of Joseph Bonaparte. With the restoration of Fernando VII coins were minted for him and his successors until the deposition of Isabel II: the last coining was in 1869.  Architecture  It was built in the 16th century, commissioned by Philip II to one of the most important architects, Juan Herrera. The first draft of the construction was made by Juan Herrera and a group of tyroleans that were sent by the archduke and since then the place has stayed almost intact. It is an industrial building located between the Eresma river and The garden of Poets. The building was in a state of deterioration after its manufacturing inactivity from 1968 on. There has been a long rehabilitation process that started in 1998 with the governments protocol of collaboration to commence rehabilitation but the project was actually executed between 2007 and 2011.  Current state  The building was sold and from 1878, it was transformed into a flour factory. The flour production continued until November 1967, and from then on the building was abandoned, sold, and then acquired in 1989 by the municipality. On February 14, 2007, his rehabilitation began. Today, the Royal Mill Mint is the jewel of the Spanish Mints and is considered to be the oldest industrial architecture sign still standing around the world.

Greenlees married Graham Kinloch Wylie, a landscape painter, in October 1885. Greenlees attended the Glasgow School of Art in the early 1870s. She studied painting, design and drawing and was awarded a national Queen's Prize for a lace curtain design in 1870. Greenlees often painted Scottish landscapes, and was also known for her depictions of women. Her works are held in public collections including A Little Waif, held by the McManus Gallery in Dundee, and a portrait of James Sellars in the Glasgow Museums collection. Greenlees exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in London during 1878 and 1880. She also exhibited at Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1867, when she was eighteen, and later at the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1879, Greenlees was elected to the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour. She exhibited with the society from 1878, and her work was included in the Fourth Exhibition held in 1881. Greenlees taught at the Glasgow School of Art from 1874 to 1881, when she was one of two women teaching at the school, who both resigned from their positions. Greenlees maintained a professional artistic career while continuing to teach privately, which was in direct opposition to the policies of the Glasgow School of Art. Greenlees was a founding member and first president of the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists. The society was formed early in 1882 during a meeting at the studio Georgina shared with her father at 136 Wellington Street, Glasgow. The society was the first of its kind to be formed in Scotland and represented the need for women art practitioners to exhibit their work and socialise with other artists.

Although she is often forgotten, Strehlow was her husband's main supporter, and edited his works; she also published some accounts of their activities.  Early life  Strehlow was born in Adelaide to George Pugh James and Rosamond Delila (n√©e Murdoch), who died of influenza in 1919. Shortly after her mother's death, her father married Edith Mary Eaton. She attended St Peter's Girls School and, in her final year, was head prefect. In 1932 she commenced a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Adelaide, where she met Ted Strehlow; she completed her degree in 1934 and began teaching at the Walford Girls School. She married Ted Strehlow on 21 December 1935 and, the next year, they travelled to Alice Springs on The Ghan railway.  Life in the Northern Territory  The newly married Strehlows arrived in Alice Springs on 18 February 1936, and immediately travelled to Hermannsburg, where Ted had grown up, where they stayed with the family of Friedrich Wilhelm Albrecht. During this time, they started preparations for their 'honeymoon', a camel trek through the Petermann Ranges, a part of Ted's role as a Patrol Officer for the Central Australian region. Their journey commenced on 5 June 1936, and they returned to Hermannsburg on 25 September 1936. During this journey, Strehlow had a miscarriage and almost died; she was saved due to the intervention of an Aboriginal woman. It is possible that, during this trip, Strehlow was the first white woman to see Kata Tjuta and Uluru. The Strehlows moved in to a tent at the Jay Creek Settlement on 29 May 1937; in early 1938 Strehlow had another miscarriage. Also in 1938 the couple had a house built using 2000 bricks that had been handmade by Ted and three Aboriginal friends. They moved in in mid-1938. In 1939, Strehlow suffered a fourth miscarriage, at the same time as facing additional pressure with the outbreak of World War II when Ted was accused in parliament of being a Nazi and, as he put it, 'the most hated man in Central Australia'. During this time, in May 1942, Strehlow gave birth to Theo Strehlow (named for his father) and, shortly after this, on 26 May 1942, her husband was called up for military service. Strehlow went to stay at her parents' house in Adelaide, initially just for the period Ted would be gone; this move would however turn out to be permanent.  Later life  In Adelaide, in 1944, Strehlow gave birth to a daughter, Shirley; following the end of the war, a final child, John, was born. The family remained in Adelaide, where Ted lectured in English and Linguistics at University of Adelaide and Strehlow started teaching at the Walford Girls School again. Between 1950 and 1952, Ted took an extended study tour of Europe and Strehlow rented out rooms in their house for additional income as she struggled financially. In 1951, Strehlowbegan teaching at the Wilderness School and, in November, became Vice President of Tatlers, a women‚Äôs literary club, founded by Strehlow's long term friend Roma Mitchell. In 1956, she became its president. Ted left Strehlow in 1968 and, in 1972, she filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion. At the trial, presided over by her friend Roma Mitchell, she did not seek maintenance and said that her salary was ample for her needs; she did not ask for a clause in the divorce about Ted's will, which ultimately led to both her and her children being disinherited. On 25 September of the same year, Ted married his research assistant. On 30 June 1984, shortly after a visit to her son, John, in London, Strehlow died of a heart attack; she was 73 years old.

When the Roman conducted their invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, the region was occupied due to the proximity of the settlement with Roman road that linked Astorga to Braga. = Medieval Era = In 1273, the town received a Foral charter from King Afonso III (1248-1279). The town received a confirmation Foral Charter from King Afonso IV. During the 1383-1385 Portuguese succession crisis, the village and castle sided with Beatriz, but she was defeated and the village was forced to accept John I (1385-1433). It is believed that during this time, the castle was constructed and later the castle site plan was recorded in the Duarte de Armas (Book of Fortresses c. 1509). = Post Middle Ages = In Portuguese Restoration War for Independence, the Council of War John IV (1640-1656) determined the modernization of defenses Monforte was necessary by adapting them to fire artillery.

The 304th episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on November 13, 2019. The episode addresses how frank discussion of transgender athletes is made difficult by political correctness. Plot The show opens with a new theme song dedicated to the PC babies, who are the highly politically correct quintuplet children of South Park Elementary principal PC Principal and vice- principal Strong Woman. At South Park Elementary, Principal announces that Woman will be competing in a strongwoman competition where she is the reigning champion. She encourages the girls of the school to be more active in school sports and activities. Fourth-graders Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, Butters Stotch, Clyde Donovan and Scott Malkinson are in a gaming club named Dice Studz playing Dungeons & Dragons. They are interrupted by school counselor Mr. Mackey who brings in Tammy Nelson and Nichole Daniels who wish to join. Although the boys are hesitant to let the girls play, the girls immediately display an advanced knowledge of the game that stuns the boys. Cartman, Butters and Scott complain to Mackey about the girls in their club but they are dismissed. The boys collectively decide to switch their games to tabletop miniature games to make their games too difficult for the girls to play, but the girls come in immediately prepared for the game, and Stan becomes more comfortable with the girls' presence. Cartman, Butters and Scott plead to the United States Congress to return their club to the way that it was. In response, the girls start up their own gaming club named Board Girls which is hugely popular. The boys are fascinated by their new club, but Mackey kicks them out of the club as a new rule in school no longer allows boys in girls clubs, a direct result of the boys pleas to Congress. At the strongwoman competition, Woman is interviewed and told that there is a new transgender athlete competing named Heather Swanson. When Swanson is introduced, it is revealed that she is an extremely muscular, bearded athlete (a parody of \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage) who only started identifying as a woman a few weeks ago. Swanson easily defeats the other competitors to win the contest, with Woman finishing in second place. Swanson visits Woman and Principal at their home to brag about her victory and gets into an argument with Principal, calling him a transphobe. Swanson has an interview on a sports talk show with multiple trophies and awards as she has won every women's sporting contest she has entered recently. She issues a challenge to Woman, who is watching on television at home. Woman reveals to Principal that she personally knows Swanson as her ex-boyfriend Blade Jaggart, and the reason for Swanson's attacks on Woman is due to Swanson feeling that he was beaten by a woman when they broke up. As Swanson has an interview celebrating her success in mixed martial arts, Principal interrupts her on set causing another argument. In the heat of the moment, Principal shoves Swanson, and she dives through a table, breaking it. Principal's reputation is damaged from his actions, and Woman consoles him in a park as Principal does not want to face his babies due to his actions. Principal decides to invite Swanson to South Park Elementary as a motivational speaker in an attempt to make up for his actions. As Swanson brags about her ability to beat any woman at any contest, the girls from Board Girls retort that she would be unable to beat any of them in some of their favorite games. Swanson accepts their challenge and is repeatedly defeated by the Board Girls in various games. Swanson leaves in anger as Cartman invites Swanson to make their own club instead. Principal returns home and finds that his children have accepted his actions as they simply do not care.

The movement challenges the idea that people with disabilities need to appear morally good to deserve the conditional support of able-bodied people, and instead advocates for the solidarity of physically disabled people who appear not to conform to normative standards through their appearance, body size, dress, use of a mobility aid, or physical deformity.  Origins  The tag started in 2014 by a Tumblr user, Trewhella, posting a picture of them standing with their cane and a cigarette in their mouth, with the caption \\"cripple punk\\" layered over the top, and the description \\"i'm starting a movement.\\" The post would go on to be liked and reblogged by over forty thousand people, with the caption being used as a tag to boost other posts and images of physically disabled people going against the typical perception of people with disabilities.  Ideology  Cripple punk ideology centers and prioritizes the lived experiences of disabled people over the pressure to conform to the standards that able-bodied people uphold.

The company was founded in 2017. Solar Foods manufactures protein powder called Solein that can be used as a protein ingredient in food production, and plans to license its technology. History Solar Foods is a spin-off company. Its original idea is based on a joint research project focusing on renewable energy, carried out by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT. In summer 2017, when the research group announced having succeeded in producing food out of thin air, it received publicity also internationally. The company was founded the same year by D.Sc. (Tech.) Pasi Vainikka and D.Sc. (Tech.) Juha-Pekka Pitk√§nen together with Sami Holmstr√∂m, Jero Ahola, Jari Tuovinen and Janne M√§kel√§. The company aimed at starting the first phase of commercial protein production during 2021 at a factory with an estimated annual capacity of 100 tonnes of protein. By spring 2018, Solar Foods had raised ‚Ç¨800,000 in seed funding for building a pilot plant. The principal investor was Lifeline Ventures and other investors included, for example, VTT Ventures and Green Campus Innovations, a cleantech seed investor operating on the LUT campus. Additionally, the company received a product development loan of over one million euros from Business Finland. Solar Foods began to build a bioreactor tank with a production capacity of 1 kg of microbes per day. The company's previous bioreactor had been about the size of a coffee cup. That autumn, Solar Foods was selected for the Business Incubation Programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The company's goal was to develop a system for producing food on Mars. A 40-litre bioreactor is able to produce enough protein for a six-member crew. The company had three employees. In March 2019, Solar Foods received a ‚Ç¨50,000 grant from the Bank of √Öland's Baltic Sea Project. That spring, Solar Foods started its pilot plant, which produces protein that is used to develop new products together with a host of partners. In summer, the company announced its plan to build a bigger protein factory with a capacity of approximately 6,000 tonnes a year. The final decision to build will be made once the company has gained sufficient operating experience from the smaller plant. In September 2019, Fazer Group and Solar Foods announced having entered into partnership for developping the Solein protein together. The partnership was part of a financing round that brought Solar Foods ‚Ç¨3.5 million as convertibles from Oy Karl Fazer Ab, Holdix Oy Ab, Turret Oy Ab and Lifeline Ventures. By April 2020, the company had raised a total of ‚Ç¨4.3 million in funding. In summer, the pilot plant produced 300 grams of protein a day, and Solar Foods announced plans to open, within the next couple of years, a new plant that would be a hundredfold bigger than the its current plant. That could again be scaled up to factory size, that is, to a plant the size of a football field. According to the company, Solein factories could be built in areas that are not suitable for food production with current methods, but that have solar or wind energy potential, such as the Sahara desert, arctic regions and space. The company said that by the end of 2022, it would bring to market a total of 20 different consumer products that could be used as breakfast ingredients or as substitutes for dairy products or meat. Product idea Solar Foods develops protein using air and electricity. The production method is based on research carried out by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and LUT University. The idea behind producing food out of thin air with electricity originates from the 1960s. The product is made by extracting carbon dioxide () from the atmosphere and combining it with water, nutrients and vitamins. The protein is produced using electricity under contained conditions inside a metallic bioreactor. Electricity is needed for the process, but solar energy from Fortum (its partner) is used. The microbes utilised in the protein production process are grown by fermentation. Fermentation is a biotechnical process in which living microorganisms, such as yeasts, moulds or bacteria, are grown to produce useful products. The Solar Foods' idea is to feed microbes derived from the Finnish soil with carbon dioxide, hydrogen and a small amount of trace elements. The microbe used in the method is able to produce amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and vitamins from carbon dioxide. The microbe reproduces itself using energy from hydrogen and carbon from carbon dioxide. It's been claimed the product could have a revolutionary impact on food production. Apocalypse Cow (Channel 4 2019 documentary) In 2019 Solar Foods told it was aiming at developing carbon neutral food production so that agriculture would no longer be needed to produce food and the land freed from agriculture could be reforested and converted into carbon sinks. According to them this would also reduce agricultural nutrient pollution and subsequent water supply problems. It's been estimated that the land efficiency for Solar Foods methods would be about 20,000 times greater than for conventional farming. In 2020, Michael Le Page for the New Scientist took a more sceptical view, noting that the x20,000 improvement only applies to the factories themselves. If land use for Solar panels is taken into account, then land efficiency only improves by about x10. Despite his doubts over how beneficial the technology will be overall, Le Page stated that \\"the potential rewards are so immense that we should be pouring vast sums of money into finding out.\\" Solein product Solar Foods Ltd. manufactures Solein, single cell protein. Solein is vegan, and the finished product contains approximately 65 percent protein, 20‚Äì25 percent carbohydrates and 5‚Äì10 percent fats. Solein also contains small amounts of essential chemical elements, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The carbon dioxide emissions from single cell cultivation are a hundred times lower than from meat production and ten times lower than from crop production. The protein produced by Solar Foods is similar to that used in the Quorn products. The characteristics of Solein are similar to those of soy and dried algae. It is said to be very mild, and when added to a pancake base, it tastes a bit like egg, which means that it could be used in various kinds of food products, such as plant-based yoghurts, smoothies, bread or pasta, or as an ingredient in plant-based meat substitutes. Solar Foods has intended to apply for novel-food approval from the European Food Safety Authority ¬≠EFSA so that Solein could be used for human consumption. The protein could also be used in animal feed. A protein made from air is told to be cheaper than animal protein. In 2019, the company predicted its products would become more cost efficient than the then cheapest source of protein (soya from South America) by about 2025. Awards and recognition In 2019, Solar Foods received prominent recognition. It received *the Index Award, financed by the state of Denmark and worth ‚Ç¨100,000, dubbed the \\"Nobel Prize of design\\" and awarded to solutions addressing issues vital for the global future, such as food production, plastic pollution and equality *the Pentti Malaska Futures Award, worth ‚Ç¨30,000 *The Europas: The Hottest CleanTech Startup Award Talousel√§m√§, a Finnish financial and business weekly, named Solar Foods as one of the ten most promising startups in 2019 and 2020.

Life  Heinrich became Abbot of Saint Gall after Konrad von Pegau had abdicated. He was appointed by Pope Martin V. Before that, he had been provost of the Abbey of Schk√∂len in the Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz.  Works  As was the custom, Heinrich soon after his inauguration, on 9 July 1419, confirmed the rights and liberties of the city of Saint Gall. On 10 und 11 August 1419, he confirmed those of the city of Wil and on 27 August those of the city of Wangen. Abbot Heinrich tried to enhance the economic foundation of the abbey. To this end, he wanted to resolve the dispute with Appenzell, which had begun during the reign of Kuno von Stoffeln and had culminated in the Appenzell Wars in which Saint Gall had been defeated. For 11 years, the Appenzeller had been refusing to pay interest. The seven villages held several fruitless law conferences and finally, on 6 May 1421, made an award that was accepted by Abbot Heinrich, but ignored by the Appenzeller. Heinrich's request for King Sigismund's support was also unsuccessful: the king confirmed all fiefs, rights and liberties of the monastery on 10 August 1422 and admonished the surrounding forces to attend to the Abbey of Saint Gall's business, but nobody acted on this admonition. Eventually, the church authorities supported Heinrich. On 10 December 1425, the Domscholasticus of Speyer, Berchtold von Wildungen, assumed the regularisation of Appenzell. On 4 February 1426, he called on the Appenzeller to subject to the abbey's rule within 30 days. The Appenzeller thereupon agreed to negotiations, but they were too late: on 10 April 1426, they were excommunicated. Abbot Heinrich died on the journey back from Speyer, where he had pursued the aggravation of the Appenzeller banishment, in Freiburg im Breisgau. He was buried in St. Blasien.

History The church was already mentioned in the 12th century. It was re-built and altered several times. The oldest preserved parts date back to 1400. In the 15th century, the nave was covered with a wooden curved ceiling that symbolises the vault of the sky and hides the apparent flaws. In the 16th century, the nave was separated into three parts by two pillars and the Gothic window of the choir was enlarged. Under this window, a communion table was made from a slab of a former baptismal font. The church is located on a hill that overlooks the village. It was listed among the Swiss Cultural Property of National Significance.

It holds that, \\"in the absence of conclusive data educational decisions should be based on assumptions which, if incorrect, will have the least dangerous effect on the student\\". This concept was coined in 1984 by Anne Donnellan, a researcher in special education.Donnellan, A. M. (1984). The Criterion of the Least Dangerous Assumption.

In most contexts in which it is used the principle holds that one should, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, presume competence, rather than non-competence, in others. The \\"presumption of competence\\"Dotger, S. (2011). Exploring new territories: My trajectory toward becoming an inclusive science teacher educator. Reflective Practice, 12(3), 415‚Äì426. p.422. can be regarded as the \\"least dangerous\\" assumption to make about a person because, the principle holds, it is less damaging to presume competence in another, and to be wrong, than it is to presume non-competence (incompetence) in another, and to be wrong.Ballard, K. (1993). The least dangerous assumption: A response to Jordan & Powell. Disability, Handicap & Society, 8(1), 87‚Äì89. Take the example of a teacher who is uncertain about the extent to which a given student (with a severe communication impairment) understands what is said to them. The principle holds that it is less dangerous to assume that the student understands everything that is said, and to be wrong about that, than to assume that the student understands nothing that is said, and to be wrong in that direction.Emerson, A., & Dearden, J. (2013). The effect of using ‚Äòfull‚Äô language when working with a child with autism: Adopting the ‚Äòleast dangerous assumption‚Äô. Child Language Teaching and Therapy, 29(2), 233‚Äì244. Under the latter assumption the risk is that the teacher speaks too little to the student (or, in an extreme form of the argument, the teacher may not speak to the student at all). This is potentially 'dangerous' because it deprives the child of the known benefits of a language-rich environment.Entwisle, L. K., Brouwer, K., Hanson, E., & Messersmith, J. (2016). A Systematic Review of Emergent Literacy Interventions for Preschool-Age Children with Cochlear Implants. Contemporary Issues in Communication Science and Disorders; Rockville, 43, 64‚Äì76. Under the former assumption the risk is that the teacher will speak too much to the student, which, advocates of this approach maintain, is less dangerous.Doyle, M. B., & Giangreco, M. (2013). Guiding Principles for Including High School Students with Intellectual Disabilities in General Education Classes. American Secondary Education, 42(1), 57‚Äì72. The principle comes into play in educational policy and teaching practice under conditions of uncertainty (\\"in the absence of conclusive data\\"). Debate on the usefulness of the principle revolves around the question of what constitutes \\"conclusive data\\" when it comes to making complex educational decisions.Travers, J., & Ayres, K. M.

The use of microstructures, where the thickness of each strut scale of tens of microns ranges from 0.2mm to 0.5mm, has a benefit to change the physical properties of objects (metamaterials) such as: elasticity, resistance, hardness., making them lighter or flexible. The pattern has to respond on geometry constraint (shape regulation), thickness constraint (minimum thickness control), or can be enforced using optimization methods(microstructure shape and topological optimization). A 3D-printed microstructure with different thicknesses of the lattice to show different elastic behavior.  Microstructures parameters  Elastic deformation materials are described by two parameters majors parameters:Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus, however the alternative elastic constants Bulk modulus and Shear modulus can also be used . Poisson's ratio defines the ratio between the transversal and axial strain when object is compressed. Materials with negative Poisson's ratio expand laterally when stretched, in contrast with ordinary materials. In comparing a material's resistance to distort under mechanical load rather than alter in volume, Poisson's ratio offers the fundamental metric by which to compare the performance of any material when strained elastically. The numerical limits are set by 1/2 and -1, between which all stable isotropic materials are found. Young's modulus is a property that measures how rigid or soft an object is. It relates stress(per unit area) to strain(proportional deformation) along an axis or line .  Microstructure process chain  The microstructures are synthetically designed, given the input parameters correlated with the desired deformation behavior. Parameters space sampling allows the creation of a family of related structure able to satisfy the feasibility range of material parameters, corresponding microstructure of the cell is computed by interpolation.. Using the microstructure optimization and parameter space sampling, several families of related structures that together satisfied the feasible range of material parameters can defined, using these candidates, the best fit has to be chosen to ensure that neighboring structure are properly connected. Additive manufacturing design can be divided in two general steps: the pre-processing planing and the process chain. During the processing planing a microstructure design (3D geometric modelling by the use of CAD modelling system) and properties are modelling (factors and parameters). The process chain of additive manufacturing can be synthesize in five main steps: (1) the 3D modelling, (2) the data conversion and transmission, (3) checking and preparing, (4) building, (5) post-processing. Depending on the quality of the model and part in step 3 and 5 respectively, the process may be iterated until a satisfactory model or part is achieved Microstructure 3D modelling It is the most time-consuming part of the process chain, 3D geometry are modelling by the use of computer aided design (CAD), including numerical control stress analysis and finite element method (FEM). Data conversion and transmission An optimization method for sampling structures is used that exhibit the range of desired behaviors but keeps the structures sufficiently similar to allow interpolation. The process is repeated adding new structures to increase the coverage of the material space. The solid or the surface model to be built is convert into the appropriate format. The well known .STL file format originate from 3D systems which pioneered the stereo-lithography system can be cited in that case. Checking preparing As its name implies CAD errors models and non-robustness of the CAD-STL interface are being checked. Building The material is builder in relation to the constraints(elasticity, thickness, connectivity,toughness). Post processing Manuel operations are necessary at this stage for cleaning or extract the builder material considering the printed method used (SLS, FDM with resin) or remove the support (SLA postcuting).  Microstructures optimization  = Pattern optimization = To create a microstructure first a kind of tile has do be designed which provides isotropy, for example a cube. By assigning nodes to the vertices, the edges, the surfaces and one node to the interior of the shape of the tile, it is possible to connect these nodes. This connections are the parts which will be printed and the choice which nodes will be connected with other nodes determines properties and stability of the microstructure, therefore maximizing the edge space and the vertex space is important to get an optimized microstructure. However the following two attributes have to be met to be able to print the structure:  Printability  Printability can be achieved by assuring that for every set of connected nodes on one level there is at least one node which is connected to another node located lower in the structure. This criterion obviously does not have to be met for the lowest level. In addition to that the edges between the nodes have to be sufficiently thick.  Tileability  In order to be connectable the set of nodes which are on the surface of the tile must be the same on every side. This means if you put two tiles together, the respective nodes must connect. The actual microstructure consists of these tiles which are connected through the nodes on the tile-surface. = Shape optimization = Geometry complexity in 3D printing objects requires the control of the material parameters and therefore their properties to produce microstructures which can achieve different behaviors. Shape optimization can perfectly improve the stress concentration.Based on the assumption that curvature variation and negative curved regions generated high stress region introduce a low dimensional parametric shape model to eliminate sharp concave corners, which support minimization of maximal stress and an efficient implementation of printability constraint. Shape optimization based on the thickness of the deposited material to reduce the stress concentration by first accurately representing shells in the shape of conic by the use of the CAD, and then derive by the sensitivity analysis technique the stress required. = Topology optimization = Bends√∏e and Kikuchi can be consider as a pioneers in the microstructure topology optimization domain and was originally intended for the design of mechanical structures . In additive manufacturing, topology optimization is considered as an efficient method to find the right topologies by running optimization algorithms targeting to achieve the prescribed properties . The effective properties of the material structures are found unsing a numeriacal homogenization method, and then the topology optimization is applied to find the best distribution of material phases that extremizes the objective function . Inverse homogenization method has been introduced to achieve specific macro-scale behaviors with desired Poisson‚Äôs ratio. The inverse homogenization method plus constraint approach has been extended to design either mechanical properties . A data driven approach proposed , encode the variability in properties into a viable finite dimensional stochastic model, design material with a prescribed constraints and optimized to obtain the target properties. One of the problems in topology optimization is the increasing number of parameters due to the linear number of cells in the object. Two direction have been investigated to resolve this complexity. Firstly work with microstructures corresponding to block of voxels instead of individual voxels directly . Secondly, ignore the microstructure geometry and consider only the macroscopic behavior.  Printing methods used for microstructures  Additive manufacturing is used for the realization of complex material composition in 3D printing. Different techniques can be used to create microstrutures but they need to be able to print thin and complex structures. = FDM = When using FDM to print microstructures, artifacts can be visible and if the structure is very thin, the risk, that the structure breaks is high. = SLS = Selective laser sintering can be used to print complex structures and does not need any support structures, but the technology can struggle to print very thin structures, which are stable enough to not break easily. = SLA = With SLA it is possible to print in a high resolution, but the quality decreases when the resin becomes cloudy. = LOM = The accuracy of this method is limited in comparison to other 3D printing techniques and the amount of details which can be printed is low. That is why LOM is not very suitable for printing microstructures. = Other Methods = The printing techniques mentioned above are few of the better known 3D printing techniques, but other methods like for example LAM, DIW or Computed axial lithography can be used too. Microstructures applications  Microstructures used in a toy bear. Possible applications of microstructures are the fabrication of plastic toys using metamaterials to give them an elastic behaviour. The design of microstructures brings possibilities of realizing novel properties beyond traditional materials and the use in different domains such as mechanical engineering, aeronautics, astronomics, electronics, based on their deformation, compression, light sound and thermal mechanical properties. In the medical domain applications has been demonstrate with the ability to synthesize tissue, or to fabricate prosthetic or manufacturing bone with biomaterial. Other application of microstructures are the creation of sound absorbing material, using them as a catalyst, to create individual structures or just for design purposes.

Debut in the diplomatic career  Born in N√Æmes, in an academic environment, Roustan prepared a licenciate in law at Aix-en-Provence, then choose a diplomatic career. A student consul since 1860, he was successively appointed to Beirut and then Izmir, before being transferred in March 1865 to Cairo, where he was entrusted with the management of the consulate before being appointed in August of that same year. He then returned to Paris as attach√© to the direction of the consulates in December 1866 and was appointed consul in Alexandria in June 1867 and in Damascus in March 1868. Commissioner in Palestine in August 1870, at the time of the interreligious conflicts, he returned as consul of Alexandria in June 1872 after being placed on leave during the events of September 1870.

R√©cit contemporain couronn√© par l‚ÄôAcad√©mie fran√ßaise, √©d. Sfar, Paris, 2002, But the task ahead for Roustan was enormous: the English took advantage of France's weakening following the defeat in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War to obtain numerous concessions from the reigning monarch, Sadok Bey. On 23 August 1871, they were authorized to build a railway line between Tunis and Le Bardo, the future TGM. The contract even granted the authorization to operate for 99 years the land crossed by the line, inaugurated on August 2, 1872. Jean Ganiage,op. cit., This was an opportunity for the British consul, Richard Wood, to push his advantage by obtaining an extension of the line from La Goulette to La Marsa as well as the concessions of the Tunis - Hammam Lif, Tunis - B√©ja and Tunis - Le Kef lines. These were not the only contracts won by the English companies: the distribution of town gas was also granted to the \\"Foreign and Colonial Gas Company\\" for a period of fifty years.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., An English bank, \\"The London Bank of Tunis\\", was authorized on 19 May 1873 to issue banknotes despite protests from all foreign consuls.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., All these concessions had been obtained thanks to the benevolence of the former Grand vizier, Mustapha Khaznadar. His fall gave the French government hope of a turnaround in favour of French interests, but the French consul in Tunis, the Viscount of Billing, came into conflict with Kheireddine to the point of considering his murder. Faced with such incompetence, he was urgently called back to Paris and replaced by Roustan, who had the difficult task of making people forget this whole series of failures.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., = Struggle for economic influence = The Grand vizier found in the new consul the support he needed to carry out his reforms. The International Finance Commission, which managed the regency's tax revenues, was headed by a French financial inspector, Victor Villet and then √âdouard Le Blant. They appreciated the Tunisian government's desire to consolidate its finances and lent it their full assistance with the support of Roustan, who thus succeeded in reducing the influence of the British consul.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., The loss of Richard Wood's support was felt even in the economic performance of the English companies benefiting from the concessions at the beginning of the decade. The gas company went bankrupt in 1875. The English bank closed its counters in July 1876. The TGM was on the verge of bankruptcy to the point that its owners were trying to get rid of a line \\"without traffic, without passengers and without goods\\". We no longer even think about building the railway to Beja or Le Kef.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., Roustan immediately pushed his advantage by persuading Kheireddine to transfer the Beja line concession to a French company. This was done on 7 May 1877 after the French government had granted its guarantee to the Compagnie des chemins de fer B√¥ne-Guelma responsible for the works and created specially for the occasion. The French consul was aware that this concession was the first step towards a future railway linking Tunisia to French-dominated Algeria. But Kheireddine was no fool: the concession stopped forty kilometres from the and he strongly rejected all French requests for an extension to their neighbouring colony.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., Kheireddine's desire to foster a rapprochement between Tunisia and the Ottoman Empire persuaded Roustan that the Grand vizier was an obstacle to the French predominance that he was trying to impose in the country. He therefore ceased to support him against his many enemies, which hastened his disgrace and dismissal on 22 July 1877.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., The new Grand vizier, Mustapha Ben Isma√Øl, weak of character, quickly became a puppet in the hands of the French consul. The connection of the railway on Algerian lines was authorized on 28 January 1878. A declaration of independence from Constantinople was being considered. The English and Italian consuls noted with bitterness their total erasure. Even Kheireddine testified that \\"the French consul becomes all-powerful in Tunisia [...] and thus sees his wishes come true beyond his expectations\\".Jean Ganiage, op. cit., = Preparation of the protectorate =  Congress of Berlin  The Congress of Berlin which took place from 13 June to 13 July 1878, completely changed Roustan's mission. After always opposing the ambitions of the French, the United Kingdom now accepted their control over Tunisia. Upon his return from the conference, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, William Henry Waddington, asked the consul to prepare a draft of a \\"friendly\\" protectorate to be presented to the Bey of Tunis. He did so but expressed his doubts about Sadok Bey's acceptance and warned that only a military demonstration could force him to sign.Camille Mifort, Combattre au Kef en 1881 quand la Tunisie devint fran√ßaise, √©d. MC-√âditions, Carthage, 2014, Waddington eventually abandoned his project, aware that the French were thinking only of a revenge on the German Empire and not of a distant conquest which, moreover, would anger the country with Italy, animated by neighbouring ambitions.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., But this episode convinced Roustan that he had the opportunity to enter history by creating favourable conditions for a future occupation of the regency. From that date onwards, he endeavoured to increase all cases in which the French were involved in order to convince French public opinion that such attacks on the country's honour deserved compensation.  The Sidi Thabet case  Ferdinand Veillet-Devaux, so-called Count of Sancy, had obtained in 1866 a 1,200 hectare concession in Sidi Thabet to build a stud farm.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., In 1873, victim of financial difficulties, he accused the Tunisian government of being responsible and claimed enormous compensation. Faced with the refusal of the French consul then in Tunis, Viscount Charles Vallat, to support his abusive claims, he appealed to his brother-in-law, g√©n√©ral du Barail, then minister of War. Faced with such pressure, Kheireddine gave in and signed a new concession with De Sancy on 9 July 1877, granting him 3,000 hectares, on condition that he build a stud farm within a year.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., But, due to a lack of capital, he was unable to meet this last condition, which justified the Tunisian government taking possession of the property. On 10 December 1878, a commission led by , Director of Foreign Affairs, and including the President of the Municipality of Tunis, , the Inspector of Finance, Eug√®ne Queill√©, the Vice-President of the Finance Commission and the Secretary of the Commission, David Santillana, appeared at the estate for the seizure. They found a Janissary from the French consulate who forbade them to enter this \\"French land\\". Roustan immediately screamed at the violation of his home. An ultimatum was sent to the bey, demanding an apology and dismissal of all Tunisian officials involved.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., Queill√© was called back to Paris, Santillana resigned and left the country. Faced with demands that were known to be unacceptable, the French government was preparing for the breakdown of diplomatic relations, which would justify military intervention and the establishment of the protectorate. But to the general disappointment, Sadok Bey gave in. On January 10, 1879, the Grand vizier moved in full uniform to the French consulate to apologize for the Tunisian government. A Franco-Tunisian commission was set up to consider De Sancy's demands sympathetically. The only winner of this arm wrestling match, he quickly sold his estate in May 1880 to the Soci√©t√© Marseillaise de Cr√©dit.Jean Ganiage, op. cit.,  Confrontation with Italy  = Arrival of a new consul = Faced with Sadok Bey's obstinacy to defend the regency's independence, Roustan convinced Mustapha Ben Isma√Øl to use the monarch's weaknesses against him to get him to sign the protectorate treaty. But it was a failure as he testified to Felix Desprez: \\"Mustapha remembers the anger of the bey who went without speaking to him last year for three days because he had advised His Highness to sign the treaty. It seems that three days, given the intimacy of the bey and his minister, is something huge.\\"Jean Ganiage, op. cit., Failing to achieve his goals with the Tunisian monarch, Roustan recorded a small satisfaction of self-esteem when he finally obtained, on 31 March 1879, the recall in the United Kingdom of the English consul, Richard Wood, who never stopped opposing his manoeuvres. His successor, Thomas Reade, will be much more conciliatory with French ambitions. His main opponent, the French consul, who had been dismissed, was now facing attacks from the new Italian consul in Tunis, Licurgo Maccio, who had been in office since 20 December 1878.Jean Ganiage,op. cit., Well determined to block French claims, the latter systematically contested all requests for concessions in favour of the French by making counter-proposals in favour of Italian companies. He soon gathered around him all the opponents of the French consul, but the latter nevertheless retained the advantage thanks to all the spies he maintained in the bey's entourage.Jean Ganiage,op. cit., The sale of the TGM forced the two opponents to oppose each other head-on. = The TGM case = For four years, the managers of the , owners of the line, had been trying to get rid of this largely loss-making company. They were about to do so when they signed a preliminary contract with the for 225,0000 francs on 22 March 1880. As soon as he was informed, Roustan informed the managers of the B√¥ne-Guelma company, who outbid and took the contract for the sum of 262,5000 francs, i.e. more than twice the real value of \\"this old scrap metal\\".Jean Ganiage, op. cit., But the contract was broken by the High Court of Justice of London. An auction was then organised, won by the Italians for the sum of 413.7500 francs for a line that was only worth 100.0000 four years earlier.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., This French defeat worried the French government, which took a negative view of Italian competition in what is considered a French preserve. Roustan was then encouraged to accelerate the economic penetration of French companies by asking for the concession of a port at Rad√®s and a railway line connecting it to Tunis.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., In response to the Bey's hesitations, three warships were sent to Tunisian waters and a corps of 3,000 men was assembled at the Algerian border. Sadok Bey ceded and the company B√¥ne-Guelma obtained a monopoly on the construction of the railways and the concession for the construction of a port in Tunis itself was granted. Roustan could triumph; the failure of the TGM had lost all its importanceJean Ganiage,op. cit., and nothing stood in the way of France's economic control over the regency. However, the Enfida case reminded the French that everything could be quickly called into question.  The Enfida Case  The Enfida estate, covering 100,000 hectares, had been offered by Sadok Bey to Kheireddine in gratitude for his work. When he left Tunisia, no Tunisian buyer being interested, he sold the property to the Soci√©t√© Marseillaise de Cr√©dit, which had already acquired the estate of Sidi Thabet. But this sale was not to the taste of the monarch who considered that he had not offered this estate for it to end up in foreign hands. His great vizier shared his opinion because he intended to reclaim the land for himself without a free purse. His disappointment led him to move away from Roustan, which he had always supported in his companies.Jean Ganiage, op. cit., All new concession applications were now refused and old ones questioned. It was clear that Mustapha Ben Isma√Øl had now joined the Italian camp. After years of rejecting it, the military option was once again being considered by some French ministers. = Preparation for the invasion = The invasion of the regency by French troops from Algeria had always been considered by Roustan. To this end, he bribed the Tunis consul in Annaba, Joseph Allegro, who informed him about everything that was happening in the border region to the point of boasting that he could annex this part of the country as soon as he was asked.Camille Mifort,op. cit., A whole spy network was also set up by , the consular agent at Le Kef.Camille Mifort, op. cit., There were many border incidents caused by looting tribes. Conferences were then organized at the border between Tunisian and French representatives of Algeria to agree on reparations, as in 1875 and 1880. The French military appreciated the constructive attitude of the Tunisian authorities in these discussions. Yet, Roustan had an opposing view on the issue. As soon as the Sidi El Hamici conference ended in March 1880, he complained that these discussions resulted in financial compensation without the authors being punished. In addition, he considered that forest fires should also be included in claims for compensation. The French government finally agreed with his point of view and new claims for compensation were made in February 1881, less than a year after the last conference. They serve to justify to the French deputies the necessity of intervention in Tunisia to protect the Algerian colony. = Protectorate establishment =  Military conquest  The entry of French troops into Tunisia on 24 April 1881 was the consecration of Roustan's work over the years. The information gathered by Allegro and Roy facilitated the military conquest. As for the Treaty of Bardo, it took up most of the points he had written in his first draft of 1878. He was therefore one of the four signatories. His efforts were rewarded by his appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary of First Class and under Article 5 of the Treaty.Paul d‚ÄôEstournelles de Constant, op. cit., Even the uprising of many Tunisian tribes between July and December 1881 did not call into question his position. On the contrary, his links with Sadok Bey were highly appreciated since he succeeded in convincing the monarch to accede to French requests to involve the in the repression of the insurrection. This made his fall all the more unexpected.  Trial of L'Intransigeant  From the beginning of the campaign, the newspaper L'Intransigeant and its director launched a campaign against the operations, writing on 25 April 1881: \\"To what idiot will the ministry make believe that we are going to spend millions and immobilize in Tunisia forty thousand men for the sole purpose of punishing three Kroumirs who, from time to time, had stolen a 90 franc cow from our colonists?\\".Paul d'Estournelles de Constant,op. cit., In September, the newspaper tried to demonstrate that the purpose of the conquest was purely financial, to the benefit of speculators on the Tunisian debt. The government then encouraged Roustan to sue Rochefort for defamation. On 15 December, he was acquitted by the jury of the Seine.Paul d'Estournelles de Constant,op. cit., Discredited by this verdict which sounded like a conviction, Roustan understood that his days in Tunis were numbered. The French government was also aware that it took a new man to set up the administration of the protectorate without old personal resentments blocking the work to be done.Paul d'Estournelles de Constant, op. cit.,  After Tunisia  On 18 February 1882, Roustan left Tunis for Washington, where he was appointed ambassador. During his mission, he directed the work of the arbitration commission between Colombia and Costa Rica. On 5 August 1891, he was appointed Ambassador in Madrid. He retired on 19 April 1894 and died in Paris on 8 August 1906 at the age of 73 before being buried in the family vault at Ceyreste.¬´ Deuil ¬ª, Le Figaro, 10 August 1906,  Distinctions  Roustan was promoted to officer of the Legion of Honour on 11 November 1875, elevated to the rank of commander on 31 July 1879 before finally becoming grand officier of the Legion of Honour on 12 May 1894.  Private life  Roustan married Eug√©nie Roussi in 1867 but she died three years later, on June 5, 1870, at the age of 31. He never married again. In 1880, his liaison with the wife of the Tunisian government's Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs, Elias Mussalli, was extensively commented in the context of accusations of prevarication.Jean Ganiage, op. cit.,  References  Category:19th-century French diplomats Category:Aix-Marseille University alumni Category:Ambassadors of France to the United States Category:Ambassadors of France to Spain Category:Grand Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:1833 births Category:People from N√Æmes Category:1906 deaths ","title":"Th√©odore Roustan"},{"id":"62313431","text":"Harry van Kuyk (Zevenaar, 2 March 1929 ‚Äì Nijmegen, 7 May 2008) was a Dutch graphic artist, visual artist, graphic designer and writer. In 1969 he developed a new technique for the graphic arts, the printed relief or 'relief print', a print with an extreme relief (subsequently coining a new Dutch term: ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô).Joost de Wal, ‚ÄòThe Relief Print Technique‚Äô, in: Joost de Wal (ed.), White on white.

Harry van Kuyk (1929-2008) ‚Äì Reli√´fdrukken en kunstenaarsboeken, Ooij 2016  Early life  In his teens, Harry van Kuyk took up an apprenticeship at a small printer's in his hometown. It typified his enduring passion for graphic techniques and printing. He was trained at the Grafische School in Amsterdam (Amsterdam School of Printing and Graphics). Subsequently, he worked as a manual typesetter and a foreman at Boom-Ruygrok and Joh. Ensched√© and as a graphic designer and a lay-out editor at the Nijmegen magazine division of the newspaper De Gelderlander. Meanwhile, he drew, painted and photographed, produced graphic art at a small scale, and mastered graphic design. In his spare time he carried out artistic and commercial designs commissioned by companies, the local government and private collectors.  Graphics and printing career  In 1965, he became an independent graphic designer and set up a studio in Bemmel. He participated in regional exhibitions with figurative graphic art and drawings, and made contacts with painters, sculptors and graphic artists like Theo Elfrink, Klaas Gubbels, Rob Terwindt, Oscar Goedhart, Ed van Teeseling and with the artist- critic Maarten Beks. In 1969, he managed to produce prints with an extreme relief (up to 20 millimetres) in special thick rag paper. Initially he referred to them as ‚Äòpr√§ge prints‚Äô (based on the German word for blind embossing), at that time a common term in modern graphic art. Given a number of essential technical differences he soon coined and permanently used the Dutch term ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô (‚Äòrelief print‚Äô, meaning: ‚Äòprint with extreme relief‚Äô). Printed relief (two rectangles per square, 6 columns x 6 rows) 1970 paper 65 x 50 cm (passe-partout size) edition 7 His white, geometric-abstract prints, characterized by light and shadow, were a great success from 1970 onwards. One is inclined to compare them with the white wall reliefs and objects by Ad Dekkers and -artist Jan Schoonhoven. ‚ÄòThe most obvious interpretation of the Harry van Kuyk sheets relates them to Nul‚Äô, art critic Lambert Tegenbosch wrote in 1972. ‚ÄòThere is the same preference of white. Often there is some form of serial production. There is the picturesque definition of geometry. There is an element of mystery evoked by emptiness.‚ÄôLambert Tegenbosch, ‚ÄòGulden snede in de werkelijkheid‚Äô, in: Harry van Kuyk, Variaties op de Sectio Aurea (printed reliefs and text book), Nijmegen 1972 In the early seventies, artists like Schoonhoven and Shlomo Koren created their own embossed versions of white, geometric series. In 1971, Van Kuyk, supported by substantial state financial funding, built his large dedicated ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô press Aldus Manutius. He used it to print large size, coherent series covering specific themes: geometry, typography, the golden section. He organized the printed reliefs in clamshell boxes, portfolio's, wooden boxes and artist's books like Aldus Manutius (1971), Variaties op de Sectio Aurea (1972), Groot Abecedarium (1973), Tangram (1975) en Landschap (1980). He provided the editions with text booklets or sheets of text containing introductions and essays by art connoisseurs and journalists (Lambert Tegenbosch, G.W. Ovink, Joop Eilander, Wim Wennekes) or with poetry (by Hans Sternsdorff ‚Äì also known as Hans Ruf jr. ‚Äì, and Hans Bouma). In addition, he produced numerous individual printed reliefs with geometric, lyrical-abstract and figurative shapes. The editions were small: seven, ten or twenty copies, and very occasionally sixty. The production was quite time consuming. On his own initiative, he executed a number of his geometric printed reliefs in large white wall reliefs in wood (1973, 1975). Over one hundred exhibitions at home and abroad followed (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, London, New York). A number of sales exhibitions were completely sold out within only a few weeks. National and international museums acquired his work. The Groot Abecedarium was awarded Silver at the Third International Graphic Arts Biennial in Frechen (West Germany) in 1974. He moved his studio to Nijmegen. In 1980-1981 he was contemporary arts guest reviewer for De Gelderlander newspaper. After a 5-month journey across Africa (1982-1983) he settled in Ooij. His production decreased, as well as the number of his exhibitions, however new ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô editions and artist's books saw the light, including Bodoni Initiales (1993), Erografica (1995) and Novanu (2006). He produced large, minimalist white wall reliefs in acrylic or wood commissioned by, amongst others, the Municipality of Zevenaar for its town hall (1985). From the nineties onwards, he devoted himself to the more classical graphic art forms such as drypoint (nudes), and to drawings, gouaches and pastels (nudes, landscapes). He wrote essays and poetry for his artist publications. He published a dozen collections of stories, travel stories, and aphorisms. In 2007, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of Oranje-Nassau. He died one year later in Nijmegen. Printed relief from Groot Abecedarium (letter K) 1973 paper 65 x 50 cm (sheet dimensions) edition 60  Relief print: printed relief  A printed relief (‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô) by Van Kuyk is often mistaken for an extreme type of blind embossing. However, this is incorrect as the techniques differ. Embossing is a print without the use of ink with some relief (up to a few millimetres), produced on a platen press (for relief printing) or an etching press (for gravure or intaglio printing). In a platen press two platens are pressed against each other in one blow and with force, so as to have the template create a relief in the paper. In an etching press the template and the paper are fed simultaneously under a cylinder horizontally and smoothly, so as to have the template press the relief into the paper. A printed relief or ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô is a print (without the use of ink) with an extreme relief (5 to 20 millimetres), produced on a dedicated ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô press (special embossing press) by means of a mould or die and counter-die (felt mats). A printed relief by Van Kuyk combines relief and intaglio or gravure printing: the relief sits both in and on the paper. Van Kuyk's special embossing press operates vertically: the print mould or die (manually composed with elements of zinc, steel or aluminum), a sheet of moist, thick, long-fibred paper together with a set of felt mats are stacked between two plates (stamps). Under high, hydraulic pressure (up to 60 tons), with constant heat (up to 70 ¬∞C), over one to two hours, an image with an extreme relief is formed. The ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô mould is meticulously constructed with smooth raised (convex) and recessed (concave) segments so as avoid tearing the print paper. A ‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô or printed relief is the outcome of a delicate balance between mould, choice of paper, pressure, temperature and time. The process designed by Van Kuyk does not derive from embossing, but from stereotype. In its modern version stereotype was a commonly used early 20th century production technique in the commercial printing trade. Stereotype (stereos = solid; typos = stamp, letter) is the method in which a well-defined mirror image copy of a page of lead type is pressed into special paper board under vertical, hydraulic pressure in a heated embossing press.M.G. Fischer, ‚ÄòStereotypie, galvanostegie, galvanoplastiek, rubber-, semperit- en plastic- clich√©‚Äôs‚Äô, in: A.H.G. Blankensteijn (red.), Reproductie-technieken. Algrafische serie nr. 3, Mijdrecht (Stichting Graphilec) 1949 The paper board print mould (die) is subsequently cast in lead which results in a new printable page (‚Äústype‚Äù in printers‚Äô jargon) identical to the original lead type. In this way exact replicas of the same page can be used simultaneously on a number of presses. This in turn facilitates high volume printing in a short time frame ‚Äì a profitable way of printing newspapers, magazines and bestselling books. Around 1960, stereotype vanished due to the rise of offset printing; offset uses photography as a reproduction technique and made lead type obsolete. Stereotype: type and mirror image copy (paper board die) Reclam-Verlag, Leipzig 1953 Photo Roger en Renate R√∂ssing Deutsche Fotothek Due to his years of experience in large commercial printing companies Van Kuyk knew the stereotype technique inside out. As a pioneer he translated the technique to the graphic arts in 1969. In the ‚Äô70s various artists (Klaus van de Locht, Torkel Dahlstedt) mastered the process in his studio, at the press. However, whereas embossing and other graphic art with relief maintained their popularity, it is rare to find prints with an extreme relief (‚Äòreli√´fdruk‚Äô), due to the specialized skills required.

The company's only - in the European Union (EU) - approved drug is betibeglogene autotemcel (Zynteglo), which treats transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT), a rare genetic blood disorder, and has been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. The company has been criticized for the $1.8 million cost of the drug, which is the second most expensive drug in the world. The company is developing LentiGlobin gene therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. It is also developing T cell product candidates to treat acute myeloid leukemia, Merkel-cell carcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and MAGEA4 solid tumors. History The company was founded as Genetix Pharmaceuticals in April 1992 by MIT faculty members Philippe Leboulch and Irving London. In 2001, Walter Ogier was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Genetix Pharmaceuticals, and the company was focused on the development of LentiglobinTM for the treatment of sickle cell disease and thalassemia major (beta-thalassemia), the two most globally prevalent severe human genetic diseases. In September 2010, preliminary results of clinical trials of LentiglobinTM at Hospital Necker in Paris France were published in the journal Nature by Drs. Marina Cavazzano-Calvo and Philippe Leboulch, scientific founder of Genetix Pharmaceuticals / bluebird bio. Stable (21 months) transfusion independence had been successfully achieved by a patient with severe beta-thalassemia who had been treated with Lentiglobin 2 years earlier. This represented the first-ever long term correction of a major human genetic disease by gene therapy.

It is listed as a heritage site of national significance. History In the 19th century, an important Russian population resided around Lake Geneva, mainly in Geneva (bourgeois families) and Montreux/Vevey (nobility). One of the most prominent Russians in Vevey, Count Schouwaloff, saw his spouse and his only daughter Barbara die. Barbara was married either to Prince Dolgorouki or to Count Orloff, depending on the sources. Schouwaloff wanted to immortalise the memory of his daughter and built an Orthodox church dedicated to the Great Martyr Barbara. The church was designed in Saint Petersburg by Ippolito Antonovitch Monighetti between 1875 and 1878. It was built by Vaudois architect Samuel K√©ser and consecrated on November 1st, 1878. It became a parish church in 1949 and was listed among the Cultural Property of National Significance in 1977. For a long time, the administration of the church aroused controversy between the churches of Vevey and Geneva.

Life  Eglolf descended from the important middle- class Blarer trade family who were initially native to Saint Gall, but had for one generation been living in Konstanz. He was a monk in Saint Blaise Abbey holding the offices of Grosskeller and prior. Pope Martin V appointed him Abbot of Saint Gall at the end of 1426 or at the beginning of 1427. Eglolf is first documented holding office on 25 January 1427. \\"In 1436, he received the prerogative from the Council in Basel to let himself be consecrated by any bishop or abbot, should the ordinary (dt. \\"Ordinarius\\") refuse to consecrate him, as well as the prerogative to autonomously decide on vicars for the parishes of the city who were juridically subordinated to the abbot and the convent.\\" Emperor Sigismund confirmed on 28 November 1430 the prerogatives as well as the fiefs and rights, and so did his successor, Albert II, on 3 July 1439.  Works  The abbey's financial distress made the abbot ask the papal chamber for a deferral of the payment of fees. The troubles with Appenzell (dt. \\"Appenzellerwirren\\"), which consisted of a dispute that had begun under Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln and culminated in the Appenzell Wars and had remained unresolved for more than two decades, were also solved under Blarer. Defeated by Count Friedrich VII von Toggenburg in 1428, the Appenzeller became amenable to negotiations. On 26 July 1429, the Bishop of Konstanz, the St.-J√∂rgen-Bund and the Abbot of Saint Gall made peace with the Appenzeller. This peace corresponded quite closely to the award of the seven villages in 1421 under Abbot Heinrich von Mansdorf. Under Abbot Eglolf, the troubles with Appenzell as well as the Old Zurich War came to an end, whereupon, on 18 May 1437, the abbot agreed upon a land law with Schwyz lasting 20 years. Therein, the political reorientation of the abbey towards the Swiss Confederation manifested itself for the first time. On 16 March 1427 and 28 September 1429, Abbot Eglolf again confirmed the rights and liberties of the cities Wil and Saint Gall. Apparently, his endeavours were furthermore directed towards the inner structure of the abbey. To this end, he summoned the monks of Hersfeld Abbey who belonged to the congregation of Bursfeld. He abolished the monks' proprietary possession in accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict, annulled the benefice organisations (dt. \\"Pfr√ºndenorganisationen\\") of the monastery offices and reestablished the communal life. Eglolf is supposed to have repaired the convent buildings that had been demolished in the fire in 1418. Moreover, he is said to have begun the construction of a new chorus in 1439, which, however, could not be finalised, and to have established the monastery school. In 1440, he removed the monks from Herdfeld again, as they tried by means of a visitation of the Council of Basel to also obligate the Abbot to a stricter order. In their stead, he summoned monks from Kastl Abbey.  Reading list  * G√∂ssi, Anton: Kurzbiographien der √Ñbte. in: Johannes Duft, Anton G√∂ssi, and Werner Vogler (eds.): Die Abtei St. Gallen.

Georg von Wildenstein descended from the House of F√ºrstenberg and is first documented in the written sources of the Abbey of Saint Gall in the year 1347 as Provost von Ebringen, in 1351 as chamberlain, and since 1357 as working dean. After the death of Abbot Hermann von Bonstetten, the conventuals immediately held an election and elected Georg abbot, although the Roman Curia had, in 1333, explicitly reserved the right of appointment of abbey offices. Only some time afterwards, on 16 October 1360, was Georg confirmed by Pope Innocent VI on the recommendation of Emperor Charles IV . During Georg von Wildenstein's reign, the strive for independence on the part of the abbey's subordinate estates, namely the cities Saint Gall, Wil and Wangen and the collectives Appenzell and Hundwil, emerged ever more strongly. Thus, the citizenry of Saint Gall denied Georg homage and demanded the concession of further rights regarding the office of mayor, the free election of the council and the admittance of citizens. In 1362, in order to reinforce their demands, the city allied itself with Konstanz, Z√ºrich and other cities around Lake Constance, as well as with the Counts von Werdenberg, while the abbot entered into covenant with the Count of Montfort. Only under the impression of the defeat of a league of Swabian imperial cities against Eberhard II, Count of W√ºrttemberg, near Altheim in 1372 did the city and the Abbot of Saint Gall achieve an arrangement, in which the latter enforced his standpoint. Abbot Georg was likewise able to decide the conflicts with Hundwil und Appenzell by means of an agreement in his favour in 1367. Abbot Georg somewhat succeeded in rightening the household and vested rights of the abbey: in the bequeathed written sources from his reign, only one pawning is pitted against over a dozen releases of pawned properties. Furthermore, he newly purchased the bailiwick over Gossau and Romanshorn. In 1375, due to illness and old age, Georg appointed, with the conventuals' consent, Kuno von Stoffeln caretaker of the abbey, who after Georg's death in 1379 became his successor in office.

The surroundings of the village include the mountains Pli≈°ivica, Gradina and Orlove Stine (part of Svilaja mountain with a steep face), which are known for the occasional settlement of griffon vultures during their migration to the island of Cres and towards the Julian Alps in Slovenia. The village also houses the St. Vitus Church, patron saint of the village, and the village festival takes place on St. Vitus Day, 15 June. The village is known for its autochthonous Zelovo tobacco pipe made of clay. These clay pipes are made only in Zelovo and nowhere else in Croatia. In addition to pipes, the inhabitants produced also cigarette holders, wooden toys, furniture, wood carving decoration objects and musical instruments (\\"diple\\"-fluetes, flutes and stringed instruments). Almost every household in Zelovo was a production site for various craft items. There are few rural villages in Croatia where craftsmanship was so developed and promoted.

History The Great Church of Orbe was founded in the 12th century and destroyed for the first time in 1407 by a fire that devastated the whole building except the four walls and a few pillars. The church was re- built a century later by Balthazar Huguenin and Balthazar Jeanneret with the walls included in the city walls. The works were ended by architect Antoine Lagniaz, who re-built the nave and the side aisles between 1521 and 1525. Moreover, three side chapels were enlarged in 1687. The Post-Gothic church has five naves and notably features statues on the keystone, as well as capitals that represent Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary surrounded by angels. After the city was conquered by the canton of Berne in 1536 and after the introduction of the Reformation, the church became a temple and was shared by both faiths. The Protestant progressively made exclusive use of the building and installed a statue of reformer Pierre Viret (a native of Orbe) in the building in 1911.

Ariadne was founded by Christa Bittermann-Wille and Helga Hofmann-Weinberger in 1992 with the aim of facilitating study on gender and women. It provides a digital interface for locating information by and about women. The center is located at Josefsplatz 1, A-1015 in Vienna, which is the address of the Austrian National Library, and does not offer a separate facility for women's research. History Between 1986 and 1987, Christa Bittermann-Wille and Andrea Fennesz, conducted a feasibility study in coordination with the Austrian Ministry of Science, on the creation of an archive and information center for women. The rise of Second-wave feminism and the establishment of new feminist research within academia had brought forward the dissatisfaction with the availability and depth of coverage of women's topics in traditional library collections. Similar organizations abroad, like the Atria Institute in Amsterdam and the FrauenMediaTurm in Cologne, were studied. One of the biggest questions posed in the study was whether state intervention in the collection of women's documents would be accepted by institutions which already had begun women's collections as an imposition of patriarchy. It was proposed that such a collection be housed under the auspices of the Austrian National Library, as it was the largest scientific library in the country. In 1991, Bittermann-Wille began a series of consultations with interested stakeholders to determine whether the project would be accepted by other women's libraries, archives and their curators and patrons. The time period coincided with the birth of the digital age and archivists and librarians saw potential in the proposal, as long as the state did not dictate what materials should be collected and retained. Organization Ariadne was founded by Bittermann-Wille and Helga Hofmann- Weinberger in 1992 with the aim of facilitating study on gender and women. The facility provides a digital interface for locating information by and about women. Because traditional categorization of women's materials often obscured relevant works, produced limited search results, or were did not adequately represent women's works, new types of categorization were developed. Through networks with women's study institutions, historians and literary writers, Ariadne began to collect historic records to make them available for study and research with the goal of restoring the cultural memory and women's visibility in the historical record. Ariadne functions as a department of the Austrian National Library and does not have a designated reading room, nor are the works kept separately shelved from the library's other collections. The collections began being digitized and offered through a web portal in 2000 to broaden accessibility. A limitation on the material is that it is mostly available in the German language. Another limitation is that as of 2006, the archive of the umbrella organization ' (Federation of Austrian Women's Organizations), possibly one of the largest archives of documents from the fin de si√®cle in Austria have remained private and inaccessible to BOF members, academics, and Ariadne personnel. Collections and productions The collections of Ariadne contain works by and about women, their works, and the movements they were involved in as found in literature and other publications, as well as in gender and feminist studies. Though the focus is primarily on Austrian women, the collection also contains material on women from other countries. The collection on the early women's movement in Austria is titled Frauen in Bewegung (Women in Motion). Digitization of women's journals, magazines, and newspapers from the time of the Habsburg Monarchy (1282‚Äì1806) is an on-going process. Many of the journals provide information on notable historic figures, but also illuminate those unknown activists and the associations and activities they were involved with. Collaborative works have been sponsored by Ariadne and resulted in the production of BiographiA, KolloquiA, and ThesaurA, among others. ThesaurA was created in 1997 to provide a gendered language guide and inclusive reference to be used by archives and libraries to facilitate location of materials. The aim was not simply to make both sexes visible, rather than relying on a customary \\"default is male\\" categorization, but to also make gender less obscure in searching for materials using collective nouns, such as workers or movement. KolloquiA was published in 2001 and presents an inventory of available materials, research facilities and teaching references for women's information in Austria. Designed for both feminist experts and information science professionals, the material is designed to facilitate gender research. Though the BiographiA project began in 1998, the research required to compile the 6,500 biographies in the 4-volume publication delayed publication until 2015. The lexicon provides biographical sketches of Austrian women from the Roman period to the 21st century. In addition to the published volumes, Ariadne hosts an on-line database of around 20,000 biographies.

The book depicts the impact of an interstellar comet on moon and how the catastrophic effects are dealt with. The novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1998. Plot summary In 2024, Charlie Haskell, the vice president of the United States, is on the moon to inaugurate the first moonbase. An interstellar comet is discovered to be on course to impact the moon and shatter it. A rescue mission gets underway to take the thousand-something population of the base off the moon, with the support of the L1 space station (near the Earth-Moon L1 point) and Skyport, a larger geocentric space station. Haskell, in a moment of zealousness to show responsibility, promises the public to get off the moon only after every else has. Subsequent analysis reveals that the existing rescue plan would result in about 10 people not being able to get off the moon before the impact. The VP chooses to stick to his promise. Some volunteers, along with a few randomly selected people, also stay back. The rescue plan moves along, with the help of about 5 large spaceships, 'SSTOs'. The SSTOs dock with smaller ferry spaceships, 'moonbuses' and a 'Micro', in the orbit to take in passengers. Also, a last-minute risky plan of using the Micro to take off the last few people is put into action and it rescues the last group off the moon just before impact. The comet hits the moon, shattering it. The resulting debris of loose rock creates a danger to the rescue ships, as well as to the people on Earth. Some impactors, presumably a few hundred meters large, hit the Earth. The western hemisphere gets particularly affected because of the orientation of Earth during the impact. The coasts of the US are hit by multiple tsunamis and the land areas also face some impacts, resulting in widespread loss of life and property. The president, who had earlier decided against a coastal evacuation, is distraught. Many characters who have to deal with these events, like the residents of the affected areas, journalists and extremist militia members, are discussed in the novel. One of the SSTOs gets destroyed in space by a piece of debris measuring several hundred meters. The Micro also gets damaged and Haskell is forced to perform an EVA to fix the issues, which eventually succeeds. The US capital is also subsequently hit by a tsunami, and the president dies due to an aircraft malfunction during his rescue. Still in space, Haskell takes charge as the president. Haskell and other passengers of the Micro, are subsequently rescued by Percival Lowell, a 'nuclear powered' ship (presumably nuclear thermal) originally meant for the first manned mission to Mars. A mile-long piece of the debris, dubbed 'Possum' (from 'Possible Impactor'), is discovered to be on course to hit the US mainland, kill almost everyone in the US and possibly cause long-term worldwide disaster. The option of using nuclear missiles are put on hold due to concerns of even worse effects through radioactive fallout. Instead, a plan to redirect the Possum into a safe course, using the SSTOs and Percival Lowell, is put into action. An extremist militia group, with a lack of understanding of the impactor and sensing a possibility to take over the governance, damages one of the SSTOs, before getting subdued. Nevertheless, with the remaining spaceships, the redirection plan is determined to have retained the possibility of success. The redirection mission gets underway, despite risks like inadequate knowledge of the impactor's geology. One SSTO eventually crashes due to a geological imperfection in the impactor, midway through the mission. After the initial loss of hope, the mission is altered to a last- ditch attempt to coax the impactor, which happens to have a flat side, to skip off the atmosphere. The mission succeeds to delay the impact by several years. The epilogue discusses the positive socio-political transformation due to the whole event, the steps taken to further deal with the Possum, a dedicated impact avoidance strategy, increased emphasis on the space program and the first anniversary of 'the birth of Space Age'.

She is the Director of the AfriCenter division of the ISAAA, a non-profit international organization that shares agricultural biotechnology, focusing on genetic engineering. She is the chair of the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology Programming Committee, Kenya Chapter. Her responsibilities at the ISAAA include planning and managing all aspects of the AfriCenter programmes that include the transfer of agri-biotechnologies between industrialised and developing countries. She is also involved in the spreading of information on modern agricultural biotechnology to encourage informed decisions about contentious issues such as GMO's. She previously served as Council chair and vice-chair of the Cooperative University College of Kenya and Meru University of Science and Technology respectively. In December 2000, her project, involving the evaluation and transfer of tissue culture banana technology, was awarded the First Research Medal in the Global Development Network (GDN) awards for ‚ÄòScience and Technology for Development‚Äô sponsored by the Government of Japan and the World Bank.  Education and career  From 1992 to 2002 Karembu was a Senior Lecturer at Kenyatta University, Kenya. During this time she gained wide experience in technology diffusion research on small-scale agriculture. In 2000 her project involving the evaluation and transfer of tissue culture banana technology to the benefit of more than 5,000 farmers in East Africa was awarded the First Research Medal in the Global Development Network (GDN) awards for ‚ÄòScience and Technology for Development‚Äô sponsored by the Government of Japan and the World Bank. In 2002 she was awarded a PhD in Environmental Science Education with a thesis entitled: \\"Contribution of Primary schools towards Environmental Enhancement in Kenya. The case of Kiambu District.\\". In 2003 she joined the ISAAA. In 2008 she completed the Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Course at Kennedy School of Executive Education, Harvard University. In 2011 she attended the Strategic Leadership and Change Management for Directors of State Corporations at the Kenya Institute of Administration and the USAID's Champions for Change Leadership Course. In 2015 she attended Cornell University's Alliance for Science - Biotechnology Leadership Course. She coordinates ISAAA's Biotechnology Information Centers in Africa which provide information in English, Swahili and French.  Activism  Karembu has long been an active promotor of biotechnology. In 2001, as a staff member of the Kenyatta University, she was interviewed by New Scientist magazine regarding the propaganda from certain green organisations about biotechnology in Europe that has led to obstruction of attempts to combat hunger in Africa. \\"We don't get data, we get opinions,\\" Karembu said in the interview. In 2014 she wrote an opinion piece for the International Food Policy Research Institute published on SciDev.net entitled: The problems with the arguments against GM crops in which she pointed out that by 2013 more than 18 million farmers (at least 90 per cent of which were small-scale resource-poor farmers in developing countries) had chosen to use genetically modified crops on more than 175 million hectares of farmland. \\"New evidence shows that arguments against GM crops are unfounded\\", says Margaret Karembu. ‚ÄúContrary to widely held opinion that GM technology will only benefit multi-nationals and is meant for large- scale farmers, the latest trends reveal otherwise.‚Äù Karembu has actively promoted low-environmental impact methods, biotechnology sharing and genetically modified organisms as part of her work, by writing papers, presenting at conferences, writing two books for children presenting the case for genetically modified crops and in many interviews. In an interview with The Kenya Standard she said that \\"...linkages of GMOs to cancer are misplaced [and] ... even rural residents who eat traditional foods are succumbing to cancer.... The association of GMOs to cancer is partly caused by faulty studies that attempt to create an association....

MOWChIP-seq is a special type of ChIP-seq assay designed for low-input and high-throughput assays. The overall process of MOWChIP-seq is similar to that of conventional ChIP-seq assay except that the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and washing steps occur in a small microfluidic chamber. MOWChIP-seq takes advantage of the capability of microfluidics for manipulating micrometer-sized beads. In the process, a packed bed of beads is formed to drastically increase the adsorption efficiency of chromatin fragments. An automated oscillatory washing is then used to remove nonspecific binding and impurity from the bead surface. Initial version of MOWChIP device contained only one microfluidic chamber. In the more recent demonstration, semi-automated MOWChIP device for running 8 parallel assays was presented.  Applications  MOWChIP-seq is enhanced and low-input ChIP-seq thus it applies to all molecular biology that can be probed using ChIP-seq. This includes analysis of histone modifications, RNA pol II binding, and transcription factor binding. Published MOWChIP-seq results include studies of various histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, and H3K79me2)1,2.  Workflow of MOWChIP-seq  MOWChIP-seq requires a microfluidic system for running the ChIP and washing steps in a semi-automated fashion. The preparation of chromatin fragments from cells or nuclei and sequencing library using ChIP DNA is largely the same as in conventional ChIP-seq assays.  Data analysis  MOWChIP-seq produces ChIP- seq data with high quality that is comparable to those produced using large quantity of cells. Thus the data analysis is mostly identical to the analytical processes used in common ChIP-seq data analysis.

Jongkong was the simplest boat from Riau-Lingga area, and can be found widely though in small numbers throughout the area. The first record of jongkong comes from the 15th century Malay Annals, being used by Majapahit empire during the first Majapahit attack on Singapura (1350)Sejarah Melayu, 5.4: 47: So the king of Majapahit ordered his war commander to equip vessels for attacking Singapore, a hundred jong; other than that a few melangbing and kelulus; jongkong, cecuruh, tongkang all in uncountable numbers. and during the fall of Singapura (1398).Sejarah Melayu, 10.4:77: then His Majesty immediately ordered to equip three hundred jong, other than that kelulus, pelang, jongkong in uncountable numbers.  Etymology  Profiles and half-sections at the mid-point of the three forms of jongkong found in the Riau-Lingga area. The name comes from two words, that is jong and kong or jegong. Jong means a boat or sampan, no matter large or small, while kong or jegong is the place where masts are set up to hold the sail. Thus the name can be translated as a sailing boat that is used by the coastline community.  Description  In this region it is essentially a small, inshore boat and it is rarely built to a length of more than about 12-14 feet (3.7-4.3 m). It is typically a one-man boat, with a length of 9-10 feet (2.7-3 m), with depth at the mid-section about 10-12 inches (25.4-30.5 cm). It consists of a dugout base, with the hull spread slightly, and the sides built up by the addition of a single plank.Gibson-Hill (1969). p.123.

Approximately 20 local IRA volunteers commanded by Patrick Kenny attacked a British Military outpost that was guarding a broken down lorry.Brigade Activity files: A26 1 Brigade 2 Western Division (South Mayo)Irish Independent 04/08/1920 Page 5Interesting Extracts- Brief Personal notes on Parochial and other passing events by Michael F Waldron, Knox St., Ballyhaunis, 7th February 1953. Printed in Annagh Parish Magazine 2007, 2008, 2009MSP24SP830 Batt. Cmdt. Patrick Kenny Background A large lorry transporting petrol which was part of a British military convoy travelling from Claremorris towards Ballyhaunis came off the road on the Claremorris-Ballyhaunis road near Holywell on Saturday 31 July 1920. The driver of the lorry lost control and crashed off the road into the bog below.MSP34REF3087 Vol Patrick Finnegan, Crossard Coy The lorry had sunk somewhat and was stuck in the bog. A military guard of between 12-20 British soldiers from the 2nd Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, who were garrisoned in the old workhouse in Claremorris, was placed on the lorry while the rest of the convoy continued on their journey. The soldiers set up camp in a little old abandoned house nearby, throwing a large tarpaulin over the roof of the house for shelter.MSP34REF56920 Vol Matt Cribbin, Bekan Coy They placed two sentries on the road while the rest of the guard retired to the abandoned house where they lit a fire in the ruin's fireplace. Martin Forkhan, a local IRA volunteer, happened upon the scene of the crashed lorry and immediately notified the Ballyhaunis Battalion Commandant, Patrick Kenny, of the situation. Kenny issued instructions to mobilise all officers in the Ballyhaunis Battalion area.WMSP3REF35843 Vol Martin Forkhan, Ballyhaunis Coy On that same night, a train leaving Ballyhaunis towards Westport was held up by armed and masked men not far from the military encampment. A unit of 25 IRA men under the command of Capt. Martin Forde (Bekan Coy) took control of the train after firing a number of warning shots. The IRA then removed steel shutters destined for Westport RIC Barracks and buried them in the bog nearby.MSP34REF19068 Capt. Martin Forde, Bekan CoyFreemans Journal 4th Aug 1920, Page 3 The steel shutters were part of a program of fortification of RIC Barracks country-wide. Some of these men then mobilised with the other IRA officers gathering at Holywell Wood, where arrangements were made for an attempt to overpower and disarm the soldiers guarding the crashed lorry. Ambush The assembled IRA (approximately 40 strong) marched to the site of the military encampment where they took up positions. The volunteers were unsure of the size of the British force guarding the lorry, as all they could see was one sentry. An IRA officer approached the sentry and asked for a light for a cigarette. The sentry sent him into the camp. As he lit his cigarette from the camp fire he looked around and counted 18 rifles present. It was then presumed that there were roughly 18 soldiers at the encampment. Cmdt. Kenny made a plan and ordered an attack, but as the IRA volunteers were crawling through the fields towards the encampment, a line of motorcars appeared on the Claremorris road. Their headlights would have given away the positions of the IRA, so due to their poor positions, the delay in organising a plan and the coming dawn, it was decided that the attack was to be postponed until the following night. The next day, Sunday 1 August 1920 a section of men under the command of Capt. Patrick McNieve (Logboy Coy) was positioned near the site of the encampment to keep it under observation while the officers mobilised the whole battalion.MSP34REF22638 Capt. Patrick McNieve, Logboy Coy On this day, there had been sports on in Aghamore and many of the battalions volunteers had gathered in that area so were easily located.Annagh Parish Magazine 1990The Men Will Talk to Me. Mayo Interviews By Ernie O‚ÄôMalley (Chronology of events impacting Co Mayo and its Brigades, 1918-1924) Back at Holywell, scouts were posted on the surrounding roads to notify of any advancing British reinforcements and the road had been cut (a trench had been dug across it) to delay any traffic from getting by. On that night with all available men in the battalion area mobilised the IRA assembled once more and organised a plan of attack. Orders were issued, they manoeuvred into their assigned positions and waited. D Coy (Brackloon) proceeded to their positions between Ballyhaunis and Holywell where they were on outpost duty guarding the road about half a mile from the ambush site.MSP34REF11972 Vol James Sloyan, Brackloon CoyMSP34REF12092 Vol Michael Sloyan, Brackloon Coy The IRA officers decided that while the soldiers in the camp slept, some volunteers would attempt to sneak into the camp and take their weapons. Cmdt. Patrick Kenny led a small ambush party of about 20 men and crept into the camp at approximately 3am.MSP34REF20538 Vol John Kinnane (Cunnane) Bekan CoyMSP34REF11225 Vol Michael Folliard, Crossard Coy They were armed with shotguns and revolvers. A further 188 IRA men (many of them unarmed) from the Battalion were on scouting, road trenching, sentry and outpost duties in the surrounding district. The ambush party successfully infiltrated the camp without alerting the sentries and Cmdt. Kenny managed to gather up five or six rifles that were stacked together. But as he was leaving the camp, the alarm was raised and the British soldiers began to awaken. The IRA shouted a demand for the British military guard to surrender; but when no surrender came, the IRA opened fire. Three British soldiers were badly wounded in the opening salvo. One took a full shotgun blast to his back, another had a portion of his arm blown off and the third was badly wounded in the leg.Skibbereen Eagle 07/081920 Page 1 With three of their men knocked out, the British soldiers organised their defence and returned fire on the IRA. The IRA ambush party retreated to positions behind a fence where they maintained constant fire on the camp. A fierce gun battle ensued. In the darkness as Cmdt. Kenny retreated with the rifles in his arms he was caught in the crossfire and severely wounded by a shotgun blast from one of his own men. He had been shot in the left arm and face. He fell from his wounds and dropped the rifles he had been carrying. Capt. Martin Forde (Bekan Coy) and several other officers ran to Kenny's aid. Forde and his comrades were able to carry Kenny to safety. The battle continued on for about an hour and before dawn, just as the military guard seemed about to surrender, two lorries of British reinforcements came from Claremorris to their assistance. The British reinforcements opened fire from their lorries on the outposts as they encountered them who returned fire with their shotguns. With the IRA running low on ammunition and now out-gunned, Cmdt. Kenny issued an order for the IRA to retreat under fire.MSP34REF16819 Vol Thomas Dolan, Bekan Coy In total the ambush lasted for between one and two hours. Dawn was breaking just as the engagement ended. Ballyhaunis IRA September 1921: Back L-R:Capt. Pat McNieve (Logboy Coy), Capt Austin Tarpey (Holywell Coy), Bn Cmdt.

Nearly all of the men photographed played some part in the Holywell Ambush Aftermath The IRA operation was deemed unsuccessful as they had not achieved their primary objective of disarming the British soldiers and their commanding officer was badly wounded in the attack. The inability to capture the British soldiers weapons would hamper the battalion and the wider East Mayo Brigade's ability to conduct large ambushes in an area that was already in very short supply of rifles and ammunition. There were varying accounts of casualties from both sides. The IRA inflicted a minimum of three casualties on the British side and the ambush gave many volunteers their first experience of battle. Some of the volunteers who took part in the ambush claimed that 5 and upwards of 10 on the British side were wounded.O‚ÄôMalley Notebooks P17b/113 (Johnny Grealy) The British claimed that they had killed one IRA man and wounded several others.They also admitted that three of their soldiers were wounded.Leitrim Observer 7th Aug 1920 The following day, British police and military carried out an exhaustive search in the intervening districts. It was reported in the Western People, that in the search that followed, the police and military from Claremorris and Ballyhaunis found blood stains over the ground covered by the IRA and two shotguns, a loaded revolver and two overcoats.Western People 07/08/1920, page 5 In reality the IRA suffered only one casualty, that of their Cmdt. Patrick Kenny. In the military drive that followed the number of private houses raided totalled one hundred and fifty, however nothing incriminating was found.The Irish Bulletin Aug 1920 After Cmdt. Kenny was safely extracted from the engagement he was carried by Volunteers Jack and William Caulfield along with others to a house nearby and then on to Pat Healy's house. The British military's account reported that the soldiers witnessed a body being carried into a house nearby. From there he was brought to be treated first by Dr. A Smyth, Ballyhaunis, who was the battalion's Medical Officer.Annagh Parish Magazine 2015 Kenny was moved to Mayo county infirmary and treated by Dr. McBride, however, it was deemed unsafe for him to stay there so after 24hrs he had to leave and was treated in Union hospital for 10 days (Dr. Hopkins Castlebar).

It is used for live broadcast and audio recordings.  History  Originally named The Concert Hall, the theatre was designed by George Val Myer as part of the BBC's new Broadcasting House building. The hall is long, and tapers from wide at the rear to wide behind the stage. The room's height is , taking up three storeys of Broadcasting House. Upon original specification, the hall had a reverberation time of 1.7 seconds. Broadcasting House was opened on 14 May 1932 by Queen Mary of Teck. The theatre's first performance was held on 15 October 1932; at this time the hall's capacity allowed a large orchestra and an audience of 550. On 10 March 1933, the hall hosted a memorial concert to the BBC's former Director of Music, Percy Pitt. In 1933, the BBC Yearbook described the hall's acoustics and architecture: Val Myer's interior included extensive Art Deco fittings, an oak dado and bas-reliefs by Gilbert Bayes. The theatre's green room was designed by Raymond McGrath. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, part of the theatre was used as a dormitory. On 6 September 1939, Stuart Hibberd wrote that: In 1966, the BBC commissioned a report into sound propagation between spaces inside Broadcasting House, entitled Acoustic Tests in Broadcasting House, London: The Anomalous Sound Transmission between Studio S2 and the Concert Hall. The investigation found that Studio S2‚Äîsituated in the sub basement below the Concert Hall and used for small orchestras and pop groups‚Äîleaked sound into the auditorium above due to inadequate sound insulation and lack of a floating floor; this occasionally distracted musicians in the Concert Hall although it could not be heard on transmissions or recordings. In 1994, the Concert Hall was renamed the Radio Theatre. In 2012, a developmental Super Hi-Vision (8K) video system with 22.2 surround sound audio was installed in the theatre to show the London Olympics and its opening ceremony. = Organ = On 16 June 1933, the BBC unveiled the Concert Hall's Compton organ. To celebrate the event, the corporation broadcast a concert featuring George Thalben-Ball, G. D. Cunningham, and Walter Alcock. The organ featured 2,826 pipes in 35 ranks.  Productions  The BBC has recorded a number of comedy programmes in the theatre, including What's My Line?, Just a Minute, and I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. Musical artists to have performed in the venue include David Bowie (for his Bowie at the Beeb album). The Radio 2 In Concert series is broadcast from the theatre; contributing artists include Stereophonics, Jeff Lynne's ELO, James Morrison, Emeli Sande, Ed Sheeran, and Paul Weller.

(Original description) The shell is of medium size, rather thin, lanceolate, turreted, with a sloping shoulder, perpendicular periphery, and an excavate base. Its colour is uniform pale buff. The shell contains 7 whorls, including a two-whorled protoconch. Sculpture: The radials are discontinuous from whorl to whorl, feeble and oblique on the shoulder, prominent and perpendicular on the peripheral area, and traversing the basal excavation, widely spaced. There are on the body whorl ten spirals slighter than the radials. On the fasciole area of the body whorl are three faint and narrow threads. From the shoulder to the basal angle are five cords, which override the ribs and thus enclose a series of oblong and nearly uniform meshes. On the snout are six crowded and progressively diminishing beaded spirals. The upper whorls carry four spirals. Within the meshes are fine radial striae. The basal furrow is spaced as if a spiral of regular sequence to the rest were omitted. The aperture is unusually wide. The varix is prominent, more massive than the ribs. The sinus is shallow. The siphonal canal is bent, short, and open. This species has a general resemblance to Kermia spelaeodea Hervier, 1897 (synonym of Pseudodaphnella infrasulcata (Garrett, 1873)) from New Caledonia, but is smaller, thinner, less cylindrical, and with fewer radials and spirals, resulting in larger meshes in the sculpture.

Ellis Owen Ellis (1813-1861) also known as Ellis Bryn-coch, was a Welsh portrait painter, cartoonist and illustrator. His subject-matter was wholly Welsh and encompassed satires and cartoons printed in Welsh language periodicals as well as book illustrations.  Early life  Ellis Owen Ellis was born in Abererch, Caernarvonshire, to the daughter of John Roberts (Sion Lleyn). When he was a young man, Ellis was apprenticed to a carpenter but showed some promise as an artist, possibly in the capacity of a sign painter or in a coach building business. He came to the attention of the Welsh landowner and politician, Baronet Sir Robert Williames Vaughan. Vaughan introduced Ellis to the influential portrait painter Sir Martin Archer Shee, who later became President of the Royal Academy and a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1834 Ellis went to London to study painting, furnished with letters of introduction to other artists given him by Shee. According to T.R. Roberts, Ellis studied in the London Galleries that year and soon after his paintings were displayed at Exeter Hall and Westminister. According to the author, his Fall of Llewelyn, the last Prince of Wales and The Battle of Morfa Rhuddlan were 'exceptionally well received'. There is little concrete evidence determining Ellis's movements after 1834, but it is likely that he spent some time in Liverpool before moving to his home in Bryncoch near Pwllheli. Certainly, he was still in Liverpool in September 1855 when he was ‚Äòengaged in the ancient artisan tradition of ‚Äòpreparing Illustrations and Armorial Flags and Figures for the Liverpool Corporation‚Äô. A biography of Ellis Own Ellis' life published in the 9th June 1860 in Y Pwynch Cymraeg, (a Welsh-language equivalent of the English satirical magazine Punch), asserts that Ellis was 23 years old when he settled in Liverpool and worked for Alexander Moses. alt=  Portrait paintings  Ellis Owen Ellis belonged to the tradition of the Welsh artisan portrait painter. Itinerant, self-taught portrait-painters such as Ellis and his friends, William Roos and Hugh Hughes found success in the first half of the nineteenth century in Wales and England, at a time before the widespread use of studio portrait photography. This was largely due to the growth of an increasingly prosperous middle-class market who wanted, like the nobility, to own portrait likenesses of themselves. Ellis Owen Ellis' portrait of Morris Hughes as well as his pendant portrait image of the young girl beneath it, is a good example of his spare, comic style. One of Ellis' best- known works was his historical group portrait known as Oriel y Beirdd ('Gallery of Poets', c. 1855), depicting a group of 100 Welsh men-of-letters. This carefully rendered work is indicative of Ellis' familiarity with the Welsh cultural elite of his day. Indeed, according to Peter Lord, Ellis‚Äô home was a meeting-place for Welsh intellectuals such as Ceiriog, Llyfrbryf, Idris Fychan and Robin Ddu.  Book Illustration  alt= Ellis was deeply interested in the relationship between text and image. He illustrated a number of books and some of his best-known portraits were of Welsh poets, such as the engraved portrait of John Thomas, Y Bardd yn ei Wely ('The Poet in his Bed', 1861). Two of Ellis's most significant illustration projects include seven drawings of the bawdy Welsh ballad Betty of Llansaintffraid and his illustrations for the Life and Times of Richard Robert Jones (also known as Dic Aberdaron), shown in the gallery below. Dic of Aberdaron, like Ellis, was a somewhat mysterious figure; a self-taught polymath and linguist who also lived for a time in Liverpool. The art historian Paul Joyner points out the 'consistent innovations' found in Ellis' drawing. He describes the Life and Times of Richard Robert Jones as 'a Welsh Odyssey' and points out his use of a classical, 'Flaxmanesque, style of outline drawing'. Arguably, Ellis' style recalls John Flaxman's illustrations to Homer as well as Sandro Botticelli's illustrations of Dante's Divine Comedy'. Such a range of references leads to an unexpected synthesis in Ellis' work between rustic Welsh subject matter and classical erudition, obviously the product of a good arts education despite the artist's humble background. The tone of this work, like many cartoons and drawings by Ellis, is rather difficult to pin-point. It is light and satirical rather than serious, and potentially contains layers of in-jokes between the artist and his subject. Ellis also began work on a number of blocks to illustrate a picaresque fiction in pamphlet form about the highway man Dick Turpin published by John Jones.  Later life  Ellis continued to create satirical woodcut cartoons for Y Punch Cymraeg for three years between 1858-1860, before his death in 1861.

Springer Science & Business Media Traditional chestnut orchard (or \\"selva castanile\\") in Valle di Peccia, Canton of Ticino, Switzerland.  History  The chestnut tree was once known as the \\"bread tree\\". This name has its origins in the fact that chestnuts were widespread in Southern Europe and the use of its fruit abundant, thanks also to its healthy nutritional values. In addition to the fruits, the chestnut tree offered people wood, leaves, flowers and permitted honey production, thus becoming in certain historical periods of vital importance for the rural population (hence the term \\"Chestnut Civilization\\", in the sense of material and cultural organization of the mountain people based on the cultivation of this tree).Conedera M, Krebs P (2015) Il castagno : l‚Äôalbero del pane. doi: 10.5169/seals-587313 Already in the Middle Ages, the importance of this fruit in the diet of rural farmers was known, especially in times of isolation caused by the temporary disintegration of socio-economic structures or the trade network, which meant that the mountain population had to provide more autonomously for their supply. After the Middle Ages, in various mountainous regions of Italy and in Ticino, where the development of livelihoods such as fishing, trade or rich pastoralism was prevented, the local population specialized in the cultivation of chestnut orchards. In fact, the tree can also grow on marginal land, thus leaving the best land to cereal crops. At the beginning of the 20th century, chestnuts were still the main staple food of the mountain people for most of the year. An advantage of the chestnut tree was that its fruits could be dried and preserved until the next harvest, thus constituting a lifeline in the event of famine. Around 1919, the author Merz [Merz 1919, Il castagno. Sua importanza economica, coltivazione e trattamento. Berna: Ispettorato federale delle foreste, della caccia e della pesca]. estimated the annual consumption at about 100 kg per capita. Therefore, each mountain dweller depended directly on the production of two or more chestnut trees. The importance of chestnuts was also evident in various traditions and customs, such as the offering of chestnuts as a wedding gift or for funeral ceremonies, for paying taxes or as a life annuity for widows.[Lurati, O., 1971. Abitudini alimentari della popolazione ticinese fino alla met√† dell'Ottocento.¬´Schweizerisches Archiv f√ºr Volkskunde¬ª, 67,1-3, 179-195] = Decline of the chestnut orchards = The neglect of chestnut production was accentuated in the 19th century due to various causes: * replacement of chestnuts as a staple food with maize and potatoes; * improvement of agricultural techniques; the modernisation of communication routes (particularly the railway network) which permitted a better food trade with people living far from the main centers; * emigration of rural people to industrial areas; * possibility of selling wood and bark from old chestnut trees for the production of tannin, used in the tanning industry. Afterwards, the decline worsened due to the two main diseases of the chestnut tree: the Ink disease and the Chestnut blight. The chestnut orchards were gradually abandoned because of the difficulties in maintaining them and their diminished yield. More and more orchards were invaded by other tree species, thus decreasing not only the area planted with chestnuts but also the vitality of the trees, which are unable to withstand the competition of wild individuals. In addition, even the chestnut as food has suffered a fall in popularity, remaining important only as a base for cakes, as a side dish, for festive occasions or as roasted chestnuts. Today, per capita consumption is around 1 kg per person per year.Restored chestnut orchard in Valle di Peccia, Canton of Ticino, Switzerland = The situation today = Since the nineties there has been a renewed interest in the chestnut orchards. More and more local authorities and populations have begun to restore abandoned chestnut orchards. The reasons for this were mainly the idea of a return to the traditions and cultural values of past civilizations, the need to enhance the rural landscape, or the willingness to create economic and tourist initiatives for rural areas. In addition, there was also the desire to rediscover the chestnut as a healthy and natural food, versatile and easy to use, that can be valorised in the context of the general return to organic products and to the genuine cuisine. Since then, many chestnut orchards have been recovered in Ticino and in the Italian Grisons and the foundations have been set for their multifunctional and sustainable management.  Agroforestry  Chestnut orchard with donkeys grazing, Canton of Ticino, Switzerland Agroforestry can be seen as a particular form of intercropping, where trees are integrated in the agricultural system. In the case of chestnut orchards, the production of the trees is central. Thus, this system can be considered as high value tree agroforestry. A chestnut orchard can be divided in three different production levels. The trees are the first level, producing edible fruits, forage and wood. At the second level comes the companion crop, which can be either a cereal, mushroom or hay. And lastly, at the third level comes the animals, which can pasture under the trees; in such a case, the agroforestry system is more specifically called a silvopastoral system. = Silvopastoral System = The silvopastoral system is one form of agroforestry, where one level of the three-level system is a pasture used for grazing domesticated animals., Broom, Donald Maurice. (2017). Components of sustainable animal production and the use of silvopastoral systems. Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia, 46(8), 683-688. https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s1806-92902017000800009 In the north west of Spain for example, chestnut-silvopastoral systems are often linked to pork production., Garc√≠a de Jal√≥n, S., Burgess, P.J., Graves, A. et al. Agroforest Syst (2018). 92: 829. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-017-0116-3  Products  The traditional chestnut orchards are multifunctional systems. They offer a high variety of products, ranging from chestnuts and animal products to ecosystem services such as protection against erosion. The trees produce chestnuts, which are very interesting fruits with a high nutritional value,Bounous G (2004) The chestnut: a multipurpose resource for the new millennium. In: III International Chestnut Congress 693. pp 33‚Äì40 leaves that can be used as fodder and litter and flowers that allow honey production. The timber is much appreciated for many purposes due to its aesthetic qualities and its resistance to meteorological alteration. Chestnut orchards can be used for mushroom picking Diamandis S, Perlerou C (2001) The mycoflora of the chestnut ecosystems in Greece. For Snow Landsc Res 76:499‚Äì504 or to grow berry bushes. In Ticino, sheep and goats are traditionally grazing in the chestnut orchards, whereas in Spain, pigs are grazing and feeding on the left fruits during the fattening period. Such systems also provide the animals with protection against weather hazards. As a silvopastoral system, chestnut orchards also provide many ecological, economical and social services. FAOMauricio RM, Ribeiro RS, Paciullo DSC, et al (2019) Silvopastoral Systems in Latin America for Biodiversity, Environmental, and Socioeconomic Improvements. In: Agroecosystem Diversity. Elsevier, pp 287‚Äì297  Economic potential  Thanks to their numerous high quality products, the chestnut orchards have an interesting economic potential. The market opportunities for chestnut forest products have recently begun to expand, after a long lasting decline due to sanitary problems and to reduced demand.[Martins A, Marques G, Borges O (2011). Management of chestnut plantations for a multifunctional land use under Mediterranean conditions: effects on productivity and sustainability. Conference paper, DOI: 10.1007/s10457-010-9355-2] These new market opportunities have been created by the growing demand for natural products and technical innovation in the processing of these products. The demand for traditional products, once only consumed by the low-income classes, is now perceived as more natural and environmentally friendly, and is widely growing in all highly industrialised countries. However, the use of new technologies is essential to solve the issues related to the variability of production and the difficult preservation of the products of the chestnut orchards, so that they can take advantage of the opportunity offered by these new market niches. Technological improvement, in particular new developments in harvesting and processing technologies, have opened up new market opportunities for traditional chestnuts products, which can now be valorised and preserved at their best. Another interesting economical characteristic of the chestnut orchards is to provide both market (food, wood products, and fodder) and nonmarket goods and services (soil conservation, water and air quality improvement, biodiversity and scenic beauty), thus contributing to a diversified rural economy and effective environmental protection. For this reason, rural development policies are also creating favourable conditions to propagate chestnut initiatives. One of these initiatives is Agenda 2000, which promote the chestnuts orchards to diversificate the rural activities and obtain new sources of non-agricultural income in European Union member countries.  Ecological aspects  This system has beneficial effects on soil. The deep roots of chestnut trees and planted shrubs can maintain a better soil structure. Therefore, water retention is improved and soil erosion reduced. Deep rooting can also lead to a reduction of nutrient leaching because deep roots are able to absorb the nutrients which leached below the rooting zone of the grasses., Broom DM, Galindo FA, Murgueitio E. (2013). Sustainable, efficient livestock production with high biodiversity and good welfare for animals. Proc R Soc B 280: 20132025. http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.2025 The system is reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to two different aspects. First the carbon loss of the growing plants and the soil is lower because of the properties of the system. Methane production of the feeding animals in silvopastoral systems is also reduced. Additionally, silvopastoral system can produce more meat per area because to highly efficient food production of the system. This may lead to a higher mitigation of greenhouse gases. The potential of carbon sequestration of chestnut orchards is high compared to pastures only or cropping fields. This three-level system could play an important role in the mitigation of the climate change., Ibrahim, Muhammad, Leonardo Guerra, Francisco Casasola, and Constance Neely. (2010). ‚ÄúImportance of Silvopastoral Systems for Mitigation of Climate Change and Harnessing of Environmental Benefits.‚Äù Integrated Crop Management v. 11: 189‚Äì96 Lastly, the chestnut orchard is able to increase the biodiversity on several trophic levels. First, the number of plants increased due to planted shrubs and chestnut trees. Secondly these plants provide niches for invertebrate and vertebrate species. For example, it is described that the number of birds increased in three-level systems compared to pasture and woodland systems. Moreover, it is shown that the number of earthworms and other soil invertebrates also rise with beneficial effects on soil properties.  Social value  Recently, in many European countries, projects are being implemented to subsidise the restoring of chestnut growing areas, also for the role of chestnuts orchards in preserving landscape and country's traditional heritage.[Conedera M, Manetti M, Giudici F (2004). Distribution and economic potential of the Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) in Europe. International Journal of Mediterranean Ecology, ISSN 1775-4100, Vol. 30, N. 2, 2004, pp. 179-193] The chestnut orchards and their products, despite having been abandoned for a long time, are still perceived by a large part of the European population as local and traditional products and are therefore well- accepted. Moreover, the chestnut orchards have recently been restored also for their aesthetic values, and in many countries there is a positive trade off between chestnut production and tourism.  Challenges  = Diseases = Historically, chestnut production decline was accompanied by the diffusion of two important diseases: * Ink disease caused by Phytophthora cambivora, * Chestnut blight due to Cryphonectria parasitica. This latter one, which is a fungal pathogen, is now under control thanks to the spontaneous diffusion of a hypovirulent form of the disease.[Mariotti B, Maresi G, Maltoni A (2009). Tradizione, innovazione e sostenibilit√†: una selvicoltura per il castagno da frutto. Conference paper, DOI: 10.4129/CNS2008.113] In regard to the Ink disease, today this pathogen is less common but from time to time it is possible to assist to improvise death of entire orchards at a local scale. Nowadays, the recent problem of the Chestnut gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu) should be overcome thanks to the introduction of its natural antagonist, Torymus sinensis Kamijo, provenient from China as well. Another pathogen is Mycosphaerella maculiformis, a fungus which attacks the leaves which wilt and fall prematurely from the tree.[Nieddu S. (2008).Studi sulla struttura delle popolazioni di Cryphonectria parasitica dei castagneti del centro Sardegna finalizzati alla selezione di ceppi ipovirulenti da utilizzare nella lotta biologica. Universit√† degli studi di Sassari, Facolt√† di Agraria] The trees do not die, but they are weakened and will produce less fruits. = Climate change = Nowadays, the biggest issue is climate change and the more frequent very warm and dry or very cold and wet summers. In these climatic conditions, primary and secondary pathogen pressure is higher and therefore abundant harvests are put under risk. In 2003, the excessive heat during the summer caused tree leaves to wilt in July and August already, resulting in a poor chestnut production. = Trade-offs = The intercropping of chestnuts with other crops could lead to light competition due to the big canopy of chestnut trees. As the system is more complex, the workload might be increased. Therefore, such systems have to be assessed carefully before being implemented.

Some of the organizations that invited her included the American Academy for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation. In 2019, she was among the scientists invited to speak in a joint Canada-Monaco-France event on plastic pollution in the environment, namely at Maison Des Oceans, Paris, and the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, Monaco. That same year, she was called upon to testify in front of the Canadian Senate Committee on the Arctic and speak at the Belfer School for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Some of her other invited speeches were at the 2012 University of the Arctic Communications Workshop, Troms√∏, Norway. She has been nominated to represent the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) at planning group for the April 2020 International Symposium on Plastics in the Arctic and Sub‚ÄêArctic Region, Reykjavik, Iceland. = 2018-present: Career advancement = Since 2018, Provencher is Head of the Wildlife Health Unit at the Canadian Wildlife Service (Environment and Climate Change Canada), and her work focuses on the effect of diseases, parasites and contaminants on the conservation of wildlife. As of 2019, she is an adjunct researcher at three Canadian universities: Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario; Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia; and Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.  Significant contributions  Part of the Circumpolar Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) working group, under the Arctic Council, Provencher was coordinator for the Arctic Migratory Bird Initiative (AMBI). She worked with member and observer states to coordinate and implement conservation efforts for breeding birds throughout international flyways. She established a task force focused on the illegal killing of migratory waterbirds in the East Asian Australasian Flyway. This task force currently works to identify major sources of mortality in birds in the East Asian Australasian Flyway, and cooperate with local organizations and national governments to minimize the negative effects on bird populations. At the 2017 Conference of the Parties in Manilla, Philippines, she also co-lead the development of the initiative into a more comprehensive task force for all birds under the Convention for Migratory Species (CMS). She worked with communicators to inform and engage policy makers with research and science. Provencher collaborated on a research program to develop a Canadian ingested plastic research framework used to monitor plastic ingestion in seabirds and investigate questions related to the impact of plastic pollution on marine wildlife. She further co-developed and co-lead related workshops such as the Learning about Ringed Seal Health from Contaminants Science and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to further inform Inuit communities about contaminants while meshing with Inuit Knowledge and science. The ongoing community-based science communication program is now co-lead by the Government of Nunatsiavut. Aside from her numerous peer-reviewed publications as a researcher, Provencher is an author for several book chapters and gray literature articles, some of which were about the challenges of women and early career researchers in the science community.  Awards and recognition  Provencher has received numerous awards as a researcher and educator. The following are selected awards. 2018: Liber Ero Post-doctoral Fellowship 2018: NSERC Post-doctoral Fellowship 2016, 2017: W.

Garfield Weston Award for Northern Research (PhD)  Media and outreach  Provencher has presence in various radio, television and interviews with local, national and international outlets. This includes Newsweek, Maclean's, CBC, and The Guardian. The following are selected media and outreach activities. In 2011, her work on plastic assessment in northern marine birds, ‚ÄúPlenty of plastics in Canada‚Äôs Arctic birds‚Äù was written by Margaret Munro, science writer and journalist. In 2012, the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern development Canada (AANDC) produced a video featuring Provencher‚Äôs work with Inuit to study Eider Ducks. Provencher was also featured in Duck‚Äôs Unlimited‚Äôs magazine, The Conservator, for this Fellowship winning work. In 2015, the Smithsonian magazine featured Provencher in an article highlighting how seabirds act as vectors of marine contaminants dumped back on land. She was then interviewed in 2017 for CBC reports on the billions of plastic particles brought into Arctic waters through the ocean ‚Äòconveyor belt‚Äô. In 2018, Provencher and the minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, visited Nova Scotia, as they discussed plastic pollution and its threat to seabirds and the Atlantic coast. The minister later expressed her pride to have worked with such a dedicated public servant as Provencher, mentioning that Provencher's talk about work-life balance was an important message. That same year, she was part of a CBC radio coverage about a UK ban of plastic straw and other single use items and what could be done in Canada, titled \\"'We need to rethink the entire plastics industry': Why banning plastic straw isn't enough.\\" In 2019, she was featured in a Maclean's article \\"Is That My Plastic Bag in the Mariana Trench?\\" and was one of three guest plastic researchers part of a live panel discussion about the plastics in the oceans at the 2019 Advancement of Science meeting, Washington, D.C.

The protein is sequestered away from its substrate and then activated by release and exposure of the protein to its substrate. A substrate is typically the substance on which an enzyme acts but can also be a protein surface to which a ligand binds. The substrate is the material acted upon. In the case of an interaction with an enzyme, the protein or organic substrate typically changes chemical form. Substrate presentation differs from allosteric regulation in that the enzyme need not change its conformation to begin catalysis. Substrate translocation; A substrate (purple rectangle) is shown sequestered into a lipid domain (green lipids). The substrates translocation to the disordered region (grey lipids) presents it to its enzyme (blue oval) where it is hydrolyzed. Types =SARS-CoV-2= (Furin) (producing cell, replication). When cells are loaded with cholesterol furin traffics to GM1 lipid rafts where it is localized with the palmitoylated spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and primes it for viral entry. (ACE2) (target Cell, viral entry), the receptor for SARS- CoV-2 ACE2 traffics SARS-CoV-2 to GM1 lipid rafts where it is endocytosed and exposed to cathepsin for cleavage and optimal cells fusion. In low cholesterol ACE2 traffics the virus to TMPRSS2 which also cleaves and allows viral entry but through a surface mechanism that is much less efficient. The sensitivity of ACE2 to cholesterol is thought to contribute to less severe COVID19 symptoms in children. =Amyloid Precursor Protein= Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by beta and gamma secretase to yield a 40-42 amino acid peptide responsible for beta amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimers disease. The enzymes are regulated by substrate presentation. The substrate APP is palmitoylated and moves in and out of GM1 lipid rafts in response to astrocyte cholesterol. Cholesterol delivered by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) drives APP to associate with GM1 lipid rafts. When cholesterol is low the protein traffics to the disordered region and is cleaved by alpha secretase to produce a non amylogenic product. The enzymes do not appear to response to cholesterol, only the substrate moves. Hydrophobicity drives the partitioning of molecules. In the cell, this gives rise to compartmentalization within the cell and within cell membranes. For lipid rafts, palmitoylation regulates raft affinity for the majority of integral raft proteins. Raft regulation is regulated by cholesterol signaling. =Phospholipase D2= (PLD2) is a well- defined example of an enzyme activated by substrate presentation. The enzyme is palmitoylated causing the enzyme to traffic to GM1 lipid domains or \\"lipid rafts\\". The substrate of phospholipase D is phosphatidylcholine (PC) which is unsaturated and is of low abundance in lipid rafts. PC localizes to the disordered region of the cell along with the polyunsaturated lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PLD2 has a PIP2 binding domain. When PIP2 concentration in the membrane increases, PLD2 leaves the GM1 domains and binds to PIP2 where it then gains access to its substrate PC and commences catalysis based on substrate presentation. Presumably, the enzyme is capable of catalyzing a reaction in a lipid raft but lacks a substrate for activity. Enzyme translocation; PLD (blue oval) is sequestered into cholesterol- dependent lipid domains (green lipids) by palmitoylation. PLD also binds PIP2(red hexagon) domains (grey shading) located in the disordered region of the cell with phosphatidylcholine (PC). When PIP2 increases in the cell PLD translocates to PIP2 where it is exposed to and hydrolizes PC to phosphatidic acid (red spherical lipid). Mechanisms of activation =sequestration= Phase separation, endometriosis, vesicle formation, organelle trafficking Either the substrate of the enzyme can move. Movement is typically the disruption of palmitate mediated localization. For proteins that are both palmitoylated and bind PIP2, increasing the concentration of PIP2 favors trafficking of the enzyme out of lipid rafts to PIP2. PIP2 is primarily polyunsaturated which causes the lipid to localize away from lipid rafts and allows the PIP2 to oppose palmitate mediated localization. Regulation =Cholesterol= Cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) regulate lipid raft formation, hence the biological function of rafts. When saturated lipids and cholesterol increase in the membrane, lipid rafts increase their affinity for palmitoylated proteins. PUFAs have the opposite effect, they fluidize the membrane. =PUFAs= PUFAs may also increase the concentration of signaling lipids. The arachidonic acid, a very common PUFA in the brain, incorporates into PC. Arachidonyl PC is a preferred substrate of PLD likely increasing the amount of PA in a cell. Regulation of raft function by cholesterol effectively regulates substrate presentation and the many palmitoylated proteins that utilize substrate presentation as a mechanism of activation. While speculative, the profound effect of cholesterol and PUFAs on human health is likely through physiological regulation of lipid raft function in cells. Role in Biology =mechanosensation= Mechanical force (shear or swell) can independently disrupt the packing and resultant affinity of palmitate to lipid rafts. This disruption also causes PLD2 to favor trafficking to PIP2 domains. =anesthesia= General anesthetic propofol and inhaled anesthetics xeon, chloroform, isoflurane, diethyl ether disrupt lipid raft function including palmitate mediated localization of PLD2 to lipid rafts. Activation of PLD then activates TREK-1 channels. The membrane mediated PLD2 activation could be transferred to an anesthetic insensitive homolog TRAAK, rending the channel anesthetic sensitive.

He was an Austrian sympathizer. Biography He completed elementary school (Norma Avram Mrazoviƒá) and grammar school in his hometown and at the gymnasium in Szeged, after which he studied law in Budapest. On 1 February 1798, Dean Emerick Kelemen of the Faculty of Law sent a letter of recommendation to Metropolitan Stefan Stratimiroviƒá and Jovan Saviƒá was accepted as a professor of the preparatory class of the Second Latin Grammar School in Sremski Karlovci,and in the following school year 1799/1800 Saviƒá was appointed professor of the grammar class. He left his professorship on 1 March 1802 and moved to Vr≈°ac as Bishop Josif Jovanoviƒá ≈†akabenta's secretary, at which time he clashed with Metropolitan Stratimiroviƒá, leaving his position in Vr≈°ac in 1805. He moved to Serbia, to Smederevo, where, under the pseudonym Ivan Jugoviƒá, he soon became a clerk in the ruling Supreme Council (Praviteljstvuju≈°ƒái sovjet), headed by president Matija Nenadoviƒá.In 1807, after the death of Bo≈æidar Grujoviƒá, the first secretary of Serbia's ruling Council, Jugoviƒá took Grujoviƒá's place. In early September of the same year, he was sent on a diplomatic mission at the headquarters of the Russian army in Bucharest. Based on the intrigues of Russian envoy to Serbia Konstantin Rodofinikin, Jugoviƒá was dismissed from the Supreme Council at the end of 1807. After leaving his job, Ivan Jugoviƒá decided to set up a school in Belgrade that would teach more science and teach future national leaders and governors of Serbia. The Grandes √©coles was solemnly opened on 31 August (12 September according to the Julian calendar) in 1808 by the dedication of Jugoviƒá and a theological seminary in 1810. Dositej Obradoviƒá was appointed its first rector and Jugoviƒá was its only professor during the first semester. Karadjordje and other leaders sent their sons to the new school they called Velika ≈°kola (Grandes √©coles after the French model).Its first students included Lazar Arsenijeviƒá Batalaka and Vuk Karad≈æiƒá. At the end of 1808, Jugoviƒá was politically rehabilitated and headed a diplomatic mission (included Pavle Popoviƒá and Janiƒáije Djuriƒá) that spent months in Jassy, at the headquarters of the Russian army, in talks with Field Marshal Prince Alexander Prozorovsky about Serbia's future status.On his return from this mission, Jugoviƒá was appointed President of the Belgrade Magistrate, and in March 1810 served on a diplomatic mission as Karadjordje's envoy to the Austrian Emperor Francis I in Vienna. In early 1811 he was re- appointed as the first secretary of the Ruling Soviet. When Dositej Obradoviƒá died in March 1811, Jugoviƒá was appointed to the post of the Enlightened One (Minister of Education in the uprising Serbian government). In the conflict between the Russophile and Austrophilic currents (to which Jugoviƒá belonged ) in the Serbian political leadership, Jugoviƒá, with Miljko Radonjiƒá and Mihailo Grujoviƒá, was expelled from the Supreme Council at the end of 1812. He left Belgrade at the beginning of March 1813, and spent the last months of his life between Baƒçka Palanka, Timi»ôoara, Vienna and Greater Beccerek (today Zrenjanin), where he died on 7/19. November 1813. He was buried in the port of the Church of the Holy Dormition in Vienna. He played one of the crucial roles in consolidating Serbian independence and shaping the state structure of Revolutionary Serbia, and several decades ago, Jugoviƒá's ideas about a strong, free and independent nation-state that would be the bearer of the national aspirations for liberation and other places where Serbs live.

On 17 August 1451, the abbot formed an eternally valid land law with the confederal cities of Zurich, Lucerne, Schwyz and Glarus. The lawsuit was only settled in 1457, however, thanks to the intermediation of Bern. The abbot was able to keep most of his rights, but the city had the possibility to buy them from him. On 14 May 1457, the city paid the amount of 7000 gulden and thus became a free imperial city. This was not the last of Kaspar von Breitenlandenberg‚Äôs trials, however. Already for quite some time, the monks of the abbey had accused him of mismanagement and agreements with the opposite party. His opinion regarding the rights of the city had in the course of the negotiations changed more and more in the city's favour, and eventually, he wanted to leave them all the sovereign rights of the monastery for only 1000 gulden, which, however, the convent was able to prevent. In November 1457, the abbot was definitely deprived of the administration of the abbey. The administration of finances had already been in the hands of his successor, Ulrich R√∂sch, for some time. Von Breitenlandenberg spent the last years of his life chiefly in Reichenau or in Konstanz. He died on 24 April 1463 in Konstanz, but was buried in Saint Gall. During his reign, the convent counted more members than during the whole of the previous century.

Designed by Whitley C. Clacy, the church was built in 1858‚Äì59 and declared redundant in 1973. It is now a private residence and has been a Grade II listed building since 1952. History All Saints was built as a chapel of ease to St Nicholas in the parish of Wilsford. A church for Manningford Bohune was proposed in 1857 and supported by the rector of Woodborough, Rev. W. T. Wyld. As Manningford Bohune was an outlying part of the parish, the village's residents had to journey two to three miles to reach the parish church. Furthermore, there had been an increase to its population in recent years. A plot of land was donated by Mr. Henry Jenner of Chisenbury, and funds were raised by voluntary contribution and grants. Rev. George Ernest Howman, the patron of the living and rector of Barnsley, donated ¬£700, Rev. Wyld donated ¬£155 and raised a further ¬£245. A grant of ¬£110 was received from the Incorporated Society and ¬£100 from the Diocesan Society. The plans for the church were drawn up by Whitley C. Clacy of Devizes and Messrs. May and Sons of Bath hired as the builders, with the architect supervising the construction. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs. Howman on 14 May 1858. Unforeseen extra expense was incurred during the early stage of construction as the foundations had to be laid to a greater depth. The church, which cost ¬£1,350 to build, was completed on 1 October 1858, and its consecration set for 1 November (All Saints' Day), but this was delayed in order to meet the requirements of the Bishop of Salisbury for the church to hold two services on Sundays. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. Walter Kerr Hamilton, on 1 March 1859. All Saints was declared redundant by the Church of England on 3 April 1973, and subsequently sold in 1975 and converted into a residence. Architecture All Saints is built of Twerton blue lias stone, jointed with grey mortar, with dressings in freestone and a slate roof. It was made up of a nave, chancel, south porch and north vestry. A bellcote containing a single bell was placed on the west end of the church, and a stone cross on the east end. The open roof is made of stained deal. Original fittings included benches of stained deal, a stone font and pulpit, and a prayer desk of oak. The floor was laid with black and red tiles. Rev. Howman gifted the stained glass of the east and west windows.

He is considered one of the most outstanding abbots of the monastery.  Life  R√∂sch, the son of a baker, was the first Abbot of Saint Gall from civic descent. He was accepted at the monastery school on the grounds of his talent and became a monk between 1440 and 1445. In 1451, he became Grosskeller, but only two years later, he had to leave the monastery again. In 1453/1454, he lived at Wiblingen Abbey near Ulm.  Works  The abbot's coat of arms with the coat of arms of the prince abbey (top left) and the county of Toggenburg (top right) After his return to his home monastery, R√∂sch became the leader of the reform-minded conventuals who protested against their transformation into an Augustinian canon. In 1457, R√∂sch became administrator, after Abbot Kaspar von Breitenlandenberg had been suspended in the course of a visitation. Von Breitenlandenberg abdicated in 1463 due to illness, whereupon R√∂sch also formally became abbot in his stead. Von Breitenlandenberg died in the same year. R√∂sch‚Äôs time as abbot is marked by the strengthening of monastic discipline, and especially by the consolidation of the monastery‚Äôs finances and the powerful extension of the sovereignty of the prince abbey. His plan to move the monastery to Rorschach, in order to free it from the grasp of the city of Saint Gall, failed because Saint Gall‚Äôs citizens, in alliance with the Appenzeller in the Rorschacher Klosterbuch, destroyed the initiated constructions in Rorschach in 1489. Although the confederate refuges of the abbey enforced compensation payment, the monastery remained in the city of Saint Gall. R√∂sch also furthered the spiritual life in the abbey and protruded in his function as constructor.

Pi≈Çsudski's tank was created on the basis of an unknown brand of truck.  History  After Battle of Lviv (1918‚Äì1919) in Lviv, the idea of building an armored car was born that would support the assault of infantry on buildings occupied by the enemy. Second Lieutenant Edward Sas-≈öwistelnicki received from Capt. Tadeusz Kudelski an order to organize construction, while the vehicle design was developed by prof. Antoni Markowski. The construction of the vehicle in the Railway Workshops lasted several days to November 7. The vehicle started fighting on November 9, 1918, when it supported the attack of Lt Kazimierz Schleyen's unit through the Jesuit Garden. In addition to the commander, the other crew were: Eugeniusz Bernacki and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kubala (drivers) and Mieczys≈Çaw Kretowicz, Edward Kustanowicz, Bronis≈Çaw Nizio≈Ç and Stefan Zambelli (machine gunner sights). The vehicle's attack was stopped by the obstacle set, and then the vehicle was heavily fired at. To make matters worse, three of the four machine guns that were arming the vehicle were jammed. The vehicle was therefore withdrawn. Following a collision with a tree after only several days of service, the vehicle‚Äôs participation in combat was limited. At the end of the struggle, on November 22, the tank was directed to the Lychakivka turnpike to protect it, and then to Plac Krakowski. The fate of the vehicle after the war is unknown.  Reconstruction  In 2018, the Railway Acceptance Foundation undertook to restore the vehicle. Due to the lack of documentation, the dimensions were calculated according to the Lviv tenement house visible on one of the photographs, which has survived to modern times, serving as a scale. The proper armor was made of a few millimeter sheet metal, the so- called mesh protecting the vehicle from below called a \\"Led√≥chowski grid\\". The replica of the vehicle was presented to the public for the first time at the celebration of the centenary of regaining independence, November 11, 2018. http://fkpw.pl/tank/ [access 10.11.2018]  References  Category:Improvised armoured fighting vehicles Category:Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War ","title":"Pi≈Çsudski Tank"},{"id":"62315115","text":"Events during the year 1995 in Italy.

Founded in 1741, throughout most of its history, the church served the German-speaking Catholics of Lancaster. The parish has had three church buildings over the course of its existence, with the current Gothic Revival brick church being completed in 1854.  History  Two German- speaking Jesuits from Maryland arrived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in June 1741. They purchased land and built a small log chapel for the German population of Lancaster, giving the mission church the name of St. John Nepomucene. The church operated alongside the many other Christian denominations in Lancaster until one night in December 1760, when the chapel was lit ablaze. The chief burgess (city council chairman) offered a reward for information about the perpetrator, but none was ever found. Two years passed before a replacement was built. The parishioners quickly built a new stone church, the men gathering limestone from the fields and assembling it into a structure and the women mixing mortar. The cornerstone was laid in 1762. Upon its completion later that year, the church was renamed the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and was elevated to the status of a parish. It was also known among the German-speaking parishioners as (St. Mary's Church). With tensions between the German and Irish parishioners rising in the mid-19th century, the Irish pastor of St. Mary's encouraged the establishment of St. Joseph's Church in Lancaster, which would serve the German parishioners. With the parish growing, the church sought to build a larger structure to replace the stone church that had served the parish for 120 years. Work was undertaken on a Gothic Revival brick church, whose cornerstone was laid by the Bishop of Philadelphia, John Neumann. The church was completed and consecrated in March 1854. The former stone church continued to be used as a hall for festivals until it was demolished in 1881 in order to construct a school. Another fire broke out in the church in January 1867, caused by a faulty heater, doing extensive damage, though not destroying the brick exterior. Architect Edwin Forrest Durang oversaw the reconstruction and expansion, which was complete in 1868. The church was re-consecrated on May 3, 1868. The church underwent further expansion from 1885 to 1887, which added the Gothic arches and side chapels. The pastor of the church also invited Italian painter Filippo Costaggini, who was working on the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., to decorate St. Mary's. The stained glass windows and statute of St. Mary were added between 1888 and 1897.

Operating since 1978, it is owned and operated by Fran√ßoise Mouly. The company first came to prominence publishing Raw magazine, co-edited by Mouly and her husband, cartoonist Art Spiegelman. In the 1980s the company published graphic novels, and with the formation of Raw Junior in 1999, branched into children's comics with Little Lit and Toon Books.  History  = Origins = In 1978 Mouly founded Raw Books and Graphics, a name settled on in part because of its small-operation feel, and part because it was reminiscent of Mad magazine. Mouly worked from an aesthetic inspired in part by the Russian Constructivists, who brought a design sense to everyday objects. Raw Books began by publishing postcards and prints by artists such as underground cartoonist Bill Griffith and Dutch cartoonist Joost Swarte. More ambitious projects included art objects such as the Zippy-Scope, a cardboard device with to watch a comic strip rolled up on a film spool, featuring Griffth's character Zippy the Pinhead. Some projects were more commercial, such as the annual Streets of SoHo Map and Guide, whose advertising revenue financed much of Raw Books. = Raw = Having in this way honed her publishing skills, Mouly's ambition turned to magazine publication with Raw. In the midst of a commercial and artistic fallow period in the American comics industry, the lavishly-printed, first issue of Raw appeared in July 1980. The best-known work to run in Raw was a serialization of Spiegelman's graphic novel Maus, which ran as an insert for the duration of the magazine from the December 1980 second issue. Raw had a strong critical reception, and also sold surprisingly well. Raw Books published six One Shot books from 1981 to 1986 by cartoonists such as Gary Panter, Sue Coe, and Jerry Moriarty. Mouly brought a similar production sensibility to these books to what she brought to Raw: the cover to Panter's Jimbo was corrugated cardboard pasted with stickers of the book's main character. By the end of the decade, Pantheon Books had begun co- publishing Raw Books' output, and Penguin Books had picked up publishing of Raw itself. In 1991, Mouly and Spiegelman published the final issue of Raw, which was no longer a small, hands-on operation, nor was it something they still thought necessary, as the artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when Raw first saw the light of day. = Little Lit = Mouly founded Raw Junior 1999 and the company's next ongoing project was Little Lit, a comic book anthology series created expressly for children, authored by major cartoonists and literary figures. Contributors include writers such as Paul Auster, Neil Gaiman, and David Sedaris; cartoonists such as Daniel Clowes, Tony Millionaire, and Chris Ware; and children's writers such as William Joyce, Barbara McClintock and Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler). Little Lit series began publication in 2000 with the 64-page hardcover book, Little Lit: Folklore & Fairy Tale Funnies. This was followed by two subsequent volumes, Strange Stories for Strange Kids (2001), and It Was a Dark and Silly Night..., published in 2003. = Toon Books = In 2008, the children's comics publisher Toon Books debuted with eight hardcover early reader titles. Featuring such creators as Geoffrey Hayes, Jay Lynch, Dean Haspiel, Eleanor Davis, and Spiegelman, Toon Books claimed to provide \\"the first high-quality comics designed for children ages four and up.\\"\\"About Toon Books,\\" Toon Books website. Accessed Nov. 23, 2008. Upon Toon's debut, Publishers Weekly characterized the line as having the potential to revitalize the field of comics for kids: \\"Fran√ßoise Mouly is at it again. After transforming American comics with the seminal 1980s comics anthology RAW, Mouly is now out to teach kids to read by using comics.\\"Reid, Calvin. \\"Toon Books: Comics for Kids,\\" Publishers Weekly (Nov. 16, 2007). When it first launched, Toon Books was distributed by Diamond Books, a unit of Diamond Comic Distributors dedicated to getting comics and graphic novels into the book trade. In 2010, Toon Books entered into a distribution partnership with Candlewick Press.Publishers Weekly staff. \\"Candlewick Partners with Toon Books: New imprint launches in October,\\" Publishers Weekly (Sep. 09, 2010). In late summer/early Fall of 2014, Toon Books launched a new line of TOON Graphics, an imprint for readers 8 and up and announced it'll be distributed after Jan. 1, 2015 by Consortium, a unit of Perseus, a move that reflects Toon's true status as a small but expanding independent publisher.

The Watkins 29 design had a minor design change to the transom in 1987 and was renamed the Watkins 30, also known as the W30. Production The design was built by Watkins Yachts in Clearwater, Florida, United States, but it is now out of production. A total of 60 W29s were completed between 1984 and 1988, while 28 W30s were completed between 1987 and 1989. The last W30 completed was moulded in April 1989 as a 1990 model. Design The Watkins 29 and 30 are recreational keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. They have a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a nearly vertical transom on the W29 and a reverse transom on the W30, a skeg- mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. Both models displace and carry of ballast. The design has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The design's hull is molded in a single piece using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving, as well as multidirectional chopped strand fibers (MSCF). The keel is integral to the hull and the ballast is internal to the keel. The deck and the cockpit are moulded in one piece, also using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving with MCSF. Plywood coring is employed for the cabin top, deck, seat and the cockpit sole for stiffness. The hull-to-deck joint is flanged, glued and then screwed into place. There is an aluminum toe rail, stainless steel through-bolted into place, bonding the toe rail, deck and the hull. An anchor well is located at the bow with a hawspipe leading the anchor chain into the \\"V\\" berth locker. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 2GM or 3GM diesel engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . Sleeping accommodation is provided for five people, with an aft cabin and a bow \\"V\\"-berth, both doubles. The main cabin has a quarter berth or optional double pull-out berth. The head is on the port side, aft of the bow \\"V\\"-berth and has pressurized water and a shower. The galley is at the bottom of the companionway stairs to starboard and includes a sink, stove and an icebox. Ventilation is provided by eight opening ports and one deck-mounted hatch. The main cabin has of headroom and is finished with hand-rubbed teak trim, with the bulkheads and cabinetry made from teak veneer on plywood. The main cabin sole is teak and holly veneer over plywood.

The Western Approaches Tactical Unit (WATU) was a unit of the British Royal Navy created in January 1942 to develop and disseminate new tactics to counter German submarine attacks on trans-Atlantic shipping convoys. It was led by Captain Gilbert Roberts and was principally staffed by officers and ratings from the Women's Royal Naval Service (Wrens). Their primary tool for studying U-boat attacks and developing countermeasures was wargames. After the U-boat threat to merchant shipping was defeated, WATU continued to develop anti-submarine tactics for later stages of the war, including Operation Overlord and the Pacific War. WATU trained naval officers in its tactics by hosting week-long training courses in which the students played wargames. WATU formally ceased operations at the end of July 1945. Mission During World War 1, German submarines (U-boats) sank merchant ships in the Atlantic Ocean so as to deny supplies to its enemies in Europe. Britain reacted by organizing the merchant ships into convoys which were escorted by warships armed with depth charges. This strategy proved effective at repelling U-boats. During the inter-war years, Germany secretly developed new submarine tactics to counter the convoy system. The products of this research were the \\"wolfpack\\" tactics, wherein submarines would attack convoys in groups, exploiting the weaknesses of the convoy system, and new advances in submarine technology. The British, by contrast, had neglected to study submarine tactics during the inter-war years. They entered World War 2 assuming that the U-boats would operate much as they had during the previous war, unaware that the Germans would come at them with new tricks. As soon as Britain declared war on Germany (3 Sept 1939), Germany sent its U-boats to attack transatlantic shipping. The U-boats had a devastating effect. In 1938, Britain had received 68 million tons of imports, but in 1941 the U-boats reduced this to 26 million., Why the Allies Won. p. 31 Britain was not a self-sufficient nation, and eventually its reserves of food would run out and it would be forced to capitulate to prevent a famine.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 3: \\"‚ÄòUnless something was done in the Battle of the Atlantic,‚Äô Roberts was told, ‚Äòwe were going to lose [the war], merely because vital food and war supplies would not arrive.‚Äô\\" In March 1941, Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared that Britain was fighting \\"the Battle of the Atlantic\\", and made anti-submarine warfare a top priority. The Royal Navy understood, from intercepted radio transmissions, that the U-boats were operating in coordinated groups, but did not know the specifics of their tactics.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 8: \\"While the British could see from intercepted radio transmissions that U-boats were increasingly working together, providing the German vessels with safety in numbers, the specifics of their highly effective tactics could only be guessed at.\\" On 1 January 1942, Admiral Cecil Usborne assigned Commander Gilbert Roberts to establish a wargaming unit at the Western Approaches Command in Liverpool, to analyze the submarine attacks and develop defensive tactics.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 8: \\"On the first day of 1942, Roberts was told to report to the Admiralty offices with an overnight bag. On arrival he met two of the navy‚Äôs most senior officers, the Second Sea Lord, Sir Charles Little, and Admiral Cecil Usborne, the former director of naval intelligence, now an aide to Winston Churchill. Usborne was responsible for overseeing the development of anti-U-boat weapons.\\" Roberts had played naval wargames during a two-year stint at the Portsmouth Tactical School, using them to develop new strategies and tactics. Additionally, Roberts was a gifted communicator who would be able to train commanders in the tactics he was to develop.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 8: \\"Churchill‚Äôs aide believed that Roberts, who had shown himself to be a talented strategist in Portsmouth and an enthusiastic proponent of games as a way to prepare for war, was the ideal person to evolve anti-U-boat tactics. Moreover, as a gifted communicator he was qualified to train escort commanders in those tactics.\\" Roberts moved to Liverpool to set up his tactical unit on the top floor of the Western Approaches headquarters. Most of the staff at Western Approaches were women from the Women's Royal Naval Service (colloquially referred to as \\"Wrens\\"), and likewise Roberts recruited most of his staff from the Wrens. At total of sixty-six Wrens served at WATU from 1942 to 1945.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, Postscript: \\"By 1945, a total of sixty-six Wrens had completed the course in order to become staff at WATU or its sister units.\\" Roberts and his team reviewed battle reports from convoy escort commanders, recreated the battles in wargames in order to deduce how the U-boats were operating, and then devised tactics by which the escorts could defeat the U-boats. Their first product was a tactic codenamed Raspberry, developed that January (see below). As well as devising tactics, WATU also trained naval officers in their use by having them participate in wargames. The first batch of trainees arrived on 2 February 1942. The training course lasted six days, from Monday to Saturday, and was held every week from February 1942 to the last week of July 1945. Up to fifty officers at once took the course.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 12: \\"Each course, which lasted from Monday to Saturday, and which ran weekly without interruption from the first week of February 1942 to the last week of July 1945, involved up to fifty officers at once.\\" WATU not only trained British officers, but also officers from other countries such as Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Poland, and Free France.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 12, fn 1: \\"Roberts recorded that on Sundays the team would often be called upon to give demonstrations to visiting Americans.\\" In May 1943, Admiral Karl Doenitz ordered the U-boats to withdraw from the Atlantic, allowing merchant convoys to pass unmolested. By 1944, WATU's existence was public knowledge. A journalist visited WATU in January 1944 to observe a wargame and published a short article in The Daily Herald.The Daily Herald. 17 January 1944 An expos√© appeared in Illustrated magazine the following month.26 February 1944 Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 17 WATU continued to develop anti-submarine tactics and train officers until the end of the war. It officially ceased operations at the end of July 1945. It had trained close to 5,000 officers over its lifetime.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, postcript Legacy After WATU was closed, Admiral Horton sent the following signal to its former members: \\"On the closing down of WATU I wish to express my gratitude and high appreciation of the magnificent work of Captain Roberts and his staff, which contributed in no small measure to the final defeat of Germany.\\"Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, Postscript Admiral Noble sent Roberts a letter in which he wrote: \\"...you had a great deal to do in winning the war because if we hadn‚Äôt won the Battle of the Atlantic we should undoubtedly have lost the war!\\"Williams (1979). Captain Gilbert Roberts, p. 179 What makes WATU a noteworthy episode in the history of military wargaming is that it used wargames to investigate real scenarios that were occurring during an ongoing war and develop solutions that were immediately implemented in the field. By contrast, most wargames are played during peacetime to prepare officers for potential wars, and the scenarios they explore are either hypothetical or happened many years ago, and may not be relevant to the next conflict when it comes due to unforeseen factors such as new technology or rules of engagement. Headquarters Western Approaches Command was an operational command of Britain's Royal Navy, tasked with safeguarding British shipping in the Western Approaches (the seas to the west of Ireland and Britain). Initially headquartered in Plymouth, on the southern coast of Britain, it was moved north to Liverpool in February 1941. After France had fallen to the Germans, North Atlantic shipping convoys had been diverted around the north of Ireland to evade the German navy. Relocating Western Approaches Command to Liverpool sped up communications. Its headquarters was Derby House, a building located behind Liverpool's town hall; today the headquarters is a museum. The top floor, comprising eight rooms, was allocated to WATU.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 10: \\"Roberts was to be given the entire top floor of Derby House, [...] comprising eight rooms.\\" Most of the staff at Western Approaches HQ were women from the Women's Royal Naval Service. Colloquially, they were referred to as \\"Wrens\\". When Roberts arrived at Western Approaches in January 1942, its commander-in-chief was Admiral Percy Noble, who was replaced by Admiral Max Horton in November 1942.

Overview of the wargames Gilbert Roberts was first introduced to wargaming during a stint at the Portsmouth Tactical School from 1935 to 1937. Roberts took to wargaming with great enthusiasm, and developed his own rulesets. Roberts' wargames were based on the wargames developed by Fred T. Jane in 1898 (Jane Naval Wargame and Fighting Ships).Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 7: \\"The progenitor of the wargame on which Roberts based his games in Portsmouth was Fred Jane [...] It was a version of the Jane Naval Wargame that Roberts adapted at his posting in Portsmouth\\" Despite the strong effect that U-boats had during World War 1, Roberts' wargames at Portsmouth did not simulate submarine warfare, nor attacks on merchant convoys. In fact, nobody in the Royal Navy studied submarine warfare through wargames until the establishment of WATU in 1942.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 7: \\"Despite the fact that during the First World War the Germans had used submarines to great effect to disrupt the convoys bringing food and supplies to Great Britain, neither U-boats nor convoys featured in the wargames of 1935. [...] ‚ÄòSubmarines were not mentioned,‚Äô Roberts wrote of the games he was tasked with designing. ‚ÄòNor were convoys and attacks on them. Nobody connected Hitler‚Äôs rise ‚Ä¶ to the possibility of another Battle of the Atlantic. Nor did I, to be absolutely fair.‚Äô\\" At WATU, the wargames were conducted in the largest room of the top floor of Western Approaches HQ. The floor was covered with brown linoleum and in the center was a painted grid. This grid was the game board. The gridlines were spaced ten inches apart, representing one nautical mile. Around the grid were vertical screens of canvas that had peepholes cut into them. The players who controlled the escort ships had to stand behind the screens and could only view the game board through the peepholes. The players who controlled the U-boats did not stand behind the screens and had an unrestricted view of the game board. The ships and surfaced U-boats were represented on the game board by tiny wooden models.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 11: \\"The floor in the centre of the room was covered in brown linoleum, painted with white gridlines and punctuated with tiny wooden models [...] each white line was spaced ten inches apart, representing one nautical mile, while the counters represented ships and surfaced German U-boats.\\"\\" The U-boats' movement lines were drawn in green chalk, a color which contrasted poorly with the brown tint of the floor; and when viewed from an angle, these lines were practically invisible, so the players behind the screens couldn't make them out. The escort ships' movement lines were drawn with white chalk, which could be clearly perceived by the players behind the screens.Illustrated magazine (26 Feb 1944): \\"Then he [Roberts] bends down and makes a series of small green chalk marks on the lino to indicate submerged U-boats on the flank of a distant convoy.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 11: \\"The movements of the U-boats were drawn in green chalk on the floor, a colour chosen as it was impossible to make out against the floor‚Äôs tint when viewed from an angle. This ensured the U-boat positions were undetectable to the players peering through the canvas screens. The escort ships‚Äô movements would then be added to the floor in white chalk, which was, in contrast to the green markings, legible to those peeking from the canvas holes.\\" The players were given two minutes per turn to make decisions and give orders.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 11: \\"Players were given two minutes in which to submit their orders for the next ‚Äòturn‚Äô, to replicate the urgency of a real battlefield.\\" The players issued their orders for their imaginary ships on pieces of paper that they passed to the Wrens‚Äîthis prevented their opponents on the other side of the room from overhearing. The Wrens would then get down on the floor and compute the outcomes of the players' orders. Roberts provided the Wrens with the performance characteristics of all ships concerned: the range of the U-boat's torpedoes (5,400 yardsWilliams (1979). Captain Gilbert Roberts, p. 94), the speed of the ships, their turn speed, the precise capabilities of the escorts' sonar (then known as ASDIC), how engine noise might distort listening attempts, visibility at night, etc. The Wrens would plot the trajectories of the ships on the game board with chalk. Tactics developed =Notes on WW2 submarine warfare= Submarines of this era were powered by diesel engines and batteries. They could only use their diesel engines when surfaced, as these needed to breathe air to work. When submerged, the submarine used lead-acid batteries. The batteries were less powerful than the engine, so the submarine was reduced to about half-speed: e.g. a Type VIIC U-boat could travel at 17.7 knots (~32.8 km/h) on the surface but only 7.6 knots (~14 km/h) underwater. The batteries could be exhausted after an hour or so of maximum speed underwater. Lower speeds gave greater endurance, but would eventually run out of charge. At that point, the U-boat would be forced to surface for air and recharge the batteries with the diesel engine. The British were the first to equip their warships with sonar to hunt enemy submarines. They called this technology \\"ASDIC\\"; the term \\"sonar\\" was later coined by the Americans. This technology sent loud pings into the water and located a submerged submarine by the echoes. The U-boats could hear these pings, of course, so they would know they were being hunted. In practice, ASDIC had an average detection range of 1,300 yards (~1,200 meters).Akermann (2002). Encyclopedia of British Submarines 1901-1955, p. 47 ASDIC could be ineffective if there was too much ambient noise in the water. The maximum speed at which a ship could travel while using its ASDIC was about 15 knots (~28 km/h), beyond which the noise of its own propeller and engine would drown out the echoes.Brown (2000). Nelson to Vanguard Both the U-boats and the warships also had hydrophones with which they could passively listen for sound in the water. U-boats usually attacked at night. The cover of darkness allowed them to travel at surface depth with less risk of being spotted by look-outs. Escort ships were equipped with star shells, which when fired in the air would release a burning flare held aloft by a small parachute. This would illuminate the surface of the water, making it easy to spot a surfaced U-boat. Warships used depth charges to sink submarines. These are bombs that are dropped into the water around the U-boat. The hydraulic shockwave produced by the explosion would seriously damage if not sink any submarine within 10 meters. =Raspberry= 600px During World War 1, the U-boats typically attacked convoys from outside the formation, striking ships at the perimeter. But reports from convoys in 1942 showed that U-boats were sinking ships at the center of the formation. Roberts surmised that the U-boats were somehow sneaking into the formation undetected before firing their torpedoes.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 11: \\"If the U-boats were firing from outside the perimeter of the convoy, how had Annavore, which was in the centre of the convoy, been sunk? Might it be possible, he wondered, that the U-boat had attacked the ship from inside the columns of the convoy?\\" Roberts and his team tested various ways by which a U-boat might sneak into a convoy, sink a ship, and escape undetected. Only one tactic worked on the game board: The U-boat snuck into the convoy from astern on the surface so that it could use its diesel engine to outpace the speed of the convoy. Since these attacks happened at night, the U-boat was not easily spotted by look-outs, and once inside the convoy it was indistinguishable from the other ships on radar. The U-boat would then sink a merchant ship with a torpedo at close range, then submerge and turn around to make its escape from astern.Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 11: \\"Between them, Roberts and the two Wrens began to plot different scenarios that might have enabled the U-boat to sneak into the convoy without being detected. Only one checked out: the U-boat had entered the columns of the convoy from behind. And it must have done so on the surface, where it was able to travel at a faster speed than the ships. By approaching from astern, where the lookouts rarely checked, the U-boat would be able to slip inside the convoy undetected, fire at close range, then submerge in order to get away.\\" Roberts and his team then developed a counter-tactic to defeat this (see diagram). When a merchant ship in the convoy was torpedoed (1), the escort ships to the rear and flanks were to fall back and form a tight line behind the convoy (2). The line of escort ships was to then trawl for the U-boat using sonar, and drop depth charges when the U-boat was found (3). The escorts in front of the convoy were to stay ahead and move in a zig-zag patten in case the U-boat tried to escape from the front at full speed. At the suggestion of Jean Laidlaw (one of the Wrens), this tactic was codenamed Raspberry, as in \\"blowing a raspberry at Hitler\\".Williams (1979). Captain Gilbert Roberts, pp. 94-96 Raspberry was in part disseminated by having naval officers come and participate in the wargames at WATU where they could experiment with Raspberry themselves. Raspberry was also published in the Western Approaches Convoy Instructions, a manual for escort ship captains. Soon enough, reports of successful U-boat sinkings, made possible by Raspberry, came in. =Pineapple= 600px Pineapple was meant to be used when a possible U-boat was detected somewhere far ahead of the convoy‚Äîperhaps by reconnaissance planes, radio direction finders, or intelligence reports‚Äîbut which hadn't yet been sighted by the escorts' look- outs. Ever since Raspberry was deployed, Roberts had been concerned that eventually the German navy would figure out how Raspberry was sinking their U-boats and alter their tactics. Perhaps a U-boat ahead of the convoy might observe Raspberry in action and report what it had seen to German naval command‚Äîthis scenario was the impetus for developing Pineapple. The basic outline of this tactic was proposed by a visiting officer from the Canadian Navy. The diagram he drew for Roberts somewhat resembled a pineapple, so that's what Roberts called it.Williams (1979). Captain Gilbert Roberts, pp. 108-109: \\"Still using the escort commanders as his forward eyes, a suggestion came to him from a Commander Prentice, a retired R.N. Officer now with the Canadian Navy. The picture Prentice drew looked somewhat like a pineapple lying on its side and this eventually was what the tactic was called.\\" The basic idea of this tactic was to trick the U-boat (if it was there) into an encirclement where it could be sunk, or at least scare it off. Either was better than letting it lurk near the convoy where it might observe Raspberry in action or launch an attack of its own. When a possible U-boat was detected ahead of the convoy (1), the escort ships at the front and the flanks of the convoy were to advance at full speed for 15 minutes, firing star shells along the way to light up the surface of the water. This would prompt the U-boat to submerge if it wasn't already (2). While the escort ships moved at full speed, their sonar was useless because of the noise, so the U-boat was safe from detection at this point. The U-boat might now choose to slip away and attack another night, or it might press on towards the convoy, resurfacing after the escort ships passed by. After completing their 15-minute sortie, the escort ships were to turn around and slowly return to their normal positions around the convoy, all the while scanning the water with sonar. If the U-boat was still around, it would be detected in this sweep and attacked (3).Williams (1979). Captain Gilbert Roberts, pp. 108-110 =Beta Search= Beta Search was a tactic to be employed when an escort's lookout had sighted a U-boat. When a U-boat was spotted, the escort ship that spotted it was to move in its direction without firing flares, using sonar, or dropping depth charges. The U-boat's captain would reflexively order his ship to submerge. The escort ship was then to pass over it, making the U-boat crew believe they had escaped detection. The wargames predicted that the U-boat would then make a slow turn and assume a vector parallel to the convoy. At this point, the escort ships were to rush to the U-boat's predicted position. The rumble of the convoy's propellers would mask their approach. Once over the U-boat's predicted position, the escort ships were to release their depth charges. Beta Search was jointly developed by Roberts and Laidlaw. It was so named because U-boat transmissions always began with a \\"B-bar\\" in Morse code (dash-dot-dot-dot-dash).Parkin (2019). A Game of Birds and Wolves, chpt. 13: \\"During the next few days Roberts and Laidlaw began to develop a replacement tactic [...] which they dubbed ‚ÄòBeta Search‚Äô, named after the fact that U-boat transmissions always began with the Morse B (Beta), or B-bar\\" Admiral Horton personally tested Beta Search in a wargame at WATU. He played the role of the U-boat, while Janet Okell played the role of the escorts. Five times in a row, Okell sank Horton's U-boat. =Step-Aside= 300px Step-Aside was a tactic by which an escort ship could defend itself from a U-boat armed with acoustic torpedoes, specifically the T5 Zaunk√∂nig torpedo, which the German navy began using in August 1943. This torpedo used built-in hydrophones to guide itself to its target by sound. In late 1943, Roberts received reports that the U-boats were regularly targeting the escort ships themselves. Stripped of their escorts, the merchant ships became easy prey. There was a common pattern in these reports: The escort ship would sight a U-boat and head straight for it, but then the escort ship would somehow get hit in the stern. This was a puzzling pattern. In those days it was very difficult for a submarine to torpedo a ship that was heading straight for it. From that angle, the ship had a narrow profile and with a slight turn it could easily dodge a conventional torpedo. U-boats preferred to attack ships from the side at an angle on the bow of 45 to 90 degrees. Furthermore, a conventional torpedo should have hit the escort ship in the bow because it was headed straight at the U-boat. A mine was suggested to be the mystery weapon but that was unlikely given how often this pattern repeated. Roberts surmised that the Germans were using a new type of torpedo that could guide itself to its target by following the sound of the target's propeller (the noisiest part of the ship). Such a weapon had long been dreamed of by submariners and Roberts deduced that the Germans had just invented the first practical one. Roberts surmised that the Germans' acoustic torpedo could only track targets that were in a 60 degree cone ahead of it (he was correct), so the escort ship must first place itself outside this cone when it goes after the U-boat. When the escort ship sights a U-boat, it was to turn towards the U-boat and fire a star shell to let the U-boat know that it had been spotted, which would prompt the U-boat to submerge and fire its acoustic torpedo.Williams (1979). Captain Gilbert Roberts, p. 129: \\"It was obvious that the U-boat did not fire its acoustic torpedo until it was sure the escort was attacking. [..] As soon as it was certain it had been spotted, probably by Radar, or star shell, or even by a sudden increase in hydrophone noise, that would be the moment to dive and the T.5 torpedo would then be fired.\\" The escort ship was to then turn 150 degrees away from the convoy and sail for one mile at a speed of 15 knots (1). The escort ship was to then turn onto the bearing on which it initially spotted the U-boat, which would put it on a course roughly parallel to the torpedo (2). After another mile, it was to turn towards the U-boat's last known location, locate it with sonar, and drop depth charges (3).Williams (1979). Captain Gilbert Roberts, p. 133 As soon as it was completed, Step-Aside was communicated by radio to escort commanders at sea on 23 September 1943.Williams (1979) writes that the captain of HMS Orchis received Step-Aside over radio just after his convoy had been attacked by U-boats, during which HMS Itchen was sunk. Itchen was lost in the early morning of 23 September 1943. We can reasonably infer that Step- Aside was received that same day. Thanks in part to Step-Aside, the Germans' acoustic torpedo never achieved its full destructive potential. The Allies also used decoy sound generators such as \\"Foxer\\" and CAT (Canadian Anti- Acoustic Torpedo) to counter the acoustic torpedo.Doherty (2015).

While V14 would be the primary Metrobus Route on the line that operate throughout most of the day, route V15 would only operate during the weekday peak-hours only. =1993 Changes= On December 11, 1993, both the V14 and V15 were extended north from Addison Road station, to operate to Deanwood station in order to replace the R12 former routing between Deanwood and Addison Road stations, via Central Avenue, Hill Road, Seat Pleasant Drive, Addison Road, and Minnesota Avenue NE. Main differences were that the V14 would operate straight on Hill Road between the intersections of Seat Pleasant Drive and Central Avenue while the V15 would divert from the intersection of Hill Road onto the intersection of Hastings Drive, then make turn onto the intersection of Pepper Mill Drive, before returning back onto Central Avenue. The routing between Addison Road and Penn Marr Shopping Center mostly remained the same other than for a small segment in the Pepper Mill Village neighborhood that was altered. As a result of these changes, the line was renamed from the District Heights Line to the District Heights‚ÄìSeat Pleasant Line. =2015 Proposed Changes= In 2015, WMATA proposed to eliminate route V15 and the segment along Pepper Mill Drive and Hastings Drive. Route V14 would add weekend service and run its full route on Sundays instead of terminating at Addison Road station. =2016 Changes= On March 27, 2016, route V15 was discontinued and replaced by the V14 which added weekend service. Route V14 also would operate the full route on Sundays between Deanwood station and Penn Mar Shopping Center instead of Addison Road station.

History  = Imperial Japan = In 1879, the Japanese Empire abolished the Ryukyu Domain, exiling its monarch to Tokyo. Okinawa Prefecture was established out of the newly acquired territory. The Amami Islands were already a part of Japan due to the Satsuma Invasion of Ryukyu, and were made a part of Kagoshima Prefecture unlike the other parts of the Ryukyu Islands. At the beginning of the 20th century, the government of the Japanese Empire started to implement assimilation policies towards the Ryukyuan people. An example of such policies would be the dialect cards (ÊñπË®ÄÊú≠, h≈çgen fuda), which were given to students who spoke any of the Ryukyuan languages at school. Punishments for having the card were sometimes corporal. In addition to linguistic suppression, Ryukyuan culture was also forbidden, with Japanese culture being promoted. = Modern Japan = While active suppression of the Ryukyuan people has stopped, the Government of Japan still refuses to recognize the Ryukyuans as an indigenous people, labeling them as Japanese ethnics instead. The government also classifies the Ryukyuan languages as Japanese dialects, despite the lack of mutual intelligibility.

Details of the incident weren't disclosed until January 8, 2019, when Yamaguchi personally did on social media, also accusing how her personal information was leaked to the men through other members of NGT48, and denouncing the group's management for inaction in the issue. She was then allegedly pressured into apologizing in public, sparking outrage in Japan and abroad, with many celebrities including fellow NGT48 members accusing the group's management of victim blaming. The NGT48 management assigned a female manager for the group, saying a woman would be better able to understand members' situations, and tasked a third-party committee to examine the incident, including the possible extent of other group members' involvement. The ensuing press conference led to a public clash when Yamaguchi rebutted management's claims in real time on Twitter, and led to local companies choosing not to renew yearly sponsorships. The decision by the agency to pardon those members who had been intimate with fans ultimately pushed Yamaguchi to withdraw from the group. Afterward, the management initiated a civil lawsuit against her alleged assailants, which ended in an out-of-court settlement. Incident On January 8, 2019, Maho Yamaguchi, who was the co- captain of one of NGT48's sub-groups, alleged in her Showroom live stream and Twitter that on December 8, 2018, two men assaulted her as she was entering her apartment. She alleged that they grabbed her face and attempted to pin her on the ground, and were stopped by another resident. The men, both 25-year old university students, were arrested by the police, and released from custody 20 days later without prosecution. They denied Yamaguchi's description of events, claiming that they \\"just wanted to talk\\". A third male accomplice was later identified by management. Early reports on the incident mentioned the building was used by the NGT48 management as a surrogate for a dormitory for members who do not live in Niigata Prefecture and that the building was furnished with an automatic lock at the entrance. Yamaguchi had brought the incident to the attention of the management of NGT48, but after a month of silence, she decided to bring the issue to the public. After her live stream was cut abruptly, Yamaguchi posted several since-deleted tweets detailing her account and claiming that others NGT48 members were responsible for leaking her personal information to her assailants, including her own address and what time she would be returning home. During the group's third anniversary theater show on January 10, Yamaguchi publicly apologized for \\"causing trouble\\" by speaking out. A petition on Change.org calling for the resignation of NGT48 director Etsuro Imamura gained over 53,000 signatures before closing on January 13. On January 14, AKS issued an apology and later confirmed that a member had shared information after being accosted by the men, but they also stated that \\"nothing illegal\\" had happened. On the same day, Imamura was transferred to AKS' Tokyo headquarters and was replaced by Maiko Hayakawa; AKS explained they chose Hayakawa because as a woman she would understand the members better. Alarms and counseling services were provided to NGT48 members. Investigation On January 31, NGT48 management announced the formation of an independent third-party committee (consisting of a lawyers from Iwasaki Law, Akasaka Mori no Ki Law, and Shinwa Law) to investigate the causes of the incident and whether other NGT48 members had been involved. On March 21, 2019, their report was released on NGT48's website, which concluded that, while up to 12 members were alleged to have fraternized with fans, NGT48 members were not implicated as no criminal conspiracy was found. The incident was caused by the \\"excessive behavior from some fans\\", and aggravated by the poor civil infrastructure of Niigata which made group members relatively easy to locate. The report also commented on the closeness between fans and group members. It noted that group members had been accosted by an accomplice of the two main assailants, and revealed details about the activities of many other members; that members had met individually with that man before; and that the assailants had been renting apartments in three other building complexes across Niigata in order to meet with other members who lived in those buildings. The report also contained quotes from an audio recording from the day of the incident; when Yamaguchi and an AKS staff member questioned the suspect, one assailant said they knew of the address of Yamaguchi's apartment from other group members. On March 22, 2019, board members and managers from AKS, the talent agency that managed NGT48, held a press conference outlining the report's conclusions. Yamaguchi criticized the outcome live on Twitter, and categorically denied the claims made by Matsumura, AKS's board member. To his initial decision to give a pardon to all members who had had personal associations with fans, Yamaguchi said that he had told her the investigation was to identify the members fraternizing with fans and that those members would be fired, and said Matsumura had downplayed those interactions by saying it was \\"greetings\\", when in reality included intimate affairs with the assailants. Yamaguchi claimed that Matsumura had pressured her to apologize in January 2019 and she had eventually done so to ensure that the other members would not have to apologize in her stead. After the NGT48's management dissolved the team structure, at the end of Team G's final theater show on April 21, 2019, Yamaguchi, Rena Hasegawa, and Riko Sugahara announced their withdrawal from NGT48. There, Yamaguchi spoke of how the AKS president accused her of being an \\"assailant against the company\\", and, referencing the management's decision, she stated that she could no longer stay \\"in a group where you will receive a pardon for anything\\". AKS did not comment on her claim but maintained that the decision to leave was her own. Rino Sashihara attempted to discuss Yamaguchi's situation with AKS founder Yasushi Akimoto, but she claimed that he is no longer part of the administration and is only involved as the creative producer. A farewell theater show was held on May 18: initially announced to feature solely Yamaguchi, Sugahara, and Hasegawa, seven other members made a voluntary guest appearance as a gesture of solidarity, with producer Akimoto also writing a song for the occasion. Lawsuit On April 30, 2019, AKS filed a lawsuit against Yamaguchi's assailants asking for 30 million yen, claiming the assault had disrupted NGT48 events and caused 100 million yen in economic damages in addition to damaging the trust between members and agency; it also included a transcript of a recorded conversation between Yamaguchi, staff members, and the two men, in which they alleged that they were associating with 8 members in NGT48. At a press scrum on July 10, AKS' attorney Kazuhiro Endo claimed the point of the lawsuit was not money, but to uncover truth and use the results to prevent a reoccurrence. Oral proceedings began on July 10, 2019, and on September 20 the two men denied having committed physical aggression, while alleging Yamaguchi willingly disclosed her personal information and address to the first defendant at a handshake event in 2017, so he could send gifts discreetly to her home. On October 28 the Niigata District Court held a hearing where the AKS attorney said that the defendants submitted evidence of their connection to Yamaguchi while denying that other NGT48 members were involved in their confrontation. On October 30, 2019, Sports Nippon published photos they said depicted Yamaguchi and one of the assailants communicating their apartment numbers to each other with hand signals at a group's photo-op event. On Twitter, Yamaguchi rejected the news as \\"slander\\" and said the photos were the evidences presented in court days before and then leaked to the media; she said these were simply poses requested by fans, a common occurrence at such events. She also mentioned there were unreleased voice recordings containing current NGT48 members admitting to having private relationships with a group of people which included the assailants. AKS denied that their side was responsible for leaking the material to the press, as did the defendants. In order to verify the claims made by the defendants at the trial, in the months of November 2019 and January 2020 AKS sent requests to the police to obtain the statement reports, cellphone inspection data, and other investigation papers related to the assailants. Likewise, requests were also sent to the prosecutor to obtain the incident's non-prosecution records, to which Yamaguchi also attached her consent. All requests were however rejected. After the courthouse proposed an out-of-court settlement to the plaintiff and the defendants on March 3, 2020, the trial eventually ended in a settlement on April 9, 2020, without reaching a verdict from the judge and falling short of its stated goal. The two men agreed to pay in compensation within five years, and were banned from future events related to the AKB48 Groups, though AKS had said in January 2019 that they were already banned from attending NGT48's concerts and events. Endo claimed that the NGT48 members were not guilty of being accomplices to the suspects and their reactions towards Yamaguchi had been a result of miscommunication. Reactions =Public response= Yamaguchi's initial public apology sparked criticism over victim blaming and the management's negligence from domestic and international communities, including other 48 Group members such as Rino Sashihara, Akari Suda, and Yuki Kashiwagi and celebrities. Several companies withdrew sponsorships afterwards. During a press conference on March 29, 2019, the city of Niigata announced that they were cutting ties with NGT48 effective April, including ending their radio show, \\"Port de NGT.\\" After Yamaguchi announced she was leaving the group, more sponsors began to pull out from NGT48, including the fashion brand Heather. =NGT48's response= On February 3, 2019, Team G members Rena Hasegawa, Riko Sugahara, and Fuka Murakumo removed \\"NGT48\\" from their social media profiles in solidarity with Yamaguchi. On March 7, 2019, AKS announced Etsuro Imamura's dismissal from the management and Takahiro Hosoi's resignation as AKB48 theater manager for inappropriate behavior in midst of the committee's examination, after in a tweet former AKB48 manager Tomonobu Togasaki showed themselves enjoying a drink at a bar, while posting \\"Everyone, don't be fooled by these worthless reports\\". On April 11, 2019, after apologizing to the Niigata government for mishandling Yamaguchi's assault allegations, the official NGT48 website announced that the management was dissolving the team structure and reintroducing the current members as a unified \\"first generation\\" after their final performances on April 21.

It is listed as a heritage site of national significance. History The first Catholic church in the region of Lavaux was established by Marius of Avenches around 590 and was dedicated to Symphorian of Autun, as was the church of Avenches. Later, the church gave its name to the village which was previously called Gl√©rolles ( in Latin). Between the 12th century and the 1536 conquest by the canton of Bern, the village and the church belonged to the Bishops of Lausanne whose last titular, Sebastian of Montfalcon, is shown kneeling in front of the Virgin Mary on the main stained glass of the church. After 1536 and the introduction of the Reformation, the church was used by the Protestants. At this time, Saint- Saphorin was the seat of a parish that included the villages of Rivaz, Chexbres and Puidoux until 1734 when Chexbres and Puidoux formed an independent parish. In 2000, the older parish was re-united under its former name, Saint-Saphorin. The church of Saint-Symphorien was listed among the Cultural Property of National Significance (Class A), as were the remains of the Gallo-Roman villa located on the site until a tidal wave caused Mount Tauredunum to collapse in 563.
