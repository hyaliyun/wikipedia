It is notable in that it was the first number in Porter's first fully integrated-book musical Fifty Million Frenchmen (1929). In the original production, the song was performed by Genevieve Tobin and William Gaxton, performing the roles of Looloo Carroll and Peter Forbes, respectively. The song has been revived and rerecorded many times since, notably by Howard McGillin and Susan Powell in 1991. There are two verses and two rounds of the chorus. The song has been described as \\"a tender prequel\\" to \\"Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love,\\" Porter's first popular song. The song has been recorded by artists including Mario Lanza, Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Doris Day, Sonny Rollins, Susannah McCorkle, Bryan Ferry, Sin√©ad O'Connor on Red Hot + Blue (1990). Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song, recorded this song on both her Cole Porter Songbook albums and on her Pablo classic, Ella √† Nice. Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1955 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56) issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009. Bette Midler's version of the song plays over the final credits of the 1991 film Scenes from a Mall, which starred her and Woody Allen. According to the liner notes for It's De Lovely ‚Äî The Authentic Cole Porter Collection, the line \\"the voodoo that you do so well\\" is quoted in the 1993 Salt-N-Pepa song \\"Shoop\\".\\"We don't even need the additional evidence of rock and country artists doing albums of standards that include Porter songs, or the recent rap hit \\"Shoop\\" which quotes the phrase \\"the voodoo that you do so well\\" from Porter's 1929 'You Do Something To Me.'\\" The \\"voodoo\\" line is also quoted by Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) in the 1974 film Blazing Saddles as he exhorts his gang to attack a frontier town.

It is a recent development, with no skyscrapers, and the area also contains jungles atop rocky cliffs and hills. High waves permit surfing at Recreio Beach and the white sand beach is used by beach volleyball players. It is about 35 km from the Rio de Janeiro city centre, and most of the people living there are middle-class and high middle-class families, who moved in trying to escape the growing violence of both the North and South Zones. Apocryphally, the neighborhood received the name Recreio dos Bandeirantes, or \\"Bandeirantes' Leisure\\" because the company that mapped and hired a real estate agent to sell lots there had that name. Another version says that many of the newcomers were from S√£o Paulo, the city from which the Bandeiras departed in colonial times, and therefore Paulistas are associated with them. Still another version states that Recreio was the first (or last) resting place with fresh water for Bandeirantes traveling between Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. Recreio dos Bandeirantes Development in the area began in 1959, and only more recently, have well-to-do residents discovered and made Recreio their home. It does not have the hustle and bustle of bohemic Lapa, Copacabana, Leblon, and Ipanema, but there has been an increase in the number of restaurants, pizzerias, bars, private schools and colleges.

It is the second largest town in the province, with a population of 60,368 as of 2016. The town is located near the Guadalfeo River and from Granada. The council of Motril includes the city of Motril and the neighbourhoods of El Varadero, Carchuna, Calahonda, Puntal√≥n, Playa Granada, Las Ventillas, La Perla, La Garnatilla and La Chucha. The town is the capital of the region of the Coast of Granada. King Baudouin of Belgium died in Motril of heart failure during a visit to his summer residence, \\"Villa Astrida\\" in 1993.  History  Although its origin still remains unclear, it was a Phoenician enclave. It already existed in Roman times. Sugar cane harvest When the Christians conquered Motril, there were 2,000 inhabitants whose main activities were agriculture, fishing and the production of silk and sugar. The city centre size was around . Outside the city there are two suburbs: Al-Majon suburb and al-Couruch suburb and a neighborhood called Jandara. There was a Moorish uprising in 1569 that finished in 1570 with the Christians' victory.This made a recession of sugar production but this finished 5 years later with the repopulation of old Christians..reference to By the end of 1600s, Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cabeza church was built. Sugar cane was the most important crop, which was later processed in the sugar refineries. The most important of these was \\"La Casa de la Palma\\". Now it's the place where the \\"Museo Preindustrial de la Ca√±a de Az√∫car\\" or Sugar Cane Museum is found. In 1657, Philip IV granted Motril the title of city, separating its jurisdiction from Granada. At the beginning of the next century, Philip V distinguished Motril as \\"Muy Noble y Leal\\" , which is now found on Motril's shield. After the War of Independence, in which Motril was occupied by French troops, the city started a new expansion of sugarcane and the sugar industry. In the 19th century Motril participated in a singular event, it was proclaimed Independent Canton from July 22 to 25 of 1873. In a few years, due to the increase in the number of sugar refineries, it went to the first position in the Granada industrial ranking. It opened to the public on most traditional ride in the city, \\"Las Explanadas\\", in the mid-19th century. In 2011, the PP with Carlos Rojas got the mayoral service for a third time, with absolute majority. In 2012 he left his charge of mayor to be a spokesman of the \\"Partido Popular Andaluz\\", leaving the mayoral service to Luisa Garcia Chamorro.  Monuments  = Sugar Cane Refineries = Motril is synonymous with sugar and sugar cane. The process from sugar cane transformation into various types of sugar, even liquors like the cherished rum of Motril, has always been the basis of the local economy. Sugar refineries were for many years the \\"future\\" of the city. Now they are one of Motril's legacies. Sugar cane refineries in Motril are * Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar. * Nuestra Se√±ora de la Almudena. * Azucarera de San Luis. * Nuestra se√±ora de Lourdes. * Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cabeza (Alcoholera). * Nuestra Se√±ora de las Angustias (Fabriquilla). * Azucarera de San Fernando (s√≥lo queda la chimenea). * Ingenio de San Jos√©, El Varadero (s√≥lo queda una nave). = Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cabeza (Alcoholera) = This refinery is located next to the public swimming pool and the Parque de las Am√©ricas. It was founded by the Larios family in 1885, a family which founded a company based on the production of sugar and alcohol. At present, the company makes gin. = History = In the past, many people lived thanks to the work of the refineries due to the sugar cane. Due to the low salaries, later, the workers burned the refinery. The sugar refinery will not be destroyed, as the Town Hall wanted, because it has been declared of historic heritage by the Andalusian Government. Also the chimney, store, distillery and the terrain are protected.  Nuestra Se√±ora de las Angustias (La Fabriquilla)  Leaving Motril, towards Puntal√≥n and La Garnatilla we find the sugar refinery of Nuestra Se√±ora de las Angustias, dated 1868 and from which are restored some premises now intended for municipal usage, highlighting the magnificent \\"Nave de los Arcos\\". Juan Ram√≥n La Chica owned two refineries called \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de las Angustias\\", but one of them was in Granada and the other one in Motril. He gained full ownership over this last one in 1874. He also owned another sugar cane refinery called \\"Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen\\" in Pinos Puente (Granada). = Religious Buildings = * Iglesia Mayor de la Encarnaci√≥n. * Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cabeza (conocido como \\"El Cerro de la Virgen\\") * Iglesia de la Divina Pastora (Capuchinos). * Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Victoria. * Ermita de la Virgen del Carmen. * Iglesia del Convento de las Nazarenas. * Ermita de Nuestra Se√±ora de las Angustias. * Ermita de San Antonio de Padua. * Ermita de San Nicol√°s. * Ermita del Se√±or de Junes. * Capilla del Santo Rosario  Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cabeza  This church is one of the most important and emblematic monuments in Motril. It is on a hill called Virgin's Hill. The church was built on the ruins of a nazari (Nasrid) fortress in the 17th century by the architect Isidro de la Chica. The building was damaged during the Civil War in the 20th century and it was restored by the sculptor Manuel Gonzales, a sculptor from Motril, in the 1960s. Inside the church is the patron saint of Motril, the Virgen de la Cabeza. Nowadays, the church is next to the Parque de los Pueblos de Am√©rica and the first fountain built in Motril where there is a big Spanish flag.  Population  Motril has 61,171 inhabitants spread out over 110 km2 . There has been an increase of the population. Emigration was the first cause. Until 1610 there were 4,300 inhabitants. In 2012 there were 61,171 inhabitants. The population kept growing the last centuries. Economy = Agriculture = Situated in the south coast of Andalusia, Motril has main crops like avocado, custard apple, guava, mango and banana; as well as greenhouse cultivation and sugarcane (but 2006 was the last year in which sugarcane was cultivated). In the ancient countryside of Motril was very important the sugarcane to the production of sugar, for that Motril have several sugar refineries such as: * \\"Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar\\" * \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Almudena\\" * \\"Azucarera de San Luis\\" * \\"Nuestra se√±ora de Lourdes\\" * \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Cabeza\\" * \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de las Angustias\\" * \\"Azucarera de San Fernando\\" * \\"Ingenio de San Jos√©, El Varadero\\" These refineries are now abandoned. The potato was also very important. Motril and the villages of its the municipality: Carchuna, Calahonda, Castel de Ferro ... live of the crops in greenhouse. On one hand we have crops in greenhouse, the more importants are the tomatoes and the cucumbers. And on the other hand in a more reduced proportion crops outside such as custard apple, beans and peas. = Industry = Its geographical position makes it a commercial and industrial centre. The most important industry in Motril is the paper mill that gives 400 jobs and produces around 250 tons of paper per year. \\"The Port of Motril\\" is a commercial and fishing port. Fishing is the second most important industry in Motril after the paper industry. There is a museum in Motril, \\"The Sugarcane Museum\\" because, some years ago, there was a sugarcane refinery, where they extracted the sugar to sell it.  Climate  The climate in Motril is determined by two important geographic factors: * The Sierra de L√∫jar blocks cold winds from the north (Granada and Sierra Nevada). * The Mediterranean Sea, to the south, functions as a thermal regulator. The combination of both factors allows the presence of a subtropical microclimate. The annual average temperature is between 17 and 18 degrees Celsius. Summers are warm, between 25 and 30 degrees and winters are mild, with temperatures usually over 12 and 13 degrees. * Africa helps to cushion the hard effects of Atlantic and Mediterranean climate, providing warm breezes from the south. Culture Motril's theater, named Teatro Calder√≥n de la Barca, organises many shows such as plays, exhibitions,concerts and monologues; and there is a local orchestra, the \\"Joven Orquesta Ciudad de Motril\\". In Motril, there is a strong music development. Young people study several instruments at the professional conservatory and there is a local music school too. You can also find many small music bands created by Motrilians. Flamenco is also performed here in dance academies and exhibitions along the whole year, specially in the Cruces. Flamenco is the most characteristic dance style but other style are also practised, like ballet. Youth Area proposes many activities organised by local associations to contribute to the city's leisure like video games tournaments, crafts workshops and once a year, an event called Encuentro Joven where young people and children meet and these association prepares games to pass a journey all together and meet new people. This area has a centre called the Centro Joven where expositions of young local artists draws are passed so it helps to get to know their work. =Holy Week= The Holy week in Motril has been declared National Tourist Interest, It consist of 12 brotherhood, 23 pasos and more than 6000 followers. There are processions every day. The Holy week in Motril started in 1600 with the eldest brotherhood, called Vera Cruz. After the civil war every brotherhood had to restore its patrimony.Turismo Granada Almost all the statues in Motril are made by some artists from the province of Granada. The most interesting processions are: -The starting procession is on Palm Sunday. In this procession we can see two different pasos, it is so interesting because there is a lot of people that accompany it with palm. -On Easter Sunday there is a procession called Dulce Nombre de Jesus, it is really special. It consists on a group of children carrying the statue. It is accompanied by a lot of little children carrying bells. Nowadays, the members of the brotherhood accompany the image with special clothes that cover their face. In Spain there is a tradition of not to eat meat on Holy Thursday and on Good Friday. Each city has their own stew. The typical menu in Motril is the stew made with chickpeas and cod, the cod with tomato, and some cod omelette. Also, there are different desserts like rice pudding, torrija ... In these days it's common meeting the family. = Cuisine = The most popular dish from Motril is migas (crumbs), made of bread. Fish is also very popular in Motril, due to the town's important fisheries. The most popular fish are anchovy (locally named boquer√≥n), sardines and shrimp. The most famous drink, exclusive to the area, is ron p√°lido which is a locally produced rum. Leisure Motril is a growing dynamic city, a place of service where visitors feel at home, thanks to the great hospitality of its people. You can visit many places to have fun and meet new people, for example: -Paseo de las explanadas: pubs normally open from 4 pm until 4 am. -Parque de los Pueblos de Am√©rica: The main feature of this park is great variety of tropical flora to be found in it. = Beaches = Motril is within the Costa Tropical, a large tourist region on the coast. Motril has small beaches (bays) and large beaches (like Playa Granada). They are popular during the summer with people from the surrounding as well as the interior regions. The main problems are the wind and the jellyfish. Beaches in the area include Playa de Poniente (a large gravel/shingle beach), Playa Granada (shingles), Playa Carchuna (gravel and pebbles), and Playa Calahonda (gravel). Many of the area's beaches include car parking facilities, first aid stands, showers, beach cleaning, bars and restaurants, typical beach facilities (such as beach umbrellas and hammocks) and S.O.S. telephones. Transport Motril is served by autov√≠as A-7 to M√°laga and Almer√≠a, and A-44 to Granada. The Port of Motril offers ferries to Melilla, Nador, Tanger-Med, and Al-Hoceima and shipped 2.8 million tonnes of cargo in 2019. Motril is the only Spanish Mediterranean port that lacks a rail service; building a line which would take 25 minutes to travel to Granada railway station was estimated to cost ‚Ç¨400 million in 2017. The link to Granada was rejected in 2010 by the Ministry of Development on the basis of being unsuitable for freight railway transport due to the steep slope. From 1925 to 1950, Motril was connected to Granada via by means of a cable way that spanned from Motril to D√∫rcal.  Time capsule  On July 22, 2008, a second time capsule in Spain was buried as part of an official event organized to commemorate the 135th anniversary of the cantonal movement in Motril, which began on July 22, 1873, and ended on 25 March.

It has a population of about 100, including Foolow , Grindlow plus Little Hucklow and being measured at 427 in the 2011 Census. The area is now mainly agricultural, but the village was formerly a centre of the Derbyshire lead mining industry. The lead vein or rake outcrops to the surface to the west of the village and dives under the rocks of Hucklow Edge on the western side of the village where an adit, known as Milldam Mine, has recently been reopened by Glebe Mines Ltd that connects the various deep mines that had formerly been dug along the edge. This mine is being worked for fluorspar, which is frequently found associated with lead in the vein. In the village, there is a thriving primary school, which is located up a short lane (School Lane), under the edge, and a pub, the Queen Anne. It had a theatre for 40 years, which was run by L. du Garde Peach and the actors and staff were from the local area. The first production (The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare) was in 1927 staged in the Hucklow Holiday Homes. The first set of plays in the New Play House was in 1938, with four one act plays written by Peach. The New Play House was in a converted lead mining building (known locally as cupolas from the lead smelting furnace). The first 200-second hand seats cost 1 shilling and 9 pence each. The stage was wide by deep. For many years the theatre brought many visitors to Great Hucklow from all parts of the north of England. The theatre building is still used as an activity centre. The Unitarian Old Chapel was founded in 1696 and is still in use; it also has a small meeting room which is well used by the community. The Methodist Chapel, built in the early part of the 19th century, was converted to offices in 1999. The Nightingale Centre, which belongs to the Unitarians, is in the middle of the village and accommodates groups for school and community visits to the area, conferences and provides country holidays for children from inner cities. The Centre brings many visitors to the village from all over the world. Recently, Great Hucklow has taken control of the Silance Mine Heritage Site, jointly with the village of Foolow. This is a four hectare area of scrub, woodland and grassland on a south facing slope on Hucklow Edge which was the previous location for lead working at both Silence and Old Grove Mine and more recent re-working of the surface mineral heaps for fluorspar. The site straddles the parish boundary between Grindlow to the west and Foolow to the east. It is positioned on the boundary between the White and Dark Peak character areas. The long history of mining has resulted in the development of very complex surface soils with those derived from the shales lying in intimate association with soils developing from limestone and mineral material brought to the surface during the mining operations. Both Silence and Old Grove Mines have been extensively reworked for fluorspar at surface, but at the top end of Silence Mine there are the previously unrecognised remains of steam engine buildings and associated structures. These include the back walls of a horizontal engine house and boiler house, the possible base of a chimney, and a small sunken ‚Äòchamber‚Äô that originally was one half of a wheel pit which contained a large flywheel and/or winding drum associated with the engine house. Hillocks remain in the northern part of Old Grove Mine. The Peak District Mines Historical Society are currently excavating the remains of Silance Mine. The village is twinned with Parisot, Tarn-et-Garonne which is a rural village of similar size in the south west of France. The land rises steeply to the north of the village to Hucklow Edge and at Camphill on the plateau above it there is a popular gliding field, operated by the Derbyshire and Lancashire Gliding Club, which in July 1954 hosted the World Gliding Championships. On 9 August 2011 the UK's longest paraglider flight began in the village, ending over 250 km away in Suffolk. The village is accessed from the B6049 about a mile north of where it crosses the A623 at the Anchor Inn. The road to the village goes off to the east at the Windmill triangle. The village is host to an annual martial arts residency; this is a tradition dates back almost 30 years.

Biography Richard Furness was known as \\"The Poet of Eyam\\" after the village in Derbyshire, England where he was born on 2 August 1791. His parents, Samuel and Margaret sent him to school, although he could already read fluently by the age of four. He initially got a job keeping accounts locally but then went to apprentice as a courier in Chesterfield at the age of fourteen. He was able to extend his linguistic skills by learning French from prisoners of war. He learnt maths and music and at age of seventeen he was a Wesleyan preacher. Four years later he walked to London, and enlisted as a soldier. He did not, however, give up preaching. At the request of Dr. Adam Clarke, he spoke at the City Road Chapel. After a year he returned to Derbyshire. He separated from the Methodists about this time because he wrote a patriotic song which was sung in a public-house. In 1813 he started business at Eyam as a currier, but trade was neglected for music, poetry, and mathematics. His prospects were not improved when in 1816 he ran away with and married Frances Ibbotson of Hathersage. In 1821 he became schoolmaster in the free school at Dore which was then in Derbyshire. He also acted as vestry and parish clerk, but showed his independence of mind and action by invariably closing his book and resuming his seat at the recitation of the Athanasian Creed. He practised medicine and surgery, and when the ancient chapel of Dore was pulled down, his plans for a new one were adopted. He only superintended the erection of the building, but carved the ornamented figures which adorn the structure. On a change of incumbent at Dore he retired from his office of schoolmaster on a pension of ¬£15. The only duties he had now to perform were those of district registrar, which yielded him twelve pounds a year. In no year of his life did his income exceed eighty pounds. His first publication was a satirical poem entitled the 'Rag Bag,‚Äô 1832. His next was 'Medicus- Magus, a poem, in three cantos,‚Äô Sheffield, 1836, 12mo, in which he depicted the manners, habits, and limited intelligence, in the more remote parts of Derbyshire, the local terms being elucidated by a glossary. The title was afterwards altered to 'The Astrologer.' Many of his miscellaneous poems were printed in the 'Sheffield Iris.' After his death a collected edition of his 'Poetical Works,‚Äô with a sketch of his life by Dr. G. Calvert Holland, was published (Sheffield, 1858, 8vo). His verse is antiquated but forcible.

It is also known as the G√∂del solution or G√∂del universe. This solution has many unusual properties‚Äîin particular, the existence of closed timelike curves that would allow time travel in a universe described by the solution. Its definition is somewhat artificial in that the value of the cosmological constant must be carefully chosen to match the density of the dust grains, but this spacetime is an important pedagogical example. The solution was found in 1949 by Kurt G√∂del.G√∂del, K., \\"An Example of a New Type of Cosmological Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations of Gravitation\\", Rev. Mod. Phys. 21, 447, published July 1, 1949. Definition Like any other Lorentzian spacetime, the G√∂del solution presents the metric tensor in terms of some local coordinate chart. It may be easiest to understand the G√∂del universe using the cylindrical coordinate system (presented below), but this article uses the chart that G√∂del originally used. In this chart, the metric (or equivalently the line element) is : g = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\omega^2} \\\\left[ -(dt + e^x \\\\, dy)^2 + dx^2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} e^{2x} \\\\, dy^2 +dz^2\\\\right], \\\\qquad -\\\\infty < t, x, y, z < \\\\infty, where \\\\omega is a nonzero real constant, which turns out to be the angular velocity of the surrounding dust grains around the y axis, as measured by a \\"non-spinning\\" observer riding one of the dust grains. \\"Non-spinning\\" means that it doesn't feel centrifugal forces, but in this coordinate frame it would actually be turning on an axis parallel to the y axis. As we shall see, the dust grains stay at constant values of x, y, and z. Their density in this coordinate chart increases with x, but their density in their own frames of reference is the same everywhere. Properties To study the properties of the G√∂del solution, we will adopt the frame field (dual to the coframe read off the metric as given above), :\\\\vec{e}_0 = \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega \\\\, \\\\partial_t :\\\\vec{e}_1 = \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega \\\\, \\\\partial_x :\\\\vec{e}_2 = \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega \\\\, \\\\partial_y :\\\\vec{e}_3 = 2 \\\\omega \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\exp(-x) \\\\, \\\\partial_z - \\\\partial_t \\\\right). This frame defines a family of inertial observers who are comoving with the dust grains. However, computing the Fermi‚ÄìWalker derivatives with respect to \\\\vec{e}_0 shows that the spatial frames are spinning about \\\\vec{e}_2 with angular velocity -\\\\omega. It follows that the nonspinning inertial frame comoving with the dust particles is :\\\\vec{f}_0 = \\\\vec{e}_0 :\\\\vec{f}_1 = \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\, \\\\vec{e}_1 - \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\, \\\\vec{e}_3 :\\\\vec{f}_2 = \\\\vec{e}_2 :\\\\vec{f}_3 = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\, \\\\vec{e}_1 + \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\, \\\\vec{e}_3. =Einstein tensor= The components of the Einstein tensor (with respect to either frame above) are :G^{\\\\hat{a}\\\\hat{b}} = \\\\omega^2 \\\\operatorname{diag} (-1,1,1,1) + 2 \\\\omega^2 \\\\operatorname{diag} (1,0,0,0). Here, the first term is characteristic of a lambdavacuum solution and the second term is characteristic of a pressureless perfect fluid or dust solution. Notice that the cosmological constant is carefully chosen to partially cancel the matter density of the dust. =Topology= The G√∂del spacetime is a rare example of a regular (singularity-free) solution of the Einstein field equation. G√∂del's original chart (given here) is geodesically complete and singularity free; therefore, it is a global chart, and the spacetime is homeomorphic to R4, and therefore, simply connected. =Curvature invariants= In any Lorentzian spacetime, the fourth-rank Riemann tensor is a multilinear operator on the four-dimensional space of tangent vectors (at some event), but a linear operator on the six- dimensional space of bivectors at that event. Accordingly, it has a characteristic polynomial, whose roots are the eigenvalues. In the G√∂del spacetime, these eigenvalues are very simple: * triple eigenvalue zero, * double eigenvalue -\\\\omega^2, * single eigenvalue \\\\omega^2. =Killing vectors= This spacetime admits a five-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vectors, which can be generated by time translation \\\\partial_t , two spatial translations \\\\partial_y, \\\\; \\\\partial_z, plus two further Killing vector fields: : \\\\partial_x - z \\\\, \\\\partial_z and : -2 \\\\exp(-x) \\\\, \\\\partial_t + z \\\\, \\\\partial_x + \\\\left( \\\\exp(-2x) -z^2/2 \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\partial_z. The isometry group acts transitively (since we can translate in t,y,z, and using the fourth vector we can move along x as well), so the spacetime is homogeneous. However, it is not isotropic, as we shall see. It is obvious from the generators just given that the slices x=x_0 admit a transitive abelian three-dimensional transformation group, so a quotient of the solution can be reinterpreted as a stationary cylindrically symmetric solution. Less obviously, the slices y=y_0 admit an SL(2,R) action, and the slices t=t_0 admit a Bianchi III (c.f. the fourth Killing vector field). We can restate this by saying that our symmetry group includes as three-dimensional subgroups examples of Bianchi types I, III and VIII. Four of the five Killing vectors, as well as the curvature tensor, do not depend upon the coordinate y. Indeed, the G√∂del solution is the Cartesian product of a factor R with a three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (signature ‚àí++). It can be shown that the G√∂del solution is, up to local isometry, the only perfect fluid solution of the Einstein field equation admitting a five-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vectors. =Petrov type and Bel decomposition= The Weyl tensor of the G√∂del solution has Petrov type D. This means that for an appropriately chosen observer, the tidal forces have Coulomb form. To study the tidal forces in more detail, we compute the Bel decomposition of the Riemann tensor into three pieces, the tidal or electrogravitic tensor (which represents tidal forces), the magnetogravitic tensor (which represents spin-spin forces on spinning test particles and other gravitational effects analogous to magnetism), and the topogravitic tensor (which represents the spatial sectional curvatures). Observers comoving with the dust particles find that the tidal tensor (with respect to \\\\vec{u} = \\\\vec{e}_0, which components evaluated in our frame) has the form :{E\\\\left[ \\\\vec{u} \\\\right]}_{\\\\hat{m}\\\\hat{n}} = \\\\omega^2 \\\\operatorname{diag}(1,0,1). That is, they measure isotropic tidal tension orthogonal to the distinguished direction \\\\partial_y. The gravitomagnetic tensor vanishes identically :{B\\\\left[ \\\\vec{u} \\\\right]}_{\\\\hat{m}\\\\hat{n}} = 0. This is an artifact of the unusual symmetries of this spacetime, and implies that the putative \\"rotation\\" of the dust does not have the gravitomagnetic effects usually associated with the gravitational field produced by rotating matter. The principal Lorentz invariants of the Riemann tensor are :R_{abcd} \\\\, R^{abcd} = 12 \\\\omega^4, \\\\; R_{abcd} {{}^\\\\star R}^{abcd} = 0. The vanishing of the second invariant means that some observers measure no gravitomagnetism, which is consistent with what was just said. The fact that the first invariant (the Kretschmann invariant) is constant reflects the homogeneity of the G√∂del spacetime. =Rigid rotation= The frame fields given above are both inertial, abla_{\\\\vec{e}_0} \\\\vec{e}_0 = 0, but the vorticity vector of the timelike geodesic congruence defined by the timelike unit vectors is :-\\\\omega \\\\vec{e}_2 This means that the world lines of nearby dust particles are twisting about one another. Furthermore, the shear tensor of the congruence \\\\vec{e}_0 vanishes, so the dust particles exhibit rigid rotation. =Optical effects= If we study the past light cone of a given observer, we find that null geodesics moving orthogonally to \\\\partial_y spiral inwards toward the observer, so that if he looks radially, he sees the other dust grains in progressively time-lagged positions. However, the solution is stationary, so it might seem that an observer riding on a dust grain will not see the other grains rotating about himself. However, recall that while the first frame given above (the \\\\vec{e}_j) appears static in our chart, the Fermi‚ÄìWalker derivatives show that, in fact, it is spinning with respect to gyroscopes. The second frame (the \\\\vec{f}_j) appears to be spinning in our chart, but it is gyrostabilized, and a nonspinning inertial observer riding on a dust grain will indeed see the other dust grains rotating clockwise with angular velocity \\\\omega about his axis of symmetry. It turns out that in addition, optical images are expanded and sheared in the direction of rotation. If a nonspinning inertial observer looks along his axis of symmetry, he sees his coaxial nonspinning inertial peers apparently nonspinning with respect to himself, as we would expect. =Shape of absolute future= According to Hawking and Ellis, another remarkable feature of this spacetime is the fact that, if we suppress the inessential y coordinate, light emitted from an event on the world line of a given dust particle spirals outwards, forms a circular cusp, then spirals inward and reconverges at a subsequent event on the world line of the original dust particle. This means that observers looking orthogonally to the \\\\vec{e}_2 direction can see only finitely far out, and also see themselves at an earlier time. The cusp is a nongeodesic closed null curve. (See the more detailed discussion below using an alternative coordinate chart.) =Closed timelike curves= Because of the homogeneity of the spacetime and the mutual twisting of our family of timelike geodesics, it is more or less inevitable that the G√∂del spacetime should have closed timelike curves (CTCs). Indeed, there are CTCs through every event in the G√∂del spacetime. This causal anomaly seems to have been regarded as the whole point of the model by G√∂del himself, who was apparently striving to prove, and arguably succeeded in proving, that Einstein's equations of spacetime are not consistent with what we intuitively understand time to be (i. e. that it passes and the past no longer exists, the position philosophers call presentism, whereas G√∂del seems to have been arguing for something more like the philosophy of eternalism), much as he, conversely, succeeded with his incompleteness theorems in showing that intuitive mathematical concepts could not be completely described by formal mathematical systems of proof. See the book A World Without Time. Einstein was aware of G√∂del's solution and commented in Albert Einstein: Philosopher- Scientist that if there are a series of causally-connected events in which \\"the series is closed in itself\\" (in other words, a closed timelike curve), then this suggests that there is no good physical way to define whether a given event in the series happened \\"earlier\\" or \\"later\\" than another event in the series: > In that case the distinction \\"earlier-later\\" is abandoned for world-points > which lie far apart in a cosmological sense, and those paradoxes, regarding > the direction of the causal connection, arise, of which Mr. G√∂del has > spoken. Such cosmological solutions of the gravitation-equations (with not > vanishing A-constant) have been found by Mr. G√∂del. It will be interesting > to weigh whether these are not to be excluded on physical grounds. =Globally nonhyperbolic= If the G√∂del spacetime admitted any boundaryless temporal hyperslices (e.g. a Cauchy surface), any such CTC would have to intersect it an odd number of times, contradicting the fact that the spacetime is simply connected. Therefore, this spacetime is not globally hyperbolic. A cylindrical chart In this section, we introduce another coordinate chart for the G√∂del solution, in which some of the features mentioned above are easier to see. =Derivation= G√∂del did not explain how he found his solution, but there are in fact many possible derivations. We will sketch one here, and at the same time verify some of the claims made above. Start with a simple frame in a cylindrical type chart, featuring two undetermined functions of the radial coordinate: :\\\\vec{e}_0=\\\\partial_t, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_1=\\\\partial_z, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_2=\\\\partial_r, \\\\, \\\\vec{e}_3=\\\\frac{1}{b(r)} \\\\, \\\\left( -a(r) \\\\, \\\\partial_t + \\\\partial_\\\\varphi \\\\right) Here, we think of the timelike unit vector field \\\\vec{e}_0 as tangent to the world lines of the dust particles, and their world lines will in general exhibit nonzero vorticity but vanishing expansion and shear. Let us demand that the Einstein tensor match a dust term plus a vacuum energy term. This is equivalent to requiring that it match a perfect fluid; i.e., we require that the components of the Einstein tensor, computed with respect to our frame, take the form : G^{\\\\hat{i}\\\\hat{j}} = \\\\mu \\\\operatorname{diag}(1,0,0,0) + p \\\\operatorname{diag}(0,1,1,1) This gives the conditions : b^{\\\\prime\\\\prime\\\\prime} = \\\\frac{b^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} \\\\, b^{\\\\prime}}{b}, \\\\; \\\\left( a^\\\\prime \\\\right)^2 = 2 \\\\, b^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} \\\\, b Plugging these into the Einstein tensor, we see that in fact we now have \\\\mu = p. The simplest nontrivial spacetime we can construct in this way evidently would have this coefficient be some nonzero but constant function of the radial coordinate. Specifically, with a bit of foresight, let us choose \\\\mu = \\\\omega^2. This gives : b(r) = \\\\frac{\\\\sinh(\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega \\\\,r)}{\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega}, \\\\; a(r) = \\\\frac{\\\\cosh(\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega r)}{\\\\omega} + c Finally, let us demand that this frame satisfy :\\\\vec{e}_3 = \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\, \\\\partial_\\\\varphi + O \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\right) This gives c=-1/\\\\omega, and our frame becomes :\\\\vec{e}_0=\\\\partial_t, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_1=\\\\partial_z, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_2=\\\\partial_r, \\\\; \\\\vec{e}_3 = \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega }{ \\\\sinh( \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega r ) } \\\\, \\\\partial_\\\\varphi - \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\sinh(\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega r)}{1+\\\\cosh(\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega r)} \\\\, \\\\partial_t =Appearance of the light cones= From the metric tensor we find that the vector field \\\\partial_\\\\varphi, which is spacelike for small radii, becomes null at r=r_c where :r_c = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{arccosh}(3)}{\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\omega} This is because at that radius we find that \\\\vec{e}_3 = \\\\frac{ \\\\omega }2 \\\\, \\\\partial_\\\\varphi - \\\\partial_t, so \\\\frac{ \\\\omega }2 \\\\, \\\\partial_\\\\varphi=\\\\vec{e}_3+\\\\vec{e}_0 and is therefore null. The circle r = r_c at a given t is a closed null curve, but not a null geodesic. Examining the frame above, we can see that the coordinate z is inessential; our spacetime is the direct product of a factor R with a signature ‚àí++ three-manifold. Suppressing z in order to focus our attention on this three-manifold, let us examine how the appearance of the light cones changes as we travel out from the axis of symmetry r=0: Two light cones (with their accompanying frame vectors) in the cylindrical chart for the G√∂del lambda dust solution. As we move outwards from the nominal symmetry axis, the cones tip forward and widen. Vertical coordinate lines (representing the world lines of the dust particles) are timelike. When we get to the critical radius, the cones become tangent to the closed null curve. =A congruence of closed timelike curves= At the critical radius r = r_c, the vector field \\\\partial_\\\\varphi becomes null. For larger radii, it is timelike. Thus, corresponding to our symmetry axis we have a timelike congruence made up of circles and corresponding to certain observers. This congruence is however only defined outside the cylinder r=r_c. This is not a geodesic congruence; rather, each observer in this family must maintain a constant acceleration in order to hold his course. Observers with smaller radii must accelerate harder; as r \\\\rightarrow r_c the magnitude of acceleration diverges, which is just what is expected, given that r=r_c is a null curve. =Null geodesics= If we examine the past light cone of an event on the axis of symmetry, we find the following picture: The null geodesics spiral counterclockwise toward an observer on the axis of symmetry. This shows them from \\"above\\". Recall that vertical coordinate lines in our chart represent the world lines of the dust particles, but despite their straight appearance in our chart, the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually twisting about each other. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that when our observer looks radially outwards, he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another. The null geodesics are geometrically straight; in the figure, they appear to be spirals only because the coordinates are \\"rotating\\" in order to permit the dust particles to appear stationary. =The absolute future= According to Hawking and Ellis (see monograph cited below), all light rays emitted from an event on the symmetry axis reconverge at a later event on the axis, with the null geodesics forming a circular cusp (which is a null curve, but not a null geodesic): Hawking and Ellis picture of expansion and reconvergence of light emitted by an observer on the axis of symmetry. This implies that in the G√∂del lambdadust solution, the absolute future of each event has a character very different from what we might naively expect. Cosmological interpretation Following G√∂del, we can interpret the dust particles as galaxies, so that the G√∂del solution becomes a cosmological model of a rotating universe. Besides rotating, this model exhibits no Hubble expansion, so it is not a realistic model of the universe in which we live, but can be taken as illustrating an alternative universe, which would in principle be allowed by general relativity (if one admits the legitimacy of a nonzero cosmological constant). Less well known solutions of G√∂del's exhibit both rotation and Hubble expansion and have other qualities of his first model, but travelling into the past is not possible. According to S. W. Hawking, these models could well be a reasonable description of the universe that we observe, however observational data are compatible only with a very low rate of rotation.S. W. Hawking, Introductory note to 1949 and 1952 in Kurt G√∂del, Collected works, Volume II (S. Feferman et al., eds). The quality of these observations improved continually up until G√∂del's death, and he would always ask \\"is the universe rotating yet?\\" and be told \\"no, it isn't\\".Reflections on Kurt G√∂del, by Hao Wang, MIT Press, (1987), p. 183. We have seen that observers lying on the y axis (in the original chart) see the rest of the universe rotating clockwise about that axis. However, the homogeneity of the spacetime shows that the direction but not the position of this \\"axis\\" is distinguished. Some have interpreted the G√∂del universe as a counterexample to Einstein's hopes that general relativity should exhibit some kind of Mach's principle, citing the fact that the matter is rotating (world lines twisting about each other) in a manner sufficient to pick out a preferred direction, although with no distinguished axis of rotation. Others take Mach principle to mean some physical law tying the definition of nonspinning inertial frames at each event to the global distribution and motion of matter everywhere in the universe, and say that because the nonspinning inertial frames are precisely tied to the rotation of the dust in just the way such a Mach principle would suggest, this model does accord with Mach's ideas. Many other exact solutions that can be interpreted as cosmological models of rotating universes are known. See the book Homogeneous Relativistic Cosmologies (1975) by Ryan and Shepley for some of these generalizations.

Primacy of Peter among the Apostles  The Evangelical Dictionary of Theology illustrates the leading role that Peter played among the Apostles, speaking up on matters that concern them all, being called by Jesus by a name linking him with the rock on which Jesus would build his church, being charged with pastoring the flock of Christ, and taking the leading role in the initial church as described in the Acts of the Apostles.Walter A. Elwell (editor), Evangelical Dictionary of Theology (Baker Academic 2001 ), entry \\"Peter, Primacy of\\" There is general agreement among scholars on the preeminence that the historical Peter held among the disciples of Jesus, making him \\"the most prominent and influential member of the Twelve during Jesus' ministry and in the early Church\\".Theodore Stylianopoulos \\"Concerning the Biblical Foundation of Primacy\\", in Walter Kasper (editor), The Petrine Ministry (Paulist Press 2008 ), pp. 43‚Äì44, citing John P.

But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in , had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage ‚Äì which Paul lacked ‚Äì and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

The Canon Debate. McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, ch. 32, p. 577.  Matthew 16:18  Controversy has surrounded one particular text that is linked with the Aramaic nickname name ◊õ◊§◊ê (Cepha), meaning \\"rock,\\" that Jesus gave the man previously known as Simon. The Greeks translated it as Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ (Petros), a new form, appropriately masculine, of the standard feminine word œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± (petra), also meaning \\"rock;\\" and the Latins translated it as Petrus. While the reasons for disagreement on the nature of the primacy are complex, hinging on matters of doctrine, history and politics, the debate is often reduced to a discussion of the meaning and translation of Matthew 16:18: \\"And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\\" In the Greek text, the new name given is Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ (Petros), and in the second half of the same verse the word translated as \\"rock\\" is œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± (petra). A literal translation, in the style of the King James Version, of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \\"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\\".In French, the translation, \\"Tu es Pierre, et sur cette pierre je b√¢tirai mon √âglise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr√©vaudront point contre elle\\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic. To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \\"Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ\\" rather than as \\"ŒöŒ∑œÜ·æ∂œÇ\\" (Cephas). One common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the New Testament in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see Aramaic primacy. According to the Protestant transliteration argument, in the language that Jesus spoke, the same word, ◊õ◊§◊ê (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the Protestant Reformation, many non-Catholics have challenged the Catholic Church's position, questioning whether the feminine œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± refers to Peter, and claiming it may instead refer to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.John Engler. \\"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\\".

Catholic view on relationship to the Church today In Catholicism, it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other bishops throughout the Church. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the papacy has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the entire Church. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and passed on. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of pope which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the universal Church. Some Catholics believe that Saint Paul saw Judaism as the type or figure of Christianity: \\"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\\" In the Old Law, attributes to the High Priest the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church, though the relevance of Biblical law in Christianity is still disputed; see also New Covenant and New Commandment. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone. In the New Testament, which some call the New Law or \\"New Greek Testament\\",Knight, Kevin. \\"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\\" New Advent. Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul). Jesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \\"I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.\\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the Book of Revelation, that He has the \\"keys of death and hell,\\" which means that He has power over death and hell; also supports this. Cardinal Gibbons, in his book The Faith of Our Fathers, points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of prime minister, which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose. Both Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. John Chrysostom) referred to \\"rock\\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large. Vatican Council I defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much- debated.Schatz, Klaus. Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present. Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M. Maloney. Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1996. p. x. This is reflected in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: Regarding the Catholic interpretation of Matthew 16:18-19, Jaroslav Pelikan writes: \\"As Roman Catholic scholars now concede, the ancient Christian father Cyprian used it to prove the authority of the bishop‚Äînot merely of the Roman bishop, but of every bishop,\\" referring to Maurice Bevenot's work on St. Cyprian. Eastern Catholics agree with the above, but also consider Peter to be representative of all bishops. In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the Eastern Orthodox in the next section. Though among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of Acts of the Apostles, James \\"the brother of the Lord\\" is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first Bishop of Jerusalem. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the Council of Jerusalem and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as circumcision) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \\"pillars of the church\\" in Jerusalem. James was indeed the first bishop or patriarch of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \\"Rock\\" and \\"Chief Shepherd\\".Mckenzie, John L. The Dictionary of the Bible (Catholic) It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to Herod Agrippa's persecution. The Navarre Bible, footnotes However, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek exegesato to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \\"declaring\\" or \\"issuing a ruling.\\" The Biblical Basis for the Papacy by John Salza However, James uses the Greek word akouoo in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \\"giving one's opinion,\\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his Saint Peter and the Popes in the following terms: \\"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\\" The Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \\"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \\"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\\" This view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople: =Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy= Irenaeus Irenaeus has been called the most important witness of the Christianity of the 2nd century.Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6. Taught by Polycarp, who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became Bishop of Lyon in 178. In his Against the Heresies, Irenaeus wrote, \\"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8. In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \\"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way ‚Ä¶ gather more than they ought.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9. Irenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans. Ignatius of Antioch Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at Smyrna in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \\"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4. Tertullian Born in Carthage around 155 AD, Tertullian became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his Scorpiace of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \\"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold. ‚Ä¶For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23. Scorpiace is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \\"everyone\\" if they \\"made confession\\", rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D.. AnteNicene Fathers: Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth; Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second. On Modesty \\"Chap.

Published online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.viii.xxi.html listing various reasons why the Keys of Peter pertained to Peter alone. The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power. Cyprian Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \\"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30. In his 251 AD De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate, Cyprian asks, \\"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53. John Chrysostom John Chrysostom was born at Antioch around 347 and would fight for the reform of the Church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. He called Peter \\"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 126. His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church. Augustine of Hippo Saint Augustine was born in Numidia in 354 AD and was baptized in Milan in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 163. His Sermo states, \\"Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said 'I give to thee the keys ‚Ä¶ shall be loosed in heaven'. What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 175. His 395 A.D. Contra Epistolam Manichaei states, \\"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church. ‚Ä¶The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 182. Pope Innocent I Innocent I held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of papal primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to Decentius, bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \\"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194. It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes to the authority of \\"his holiness\\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198. The doctrine of primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy. Pope Leo I Based on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that Leo I identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \\"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted to but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter. ‚Ä¶So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles.\\" The Council of Chalcedon would later refer to Leo as \\"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\\"Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 280, 323. Pope Gregory VII The Gregorian Reform movement was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by Gregory VII, formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.Morris, Colin. The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101. Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and King Henry IV of Germany, known as the \\"Investiture Contest\\". Gregory's Dictus Pape outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.Morris, Colin. The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129. This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \\"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\\"Morris, Colin. The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133. The Petrine primacy was now more affirmed than ever. =Challenges= Councils Many challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The Edict of Milan, the Council of Nicea, and the First Council of Constantinople all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The Council of Ephesus in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD).Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. Pp. 238-256. Although the highlight of the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD was the confession of the Person of Christ, the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \\"the most holy and beloved of God\\" and \\"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, the Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.Giles, E., ed. Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454. London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321. Schism The papacy's most widely known crisis, as well as its largest challenge to authority, came with the \\"Western Schism\\" in the late Middle Ages, dating from 1378‚Äì1417.Schatz, Klaus. Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present. Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M. Maloney. Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1996. p. 100. Seven popes ruled from Avignon in France in the early 14th century, until Gregory XI risked returning to turbulent Italy and the Roman seat.Logan, F. Donald. A History of the Church in the Middle Ages. New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 297. Following the close of the Avignon papacy in 1377, Urban VI, an Italian, took the reins over a predominantly French college of Cardinals. The Cardinals called the election into question and elected Clement VII as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378‚Äì1394) and his successor, Benedict XIII (1394-1417) who would reside in Avignon. Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today =Many hold the Primacy of Peter= Icon of St. Peter (15th century, Russian State Museum, Saint Petersburg). The Eastern Orthodox Church regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \\"preeminent apostles\\". Another title used for Peter is Coryphaeus, which could be translated as \\"Choir-director,\\" or lead singer.John Meyendorff, et al. (1963), The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church (St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, Crestwood NY, ) Orthodox scholars follow St. John Chrysostom and the Byzantine tradition in seeing Peter as the icon of the episcopate with his title of protos (first) implying a certain level of authority over the other apostles. In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\\"the diocese\\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \\"Chair of Peter\\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair. As John Meyendorff explained: The notion that many Sees were ‚Äò‚Äôof Peter‚Äô‚Äô had also once been held in the West. We hear from Pope Gregory the Great: Consequently, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the unique successor of St. Peter and consider him to be in a state of schism and heresy. However, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. The Orthodox also consider that St. Linus, not Peter, was actually the first Bishop of Rome. =Keys and rock not exclusive to Peter= Eastern Orthodox theologians agree that in , \\"rock\\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \\"Peter\\" means \\"rock.\\". However implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers. Although the word keys is explicitly absent from this later verse a number of Church Fathers recognised that the meaning of keys is implicitly there; that the rest of the church has the keys: Tertullian Hilary of Poitiers John Chrysostom Augustine Moreover, Eastern Orthodox theologians follow such Fathers as St. John Chrysostom by clarifying that \\"rock\\" simultaneously refers to Peter (instrumentally) as well as Peter's confession of faith which is what has ultimate significance in establishing the Church. Some Orthodox scholars do not see Peter as being in any way above the other apostles, arguing that Peter did not have power and authority over them during Christ's public ministry. There were no positions of power between the twelve, only \\"degrees of intimacy\\" or \\"degrees of honor.\\" According to this view, Peter has a weak symbolic primacy or primacy of honor (in the sense of a purely honorary primacy). In the patristic era, this was actually the Western view held by St Augustine. Others (see above), following the traditional Byzantine view of St John Chrysostom see Peter as the icon of the bishop and therefore endowed with authority in the Church (i.e. the diocese). Tertullian John Chrysostom Pope Leo I =Proofs from the Bible= Other biblical texts seem to suggest that Peter was not head of the church in any de jure sense. shows the apostles considering a question by means of calling a Council. Although Peter is mentioned as speaking first, and all are silent ‚Äì all are silent too when Paul speaks. Further, if Peter's pronouncement was authoritative then Paul speaking afterwards would be superfluous; given that the \\"decision\\" had already been made. Equality of all the Apostles is shown in ; that all the Apostles together are the foundation of the church. shows that Paul taught in the same terms as Peter did. The forgiveness of sins (one of the powers of the keys) is granted to many; see and . =Examples from history= Orthodox historians also maintain that Rome's authority in the early Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) empire was recognized only partially because of Rome's Petrine character, and that this factor was not the decisive issue. Moreover, the Orthodox view is that Rome's privileges were not understood as an absolute power (i.e., the difference between primacy and supremacy). In the East, there were numerous \\"apostolic sees\\", Jerusalem being considered the \\"mother of all churches\\", and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first bishop of Antioch. \\"Canon 28 of Chalcedon was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ...The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\\" Protestant views on relationship to the Church today A major debate between Catholics and Protestants centers on Matthew 16:18 where Jesus tells Peter: \\"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.\\" Catholics interpret the verse as saying that Jesus would build his church on Peter, the apostle: Jesus told Peter (Rock) that he would build his Church on this Rock (Peter), and that Peter was made the shepherd of the apostolic flock ‚Äì hence their assertion of the Primacy of the Catholic Pontiff. One Protestant view on the Matthew verse agrees with the Catholic view and again the disagreements about primacy stem from doctrinal sources, and disagreements such as those over the identification of Simon Peter with the Pope. Other Protestants assert the following, based specifically on the verse in Matthew: Jesus gives Simon the new name petros. However he refers to the \\"rock\\" as petra. The inspired New Testament Scriptures were written in Greek, not Aramaic. What Jesus might have said in Aramaic is conjecture. In Greek, there is a distinction between the two words, œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± being a \\"rock\\" but œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ being a \\"small stone\\" or \\"pebble\\". (James G. McCarthy translates the two as \\"mass of rock\\" and \\"boulder or detached stone\\", respectively.) Jesus is not referring to Peter when talking about \\"this rock\\", but is in fact referring to Peter's confession of faith in the preceding verses. Jesus thus does not declare the primacy of Peter, but rather declares that his church will be built upon the foundation of the revelation of and confession of faith of Jesus as the Christ. Many Protestant scholars, however, reject this position, such as Craig L. Blomberg who states, \\"The expression ‚Äòthis rock‚Äô almost certainly refers to Peter, following immediately after his name, just as the words following ‚Äòthe Christ‚Äô in verse 16 applied to Jesus. The play on words in the Greek between Peter's name (Petros) and the word ‚Äòrock‚Äô (petra) makes sense only if Peter is the Rock and if Jesus is about to explain the significance of this identification\\" (New American Commentary: ). Donald A. Carson III (Baptist and Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Seminary) states: An alternate Protestant argument is that when Jesus said \\"upon this rock\\" in the aforementioned Matthew verse, he referred to himself, in reference to , which states that \\"God ... is the Rock, his work is perfect\\". This idea also appears in , which says \\"...that Rock is Christ.\\" In , Jesus is called \\"the chief cornerstone\\". =Meaning of \\"Rock\\"= In the original Greek the word translated as \\"Peter\\" is Œ†Œ≠œÑœÅŒøœÇ (Petros) and that translated as \\"rock\\" is œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± (petra), two words that, while not identical, give an impression of one of many times when Jesus used a play on words. Furthermore, since Jesus presumably spoke to Peter in their native Aramaic language, he would have used kepha in both instances. The Peshitta Text and the Old Syriac text use the word \\"kepha\\" for both \\"Peter\\" and \\"rock\\" in . says Jesus called Simon \\"Cephas\\", as does Paul in some letters. He was instructed by Christ to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles. Peter also had a leadership role in the early Christian church at Jerusalem according to The Acts of the Apostles chapters 1‚Äì2, 10‚Äì11, and 15. Early Catholic Latin and Greek writers (such as St. John Chrysostom) considered the \\"foundation rock\\" as applying to both Peter personally and his confession of faith (or the faith of his confession) symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large. This \\"double meaning\\" interpretation is present in the current Catechism of the Catholic Church.Catechism of the Catholic Church, Articles 424 and 552 Protestant counter-claims to the Catholic interpretation are largely based on the difference between the Greek words translated \\"Rock\\" in the Matthean passage. In classical Attic Greek petros generally meant \\"pebble,\\" while petra meant \\"boulder\\" or \\"cliff\\". Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \\"pebble\\", they argue that the \\"rock\\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin√© Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of petros and petra. Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, by Pietro Perugino (1481‚Äì82) However, even though the feminine noun petra is translated as rock in the phrase \\"on this rock I will build my church,\\" the word petra (œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± in Greek) is also used at in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \\"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\\" Although is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.Mathison, Keith A., The Shape of Sola Scriptura, pp.184‚Äì185 Another rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if Peter really means the Rock which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict the Bible's teaching in which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone. They posit that the meaning of is that Jesus uses a play on words with Peter's name to say that the confession he had just made is the rock on which the church is built. Other theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A. Carson who claim that there is no distinction between the words petros and petra in Koine Greek. The Lutheran theologiansDanker, Frederick W., The concise Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament, p. 282. state that the dictionaries of Koine/NT Greek, including the authoritativeRykle Borger, \\"Remarks of an Outsider about Bauer's Worterbuch, BAGD, BDAG, and Their Textual Basis,\\" Biblical Greek Language and Lexicography: Essays in Honor of Frederick W. Danker, Bernard A. Tayler (et al. eds.) pp. 32‚Äì47. Bauer-Danker-Arndt-Gingrich Lexicon, indeed list both words and the passages that give different meanings for each. Conservative Lutheran apologists state: =Partial Protestant support= Partial support for the Catholic position comes from Oscar Cullmann. He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \\"rock\\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \\"Kepha\\" was the Aramaic word for \\"rock\\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter. Yet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \\"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \\"warrant of the papal succession.\\"\\"Religion: Peter & the Rock.\\" \\"Time,\\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009 Cullmann concludes that while Peter was the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession. There are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \\"Rock.\\"D. A. Carson in The Expositor's Bible Commentary (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984). Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic Koine dialect in which there is no distinction in meaning between petros and petra. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of petros was a smallish \\"stone,\\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus v. 1595, where petros refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a petros/petra distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun petra could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of Petros as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic Kepha. Yet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact did mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun taute, which allegedly means \\"this very\\" or this same, when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \\"and\\", kai. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with kai, the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy The New Apostolic Church believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first Chief Apostle in the Early Church. =Lutheran view= From the Book of Concord: Unlike Oscar Cullmann, Confessional Lutherans and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of Rock by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, not Aramaic.Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18 Modern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the Rock until the 1870s: Lutheran apologists criticize: View of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) accepts the primacy of Peter, although it does not generally use the term. The LDS Church teaches that Peter was the chief apostle and head of the Church after Christ's ascension. The LDS Church further teaches that all Melchizedek Priesthood authority in the Church must come through a line of authority traceable directly from Christ through Peter. However, in contrast to other groups, they believe that the line of succession was at some point broken following the death of the apostles, necessitating a restoration of the priesthood authority. The LDS Church teaches that this restoration occurred with the appearance of the resurrected Peter, James, and John, who conferred the authority on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in 1829. All ordained members of the LDS Church can obtain a written line of authority tracing back to Christ through Peter. Despite the acceptance of Peter's primacy, several leaders of the LDS Church have taught that the rock referred to by Jesus in Matthew 16:18 was neither Peter nor his confession, but the gift of revelation from the Holy Spirit which made Christ's divinity known to Peter. Apostle Howard W. Hunter taught: Church founder Joseph Smith is quoted as having said: Although these quotes may represent normative LDS belief, none of them are from canonized doctrinal sources.

He was the eldest son of H≈çj≈ç Tokimasa and his wife H≈çj≈ç no Maki. He was shikken from the abdication of his father Tokimasa in 1205 until his death in 1224.  Early Years Until Fatherhood (1163‚Äì1183)  H≈çj≈ç Yoshitoki was born in 1163, who was the eldest son of H≈çj≈ç Tokimasa and his wife, H≈çj≈ç no Maki. At the time of his birth, he had an older sister, H≈çj≈ç Masako. Later on in the decade, he would have another brother, H≈çj≈ç Tokifusa, and a sister whose name remains unknown, but their birth dates are not known. The H≈çj≈ç clan was at that time in control of Izu, and Yoshitoki, being a H≈çj≈ç, was also a descendant of the Taira clan and also of the imperial family. At that time, the Taira, under Taira no Kiyomori, had consolidated their power in Kyoto, the capital, and expelled the Minamoto clan, their rival. Minamoto no Yoshitomo, the head of the clan, was executed, while his sons who were not executed were exiled or ordered into monasteries. The cloistered emperor, Emperor Go- Shirakawa, as well as his son, the emperor at that time (who was a puppet), Emperor Nij≈ç, were also in Kyoto. Minamoto no Yoritomo, Yoshitomo's heir, was exiled to Izu, which was where the H≈çj≈ç domains were. (His other brothers, Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Noriyori were ordered into monasteries near Kyoto). Yoshitoki was from the first day of his life expected to succeed his father as the head of the H≈çj≈ç clan in Izu. He had a very close relationships with his siblings, especially his sister Masako, who was very tomboyish and would eat with the men (including her father, Tokimasa, and her brothers, Yoshitoki and Tokifusa) rather than with her sister and mother. In 1179, Yoshitoki's sister Masako fell in love with the young Minamoto exile, Minamoto no Yoritomo, and they wed. The marriage was supported fully by the young heir, Yoshitoki. In 1180, Masako and Yoritomo had a daughter, ≈å-Hime, who was very close with her maternal uncle, Yoshitoko. That same year, a disgruntled Prince Mochihito, a son of Go-Shirakawa, grew weary of the Taira leadership, believing he was denied the throne just so his young nephew, Emperor Antoku, who was half Taira, could be enthroned. He called the Minamoto leaders all over Japan to overthrow the Taira. Yoritomo responded readily, and Yoshitoki, Masako, Tokimasa, and the entire H≈çj≈ç clan supported him. His half- brothers, Yoshitsune and Noriyori joined him. Yoritomo created his base east of Izu in Kamakura, located in Sagami Province. The Genpei War had begun, and Yoshitoki was ordered by his father to aid Yoritomo in any way he can. The next year, 1181, Taira no Kiyomori died, and was succeeded by his son, Taira no Munemori. In 1182, the 19-year-old Yoshitoki, amidst the war, wed. His wife is unknown. We do know that in 1183, they had their first child, H≈çj≈ç Yasutoki, who would become the heir to the H≈çj≈ç following his father's death. The previous year, Yoritomo and Masako had a son, who would be the Minamoto heir, Minamoto no Yoriie. In 1183, Yoritomo's rival and cousin, Minamoto no Yoshinaka, entered Kyoto and drove out the Heike (and the young Emperor Antoku). Yoshinaka was then driven out of Kyoto by Yoshitsune in the name of Yoritomo. The Minamoto quickly enthroned Emperor Go-Toba.  Rise to Power (1185‚Äì1205)  In 1185, the Genpei War ended when the Minamoto defeated the Taira at the Battle of Dan no Ura, and most of the Taira leaders were executed or committed suicide (including Emperor Antoku, who drowned). The Minamoto were now in control of Japan, and established their base in Kamakura. This also placed the H≈çj≈ç in a very powerful position as well. That year, H≈çj≈ç Tokimasa received from Cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa the first appointments for jit≈ç and shugo, or constable and steward. In 1192, cloistered emperor Go- Shirakawa (who died later that year) bestowed upon Yoritomo the title of sh≈çgun. That same year, Masako and Yoritomo had another son, Minamoto no Sanetomo. Yoshitoki was now also in a very powerful position, especially after Yoritomo died in 1199. Masako became a nun, but was still involved in politics, while Yoshitoko prepared to be heir. H≈çj≈ç Tokimasa became regent for Shogun Yoriie, Yoritomo's son who disliked the H≈çj≈ç and preferred his father- in-law's family, the Hiki clan under Hiki Yoshikazu. Yoshitoki, Masako, and Tokimasa presided over a council of regents in 1200 to help Yoriie in ruling the country, but Yoriie distrusted the H≈çj≈ç, and in 1203 plotted with Yoshikazu to have H≈çj≈ç Tokimasa murdered. Yoshitoki had no idea about this, but Masako found out and told her father. Tokimasa had Yoshikazu executed in 1203. During the gore, Yoriie's son and heir, Minamoto no Ichiman, was also executed. Yoriie, out of support, abdicated in 1203, went to live in Izu, and was executed on Tokimasa's orders in 1204. Both Masako and Yoshitoki were not expecting this. Later on, Minamoto no Sanetomo, Yoritomo's second son, became shogun. Tokimasa ruled as regent for him also, but he fell out with the H≈çj≈ç, and Tokimasa plotted to have him executed. During this period, a certain Hatakeyama Shigetada, Yoshitoki's brother in law who had married his sister (not Masako) was executed by Tokimasa's men, on false charges of treason. Yoshitoki had been close with him, and began to distrust his father. When there were plans to have Sanetomo executed also, Masako and Yoshitoki ordered their father to abdicate or they would rebel. Tokimasa shaved his head, became a monk, and retired to a monastery/nunnery in Kamakura, only dying in 1215. H≈çj≈ç Yoshitoki thus succeeded Tokimasa as shikken (regent).  Regency and Death (1205‚Äì1224)  Yoshitoki's regency was very quiet and uneventful until the final few years of it. He was aided by his sister, the \\"nun-sh≈çgun\\" Masako. In 1218, Regent Yoshitoki sent Masako to Kyoto to ask the now Cloistered Emperor Go-Toba if one of his sons, Prince Nagahito, could become Shogun Sanetomo's heir, since he had no children. She was refused. In 1219, Shogun Sanetomo was assassinated by his nephew, the late Yoriie's son, who was later murdered himself. Thus, the Minamoto line died out. That same year, Regent Yoshitoki chose a distant Minamoto relative, Kuj≈ç Yoritsune, who was of the Kuj≈ç clan and thus a Fujiwara. He was the new Shogun, but Yoshitoki was still regent. In 1221, the J≈çky≈´ War occurred. Cloistered emperor Go-Toba, disillusioned with the H≈çj≈ç, declared Regent Yoshitoki an outlaw and wanted him executed. Kyoto was now in open rebellion, Yoshitoki ordered his troops to attack Kyoto, and the city was taken in 1221. Masako helped discover the plot. Go-Toba was exiled to the Oki Islands. Yoshitoki's son, H≈çj≈ç Yasutoki, took the capital. Nonetheless, in 1224, H≈çj≈ç Yoshitoki suddenly died of an illness. He was 61 years old. He was succeeded by his son and heir, H≈çj≈ç Yasutoki, as the third Shikken for Shogun Yoritsune. His sister Masako survived him for a year, before she to succumbed in 1225 at the age of 69.

Surgery After an anesthetic (local or general, depending on whether or not it is the only surgery to be performed) is administered to the patient, a small, horizontal incision is made on the bottom of the Adam's apple. The muscles in the throat are then held apart with forceps, and the protruding cartilage is shaved down with a scalpel, thus making the throat appear smoother and less angular. The incision is then closed with sutures, and a red line will mark the incision for about six weeks. Little scarring occurs in most cases because the surgeon will usually make the incision in one of the minuscule folds of skin that cover the Adam's apple. The surgery is usually outpatient unless it is combined with other surgeries that require hospital stays. Particular care must be taken by the surgeon to not remove too much cartilage, as doing so can reduce the structure of the trachea and cause breathing difficulties. Most surgeons who specialize in sex reassignment surgery offer the procedure, and some general plastic surgeons will as well. It is one of the more common surgeries performed on trans women, along with genital reconstruction. Due to the proximity of the vocal folds, there is the small possibility that they may be damaged during this type of surgery. Generally, however, the patient's voice is unaffected, although there have been reports of slight change in pitch. Some patients will choose to undergo additional vocal surgery at the same time in order to minimize voice-related dysphoria. Recovery It is recommended by many surgeons that the patient frequently rub the site of the incision to prevent noticeable scar tissue from forming. Swelling and bruising around the site of the incision is common, and patients may also experience difficulty swallowing and speaking, to a greater or lesser degree depending on the individual. The average time for complete recovery is about two weeks, although it can sometimes take longer if the patient has pre-existing medical conditions such as anemia.

It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History The land currently occupied by the present-day suburb of Oakhurst was originally zoned as rural, with poultry and vegetable farms existing well in the mid-20th century. In 1981, the land was zoned as residential by the NSW State Government. Shortly after, the Land Commission of NSW (Landcom) began developing land bounded by Jersey Rd to the south, Daniels Rd to the west, Cook Rd to the north and Rooty Hill Rd North to the east. Landcom named the development, at this point still officially recognised as Plumpton, \\"The Oaks Estate\\", in honour of a historical residence retained by Landcom on Hyatts Road. Landcom constructed an Exhibition Village at Bancroft Street and Darkon Place, where prospective buyers could view a selection of homes prior to purchase and construction. An Information Centre was located at the entrance of the Village, and both were featured in an official Landcom television advertisement starring Australian television personalities Julie McGregor and Dave Gibson.Landcom commercial (w Dave Gibson & Julie McGregor) (1980s) Youtube The majority of \\"The Oaks Estate\\" had been completed by 1985, and the NSW Geographical Name Board moved quickly to officially name the suburb \\"Hassall\\", in honour of Reverend Thomas Hassall who established Western Sydney's first Sunday School. However, the name was a source of contention amongst local residents, who cited ridicule and irrelevance to the area as justification for a name change.A suburb changes its name without any hassle Sydney Morning Herald 8 July 1986 It was assumed the official suburb name would be reflective of Landcom's estate name, \\"The Oaks\\", and in their first act as a community, residents successfully lobbied the Board to have the name changed to \\"Oakhurst\\". Residents to the west of Daniels Rd who were also part of Landcom's Oaks Estate, were left disappointed when their section of the development was incorporated into Hebersham, a neighbouring public housing community, rather than Oakhurst.We're not snobs, say residents who oppose name-change Sydney Morning Herald 11 July 1986 Transport and housing By 1991, construction of a new estate to the north of Oakhurst, known as Hassall Grove, had commenced. However, developers and the community alike agreed that Cook Rd was insufficient to handle the increased traffic volume another suburb would bring. As such, Luxford Road was extended in a south-easterly direction and joined with an upgraded portion of Cook Road to become the area's new thoroughfare. Developers agreed the new road would form a more suitable boundary between Oakhurst and the new development. Consequently, the small portion of houses that had already been constructed, or were in the process of construction, along Southee Circuit, Bancroft Street, Westcott Place, Ophelia Place, Rotuma Street, Appletree Grove and Dimascio Place, were officially severed from Hassall Grove and absorbed into Oakhurst. Major portions of Cook Rd that were not utilised in the Luxford Rd extension, were either closed to traffic, or rejuvenated with lawns and children's play equipment. Commercial area Oakhurst's local shopping centre is Plumpton Marketplace, home to major retailers and corporations including Woolworths, BigW, the Commonwealth Bank and Flight Centre. Hassall Grove Plaza, on the other hand, provides residents with a local green grocer, bakery, hair salons and take-away shops.

It was developed by J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves at SRI International. The full name of the algorithm is DUAL finite-state machine (DUAL FSM). EIGRP is responsible for the routing within an autonomous system, and DUAL responds to changes in the routing topology and dynamically adjusts the routing tables of the router automatically. EIGRP uses a feasibility condition to ensure that only loop-free routes are ever selected. The feasibility condition is conservative: when the condition is true, no loops can occur, but the condition might under some circumstances reject all routes to a destination although some are loop-free. When no feasible route to a destination is available, the DUAL algorithm J.J. Garcia-Lunes-Aceves, \\"Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing Computations\\" IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, vol. 1, no, 1, pp. 130‚Äì141 Feb. 1993 invokes a diffusing computation E. W. Dijkstra and C. S. Scholten. ‚ÄúTermination detection for diffusing computations,‚Äù Inform. Process. Lett., vol. 11, no, 1, pp. 1‚Äì4, Aug. 1980 and EWD687a to ensure that all traces of the problematic route are eliminated from the network. At which point the normal Bellman‚ÄìFord algorithm is used to recover a new route. Operation DUAL uses three separate tables for the route calculation. These tables are created using information exchanged between the EIGRP routers. The information is different than that exchanged by link-state routing protocols. In EIGRP, the information exchanged includes the routes, the \\"metric\\" or cost of each route, and the information required to form a neighbor relationship (such as AS number, timers, and K values). The three tables and their functions in detail are as follows: * Neighbor table contains information on all other directly connected routers. A separate table exists for each supported protocol (IP, IPX, etc.). Each entry corresponds to a neighbour with the description of network interface and address. In addition, a timer is initialized to trigger the periodic detection of whether the connection is alive. This is achieved through \\"Hello\\" packets. If a \\"Hello\\" packet is not received from a neighbor for a specified time period, the router is assumed down and removed from the neighbor table. * Topology table contains the metric (cost information) of all routes to any destination within the autonomous system. This information is received from neighboring routers contained in the Neighbor table. The primary (successor) and secondary (feasible successor) routes to a destination will be determined with the information in the topology table. Among other things, each entry in the topology table contains the following: :\\"FD (Feasible Distance)\\": The calculated metric of a route to a destination within the autonomous system. :\\"RD (Reported Distance)\\": The metric to a destination as advertised by a neighboring router. RD is used to calculate the FD, and to determine if the route meets the \\"feasibility condition\\". :Route Status: A route is marked either \\"active\\" or \\"passive\\". \\"Passive\\" routes are stable and can be used for data transmission. \\"Active\\" routes are being recalculated, and/or not available. * Routing table contains the best route(s) to a destination (in terms of the lowest \\"metric\\"). These routes are the successors from the topology table. DUAL evaluates the data received from other routers in the topology table and calculates the primary (successor) and secondary (feasible successor) routes. The primary path is usually the path with the lowest metric to reach the destination, and the redundant path is the path with the second lowest cost (if it meets the feasibility condition). There may be multiple successors and multiple feasible successors. Both successors and feasible successors are maintained in the topology table, but only the successors are added to the routing table and used to route packets. For a route to become a feasible successor, its RD must be smaller than the FD of the successor. If this feasibility condition is met, there is no way that adding this route to the routing table could cause a loop. If all the successor routes to a destination fail, the feasible successor becomes the successor and is immediately added to the routing table. If there is no feasible successor in the topology table, a query process is initiated to look for a new route. Example Legend: :+ = Router :‚àí or  = Link :(X) = Metric of link A (2) B (1) C \\\\+ - - - - - + - - - - - +   (2)  (3)   \\\\+ - - - - - + D (1) E Now a client on router E wants to talk to a client on router A. That means a route between router A and router E must be available. This route is calculated as follows: The immediate neighbours of router E are router C and router D. DUAL in router E asks for the reported distance (RD) from routers C and D respectively to router A. The following are the results: :Destination: Router A :via D: RD(4) :via C: RD(3) The route via C is therefore in the lowest cost. In the next step, the distance from router E to the neighbours are added to the reported distance to get the feasible distance (FD): :Destination: Router A :via D: RD(4), FD(5) :via C: RD(3), FD(6) DUAL therefore finds that the route via D has the least total cost. Then the route via D will be marked as \\"successor\\", equipped with passive status and registered in the routing table. The route via C is kept as a \\"feasible successor\\", because its RD is less than the FD of the successor: :Destination: Router A :via D: RD(4), FD(5) successor :via C: RD(3), FD(6) feasible successor  References  Category:Routing protocols Category:Routing algorithms Category:SRI International software ","title":"Diffusing update algorithm"},{"id":"2085185","text":"In number theory, Artin's conjecture on primitive roots states that a given integer a that is neither a perfect square nor ‚àí1 is a primitive root modulo infinitely many primes p. The conjecture also ascribes an asymptotic density to these primes. This conjectural density equals Artin's constant or a rational multiple thereof. The conjecture was made by Emil Artin to Helmut Hasse on September 27, 1927, according to the latter's diary. The conjecture is still unresolved as of 2020. In fact, there is no single value of a for which Artin's conjecture is proved. Formulation Let a be an integer that is not a perfect square and not ‚àí1\\\\. Write a = a0b2 with a0 square-free. Denote by S(a) the set of prime numbers p such that a is a primitive root modulo p. Then the conjecture states # S(a) has a positive asymptotic density inside the set of primes. In particular, S(a) is infinite. # Under the conditions that a is not a perfect power and that a0 is not congruent to 1 modulo 4 , this density is independent of a and equals Artin's constant, which can be expressed as an infinite product #: C_{\\\\mathrm{Artin}}=\\\\prod_{p\\\\ \\\\mathrm{prime}} \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p(p-1)}\\\\right) = 0.3739558136\\\\ldots . Similar conjectural product formulas exist for the density when a does not satisfy the above conditions. In these cases, the conjectural density is always a rational multiple of CArtin. Example For example, take a = 2. The conjecture claims that the set of primes p for which 2 is a primitive root has the above density CArtin. The set of such primes is : S(2) = {3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29, 37, 53, 59, 61, 67, 83, 101, 107, 131, 139, 149, 163, 173, 179, 181, 197, 211, 227, 269, 293, 317, 347, 349, 373, 379, 389, 419, 421, 443, 461, 467, 491, ...}. It has 38 elements smaller than 500 and there are 95 primes smaller than 500. The ratio (which conjecturally tends to CArtin) is 38/95 = 2/5 = 0.4. Partial results In 1967, Christopher Hooley published a conditional proof for the conjecture, assuming certain cases of the generalized Riemann hypothesis. Without the generalized Riemann hypothesis, there is no single value of a for which Artin's conjecture is proved. D. R. Heath-Brown proved (Corollary 1) that at least one of 2, 3, or 5 is a primitive root modulo infinitely many primes p. He also proved (Corollary 2) that there are at most two primes for which Artin's conjecture fails.

Individual buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places that lie within the Fairlie‚ÄìPoplar Historic District include the Flatiron Building, Rhodes-Haverty Building, the Empire/C&S; Building, the Healey Building, the Prudential/W.D. Grant Building, the Retail Credit Company Home Office Building, the Elbert P. Tuttle United States Court of Appeals Building. History Fairlie‚ÄìPoplar developed during the late 19th century, when Atlanta emerged as the commercial center of Georgia and the Southeast. At the time, the area was promoted as \\"Atlanta's new modern fireproof business district\\". It constituted a major northward expansion of Atlanta's post-Civil War business district, which was largely concentrated along Peachtree and Alabama Street (now Underground Atlanta) and along Marietta Street. The new business district contained a wide variety of wholesale and retail operations, which marketed a broad spectrum of consumer goods and services. Public agencies and many of Atlanta's business offices were also located there. Building materials included brick, stone, cast iron, wood, pressed metal, glazed terra-cotta, and plate glass. The buildings in the district range in height from two to 16 stories, the taller ones constructed with concrete or steel frames, while the smaller buildings were built with load-bearing masonry and timber structural systems. Georgia State University A few of the buildings that make up the Georgia State University campus are woven into the Fairlie‚ÄìPoplar district. The first building that was acquired in Fairlie‚ÄìPoplar was the former C&S; Bank Building on Marietta Street in 1993, which became the J. Mack Robinson College of Business Administration Building. The Rialto Center for the Arts and the Haas-Howell Building followed in 1996 on the corner of Forsyth St. and Luckie St. The Helen M. Aderhold Learning Center is also located on Luckie Street and is one of the most modern lecture buildings on the campus. The Aderhold Center also provides retail and restaurant space on the street level surrounding it, causing it to further blend into the district. The Georgia State University School of Music occupies the Standard Building on the corner of Fairlie St. and Luckie St., as well as the Haas-Howell Building on Poplar St. References External links * Atlanta, Georgia, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) Atlanta Category:Neighborhoods in Atlanta Category:National Register of Historic Places in Atlanta ","title":"Fairlie‚ÄìPoplar, Atlanta"},{"id":"2085189","text":"Keira High School (abbreviated as KHS) is a government-funded co-educational comprehensive secondary day school, located in Lysaght Street, , in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia.

His novel A Disaffection was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction in 1989. Kelman won the 1994 Booker Prize with How Late It Was, How Late. In 1998 Kelman was awarded the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award. His 2008 novel Kieron Smith, Boy won both of Scotland's principal literary awards: the Saltire Society's Book of the Year and the Scottish Arts Council Book of the Year.  Life and work  Born in Glasgow, Kelman says: > My own background is as normal or abnormal as anyone else's. Born and bred > in Govan and Drumchapel, inner city tenement to the housing scheme homeland > on the outer reaches of the city. Four brothers, my mother a full time > parent, my father in the picture framemaking and gilding trade, trying to > operate a one man business and I left school at 15 etc. etc. (...) For one > reason or another, by the age of 21/22 I decided to write stories. The > stories I wanted to write would derive from my own background, my own socio- > cultural experience. I wanted to write as one of my own people, I wanted to > write and remain a member of my own community. During the 1970s he published a first collection of short stories. He became involved in Philip Hobsbaum's creative writing group in Glasgow along with Tom Leonard, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Aonghas MacNeacail and Jeff Torrington and his short stories began to appear in magazines. These stories introduced a distinctive style, expressing first person internal monologues in a pared-down prose using Glaswegian speech patterns, though avoiding for the most part the quasi-phonetic rendition of Tom Leonard. Kelman's developing style has been influential on the succeeding generation of Scottish novelists, including Irvine Welsh, Alan Warner and Janice Galloway. In 1998, Kelman received the Stakis Prize for \\"Scottish Writer of the Year\\" for his collection of short stories The Good Times. In 2019, James Kelman's official website was launched, JamesKelman.Net, which is accessible via:  Critical reception  Kelman's Booker Prize win was, at the time, controversial due to what some saw as the book's casual use of bad language: one of the judges, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, denounced the awarding of the prize to Kelman's book as \\"a disgrace\\". Kelman has since said that his Booker Prize win, specifically the negative publicity and attacks made as a result, made publishers more reluctant to handle his work.article6036703.ece The debate surrounding the use of this \\"offensive\\" language has been picked up by Kelman himself, who argues that the \\"Standard English\\" of traditional English novels is unrealistic. In his essay \\"The Importance of Glasgow in my Work\\", he compares the presentation of working class and Scottish characters with those of the traditional \\"upper class\\" English protagonist:  Political views and activism  Kelman's work has been described as flowing \\"not only from being an engaged writer, but a cultural and political activist\\". At the time of Glasgow's Year as City of Culture he was prominent in the Workers' City group, critical of the celebrations. The name was chosen as to draw attention to the renaming of part of the city centre as the Merchant City, which they described as promoting the \\"fallacy that Glasgow somehow exists because of (...) 18th century entrepreneurs and far-sighted politicians. (The merchants) were men who trafficked in degradation, causing untold misery, death and starvation to thousands\\" The Workers' City group campaigned against what was seen as the victimisation of People's Palace curator Elspeth King and a Council attempt to sell off one third of Glasgow Green. Their activities drew the ire of Labour Party councillors and commentators, with Kelman, and his colleagues Hugh Savage and Farquhar McLay, being described as \\"an 'embarrassment' to the city's 'cultural workforce'\\". Kelman was involved in the Edinburgh Unemployed Workers Centre, giving a speech at its opening, and has expressed support for the Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh (ACE), its successor organisation. Kelman has been a prominent campaigner, notably in issues of social justice and traditional left-wing causes, although he is resolutely not a party man, and remains at his heart a libertarian socialist anarchist, saying \\"the parliamentary opposition parties are essential to the political apparatus of this country which is designed to arrest justice\\". He lives in Glasgow with his wife and children, though has also lived in London, Manchester, the Channel Islands, Australia and America. In his introduction to Born up a Close: Memoirs of a Brigton Boy (2006), an edition of Glaswegian political campaigner Hugh Savage's writings, Kelman sums up his understanding of the history of national and class conflict as follows: > In an occupied country indigenous history can only be radical. It is a class > issue. The intellectual life of working class people is ‚Äòoccupied‚Äô. In a > colonised country intellectual occupation takes place throughout society. > The closer to the ruling class we get the less difference there exists in > language and culture, until finally we find that questions fundamental to > society at its widest level are settled by members of the same closely knit > circle, occasionally even the same family or ‚Äòbloodline‚Äô. And the outcome of > that can be war, the slaughter of working class people. Despite reservations about nationalism, Kelman has voiced his support for Scottish independence, stating \\"Any form of nationalism is dangerous, and should be treated with caution. I cannot accept nationalism and I am not a Scottish Nationalist. But once that is said, I favour a Yes or No decision on independence and I shall vote Yes to independence.\\" In 2012 a film was made based on the short story \\"Greyhound For Breakfast\\". He has voiced criticism of Scottish arts funding council Creative Scotland.

It has been known by several different names, but from 1874 to 1967 it was Sidmouth Junction while it was the junction for branch lines to and through to . History Local railway lines The station was designed by William Tite and was opened by the LSWR on 19 July 1860, along with its Exeter Extension from to Exeter Queen Street. It was named \\"Feniton\\" after the nearest village, but less than a year later it was renamed (on 1 July 1861) as \\"Ottery and Sidmouth Road\\". In February 1868 this was changed again to \\"Feniton for Ottery St Mary\\". On 6 July 1874 a branch line to was opened and the station changed its name once more to become \\"Sidmouth Junction\\", a name that it managed to retain for more than 90 years. On 1 May 1897 a new line to was opened and this was extended on 1 June 1903 to . Although the junction for this line was at , Sidmouth Junction was the de facto junction as it was situated on the London main line. A third platform was provided to accommodate branch line trains; this was a terminal bay at the Yeovil end of the westbound platform. It was on this platform that the main two-storey building was situated. A goods yard and goods shed was provided adjacent to the bay platform. This was closed on 6 September 1965. The following year saw the withdrawal of local stopping trains on the main line, but Sidmouth Junction remained open until 6 March 1967 when passenger services were withdrawn from the branch lines. The station was however reopened by British Rail on 5 May 1971 as a result of local campaigning by the residents of the expanding village, assuming the original \\"Feniton\\" name. A ticket office was erected in 1974 as the original building had been demolished while the station was closed. The platform was rebuilt and lengthened in 1992 but is still shorter than many of the trains that call. Signalling The station was built next to the level crossing of the Ottery Road which was operated by the station staff. A signal box was provided in 1875 at the east end of the station on the north side of the line, opposite goods yard. Because it was too far from the level crossing a small signal box was provided at that end of the station to control the level crossing. The main signal box was closed on 21 May 1967 but the level crossing box was retained. The line through the station reduced to just a single track on 11 June 1967. In 1974 the level crossing gates were replaced by lifting barriers; the level crossing box was abolished at the same time and the barriers were operated from a panel within the station building until March 2012 when signalling and level crossing control was transferred to Basingstoke Area Signalling Centre. Description The platform is on the south side of the line, east of the level crossing of Ottery Road. It is only long enough for 3 car trains so only the doors on the front unit are opened if the train is longer. The disused eastbound platform still stands but the goods yard site is now occupied by houses. Services South Western Railway operate at least a service every two hours between London Waterloo and Exeter St Davids. Due to the short platform at this station, passengers wishing to alight need to be in the front 3 coaches of the train as the platform can only take 3-car trains.

It was a limited release by Bang Bang Recordings ‚Äì a label created by the band for the sole purpose of releasing the single. The name, Bang Bang, was mooted as a replacement band name, on the basis that the name Arctic Monkeys sounded \\"silly\\". Only 1500 CDs and 1500 vinyl copies were made available, meaning the single is now rare and increasingly sought after by fans of the band. Both tracks were re-recorded and included on the band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006). Track listing Bang Bang Recordings Limited The record label Bang Bang Recordings Limited was originally established on 31 May 2005 and the purposed registration office was located at 1 Conduit Street in London. The official director as well as the secretary of the company resigned the day after on 1 June 2005. Arctic Monkeys signed a contract with the record label Domino Records later that month.

He was born, and died, in Regensburg. Herrich-Sch√§ffer studied and collected particularly butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). He was chairman of the Regensburg Botanical Society () from 1861 to 1871,Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft: Geschichte and was awarded an honorary citizenship of Regensburg in 1871. He wrote Systematische Bearbeitung der Schmetterlinge von Europa between 1843 and 1856, one of the most influential works on the higher classification of Lepidoptera of the 19th century. Many of the lepidopteran higher taxa recognized today were defined in this work for the first time. He based his classification mostly on wing venation. Parts of his collection went to Otto Staudinger at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin and M. J. Bastelberg at the Zoologische Staatssammlung M√ºnchen. Many Microlepidoptera in his collection were given to Ottmar Hofmann (1835‚Äì1900) at the Natural History Museum in London.

Acetylene gas lamps were used to illuminate buildings, as lighthouse beacons, and as headlights on motor-cars and bicycles. Portable acetylene gas lamps, worn on the hat or carried by hand, were widely used in mining in the early twentieth century. They are still employed by cavers, hunters, and cataphiles. Small carbide lamps called \\"carbide candles\\" or \\"smokers\\" are used for blackening rifle sights to reduce glare. They are used because of the sooty flame produced by acetylene. Mechanism A French manufactured acetylene gas lamp, of circa 1910, mounted on a bicycle Carbide lamp in a coal mine A mining or caving lamp has calcium carbide placed in a lower chamber, the generator. The upper reservoir is then filled with water. A threaded valve or other mechanism is used to control the rate at which the water is allowed to drip into the chamber containing the calcium carbide. By controlling the rate of water flow, the production of acetylene gas is controlled. This, in turn, controls the flow rate of the gas and the size of the flame at the burner, and thus the amount of light it produces. This type of lamp generally has a reflector behind the flame to help project the light forward. An acetylene gas powered lamp produces a bright, broad light. Many cavers prefer this type of unfocused light as it improves peripheral vision in the complete dark. The reaction of carbide with water is exothermic and produces a fair amount of heat independent of the flame. In cold caves, carbide lamp users can use this heat to help stave off hypothermia.Matthews, C. E. (1996). An illuminating reaction. The Science Teacher, 63(5), 30. = Chemical reactions = Acetylene is produced by the reaction: : CaC2(s) \\\\+ 2H2O(l) ‚Üí C2H2(g) \\\\+ Ca(OH)2(aq) The acetylene combusts easily in the atmosphere: : 2C2H2 \\\\+ 5O2 ‚Üí 4CO2 \\\\+ 2H2O + ŒîH = ‚àí1300kJ/mol When all of the carbide in a lamp has been reacted, the carbide chamber contains a wet paste of slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) which can be used to make a cement. This is emptied into a waste bag and the chamber can be refilled. History A carbide lamp from 1900s at the Railway Museum in Fl√•m, Norway In 1892, Thomas Willson discovered an economically efficient process for creating calcium carbide in an electric arc furnace from a mixture of lime and coke. The arc furnace provides the high temperature required to drive the reaction. Manufacture of calcium carbide was an important part of the industrial revolution in chemistry, and was made possible in the US as a result of massive amounts of inexpensive hydroelectric power produced at Niagara Falls before the turn of the twentieth century. In 1895, Willson sold his patent to Union Carbide. Domestic lighting with acetylene gas was introduced circa 1894 and bicycle lamps from 1896. In France, Gustave Trouv√©, a Parisian electrical engineer, also made domestic acetylene lamps and gasometers. The first carbide bicycle lamp developed in the United States was patented in New York on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin. Another early lamp design is shown in a patent from Duluth, Minnesota on October 21, 1902. In the early 1900s, Gustaf Dal√©n invented the Dal√©n light. This combined two of Dal√©n's previous inventions: the substrate Agamassan and the Sun valve. Inventions and improvements to carbide lamps continued for decades. For example on March 10, 1925 Andrew Prader of Spokane, Washington was granted After carbide lamp open flames were implicated in an Illinois coal-seam methane gas explosion that killed 54 miners, the 1932 Moweaqua Coal Mine disaster,Fifty-First Annual Coal Report of Illinois, 1932, Department of Mines and Minerals. Journal Printing Co.: Springfield, ILL., 1933 carbide lamp use declined in United States coal mines. They continued to be used in the coal pits of other countries, notably USSR. In the birth of the cinema of Iquitos, a carbide lamp was used as light support to project the first film in the Casa de Fierro, in 1900. Lighting systems  Advertisement for home acetylene gas lighting, 1922 Carbide lighting was used in rural and urban areas of the United States which were not served by electrification. Its use began shortly after 1900 and continued past 1950. Calcium carbide pellets were placed in a container outside the home, with water piped to the container and allowed to drip on the pellets releasing acetylene. This gas was piped to lighting fixtures inside the house, where it was burned, creating a very bright flame. Carbide lighting was inexpensive but was prone to gas leaks and explosions. Early models of the automobile, motorbike and bicycle used carbide lamps as headlamps. Acetylene gas, derived from carbide, enabled early automobiles to drive safely at night. Thick concave mirrors combined with magnifying lenses projected the acetylene flame light. These type of lights were used until reliable batteries and dynamos became available, and manufacturers switched to electric lights. Acetylene lamps were also used on riverboats for night navigation. The National Museum of Australia has a lamp made in about 1910 that was used on board , a paddle steamer which has been restored to working order and also in the museum's collection.Paddle Steamer Enterprise, National Museum of Australia They are also used for night hunting. Use in caving While LED electric lights have mostly replaced carbide lamps, some still prefer the \\"old-school\\" approach of using carbide lamps during recreational caving excursions. Early caving enthusiasts, not yet having the advantage of light-weight electrical illumination, introduced the carbide lamp to their hobby.Caving equipment and culture (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand) While increasingly replaced by more modern choices, a substantial percentage of cavers still use this method. In cave surveys, carbide lamps are favoured for the lead or \\"point\\" surveyor, who must identify suitable points in the cave to designate as survey stations. The sooty carbide flame may be used to mark cave walls with a station label. Especially favoured for this purpose are all-brass lamps or lamps made with no ferromagnetic metals, as these lamps do not deflect the needles of a magnetic compass, which is typically read while brightly illuminated from above using the caver's lamp. Apart from their use as cave surveying tools, many cavers favour carbide lamps for their durability and quality of illumination. They were once favoured for their relative illumination per mass of fuel compared to battery powered devices. Before the advent of high-intensity LED illumination with lithium ion batteries, carbide also had two important advantages over the alternative of miners electric lamps. Miners lamps were intended to last for the duration of a standard working shift, whilst major caving explorations could be much longer, so the carbide could be replenished during the trip. Expeditions involving camping over several days in remote regions might not have access to electricity for recharging. Lamps used in such circumstances would consist of a belt mounted gas generator linked by flexible pipe to a headset. The acetylene producing reaction is exothermic, which means that the lamp's reactor vessel will become quite warm to the touch; this can be used to warm the hands. The heat from the flame can also be used to warm the body by allowing the exhaust gases to flow under a shirt or poncho pulled out from the body, a technique discovered almost immediately by cold miners, and nicknamed by cavers the \\"Palmer furnace\\".

In a few cases the sanjak-bey was himself directly answerable to Istanbul. Like other early Ottoman administrative offices, the sanjak-bey had a military origin: the term sanjak (and liva) means \\"flag\\" or \\"standard\\" and denoted the insigne around which, in times of war, the cavalrymen holding fiefs (timars or ziamets) in the specific district gathered. The sanjakbey was in turn subordinate to a beylerbey (\\"Bey of Beys\\") who governed an eyalet and commanded his subordinate sanjak-beys in war. In this way, the structure of command on the battlefield resembled the hierarchy of provincial government. The office of sanjak-bey resembled that of the beylerbey on a more modest scale. Like the beylerbey, the sanjak-bey drew his income from a prebend, which consisted usually of revenues from the towns, quays and ports within the boundary of his sanjak. Within his own sanjak, a governor was responsible above all for maintaining order and, with the cooperation of the fief holders, arresting and punishing wrongdoers. For this, he usually received half of the fines imposed on miscreants, with the fief holder on whose lands the misdeed took place, receiving the other half. Sanjak governors also had other duties, for example, the pursuit of bandits, the investigation of heretics, the provision of supplies for the army, or the despatch of materials for shipbuilding, as the sultan commanded.

A Great Britain and England international, he played for the Leeds Rhinos (with whom he won the 1999 Challenge Cup), Sydney Roosters (winning the 2002 NRL Premiership and 2003 World Club Challenge), Bradford Bulls (winning Super League X in 2005), Warrington Wolves (winning the 2009, 2010 and 2012 Challenge Cups) and the Salford Red Devils. With a reputation as a tough, uncompromising competitor, Morley was the first British player to win both NRL and Super League championships. Background Morley was born in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. Playing career =Leeds= He played for Leeds between 1995 and 2000. He made his England and Great Britain d√©buts in 1996. In the 1997 post-season, Morley was selected to play for Great Britain in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Australia. Morley played for Leeds as a in their 1998 Super League Grand Final loss to Wigan. He won the Challenge Cup with Leeds in 1999 when they defeated London Broncos 52‚Äì16 at Wembley. He was offered a chance to play alongside his brother Chris Morley, who played for Wales, but chose to commit to England in the 2000 World Cup. In July 2000, Morley agreed to join Australian side Sydney Roosters in the National Rugby League at the end of the season, who were being coached by former Leeds boss Graham Murray. =Sydney= The 2000 NRL season was Morley's first at the Roosters. After taking twelve months to fully acclimatise, the tough forward became a central figure in the club's twelfth Premiership ‚Äì their first in 27 years ‚Äì playing as a in the 2002 NRL Grand Final, a 30‚Äì8 victory over the New Zealand Warriors at Telstra Stadium. Having won the 2002 NRL Premiership, the Roosters travelled to England to play the 2003 World Club Challenge against Super League champions, St. Helens. Morley played and scored a try in the Roosters' victory. Later that year Morley played in the for the Roosters in the 2003 NRL Grand Final which was lost to Penrith Panthers. Morley played for the Roosters as a in their 2004 NRL Grand Final loss to cross-Sydney rivals, the Bulldogs. Morley was then selected in the Great Britain team to compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played as a in the Lions' 44‚Äì4 loss. Morley playing for England in 2008 In a round 20 match towards the end of his final season (2006) with the Roosters, Morley was sent off after attempting to knee Bulldogs player Corey Hughes in the face as the player attempted to play the ball. Afterwards he was suspended by the NRL Judiciary, and the Roosters released him from his contract. He returned to the UK before the season's end. Morley had helped the Roosters to a World Club Challenge title as well as two further Grand Final appearances before joining English club Warrington. He is one of only eight Englishmen to have played in NRL Grand Final-winning teams. Morley is the only player to win Great Britain caps whilst at the Roosters, although Phil Clarke had won England caps whilst at the club. =Bradford= In 2005 Morley became the first Englishman to have won Premierships in the NRL and Super League and the Rugby League Challenge Cup. In late 2005, although still contracted to Roosters; Morley joined Bradford Bulls towards the end of the season and helped them to claim the Super League championship against his old team Leeds. He played for the Bradford Bulls from the interchange bench in their 2005 Super League Grand Final victory against the Rhinos. His stay at Bradford was short as he joined Warrington the next season. Morley playing for Warrington in 2007 =Warrington= Morley signed a 4-year deal with Warrington, beginning in 2006. He captained the Great Britain test side that faced France in 2007. He was also appointed captain of Warrington. It was while playing for Warrington that he made his 400th competitive senior appearance. Morley was named in the 24-man England squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and also played against Wales at the Keepmoat Stadium, Doncaster prior to England's departure. In Group A's first match against Papua New Guinea he played from the interchange bench in England's victory. Morley guided Warrington to Challenge Cup glory in 2009, beating Huddersfield in the final at Wembley. He was selected to play for England against France in the one-off test in 2010. Morley captained Warrington in the 2010 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. Morley was to lead England in the 2010 Four Nations but was ruled out after injuring himself in a warm up match against the New Zealand MƒÅori rugby league team. Morley played for England in the 2011 Four Nations. England made the tournament's final and in the final, Morley made his 50th international appearance. He played in the 2012 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. He played in the 2012 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford. Morley's autobiography, \\"Moz\\", was released on 12 November 2012 and reprinted twice in the run up to Christmas 2012. He played in the 2013 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Wigan Warriors at Old Trafford. =Salford= Morley signed a one-year deal for his hometown club Salford for the 2014 season, aiming to finish his career with his hometown club. The 36-year-old forward was appointed the Salford Red Devils' captain at the start of the 2014 season. On 10 September 2015, Adrian announced that he would retire from playing rugby league at the end of the 2015 season.

The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 census was 717. History The name means Ulla's nook, the Old English word hahl, meaning a nook or corner of land, suggesting the hollow in which the village is situated, being compounded with a personal name of Scandinavian origin.Place Names in the Landscape, Margaret Gelling, 1984 The manor is recorded in the Domesday Book where it is listed as Holehale, one of the lands of Robert de Stafford. \\"In Ferncombe Hundred in Holehale (Ullenhall) 1 hide. Land for 15 ploughs. 17 villagers and 11 smallholders with 6 ploughs. Woodland ¬Ω league long and 1 furlong wide.

His lands extended beyond those at Ullenhall, but, following the Conquest, Ullenhall was bestowed by the conqueror on Robert de Stafford, descended from the de Tonei family and who had fought stoutly with Duke William against King Harold. He made Stafford his principal seat, where he had a strong castle and assumed his surname from thence.William Dugdale, The Antiquities of Warwickshire, 1656 Ullenhall stands on lands that were originally part of the Barrells Hall estate. The earliest mention of Barrells was a reference to a Richard Barel in 1405. In 1554 the estate was purchased by Robert Knight of Beoley, 4 miles west of Ullenhall, and remained in the Knight family until 1856. An inventory taken in 1652 shows that it was then an ordinary farmhouse, and a member of the Knight family appeared in the 1682 Heralds' Visitation of Warwick. The future 1st Earl, Robert Knight, Lord Luxborough, purchased Barrells from a cousin in 1730. When Henrietta St John was banished to Barrells in 1736 it was still a relatively simple house, in very poor condition. When his son married in 1750 he commissioned the Italian architect Joseph Bonomi the Elder to build an imposing extension, which thereafter became the main house.\\"Drawn to Entice\\" by Peter Meadows. Country Life Magazine 28 April 1988 On Henrietta's death in 1756 her husband rebuilt large parts of it. His wife Henrietta, Lady Luxborough, made the house the hub of a literary circle after her husband banished her to Barrells following a romantic indiscretion. She was one of the first to establish a ferme orn√©e and is credited with the invention of the word \\"shrubbery\\". She was a prominent member of the Warwickshire Coterie, a group of poet friends including the poet William Shenstone,Friendship with Shenstone stated on National Portrait gallery biog. of Lady Luxborough who had developed his own ferme orn√©e at The Leasowes in Halesowen, Shropshire. The family crest was a winged spur which gives its name to the village pub to this day. The Newtons owned the house after the Knights and extended it dramatically. However, the house was very seriously damaged by fire in 1933 and lay derelict until 2005 when it was restored as a family home. Despite its ancient roots, Ullenhall was not established as a separate Ecclesiastical Parish until June 1861 when the old manors of Apsley, Forde Hall and Mockley were also included in the parish.  Governance  Ullenhall is part of the Tanworth ward of Stratford on Avon District Council and represented by Councillors Peter Oakley and George Atkinson, Conservative. Nationally it is part of Stratford-on-Avon (UK Parliament constituency), whose current Member of Parliament is Nadhim Zahawi of the Conservative Party. It was included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament. Geography The soil is clay, gravel, and marl and the subsoil keuper marl.

Notable buildings The Old Chapel, Ullenhall, Warwickshire The village has two churches. Situated on a hill to the north of the village is the old parish church of St Marys which is locally referred to as the Chapel. The oldest part of the building has been dated back to the 13th century but only the chancel of the original building now remains, to which a western porch has been added. There remain some ancient stained glass in the windows and some encaustic tiles in the floor.Old Warwickshire Churches, W Hobart Bird 1936 The font, of the 15th century, has an octagonal bowl with a moulded lower edge, and a plain stem. In the bowl one of the two staples remains. The memorials are to the knights of Barrells Hall and a coloured memorial to Sir Francis Throkmorton who died in 1554. The roof and bell tower were still under restoration at the turn of the 2000 millennium but at a service attended by 80 parishioners on the morning of 1 January 2000 the old bell was made to \\"ring in\\" the 21st Century by throwing Golf balls into the bell tower.Recorded in a history of the chapel displayed inside The balls were recovered some years later when the restoration was completed. The modern church of St Mary is down in the village and was constructed in 1875 at a cost of ¬£5,000 to an odd idiosyncratic design by John Pollard Seddon in the Early English styleNikolaus Pevsner and Alexandra Wedgwood, The Buildings of England, Warwickshire, 1966, by the three Newton brothers of Barrells Hall and Glencripesdale Estate in memory of their parents William & Mary Newton. A significant local landmark is The Crowley Oak which can be located just outside the village heading towards the A435. It has ancient oak status according to the Woodland Trust and with a girth of over seven metres, it certainly makes an impressive sight at the roadside.Woodland Trust website Economy The village is served by a public house, the Winged Spur, which takes its name from the Barrell family crest. There is a village hall and a tennis club, and plans for a Amazon distribution centre in the parish.

It is produced specifically by the ABC News and Current Affairs Department. The program first aired on the 29 May 1996, and since then it has continued to profile various Australian people, typically ones with a diverse background or notable reputation. Australian Story tends to explore themes such as ‚Äòheroic achievement‚Äô, ‚Äòtaking a stand‚Äô and ‚Äòhuman weakness‚Äô. The episodes are known to frame people or situations in a sympathetic light. This personal approach to story-telling has been well received by many, with the program winning many awards including multiple Walkley Awards for excellence in journalism and four consecutive Logie Awards (2003-2006). As of 2013, it attracted an average audience of more than one million viewers each week, making it one of the most popular programs on ABC Television.  Format  Australian Story is a weekly half hour program which airs on Monday‚Äôs at 8:00pm (AEST). The program is categorised as a documentary style current affairs program. This hybrid categorisation is a result of the program‚Äôs decision to present newsworthy stories without the presence of an onscreen reporter. Instead, the program aims to have subjects tell their own stories in their own words. Each week the program presents a story relating to a notable Australian figure. These are referred to as profiles and they convey subjective experiences. Profiles account for both Australian celebrities and lesser known more ordinary Australians. The program has an intimate approach to storytelling. The subjects are filmed in relevant environments such as their respective home or workplace. Profiles also include footage of and confessionals made by relevant family and friends. Each profile on average, is filmed over a period of 10-12 days, and each episode has an eight-week turnaround.  Broadcast History  In 1996 the ABC restructured its current affairs program The 7:30 Report, turning separate state editions into one centralised national program. As a result, The 7:30 Report had less scope for localised, human interest stories. ABC in Brisbane established Australian Story as a result of the restructuring, and they were given a remit for rural coverage. The program began screening on the 29th of May 1996. Australian Story was initially supposed to be a series of small magazine-style stories. It quickly started focusing on one single story for each episode, this is the format it still uses today. Given it was shot predominantly outside of a studio and always without the presence of a reporter, Australian Story was originally considered to be a novelty current affairs program. Other unconventional elements included their camera work and pacing which were considered to be slow and cinematic. These characteristics of the show contribute to its classification as a documentary. In 2016 Australian Story celebrated its 20th anniversary and broadcast a two-part special. The special acknowledged many notable stories covered since the program's inception, such as Hazel Hawke's Alzheimer's diagnosis, Australian actress Jacki Weaver's bought with alcoholism and Gail Shann's life in rural Queensland after losing her arms. The special revealed that over the span of 20 years Australian Story had covered over 800 stories. Caroline Jones was previously the program's presenter and would introduce the subject at the beginning of an episode. Occasionally a high-profile person would fill this role, such one off presenters included the likes of Matt Damon, Elton John and Dawn Fraser. Jones announced she was leaving Australian Story at the end of 2016. As a result of her departure, it was decided that episodes would no longer be introduced by a presenter. Episodes of Australian Story have always aired on a Monday night at 8:00pm (AEST) on ABC TV. They are now also posted weekly to Youtube. In addition to this, episodes are made available via the Australian Story webpage and ABC iview.  Ratings  { ! Year !!

The program is classified by the ABC as a News and Current Affairs Program as well as a documentary series. Australian Story‚Äôs status as a documentary program though has been contested by Australian documentary filmmakers. This is because the program is a serial production made for a television network and from a formal broadcasting location. The program's status as a News and Current Affairs Program has also been questioned by academics who claim Australian Story exhibits a soft journalistic approach. Such critiques suggest the program has become a platform for people with high-profile stories who want to manage their image and the publicity surrounding it. = \\"The Road to Kerobokan\\" = Australian Story aired an episode on January 13th of 2006 entitled ‚ÄòThe Road to Kerobokan‚Äô. It detailed the story of Scott Rush, a 20-year-old Australian male who was on trial in Bali, Indonesia for his part in a heroin smuggling attempt. The episode aired only hours after Rush received a life sentence. Producers Helen Grasswill and Ruth Dexter chose not to disclose Rush‚Äôs previous criminal misdemeanours in the episode per legal advice. This was because such information could damage Rush‚Äôs appeal process. The episode still acknowledged that Rush had previous misdemeanours but did not detail them. The following morning on the 14th of February, the day after the Australian Story episode aired, the Queensland Courier-Mail published a front-page story with the headline ‚ÄòMule had history of crime‚Äô. This article exposed in more detail Rush‚Äôs prior drug offences. In response, an episode of ABC‚Äôs program Media Watch exposed that a negative sentiment was shared among many Australian Story viewers because the program had chosen not to disclose such information. As reported by Media Watch, Paul Toohey of Australian Magazine The Bulletin said ‚Äòwhatever that Australian Story was, it was not journalism‚Äô. Such backlash has contributed to the idea that Australian Story is too soft on its subjects. = \\"Something in the Water\\" = In 2010, Australian Story aired a two-part profile entitled \\"Something in the Water\\", broadcast on the 15th and 22nd of February. The profile was on Alison Bleaney, a doctor and member of local council in the Tasmanian town of St Helens. Bleaney raised concerns about links between forest industry practices and the supposed presence of toxins in Tasmanian waterways. The episodes aired during the Tasmanian State election campaign, and garnered political attention. Accusations arose after the episodes aired, that they had been deliberately broadcast during the 2010 Tasmanian State Election campaign, in order to influence the result. Deborah Fleming who was Australian Story‚Äôs executive producer at the time responded to such criticism by saying that the program had sought only to report concerns rather than facts. Although past public surveys have revealed that Australians rely on the ABC News and Current Affairs Department as a source of trustworthy political information. It is expected that when this department gives an issue in-depth attention, it will become legitimated and treated as a current affair rather than solely a human interest story. Because of this, \\"Something in the Water\\" came under scrutiny with critics arguing it should have been more scientifically credible.  Notable Profiles  alt= = \\"The Gilded Cage\\" = In 2002, Australian Story aired a profile on the former Australian Governor- General and Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane Dr Peter Hollingworth. The episode was entitled \\"The Gilded Cage\\". This was a notable episode because Australian Story had the exclusive interview with Hollingworth after a major school sex abuse scandal he had inadvertently played a part in. Whilst Hollingworth was Archbishop there were two serial pedophiles active in three Brisbane Anglican schools and the way he handled the situation was widely deemed across Australia as inappropriate. In \\"The Gilded Cage\\" Hollingworth implied that a 14 year old girl was the one to initiate the sexual relationship she had with a Priest. These comments were met with controversy from the Australian public and he eventually resigned from his position as Governor-General over the matter. The candid and confessional nature of the interview served Australian Story's reputation as being a provider of real and personal stories. = \\"Murder He Wrote\\" = \\"Murder He Wrote\\" is a notable Australian Story profile as it was the program's first ever two-part profile, spanning over two episodes. Prior to this profile Australian Story had never dedicated more than one episode to a story. The episodes were broadcast respectively on the 29th of July 2002 and the 5th of August 2002. They detailed the story of John Button, a man from Western Australia who was wrongfully convicted of murder. Button had been convicted of killing his girlfriend Rosemary Anderson, but the case was reopened when he appealed the conviction and attributed her death to the very high-profile serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke. Producer of these episodes, Wendy Page, had researched the case for 6 years before pursuing the story. Herself and Ian Harley won the Walkley Award for 'Current Affairs, Feature, Documentary more than 10 minutes' with this profile. Australian Story interviewed members of the Button, Anderson and Cooke families throughout the appeal process. The profile concluded with Button‚Äôs exoneration, his case was one of the longest-standing convictions to be overturned in Australia's legal history. = \\"Into the Forest\\" = alt= In 2004 on the 1st of November, Australian Story aired the first episode of a two-part profile entitled \\"Into the Forest\\". This two-part profile explores the crimes of infamous Australian serial killer Ivan Milat. In Part 1, Australian Story spoke to Milat's younger brothers Bill and Richard, older brother Boris and sister-in-law Caroline as well as Clive Small who was the NSW Police Superintendent whilst Milat's case was open. According to Screen Australia this episode was the number 1 top rated Australian documentary on television in 2004. Producers Ben Cheshire and John Stewart won the TV Week Logie Award for ‚ÄòMost Outstanding Public Affairs Programme‚Äô for this profile. = \\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\\" = \\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\\" was Australian Story‚Äôs first ever three-part profile with three episodes broadcast in 2006 on the 17th of July, 24th of July and 31st of July. The case generated heated public debate and was of great interest to The Australian public at the time. It followed three men, Fazzari, Pereiras and Martinez who had been convicted for the murder of Phillip Walsham in 1998. The episodes focus heavily on Mirella Scaramella, the girlfriend of Fazzari and her efforts to fight the verdict. A year following this Australian Story profile, the three men were exonerated by the Western Australia Court of Appeal. = \\"Unbreakable\\" = alt= The Australian Story special entitled \\"Unbreakable\\" detailed the experience of competitor Garry Robinson who managed to survive a Black Hawk helicopter crash in Afghanistan in 2010 and went on the compete in the Invictus Games. The episode is notable because it attracted a complete audience of 2 million people. Most episodes generally garner an audience of 1 million people. \\"Unbreakable\\" aired on Monday the 15th of October, 2018. Australian Story spoke exclusively to Prince Harry throughout this episode, as he is the founder of the Invictus Games. He was interviewed from inside Kensington Palace. = \\"A Complicated Life: Kerry Packer\\" = In April 2014, Australian Story broadcast a two-part profile on Australian media mogul Kerry Packer. The profile detailed the life of Kerry Packer who had died in 2005 after a long and highly influential career. Part two of this profile garnered the highest average audience for 2013-14, with 1.6 million viewers. The profile was of great interest to Australians as it included interviews with particularly powerful men such as John Howard, Malcolm Turnbull and Richard Walsh. The profile also included an interview with Jodhi Meares, Packer's former daughter-in-law, who had never before spoken out about her experience being a part of the Packer family.

Inchgarvie or Inch Garvie is a small, uninhabited island in the Firth of Forth. Its name comes from Innis Garbhach which is Scottish Gaelic for \\"rough island\\". On the rocks around the island sit four caissons that make up the foundations of the Forth Bridge. Inchgarvie‚Äôs fortifications pre-date the modern period. In the days when boats were the only way to cross the Firth of Forth, the island was on the main route between North Queensferry in Fife and South Queensferry in Lothian. This made it strategically important. Although now uninhabited, Inchgarvie has been inhabited throughout various periods of history. The first recorded time was in the late 15th century. Like nearby Inchmickery, its profile and colour makes it look like a small warship from a distance. It was armed with coast defence guns from 1901 until 1906, and again from 1908 until the 1930s. History Records of Danish attacks on nearby islands, particularly Inchcolm as well as Fife and Lothian may mean that it was used in some capacity by them. The island was licensed by King James IV to John Dundas of Dundas with the power to build a fort on 20 March 1491. John Dundas did not build the castle, and James IV himself ordered a strong tower to be built in 1513. On 8 March 1514 Margaret, the widow of William Dundas of Dundas, undertook to manage the completion of the fortress that James IV and her father-in-law had begun building on her island.Macleod, Walter, Royal Letters, from the papers of Dundas of Dundas (Edinburgh, 1897), lxxiii, citing Acta Dominorum Concillii, 26, f. 43. From 23 December 1514, Charles Dennison, Captain of Inchgarvie managed and fed a large royal construction team. The master mason was John of Cumbernauld, with his \\"servitor\\" John Strathauchin, who directed eight other masons and ten labourers. Margaret, Lady of Dundas gave them two boats. Two 'serpentine' guns and guns from Colstone were placed on the island after a visit by artillery experts in July 1515, and the island was equipped with a \\"blawing horne.\\" There was also a chapel.Accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1903), 20-26. The Laird of Dundas was paid ¬£33 for repairing thefortress in March 1533.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1531-1538, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 161. The fort was captured by Richard Brooke in the Galley Subtile on 6 May 1544 during an attack on Edinburgh and demolished a week later. The English commander Lord Hertford wrote that it would have been useful to garrison Inchgarvie, but his orders from Henry VIII would not allow it.'Late Expedition in Scotland, 1544', in Tudor Tracts (London, 1903), 44: Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol.19 part 1 (London, 1908), no.472. In 1547, after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, Inchcolm and Inchkeith were fortified by the English, and held for two years; it is possible that Inchgarvie was fortified at this period too. =Prison= Between 1519 and 1671, the castle was used as a prison, and in 1580 Inchkeith and Inchgarvie were made a place of exile for the plague-stricken by order of the Privy Council.Garvie, James, Old and New Edinburgh, (1890), ch.34, p291. On 6 September 1627, the Laird of Dundas was invited to meet the Privy Council at South Queensferry and discuss building a modern fort on the island.Macleod, Walter, Royal Letters, papers of Dundas of Dundas, Edinburgh (1897), no.56. Like Inchkeith, Inchgarvie had a quarantine hospital, and a prison. Oliver Cromwell had this demolished. During the reign of Charles II as King of Scots, the island was subject to continued maintenance for defensive purposes. The island was inspected by Charles in 1651 before falling into disrepair after his army was defeated by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester. In 1707 the island is known to have been rented to Archibald Primrose, 1st Earl of Rosebery. In 1779, however, the island's fortifications were renewed once more, in response to the threat posed by John Paul Jones, American Naval Commander, who harassed British ships from a base in the Forth. These fortifications were never used in anger. During the Napoleonic period, the threat from the sea meant gun batteries were created in 1806. =Forth Bridge= Construction of the Inchgarvie cantilever of the Forth Bridge In 1878 the foundations for Thomas Bouch's Forth Bridge were laid on Inchgarvie (and their bricks remain), but after the Tay Bridge Disaster, these plans were abandoned, and the island languished until the west end of the island was extended with a pier, and used as the foundation for one of the Forth Bridge's cantilevers. The island, due to its proximity to the bridge, was also used as a construction office for the bridge, as well as accommodation for its workers within the re-roofed castle buildings. Some of the stone from the former castle was used to help build the caissons of the Forth Bridge. =Defence operations= The island became of renewed importance to the security of the Firth of Forth at the beginning of the 20th century. It was armed with two 12-pdr guns in 1901, in conjunction with gun emplacements on the mainland to the north (at North Queensferry) and to the south (at Dalmeny). Although the island's guns were removed from the approved armament in 1906, they were re- instated in 1908. The number of guns was increased to four in the early months of the First World War. The island's guns were removed from the approved armament of the Forth in the early 1930s. The guns may have survived for drill and practice until the beginning of the Second World War, during which the island was armed only with machine guns. The island's defences were intended (until 1905) to cover the controlled minefield laid across the river and later to tackle fast-moving torpedo boats attempting to enter the naval anchorage above the Forth Bridge or to damage the lock gates of the Rosyth Dockyard. Geology Inchgarvie is of igneous origin, and partly made up of picrite. Studies of the landscape beneath the waters of the firth have revealed that the visible surface of Inchgarvie is only the top of a larger crag and tail structure similar in structure to Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile created by glacial action.

Overview  In many ways, the 2251s were modernised Dean Goods, sharing the main dimensions, but having more modern features such as taper boilers and full cabs. Increases in both boiler pressure and heating surface gave a useful increase in power at the expense of weight that restricted permitted routes.

Models Bachmann Branchline manufactures models of the 2251 in OO gauge. Mainline (Palitoy) released the first ready-to-run OO model in 1978. The Bachmann model was released in 1996. It is based on the Mainline model with revised body tooling to complement a completely new chassis design that allows the boiler backhead to be modelled. In N gauge, the first model was the langley whitemetal kit, designed to fit the graham farish 94xx/general purpose tank chassis. The next was the Peco (model railroads) ready to run model. This was a big step forward, and was DCC fitted as standard. Production of these stopped around 2010. The next model of the class was made by Union Mills, and was released in 2017.

It is intended to be the first high-end shopping mall in northern Shenzhen. It is expected to open in mid-2013. History The land on which this golf club was built was stolen from the people of Songyuanxia village, Guanlan township. First of all, the villagers were told that there was a government requisition order requiring the villagers to turn their land over to the government for the purpose of creating an orchard. Apparently, the order came from Ye Xuanping, son of Ye Jianying. Then once the land was handed over, somehow it came into the hands of a Thai Chinese. This happened during the time when a blind eye was turned to corruption. Mission Hills Golf Club was established in 1992 and 1993 saw the opening of its public driving range. By February 1994, the People's Government of Shenzhen entered into an agreement with the International Golf Association, announcing that Mission Hills Golf Club would be the host venue for the 1995 World Cup of Golf - the first international golf tournament in China. That year, an estimated 30,000 fans lined the fairways to see the United States team of Fred Couples and Davis Love III win its fourth consecutive World Cup title by 14 strokes over Australia (Brett Ogle and Robert Allenby). Since its inception, Mission Hills Golf Club has hosted over 50 international matches and is regularly visited by dignitaries, royalties, celebrities, world business, and political leaders, and a steady stream of the world's greatest golfers, including Annika Sorenstam, Nick Faldo, Zhang Lianwei, Colin Montgomerie, Retief Goosen and Tiger Woods.

In 2011, it evolved into 7.30, a revamped current affairs program. History The 7.30 Report began on 28 January 1986, screening Tuesday to Friday evenings. The program extended to Mondays the following year. Until the end of 1994 the program had separate editions for each state and territory, presented by Alan Carpenter, Mary Delahunty, Quentin Dempster, Trisha Goddard, Sarah Henderson, Genevieve Hussey, John Jost, Leigh McClusky, Kelly Nestor, and Andrew Olle. Kerry O'Brien took over as the presenter of the national program in 1995, with Maxine McKew serving as the main relief presenter until 2006. O'Brien remained the editor and presenter of the program from the time it went national. He announced in 2010 that he would be leaving at the end of the year. He presented his final edition of the program on 9 December 2010. In February 1996, the Friday episode of the show was replaced with Stateline, a similar show with a separate edition for each state and territory. = 2011 changes = The ABC announced in December 2010 that the program would return in 2011 in a new form, under the name 7.30. The revamped program was first presented by Leigh Sales from Sydney. Chris Uhlmann was 7.30's first political editor and Canberra presenter. The ABC also announced that Stateline would be folded into the 7.30 program. The change saw 7.30 extended to five nights a week, although Friday editions continued to be presented locally and focus on state affairs. Format The program usually comprised several pre-recorded items and live interviews, focusing on issues of national or global significance. The program traditionally featured interviews with politicians. Reporters in its last season included: Tracy Bowden, Matt Peacock, Andy Park, Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop, Dylan Welch, Louise Milligan, Madeleine Morris, Conor Duffy, Sarah Whyte, David Lewis, Monique Schafter, Alex Mann, Michael Atkin(s), and political editor Sabra Lane. Former reporters had included political editor Heather Ewart, Deborah Cornwall, Greg Hoy, Mark Willacy, Michael Brissenden, Murray McLaughlin, Mary Gearin, Mike Sexton, John Taylor, Peter McCutcheon, Paul Lockyer, Lisa Whitehead, Natasha Johnson, David Mark, Genevieve Hussey, Mark Bannerman and Jonathan Harley. Paul Lyneham also hosted The 7.30 Report for several years. Until 2010, satirists John Clarke and Bryan Dawe presented a (usually) weekly mock interview covering a topical issue. Dawe played the interviewer, while Clarke played a prominent public figure but, unusually for satire, he deliberately made no attempt to imitate the appearance, voice, or mannerisms of the person he portrayed. When portraying Julia Gillard he placed a flower pot behind him to give the impression of him being a woman. These interviews were a continuation of the pair's work for A Current Affair, beginning in 1989, for which they won a number of awards.

Traffic on the main street, St John's Road, is often heavy, as it forms part of the A8 main road between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The actual \\"High Street\\" itself is no longer the main street, an anomaly shared with central Edinburgh. Famous residents have included Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, Bible translator Alexander Thomson and Scottish Renaissance author Helen Cruickshank.

Landmarks, attractions, and facilities Edinburgh Zoo Edinburgh Zoo is situated to the south-east of Corstorphine, and is the area's largest and most popular tourist attraction. Corstorphine has one of Scotland's best-preserved late medieval parish churches, Corstorphine Old Parish Church, with a short tower and spire and several well-preserved stone effigies of the local noble family, the Forresters of Corstorphine.

Corstorphine Hill is one of the so-called \\"Seven Hills of Edinburgh\\". Queen Margaret University's main campus was located there from 1970 until 2007, when the university moved to Musselburgh. Etymology The earliest known form of the name is Crostorfin, recorded in 1128. This possibly means 'Torfin's crossing'; in ancient times, much of the land in the area consisted of small lochs and marshes, with Corstorphine situated at an ideal crossing point. The identity of Torfin is not certainly known, but he was likely a local baron who commanded a stronghold by the crossing. The name is a Gaelicised version of the Norse name Thorfinnr, and was popular in Scotland around 1000. A popular legend, now widely discredited, states that a 'cross of fine gold' was presented to the church by a Norman baron, and thus the village came to be known as croix d'or fine. History Corstorphine Old Parish Church Old Corstorphine stood on a piece of dry land, between two lochs, the Gogar Loch and Corstorphine Loch, though both have now been drained. The first noticed proprietors of Corstorphine were David le Mareschall, in the reign of Alexander II, and Thomas le Mareschall and William de la Roche, whose names occur in Ragman Rolls of 1296. The estate remained in the possession of the families of Thomas le Mareschall and William de la Roche until the reign of David II, when it was forfeited by David le Mareschall and given by the King to Malcolm Ramsay. It was next held by William More of Abercorne, who left it to his brother, Gilchrist More, who sold it to Adam Forester. An important family in the area were the Lords Forresters, whose name has been given to several streets and whose large house can still be seen on Corstorphine High Street. Their main home, Corstorphine Castle, a 14th-century stronghold, was in ruins by the end of the 18th century and does not exist today. The only remnant of the castle is the 16th century doocot () which stands alongside Dovecot Road and a commemoration in a street name, Castle Avenue. The lands and Barony of Corstorphine have long been associated with the Forrester family. The first firm link with Corstorphine comes with Adam Forrester a wealthy burgess of Edinburgh in the 1360s when he began to acquire land in the vicinity. Between 1374 and 1377 King Robert II confirmed Adam Forrester in the lands of the Lordship of Corstorphine,National Archives of Scotland: Reference C2/R. v. 49. which had previously been owned by William More of Abercorn. Forrester founded a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist, connected to the parish church of Corstorphine. Sir John Forrester tomb (spouse hidden) in Corstorphine Old Parish Church Sir John Forrester, who succeeded his father upon his death, was granted various lands, mostly in West Lothian, in 1426 which were united into the barony of Liberton. In Perth on 4 February 1431 James I confirmed him in the house and lands of Corstorphine, which would be thereafter known as the Barony of Corstorphine. He likely founded the Corstorphine Collegiate Church in 1429, which forms part of today's parish kirk. Sir John is thought to have died in 1448 and was buried in Corstorphine Kirk, where recumbent effigies of him and one of his wives survive. He had four children: John, Henry, Elizabeth, and Janet. William Dunbar mentions a poet, Roull of Corstorphin in his Lament for the Makaris c.1505. Little else is known of the poet Roull, though one poem by him may be extant. Stewart Conn, Edinburgh's first appointed Makar,http://www.cityofliterature.com/ecol.aspx?sec=3&pid;=11 Edinburgh Makar has celebrated Roull's memory in his volume Ghosts at Cockcrow. The title then fell to his eldest son John, who is believed to have been more of a soldier than a civil servant. In 1443 he was with the Earl of Douglas when he destroyed Barnton castle, a stronghold of the Crichtons. As a direct consequence Forrester's house at Corstorphine was razed. He died in 1454 and was buried in Corstorphine Kirk, where his tomb can still be seen. =16th century= James Forrester of Corstorphine (son of the previously mentioned James Forrester), husband of Janet Lauder, was confirmed by Mary, Queen of Scots, on 5 February 1556 in the Barony of Corstorphine. In 1577 Sir James presented the parish kirk with a bell for its steeple. This bell still survives, although it was renewed in 1728. On 22 October 1599 Henry Forrester of Corstorphine sold various lands within the parishes of Corstorphine and St Cuthbert's. Henry died sometime around 1615 and his eldest son George became laird. James VI had already confirmed George Forrester, son and heir apparent of Henry Forrester of Corstorphine, and his wife Christine Livingstone in various properties in the barony of Corstorphine, on 15 November 1607. At Holyrood House on 30 July 1618 King James confirmed Sir George Forrester of Corstorphine in the lands and barony of Corstorphine. On 22 July 1633 he was created Lord Forrester of Corstorphine by Charles I. Lord Forrester had no sons, so resigned most of his properties, including Corstorphine, in favour of James Baillie. Corstorphine doocot, built in the 16th century to serve Corstorphine Castle, which has since been demolished. During the mid-17th century the family seems to have experienced some financial problems which resulted in lands being temporarily out of their control. On 3 August 1663 the lands and Barony of Corstorphine, except for the castle of Corstorphine and the town of Corstorphine, were granted to Sir John Gilmour. Oliver Cromwell had granted Laurence Scott of Bavelaw and his wife Katherine Binning, the lands, Lordship and Barony of Corstorphine, tower, manor-place, mills, mill- lands, parsonage etc., in lieu of the money due by James, Lord Forrester, to Beatrix Ramsay in Corstorphine who had assigned the debt to the said Laurence Scott, 1654. On 5 August 1664 the lands, Lordship and Barony of Corstorphine formerly belonging to James, Lord Forrester, and his brother German William Baillie which had been taken in lieu of debt, were granted to Florentius Gardner, baillie of Grangepans. On 10 May 1666, land was similarly granted to John Boyd, merchant burgess of Edinburgh. The Forresters soon reacquired much of their lands around Corstorphine. James Baillie's first wife Johanna died early. He then married Janet Ruthven, daughter of the Earl of Forth. This latest Lord Forrester was a man of dubious morals and seduced his niece, the wife of an Edinburgh burgess James Nimmo. She, however, later quarrelled with Forrester and stabbed him to death in his garden at Corstorphine on 26 August 1679. Mrs Nimmo was later executed at the Cross of Edinburgh for the murder. The titles then fell to William, the son of his brother William Baillie and his wife Lillias, daughter of the first Lord Forrester. In 1698, the estate of Corstorphine was sold to Hugh Wallace of Ingliston, a Writer to the Signet. In 1713, he sold it to Sir James Dick of Prestonfield, in whose family it remained until 1869. The Dicks were a prominent family of lawyers and merchants in Edinburgh. Sir James Dick (1643‚Äì1728) was a merchant and baillie of Edinburgh and also served as Dean of Guild and later as Lord Provost.http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I38424&tree;=CC =18th century= The Register of the Great Seal records the transfer of the lands and Barony of Corstorphine to Sir James Dick on 2 June 1713. View of Edinburgh from Corstorphine Hill, 1824 Unlike some other areas of Edinburgh, Corstorphine escaped widespread industrialisation in the 19th century. It only started to be absorbed into the Edinburgh urban area in the mid-20th century. But even before then, it had started to transform into a middle-class dormitory area for Edinburgh workers. By the late 20th century, Corstorphine had an ageing demographic. In 1961, Queen Margaret College (now QMU) obtained land up on the edge of Corstorphine next to Clermiston, and set up a campus there. This was closed in 2007, when they moved all their facilities out to Musselburgh. Before Edinburgh's roads were improved, Corstorphine was on a major route from central Edinburgh to Glasgow (hence the name \\"Glasgow Road\\" in the west of Corstorphine). However, Corstorphine has failed to integrate its retail sector, and by building a large retail park, many of its small businesses have fallen by the wayside, and been mostly replaced by charity shops. Sport There are two rugby clubs based in Corstorphine: Corstorphine Cougars RFC and Forrester RFC. Because of its proximity to Murrayfield Stadium, Corstorphine picks up much of the passing trade from rugby internationals and this helps support the local hotels and pubs. The local football club is Beechwood FC who play at Gyle Park pitches and at Tall Oaks. These are two of a number of football grounds in the area. There are also two tennis centres at St.Margaret's Park and on Belgrave Road. RH Corstorphine Cricket Club play home games at the Royal High School in Davidson's Mains. There are also two golf clubs based at Carrick Knowe nearby, and also another over on the other side of Corstorphine Hill. Corstorphine Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1902. The club and course disappeared in the late 1920s. The area once occupied by the course now forms part of Edinburgh Zoo.\\"Corstorphine Golf Club\\", \\"Golf‚Äôs Missing Links\\". Corstorphine has its own tennis club, which is over a hundred years old.,Corstorphine Tennis Club and there are additional tennis facilities at the David Lloyd Centre in Gyle Park, and at the nearby Murrayfield Tennis Club. Amenities In the area is Corstorphine Primary School, a state school catering for children between typically 5‚Äì12 years of age. There are also several other state primary schools near Corstorphine: Carrick Knowe Primary School, East Craigs Primary School, Fox Covert Primary School, Fox Covert Roman Catholic Primary School and Gylemuir Primary School. The state secondary school that serves the area is Craigmount High School, which is situated between Corstorphine and East Craigs, and the nearest Roman Catholic secondary school is St. Augustine's, which shares a campus with Forrester High School.  Transport  The former Pinkhill Railway Station Corstorphine contains one of the busiest routes out to the west, and Glasgow Road's name reflects its former connection to that city. St John's Road, the main street in Corstorphine rather than the High Street, has been consistently rated as among the most polluted in Scotland.Revealed: the most polluted streets in ScotlandEdinburgh street most polluted in Scotland Lothian buses has introduced low-emission buses to try and deal with this problem.Green buses for one of Scotland's most polluted streetsLow-emission buses for one of Scotland's most polluted streets Large sections of this main road have been turned into bus lanes where the road is wide enough. Cycling routes run mainly from east to west as the topography is dominated by the ridge of Corstorphine Hill The area is served by a number of buses operated by Lothian Buses including route numbers 1, 12, 21, 26, 31, as well as the airport buses, the 100 & 200\\\\. Other companies also run bus routes through Corstorphine, including First Buses, and also CityLink. The Corstorphine and Pinkhill railway stations were closed to passenger service in 1968, but some of the track bed remains and is used as a footpath and part of the cycle network. The nearest extant railway stations are at Edinburgh Gateway and South Gyle, and slightly further away, Haymarket. Victorian former coach house in Corstorphine.

Childress is credited as being the author of the Texas Declaration of Independence George Campbell Childress (January 8, 1804 ‚Äì October 6, 1841) was a lawyer, politician, and a principal author of the Texas Declaration of Independence. Early life Childress was born on January 8, 1804 in Nashville, Tennessee, to John Campbell Childress and Elizabeth Robertson Childress. In 1826 he attended and graduated from Davidson Academy. Two years later, he was admitted to the Tennessee Bar. George C. Childress studied law for two years later he became chief editor for the Nashville Banner which he remained for 10 years. Texas Washington-on-the-Brazos community in Washington County, Texas, United States. After spending some time raising money and volunteers in Tennessee for the Texas army, Childress left permanently for Texas. He arrived at the Red River on December 13, 1835, then illegally crossed the Red River into the nation of Mexico in violation of the Law of April 6, 1830. He reached Robertson's Colony on January 9, 1836. The following February he and his uncle, Sterling C. Robertson, were elected to represent Milam Municipality (formerly known as Viesca) at the Convention of 1836. Childress called the convention to order and subsequently introduced a resolution authorizing a committee of five members to draft a Declaration of Independence. Upon adoption of the resolution, he was named chairman of the committee by Richard Ellis (the other members of the committee were Edward Conrad, James Fannin, Bailey Hardeman, and Collin McKinney). The committee finished the drafting in only one day, leading many to believe that Childress had gone to the convention with a draft already prepared (as such, Childress is almost universally acknowledged as the primary author of the document and a newspaper article for his brother Wyatt's memorial states George wrote it in his brother's blacksmith shop). The convention approved the document on March 2, 1836. The document is modeled closely on the United States Declaration of Independence, where most of the signatories had moved from, often illegally. Although the document is dated March 2, the actual signing took place on March 3, after errors were discovered when it was read. On March 19, 1836, Childress and Robert Hamilton were sent to the United States to gain recognition of the new Republic of Texas. They were later replaced by James Collinsworth and Peter W. Grayson. Personal life On June 12, 1828, he married Margaret Vance. Seven years later, she gave birth to a son, but died from complications a few months afterward. On December 12, 1836, Childress married Rebecca Stuart Read Jennings. This union produced two daughters. Death and legacy In despair at the loss of his law practice, on October 6, 1841, while living in Galveston, Childress took a Bowie knife and committed suicide by cutting open his abdomen. Childress County, Texas is named in his honor. The city of Childress, Texas is named in his honor.

Azacitidine and its deoxy derivative, decitabine (also known as 5-aza-2‚Ä≤-deoxycytidine), are used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Both drugs were first synthesized in Czechoslovakia as potential chemotherapeutic agents for cancer. Uses =Clinical= Azacitidine, marketed as Vidaza, is used mainly in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, for which it received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 19, 2004. In two randomized controlled trials comparing azacitidine to supportive treatment, 16% of subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome who were randomized to receive azacitidine had a complete or partial normalization of blood cell counts and bone marrow morphology, compared to none who received supportive care, and about two-thirds of patients who required blood transfusions no longer needed them after receiving azacitidine. It is also sometimes used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, as a hypomethylating agent; an oral version called CC-486 is being tested as an easier to administer treatment for AML.CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) Monotherapy in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) =Non-clinical= Azacitidine can be used in vitro to remove methyl groups from DNA. This may weaken the effects of gene silencing mechanisms that occur prior to methylation. Certain methylations are believed to secure DNA in a silenced state, and therefore demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and confer relative gene activation. Azacitidine induces tumor regression on isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutant glioma xenografts in mice. In research, 5-azacitidine is commonly used for promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation of adult stem cells. However, it has been suggested that this drug has a compromised efficacy as a cardiac differentiation factor because it promotes the transdifferentiation of cardiac cells to skeletal myocytes. Azacitidine also has antiviral effects in animal studies as well as its anti- cancer actions, but has not been tested for clinical use. Mechanism of action Azacitidine is a chemical analogue of the nucleoside cytosine, which is present in DNA and RNA. It is thought to have antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms - at low doses, by inhibiting of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and at high doses, by its direct cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA, resulting in cell death. Azacitidine is a ribonucleoside, so it is incorporated into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. In contrast, decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a deoxyribonucleoside, so it can only incorporate into DNA. Azacitidine's incorporation into RNA leads to the disassembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and inhibition of the production of proteins. Its incorporation into DNA leads to covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequently leads to cytotoxicity. It has been shown effective against human immunodeficiency virus in vitro and human T-lymphotropic virus. =Inhibition of methylation= After azanucleosides such as azacitidine have been metabolized to 5-aza-2‚Ä≤-deoxycytidine- triphosphate (aka, decitabine-triphosphate), they can be incorporated into DNA and azacytosine can be substituted for cytosine. Azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized as substrate by the DNA methyltransferases, which catalyze the methylation reaction by a nucleophilic attack. This results in a covalent bond between the carbon-5 atom of the cytosine ring and the enzyme. The bond is normally resolved by beta-elimination through the carbon-5 atom, but this latter reaction does not occur with azacytosine because its carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen, leaving the enzyme covalently bound to DNA and blocking its DNA methyltransferase function. In addition, the covalent protein adduction also compromises the functionality of DNA and triggers DNA damage signaling, resulting in the degradation of trapped DNA methyltransferases. As a consequence, methylation marks become lost during DNA replication. Toxicity Azacitidine causes anemia (low red blood cell counts), neutropenia (low white blood cell counts), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), and patients should have frequent monitoring of their complete blood counts, at least prior to each dosing cycle. The dose may have to be adjusted based on nadir counts and hematologic response. It can also be hepatotoxic in patients with severe liver impairment, and patients with extensive liver tumors due to metastatic disease have developed progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially when their albumin levels are less than 30 g/L. It is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors. Kidney toxicity, ranging from elevated serum creatinine to kidney failure and death, have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for conditions other than myelodysplastic syndrome. Renal tubular acidosis developed in five patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (an unapproved use) treated with azacitidine and etoposide, and patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys, so patients with chronic kidney disease should be closely monitored for other side effects, since their levels of azacitidine may progressively increase. Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, azacitidine can cause severe fetal damage. Sexually active women of reproductive potential should use contraception during while receiving azacitidine and for one week after the last dose, and sexually active men with female partners of reproductive potential should use contraception during treatment and for three months following the last dose. A study undertaken to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of a single- day exposure to Azacytidine (5-AzaC) on neurobehavioral abnormalities in mice found, that the inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-AzaC treatment causes neurodegeneration and impairs extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation and the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein expression in neonatal mice and induces behavioral abnormalities in adult mice, as DNA methylation-mediated mechanisms appear to be necessary for the proper maturation of synaptic circuits during development, and disruption of this process by 5-AzaC could lead to abnormal cognitive function. Azacitidine can also cause nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, redness at its injection sites, constipation, bruising, petechiae, rigors, weakness, abnormally low potassium levels in the bloodstream, and many other side effects, some of which can be severe or even fatal.

He was the father of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and of socialite Lee Radziwill, and was the father-in-law of John F. Kennedy. Early life and education John Vernou Bouvier III was born in East Hampton, New York. His nickname, \\"Black Jack\\", referred to his perpetually dark-tanned skin and his flamboyant lifestyle. Bouvier's great-grandfather, Michel Bouvier, was a French cabinetmaker from Pont-Saint-Esprit, in the southern Provence region. Michel immigrated to Philadelphia in 1815 after fighting in the Napoleonic Wars, worked for Joseph Bonaparte, married, was widowed, and then married Louise Clifford Vernou. In addition to crafting fine furniture, Michel Bouvier had a business distributing firewood. To support that business, he acquired large tracts of forested land, some of which contained a large reserve of coal. Michel further grew his fortune in real estate speculation. His sons, Eustes, Michel Charles (M.C.), and John V. Bouvier Sr., distinguished themselves in the world of finance on Wall Street. They left their fortunes to their only remaining male Bouvier heir, Major John Vernou Bouvier Jr., who used some of the money to buy an estate known as Lasata in East Hampton, Long Island. Major John Vernou Bouvier, Jr. (born 1866), a successful attorney, and Maude Frances Sergeant (born 1869) had five children, of whom John Vernou Bouvier III was the eldest. Their other children were William Sergeant \\"Bud\\" Bouvier, who was born in 1893 and died from alcoholism in 1929; Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, who was born in 1895 and became the wife of Phelan Beale, Sr. and the mother of Edith Bouvier Beale, Phelan Beale, Jr., and Bouvier Beale; and twins Maude Reppelin Bouvier Davis and Michelle Caroline Bouvier Scott Putnam (born 1905). John Vernou Bouvier III attended Philips Exeter Academy and Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School. He then studied at Columbia College, his father's alma mater, where he played tennis for two years before transferring to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. While attending Yale, he was a member of the Book and Snake secret society and the Cloister Club. He graduated in 1914. Career and military service Upon his graduation, he went to work as a stockbroker at his father and uncle's firm: Bouvier, Bouvier & Bouvier. In 1917, he left the firm to join the United States Navy. When the Navy proved to be too strenuous , he transferred to the United States Army, where he served as a major. Bouvier was discharged in 1919, whereupon he went back to work as a stockbroker on Wall Street. Personal life Bouvier married Janet Norton Lee, the daughter of real estate developer James T. Lee, on July 7, 1928, at St. Philomena's Church in East Hampton. They had two daughters, Jacqueline Lee \\"Jackie\\" Bouvier (1929‚Äì1994) and Caroline Lee Bouvier (1933‚Äì2019). Bouvier's drinking, gambling, and philandering led to the couple's divorce in June 1940. Bouvier never remarried. In June 1942, Janet Lee Bouvier married Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr. Janet reportedly did not want her ex-husband to escort his daughter, Jacqueline, down the aisle for her 1953 wedding to John F. Kennedy, so Jacqueline was instead escorted by her step-father. However, some reports indicated Bouvier was too intoxicated to escort his daughter, leading Auchincloss to step in to give the bride away. By the mid-1950s, Bouvier had sporadic contact with his daughters and family. He spent the majority of his time drinking alone at his New York City apartment located at 125 East 74th Street.Klein, page 36 Later life and death In the spring of 1957, Bouvier was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He checked into Lenox Hill Hospital on July 27, 1957 to undergo chemotherapy. On August 1, he fell into a coma. He died two days later, on August 3, aged 66. His funeral, which was arranged by his daughters Jacqueline and Lee, was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan after which his body was buried in the Bouvier family plot at Most Holy Trinity Catholic Cemetery in East Hampton, New York. In popular culture Bouvier is thought to be the \\"Wall Street Jack\\" mentioned in the lyrics of \\"Forty Second Street\\", from the musical 42nd Street.http://www.filmsite.org/fort4.html He was portrayed by Rod Taylor in the TV film biography Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy in 1981.

In many countries, including the United States, police and prosecutors are required to disclose to the defendant exculpatory evidence they possess before the defendant enters a plea (guilty or not guilty).Quote from Prof. Laurie Levenson: \\"Prof. SCHECK: ... that didn't commit the crime. But I think the problem is that under the law now, number one, prosecutors are not obligated to provide exculpatory evidence to grand juries who are considering whether or not to indict a defendant. And number two, there's no real requirement at all that prosecutors disclose exculpatory evidence to defendants prior to the time they decide to plead.\\" https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122286337 Per the Brady v. Maryland decision, prosecutors have a duty to disclose exculpatory evidence even if not requested to do so. While the prosecution is not required to search for exculpatory evidence and must disclose only the evidence in its possession, custody, or control, the prosecution's duty is to disclose all information known to any member of its team, e.g., police, investigators, crime labs, et cetera. In Brady v. Maryland, the U.S. Supreme Court held that such a requirement follows from constitutional due process and is consistent with the prosecutor's duty to seek justice.  Illustration  A victim is murdered by stabbing and a suspect is arrested for the murder. Evidence includes a knife covered with blood found near the victim and the accused found covered in blood at the murder scene. During the investigation, the police interview a witness claiming to have seen the stabbing. The witness makes a statement to the police that another unidentified person committed the crime, not the accused. The witness's statement is exculpatory evidence as it introduces reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The police either do not believe the witness's account or else find the witness unreliable and choose not to follow up on the lead. The prosecutor is obliged to inform the accused and his or her attorney of the witness's statement even though the police doubt the witness's version of events. Failure to do so would provide grounds for a motion to dismiss the charges or an appeal of a subsequent guilty verdict.  See also  *Brady disclosure *Giglio v.

It linked the quays at Wadebridge with the town of Bodmin and also to quarries at Wenfordbridge.Sources use Wenfordbridge and Wenford Bridge interchangeably, but the current Ordnance Survey 1:50 000 maps cite the name as a single word Its intended traffic was minerals to the port at Wadebridge and sea sand, used to improve agricultural land, inwards. Passengers were also carried on part of the line. It was the first steam- powered railway line in the county and predated the main line to London by 25 years. It was always desperately short of money, both for initial construction and for actual operation. In 1847 it was purchased by the London and South Western Railway,Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, when that company hoped to gain early access to Cornwall for its network, but in fact those intentions were much delayed, and the little line was long isolated. China clay extraction was developed at Wenfordbridge and sustained mineral traffic on the line for many years, but passenger use declined and the line closed to passengers in 1967, the china clay traffic continuing until 1978.Dendy Marshall, C F, revised by Kidner, R W, History of the Southern Railway, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 1982 Much of the route now forms part of the Camel Trail, a cycle and footpath from Wenfordbridge to Padstow Origins Local interests obtained parliamentary authority to construct the Bodmin & Wadebridge Railway from metal ore mines near Wenford to the port at Wadebridge for onward transport by coastal shipping. Sea sand, then used for improving agricultural land, was also to be brought up from Wadebridge. The line was also to have a branch to Bodmin and also a one-mile branch to Ruthern Bridge. The line was formally opened on 30 September 1834 although trial operation, conveying revenue passengers and minerals had taken place in July. The permanent way consisted of 15 foot parallel As opposed to fish bellied rails rails 42 lbs per yard on stone blocks 20 inches square. The track gauge was the standard gauge. At first there was only one locomotive, called \\"Camel\\", a single passenger coach, and desperately few wagons, but a second engine, called \\"Elephant\\" was obtained from June 1836. The passenger service only ever operated between Bodmin and Wadebridge, and never on the branches; there were no intermediate stations, but boarding at any intermediate place was semi- officially permitted. The train service seems to have been very irregular, probably because of mechanical problems with the locomotives, and for many years (probably from 1841) the passenger service consisted of a train from Wadebridge on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, returning on the other weekdays.Williams, R A, The London & South Western Railway, vol 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968 Minerals and goods were the dominant traffic, and there were numerous wharves‚Äîthe company used the term borrowed from canal operation, and the person in charge of each wharf was a wharfinger. Wharves and siding connections were at:Possibly at other locations also * Ruthern Bridge; a goods and mineral terminus on its own branch; this served small mines for copper, lead and iron; * Denby Siding; near the later Nanstallon Halt; serving an iron mine; * Borough Bounds Wharf, later also known as Dunmere Wharf; on the Wenfordbridge side of Boscarne Junction; grain to Hawke's Mill; * Penhargard Siding, mainly used for timber; * Helland Wharf; * Tresarratt Quarry; * Parkyn's Stump Oak; * Tresarratt Wharf; * WenfordbridgeMitchell, V and Smith, K, Branch Lines Around Bodmin, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1996 Although export of granite and the carriage of sea sand grew in volume, passenger traffic remained insignificant, and the line remained hopelessly weak financially, and a series of disasters including serious floods which damaged bridges and culverts, wiped out any small operating profit. Takeover In the period from 1835, business interests in the Falmouth area were concerned to regenerate that town's waning importance, and railway connection to London was in their thoughts. Several proposals came forward and failed, but a scheme called the Cornwall & Devon Central Railway gained support for a standard gauge line following an inland route, forming an alliance with other lines to get access to London over the London & South Western Railway. The Cornwall & Devon Central company had yet to get parliamentary approval for construction, but it purchased the Bodmin & Wadebridge line for ¬£35,000. In fact the C&DC; lost out in its bid for approval for its line, and the London & South Western company itself purchased the Bodmin & Wadebridge line for the same ¬£35,000 from the C&DC; company in 1847. The LSWR now owned a heavily loss-making little line more than a hundred miles from its own network. The purchase did not have parliamentary authority, and the purchase is often described as illegal. In fact the activities of companies incorporated by Act of Parliament were limited by the terms of the Act, and the LSWR did not have the power to acquire another railway company; their action in doing so would better be described as ultra vires. Notwithstanding the remoteness of the new owner, the LSWR brought financial resources to bear and the local line continued its operations with a little more certainty than previously, while still making considerable losses. However the Bodmin & Wadebridge continued to play a role in the battle between the LSWR and its allies, and the GWR and its satellites. Several nominally independent companies sought support and parliamentary powers for lines connecting with the Bodmin & Wadebridge; among these was the Launceston, Bodmin & Wadebridge Railway, which obtained its powers in 1864 but never succeeded in using them. In 1873 the Devon & Cornwall Railway, a narrow gauge company, tried to obtain parliamentary authority to make extensions in the two counties in its name, including a railway from near Okehampton to Wenfordbridge, so as to gain access to Wadebridge; but this was rejected in Parliament.Williams, R A, The London & South Western Railway, vol 2, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973 A new halt, called Shooting Range Platform, was opened about 1880. It was long enough for a single coach, located on the south-west side of the line; the shooting range was in the otherwise inaccessible land between the railway and the loop of the River Camel, opposite Derry's Wood. Trains stopped there only with written authority from the Army. In 1882 an Act was passed for a railway called the North Cornwall Railway to build a line from Padstow via Wadebridge to Halwill, where the LSWR now had its line; running arrangements for the North Cornwall trains as far as Okehampton were agreed. The North Cornwall Company had wanted running rights as far as Exeter, but by now the LSWR sought friendlier terms with its rival, the GWR, and to avoid offending them, the powers were stopped short at Okehampton. There was to be a triangular junction at Pendevy Bridge, the point where the new Halwill line met the Bodmin & Wadebridge, a little east of Wadebridge, and the Act included powers to improve the Bodmin & Wadebridge line, including the making of seven deviations to eliminate the very sharp curves on the line. In fact by an Act in 1883 the LSWR took over the role of making those improvements, and on 1 July 1886 the LSWR formally absorbed the Bodmin & Wadebridge line, the previous semi-legal purchase now being authorised by Act of Parliament of 25 June 1886. The GWR arrives in Bodmin The Great Western Railway had formed an alliance with other broad gauge railway companies in the West of England: the grouping was called the Associated Companies. In 1876 they amalgamated under the banner of the Great Western Railway, and that company pursued an active interest in developing railways in Cornwall. In earlier years the Associated Companies and the so- called narrow gauge companies‚Äîthe LSWR and its allies‚Äîwere hostile to one another, but now the enmity was abating. An earlier proposal had been made to make a broad gauge line from the Cornwall Railway near Bodmin Road station to the Bodmin & Wadebridge station at Bodmin, with interchange platforms for the necessary transshipment from broad to standard gauge wagons there. This had been authorised by Act of Parliament in 1864, but was dropped in 1876. By 1882 relations between the GWR and the LSWR had improved enough for constructive discussions to take place about connecting the GWR to Wadebridge, and to improve the Bodmin & Wadebridge line itself. (The line had been constructed with very sharp curves and lightly constructed track.) The Great Western Company got powers to make a standard gauge connection,By then it was obvious that the days of the broad gauge were numbered and on 27 May 1887 the GWR opened a line from Bodmin Road to its own Bodmin station in the town. The station later became known as Bodmin General. In the following year, on 3 September 1888 the GWR built an extension from their Bodmin station to join the Bodmin & Wadebridge line, at Boscarne Junction.MacDermot, E T, History of the Great Western Railway, vol 2, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1932 The LSWR now suspended its own passenger trains on the Bodmin & Wadebridge line from 1 November 1886 for the improvements to the line to be undertaken; goods trains were also suspended, and Great Western Railway trains were the only ones on the line, running from their own Bodmin station. In 1891 yet another Parliamentary Act was required to permit extension of time for these works, which still included the substantial easing of the sharp curves at Grogley and Dunmere, and substantial improvement of the whole of the section from Boscarne Junction to Bodmin (B&WR; station), and extension of Wadebridge station. Integration with the LSWR lines The Bodmin & Wadebridge System in 1895Construction of the North Cornwall line from Halwill was much delayed due to difficulty in raising the necessary capital, and after several extensions of time it opened to a special goods train on 31 May 1895 and fully on 1 June 1895. The planned eastern arm of the triangular junction with the Bodmin & Wadebridge having been long forgotten. The North Cornwall converged with the Bodmin & Wadebridge line at Wadebridge Junction, about a mile east of Wadebridge itself. Padstow had to wait still further, and after yet another Act of variation the Wadebridge to Padstow section was opened to the public on 27 March 1899. On 1 November 1895 the LSWR resumed running trains on the Bodmin & Wadebridge section, and therefore journeys from Waterloo to Bodmin, changing at Wadebridge, became feasible, taking from 7 hours 18 minutes to about 9 hours. The GWR continued its service of seven trains a day. The twentieth century The Bodmin & Wadebridge system in 1923Traffic on the line remained very light, and the LSWR installed class H13 steam railcars on the passenger trains; they seated 40 passengers. At the same time, intermediate halts were opened at Grogley Halt, Nanstallon Halt and Dunmere Halt on 2 July 1906. Mitchell and SmithVic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Wenford Bridge to Fowey, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1998, also refer to a St Lawrence Hospital Platform, near the road to Nanstallon, opened in 1906 and closed in 1917. St Lawrence's Hospital is shown as \\"County Lunatic Asylum\\" on the 1908 Ordnance Survey map, but the Platform is not shown. The location must have been on St Lawrence Road.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560, 1908 A second line was provided from Wadebridge Junction to Wadebridge, one line leading from the North Cornwall line and the other from the Bodmin line. The junction signalbox was abolished, and the two lines to Wadebridge were operated as two single lines. This arrangement applied from 4 February 1907. Ruthern Bridge had originally been provided for several small mineral mines in the immediate area; but these declined in the twentieth century, and the last train ran on 29 November 1933, the ground frame connection to the main line being closed on 1 January 1934. The Bodmin station was renamed Bodmin North on 26 September 1949; the GWR station was renamed Bodmin General. The B&W; station was destaffed on 3 January 1966 and became a Halt on 18 April 1966‚Äîan unusual case of a terminal station being a halt. A modern clay drying works was built alongside the Wenfordbridge line just north of Poley's Bridge Road some time before 1962; china clay was piped as a slurry from Stannon Moor, over four miles away, and the dried product was conveyed away by train. From 1964 strict economies were to be made on the line, which after all had two train services from two different Bodmin stations. A new platform was opened on 15 June called Boscarne Exchange Platform; trains from Bodmin General to Wadebridge stopped here, and a diesel railbus operated a shuttle connection between there and the original Bodmin & Wadebridge station. The railbuses had steps to enable passengers to join and alight, so the \\"platform\\" on the B&W; line was at ground level. There was no public access to and from the station, which was only for immediate transfer between the two trains. Oil lamps were provided‚Äîin 1964! In 1966 the North Cornwall line between Halwill and Wadebridge was closed, and for a short period the Bodmin and Wadebridge trains were the only connection to Padstow. In fact passenger services finished on 30 January 1967. Public goods facilities at Wenfordbridge were withdrawn on 1 May 1967, and the line became a dedicated branch for the china clay private sidings, gaining access to the railway network via Bodmin General (reverse) and Bodmin Road. The line closed in 1983.Cobb, Col M H, The Railways of Great Britain - A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 2003 In 1974 a preservation society was formed, which became the Bodmin and Wenford Railway. They have established a successful railway museum at Bodmin General, and run steam hauled passenger trains to Bodmin Parkway and to Boscarne. It is their aim to extend from Boscarne Junction to Wadebridge alongside the trail, on the route of the Bodmin and Wadebridge line. Rolling stock \\"The oldest rolling stock in England. Bodmin & Waterbridge Branch, London & Southwestern Railway, in use for fifty years\\" in 1896 When the rolling stock came to be standardised with the rest of the network, the age of the route gave some difficulties. There was a trial of SECR P Class 0-6-0 on the line, which was a failure because of the lightly laid track and sharp curves, which made running difficult for locomotives not designed to accommodate it. As a result, three of the LSWR 0298 Class, Victorian locomotives designed for urban passenger duties, were retained on the line significantly past their life-expiry, and became an attraction in the far west for locomotive enthusiasts, being recorded as prodigious survivors as early as 1949 by C Hamilton Ellis.Ellis, C Hamilton, Some Classic Locomotives, Allen & Unwin, London, 1949 They were eventually replaced by GWR 1366 Class dock tanks in 1962 after the line had been transferred to the Western Region of British Railways.

Life Willan was educated at Sedbergh School, and received his M.D. at Edinburgh in 1780 From 1781 he practised medicine in Darlington and then moved to London in 1783 as physician to the new Carey Street Public Dispensary, where he remained until 1803 teaching alongside Thomas Bateman. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1809. Works Following the example of Carl Linnaeus, Willan attempted a taxonomic classification of skin diseases, describing impetigo, lupus, psoriasis, scleroderma, ichthyosis, sycosis, and pemphigus. Willan's portrait was reproduced on the cover of the British Journal of Dermatology for many years.NNDB Willan and Bateman working together provided the world's first attempt to classify skin diseases from an anatomical standpoint. In 1790, Willan received the Fothergill Gold Medal from the Medical Society of London for his classification of skin diseases. In the same year he published an account entitled \\"A Remarkable Case of Abstinence\\", which detailed the case of a young Englishman who died in 1786 after fasting for 78 days - one of the earliest accounts of eating disorders in males. A copy of one of his works was translated into German and published in Breslau in 1799. The English version has been lost. In 1798, Willan described the occupational disease psoriasis diffusa, which affects the hands and arms of bakers, and in 1799 first described the exanthematous rash of childhood known as erythema infectiosum. Willan's 1808 book, On Cutaneous Diseases is a landmark in the history of dermatology and in medical illustration and contains the first use of the word \\"lupus\\" to describe cutaneous tuberculosis.Site to view online Delineations of Cutaneous Diseases: Exhibiting the Characteristic Appearances of the Principal Genera and Species Comprised in the Classification of the Late Dr. Willan; and Completing the Series of Engravings Begun by that Author by Thomas Bateman, London, 1817.

Chimping is a colloquial term used in digital photography to describe the habit of checking every photo on the camera display (LCD) immediately after capture. Some photographers use the term in a derogatory sense to describe the actions of amateur photographers, but the act of reviewing images on-camera is not necessarily frowned upon by professional or experienced photographers.  Origin of the term  The term 'chimping' was first written about by Robert Deutsch, a USA Today staff photographer, in September 1999 when writing a story for the SportsShooter email newsletter. He did not invent the term but heard it passed down by word of mouth. The term derives from the habit of the photographer looking at the picture in the LCD, and saying \\"Ooh, ooh, ooh!\\" imitating the sound of a chimpanzee.  Views on chimping  Stephen Johnson, in his book on digital photography, writes:Johnson, Stephen; Stephen Johnson on digital photography, Page 72, O'Reilly, 2006 .

Therefore, the idea that only \\"wannabe\\" photographers need to look at the LCD and check the exposure, image, or both may be unreasonable.

It borders Halebank to the south and west, Hough Green to the north and north west and an area just outside Widnes town centre (the Ball o'Ditton) to the east. Ditton is a local government ward, with a population of 6,249 at the time of the 2001 Census. It has three small areas of shops (\\"Alexander Drive\\", \\"St Michaels\\" and \\"Queens Avenue\\") and the Roman Catholic St Michael's Church - a local example of Gothic Revival architecture. The area also houses two medium-sized industrial estates. There are three public-houses in Ditton; the Blundell Arms, the Yew Tree (now demolished, with apartments built on the land) and the New Inn. To the south east of Ditton runs Ditton Road, which connects the A562 Ashley Way Central Widnes By-pass to the Halebank area of the town. This an industrial stretch of road containing remnants of Widnes' manufacturing and trade, including a chemical plant and large timber yard which sit on an expanse of land which leads to the River Mersey. The area also once contained a popular golf course - St Michaels Municipal, however it closed due to arsenic contamination, which is a reminder of the industrial waste that lies beneath. Ditton railway station, situated on Hale Road between Ditton and Halebank, closed to passengers on 27 May 1994. The site is now a railway junction with concrete remnants of platforms. Near to the former station is Ditton Brook, which runs from the eastern part of Liverpool to Ditton, where it flows into the River Mersey. The River Ditton, runs through the area also flowing into the River Mersey. From 1968, and until, September 2004, a large Asda superstore with a petrol filling station occupied a site opposite just a few hundred yards up the road from the railway station. Asda relocated to a new larger store nearer to Widnes town centre the same year that the old store ceased trading and the former site was redeveloped into industrial units from 2005. Until the late 1990s, Ditton was the site of a large purpose built Golden Wonder factory, where they manufactured crisps. Some years after the Senior Management buy-out of the company from Dalgety, the Widnes site was closed and production transferred to Scunthorpe. A large part of the workforce were Widnes-based, so the decline of the factory exacerbated the problem of unemployment for unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the area. The site of the factory was used as the police station in the BBC TV drama Merseybeat, which was filmed on location in Ditton. The area has recently benefited from new-build housing developments (such as Redrow's Chapel Gate development) with units primarily being purchased by first time buyer owner-occupiers, many of whom are indigenous to the area.

Male and female squash blossoms can be used interchangeably, but picking only male flowers (leaving some for pollination) allows the plant to also produce some fruit (squash).

This map includes as \\"federal lands\\" land held \\"in trust\\" for American Indians, which are not generally considered, \\"federal lands\\" in other contexts. Federal lands are lands in the United States owned by the federal government. Pursuant to the Property Clause of the United States Constitution (Article Four, section 3, clause 2), the Congress has the power to retain, buy, sell, and regulate federal lands, such as by limiting cattle grazing on them. These powers have been recognized in a long line of U.S. Supreme Court decisions.Paul Rodgers, United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction (2011), p. 100-101.Gibson v. Chouteau, 80 U.S. 92, 99 (1872), U.S. v. Grimaud, 220 U.S. 506 (1911), Light v. U.S. 220 U.S. 523 (1911), Utah Power & Light Co. v. U.S., 243 U.S. 389, 405 (1917), Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 336 (1936). The federal government owns about 640 million acres of land in the United States, about 28% of the total land area of 2.27 billion acres.Lipton, Eric, and Clifford Krauss, Giving Reins to the States Over Drilling, New York Times, August 24, 2012.Carol Hardy Vincent, Carla N. Argueta, & Laura A. Hanson, Federal Land Ownership: Overview and Data, Congress Research Service (March 3, 2017). The majority of federal lands (610.1 million acres in 2015) are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), or U.S. Forest Service (FS). BLM, FWS, and NPS are part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, while the Forest Service is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. An additional 11.4 million acres of land (about 2% of all federal land) is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). The majority of federal lands are located in Alaska and the Western states. Legal background The United States Supreme Court has upheld the broad powers of the federal government to deal with federal lands, for example having unanimously held in Kleppe v. New MexicoKleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976). that \\"the complete power that Congress has over federal lands under this clause necessarily includes the power to regulate and protect wildlife living there, state law notwithstanding.\\" Lands held by the United States in trust for Native American tribes are generally not considered public lands.Tom Fredericks & Andrea Aseff, When Did Congress Deem Indian Lands Public Lands?: The Problem of BLM Exercising Oil and Gas Regulatory Jurisdiction, 33 Energy Law Journal 119 (2012). There are some 55 million acres of land held in trust by the federal government for Indian tribes and almost 11 million acres of land held in trust by the federal government for individual Natives. Although the United States holds legal title to these lands, the tribe or individual holds beneficial title (the right to use and benefit from the property).\\"Trust Land\\" in Treaties with American Indians: An Encyclopedia of Rights, Conflicts, and Sovereignty (ed. Donald L. Fixico: ABC-CLIO, 2008), p. 956. As a result, Indian Country is \\"quasi-private, not public, land.\\" Nevertheless, \\"because the United States is a legal title holder, the federal government is a necessary part in all leases and dispositions of resources including trust land. For example, the secretary of the interior must approve any contract for payment or grant by an Indian tribe for services for the tribe 'relative to their lands' (25 U.S.C. ¬ß 81).\\" Primary federal land holders This map shows land owned by different federal government agencies. The four primary federal land holders are: *Department of the Interior **Bureau of Land Management (BLM) - Manages about 248.3 million acres of federal lands as of 2017, more than any other agency. Of these, 99.4% are in the 11 Western states or Alaska. BLM primarily emphasizes rangeland, but also administers lands for purposes other than grazing, including \\"recreation, ... timber, watershed, wildlife and fish habitat, and conservation.\\" **United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) - Manages about 89.1 million acres of federal land, of which 86% are in Alaska. FWS-administered land is primarily for conservation and promotion of wildlife; however, some other uses (such as resource extraction) are permitted under certain conditions and in certain areas. **National Park Service (NPS) - Manages about 79.8 million acres of federal land, of which 66% are in Alaska. There are official NPS units with a variety of titles, including national park, national monument, national historic site, national recreation area, and national battlefield. *Department of Agriculture **United States Forest Service (FS) - Manages about 192.9 million acres of national forests. Although Forest Service holdings are mostly in the West, FS also manages about 60% of all federal lands in the Eastern United States. The fifth largest federal landowner is the U.S. Department of Defense, which owns, leases, or possessed 26.1 million worldwide, of which 11.4 million acres are located in the United States. DOD land is mostly military bases and reservations. The largest single DOD-owned tract is the 2.3-million-acre White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Together, the BLM, FWS, NPS, Forest Service, and DOD manage 97% of federal land. Federal agencies that control smaller amounts of land include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the United States Postal Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the U.S. Department of Energy. Distribution and changes over time Federal land is concentrated in the Western United States. Nationwide, the federal government owns 27.4% of all land area. There are significant variations regionally; the federal government owns 61.3% of the land area in Alaska, 46.4% of the land area in the 11 contiguous Western states; and 4.2% of the land area of other states. The state with the highest percentage of land held by the federal government is Nevada (79.6%); the states with the lowest percentage of land held by the federal government are Connecticut and Iowa (0.3%). From 1990 to 2015, federal acreage declined by about 3.9% due to a decline in land held by DOD and BLM.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Captain Picard and Vash are reunited when the Enterprise hosts an archaeology symposium, but their disparate personalities soon have them sparring. Q arrives and offers to do Captain Picard a favor by getting him and Vash back together again. When Picard rejects the notion, Q transforms the captain into Robin Hood and sends him, Vash, and several members of Picard's senior staff to Sherwood Forest. Plot Captain Picard is working late on a speech that he will present to visiting archaeologists when Counselor Troi tells him that the council members have arrived and been assigned quarters. Picard returns to his quarters and finds Vash waiting for him, and the two kiss. The next morning, the two are sharing breakfast when Doctor Crusher arrives and offers to give Vash a tour. Vash expresses surprise and slight anger at the fact the Captain hasn't told his friends about her and confronts him about this at a reception for the delegates. After the reception, Q returns to repay Captain Picard for saving him in \\"D√©j√† Q\\". Picard requests nothing, so Q decides to save Picard by testing Picard's love for Vash. While Picard is addressing the delegates, Q transports the bridge crew to medieval England, where Captain Picard is Robin Hood and the bridge crew are the Merry Men. English soldiers attack the group and the group retreats to the forest. Q assumes the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham and has imprisoned Vash, now Maid Marian. Picard must rescue Vash as she is sentenced to die for treason. Vash manipulates Sir Guy of Gisbourne into sparing her life by professing love and promising marriage. Picard realizes that if he does nothing, Vash will die. He orders his officers to remain in the woods, then disguises himself and infiltrates the castle as a peasant worker. Picard climbs up to the tower and through the window. The two bicker over the merits of Picard's rescue plan, and Vash refuses to go. Picard begins to carry her away when a group enters. Picard is taken away by the guards, and Vash tries to send a message to Commander Riker, which is stopped by Q, who reveals himself to Vash and has her taken away. At the chopping block, Picard's officers reveal themselves disguised as monks and create a diversion. Picard and his staff prove themselves formidable fighters and win. Picard frees Vash, who leaves with Q to explore the galaxy. Q guarantees Vash's safety; with that, Picard considers Q's debt paid in full.

Sivand is home to the Sivandi dialect, a north western -Iranian language which like an island is surrounded in a sea of other Persian languages and dialects in Fars. The number of Sivandi speakers is estimated to be approximately 6,800 persons. The population of Sivand decreased from some 6,000 in 1950 to its present total, as a result of most of its young population leaving for cities in pursuit of higher education; some Sivandis also emigrated, mostly to Europe and the United States of America. Most of Sivand's present inhabitants are involved in horticulture and farming.

These Protestant refugees fled Catholic persecution in France, emigrating to the Die Pfalz, the Rhenish Palatinate (in present day Germany), before going to New Netherland where they settled in Wiltwyck (present day Kingston, NY) and Nieuw Dorp, settlements midway between New Amsterdam (present day New York City) and Beverwyck (today known as Albany, New York) before ultimately founding New Paltz.

Flemish is one of the three national languages of Belgium, together with French and German, and is the only official language of the Flemish Region. The various Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium contain a number of lexical and grammatical features which distinguish them from standard Dutch. Crestien translates to Guislain (or Ghislain), and formal records were usually kept in Latin, \\"Old French\\" or Corsican as the Flanders region was then governed as the Spanish Netherlands. The incorrect translation of \\"de still Courtuier\\" above can be translated as still being of titled nobility, and a member of the wool supply trade at that time as Guislains lands were sold.

In 1663 the Esopus Indians captured DuBois' wife and three children who were eventually rescued three months later.

The tract, known in 17th- century colonial New York as a \\"patent,\\" stretched from the Hudson River to the Shawangunk Mountains. DuBois was one of eleven men to begin settling on a rise over the Wallkill River, in the center of the patent, in 1678.The Early Families of New Paltz, Historic Huguenot Street, 1999 Louis DuBois served as one of the original elders in New Paltz's French Reformed Church, which is still in existence today. In the early years, DuBois and his fellow patentees governed the land communally. In 1728, the surviving patentees and their descendants created a more formal form a government called \\"The Twelve Men\\" (later known as the Duzine). This body consisted of one elected representative for each patentee families. Membership was restricted to their descendants through either male or female lines. To this date, some of the DuBois land is still owned by the family descendants. In 1785, the New York State Legislature confirmed the actions of this body. Although a standard form of town government was established in the late 18th century, the Duzine existed in at least ceremonial form into the 19th century. In the later years of the Duzine, the members were consumed with lawsuits defending the boundaries of the New Paltz patent. At one time, the Duzine hired Aaron Burr to represent them in such a lawsuit.

Original series The title characters are a pair of anthropomorphic puppet pigs, named Pinky and Perky, who were originally going to be named Pinky and Porky but there was a problem registering Porky as a character name. This was solved by Margaret Potter, the wife of their producer, Trevor Hill, who also discovered them, when she woke him up one night announcing \\"I've got it! Pinky and Perky!\\" They were created by Czechoslovakian immigrants Jan and Vlasta Dalibor who moved to the village of Houndhill, leaving the pigs under the cupboard in The Bungalow. The characters of pigs were chosen because the pig is seen as a symbol of good luck in the former Czechoslovakia. The puppets, who had only very limited movements, looked very alike. Pinky wore red clothes and Perky wore blue, but this distinction was of little use on monochrome TV, so Perky often wore a hat. Pinky and Perky spoke and sang in high-pitched voices, created by re-playing original voice recordings at twice the original recorded speed; the vocals were sung by Mike SammesSpencer Leigh, Mike Sammes, obituary in The Independent on Sunday, 11 June 2001 while the backing track was played at half normal speed (Sammes did the same job for Ken Dodd's Diddymen, as Ross Bagdasarian did for the original Chipmunks in the early 1960s)‚Äîhence the expression \\"Pinky and Perky speed\\", when an LP record is played at 45 rpm or 78 rpm instead of the correct 33‚Öì rpm. Pinky and Perky would often sing cover versions of popular songs, but also had their own theme song, \\"We Belong Together\\". They had their own fictional TV station \\"PPC TV\\". They also performed comedy sketches usually with a human foil (similar to Basil Brush). Actor John Slater worked with them as a straight man for many years, enduring soakings from water pistols and similar pranks. Other human companions included Roger Moffat, Jimmy Thompson, Bryan Burdon and Fred Emney. Their show included other puppets such as the Beakles (an avian parody of the Beatles), Topo Gigio, a mouse puppet who appeared in many later episodes, as well as a female pig. Other puppets included Ambrose Cat, Basil Bloodhound, Bertie Bonkers the baby elephant, Conchita the Cow, Horace Hare and Vera Vixen. Pinky and Perky also performed guest slots on other shows, including several appearances on Sunday Night at the London Palladium.One episode, originally broadcast on 13 April 1958, was shown on Talking Pictures TV on 26 January 2020. The puppets also appeared on TV in the United States on a number of episodes of The Ed Sullivan Show: 532 (14 September 1958), 548 (4 January 1959), 573 (5 July 1959), 740 (10 March 1963), 780 (23 February 1964, where they shared the bill with the Beatles and Morecambe and Wise) and 908 (26 February 1967). The pigs featured in series, such as Pinky and Perky's Pop Parade and Pinky and Perky's Island, for 11 years until 1968 on the BBC before transferring to ITV until 1972. There were no real people, sketches or stories in the shows at all. Instead, the puppets would be seen lip-synching and dancing to songs by the likes of Petula Clark. In this incarnation, each episode would end with the characters singing the Scaffold's hit \\"Thank U Very Much\\". At this point, there would be the only piece of spoken dialogue, which went along these lines: :: \\"Who's going to say it?\\" :: \\"Oh, let me!\\" :: \\"No! I want to!\\" :: \\"All right, then, let's do it together! Ready‚ÄîMUCH!\\" Other shows and appearances The characters enjoyed a brief revival in the 1990s, on the short-lived children's series The Pig Attraction. A children's annual was also produced in the '60s featuring their adventures. The Pinky and Perky Show reappeared in an all-new CGI-animated television series on CBBC, beginning in November 2008 on BBC One. There are 52 episodes, each 13 minutes in length. Some of the old characters remained in the show, such as Vera Vixen (who often hatches schemes to try to get rid of the two pigs) and Morton Frog (who works in the production control room, usually running the end titles [or in \\"Cartoon Mash-Up\\", cueing the end music] at the end of an episode.). Alongside them, there were a host of new characters, such as K.T. the studio manager cat, Wilberforce the tortoise security guard (who comes up with impractical ideas for new acts or games for the show), and a pair of poodle receptionists called Tara and Tamara (who, in a recurring gag, often get Pinky and Perky's names wrong). There is also a steady stream of special 'celebrity' guests, many of which spoof better-known franchises, such as Doctor Who as \\"Dr. Roo\\" and Harry Potter as \\"Harry Trotter\\". The series was produced by Lupus Films, and line produced by Sally Marchant. A DVD of the new look Pinky and Perky, featuring eight episodes from the new series, entitled Licence to Swill was released in 2009.

Today, Croatia Records claims to have 70% share of the Croatian music market and has 30 record stores. Being a continuation of Jugoton, from which it inherited a comprehensive audio and video collection, Croatia Records is also active in re-releasing numerous digitally remastered former Yugoslav pop and rock titles. Following the global retro trend, the company decided to re-introduce gramophone records as well. History The company that is today Croatia Records was founded in 1947 in Zagreb, the capital of the then-People's Republic of Croatia under the name Jugoton, a publicly owned company which was the largest record label and chain record store in the former SFR Yugoslavia. During several decades of its successful existence, Jugoton signed many eminent ex-Yugoslav artists such as: Indexi, Bijelo Dugme, Elektriƒçni Orgazam, Haustor, Idoli and Leb i Sol, and also numerous important foreign stars for the domestic market including: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Madonna, U2, David Bowie, Queen, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode etc. The company also owned a chain of record shops across Yugoslavia. Many Yugoslav entries in the Eurovision Song Contest were signed with Jugoton including the 1989 winners Riva. =Croatian independence= After the transition from socialist state to parliamentary democracy in 1989, the question of Croatia's self-determination from Yugoslavia was raised. In 1991, shortly before the declaration of Croatian independence and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the company's name Jugoton, a portmanteau word of Jugoslavija (Yugoslavia) and tone, was changed to Croatia Records. Parallelly, the major labels in Serbia and Slovenia such as PGP RTB and ZKP RTLJ were renamed to PGP-RTS and ZKP RTVS respectively. The company was inherited by the now-independent Republic of Croatia and since the previous economic system was abandoned, it was privatized. Since the year of 2000, Croatia Records is managed by professionals from the music industry joined in the partnership company called AUTOR d.o.o. (limited company).http://www.poslovni.hr/63664.aspx In 2001, the musician Miroslav ≈†koro became the leader of Croatia Records, until his resignation in 2006.24 Sata newspaper, July 30, 2006: (Google cache version) Croatia Records Music Publishing Croatia Records Music Publishing (CRMP d.o.o.) is a company owned by Croatia Records d.d. that specializes in the regulation of conditions of use of copyright music and digital distribution.

Early life Byford was born the youngest of four children to Earnest Charles and Irene Byford. He has a brother, a half-sister from his father's side, Enid, who is 20 years older than him and a half-brother Michael from his mother. Byford was just 11 years old when his mother died. \\"Being so young,\\" he says, \\"it was a crushing blow. But that, I think, is when that will to survive was built in.‚Äù Only two years later his father, whom Byford describes as a violent alcoholic, suffered a terrible accident while at work at a textile mill, losing an arm after it was entangled in a piece of heavy machinery. He joined a youth club band at 14. When he was 15, in 1966, having left school to work as a junior carpenter, his first steady girlfriend, Linda, fell pregnant. They were promptly married. But the marriage didn't last, even though the couple had two children. At 18, in 1969, he was employed at the Shuttle Eye pit at Flockton, near Huddersfield. At six-foot-one he was considered too tall to work underground, in tunnels only three feet high.

Musical career He was taught to play guitar by his best friend's brother, who led a local blues group. Byford switched to bass, and passed through various bands in the Barnsley area. His first appearance on an album was in 1971 when he played flute and wrote a few of the songs on the self titled debut album by psychedelic rockers Jumble Lane, a Holyground Records release. He started singing backing vocals when he joined the Iron Mad Wilkinson Band, named after a local industrialist. Byford sang and played bass with a local power trio called Coast from around 1973 to 1976 along with drummer Al Dodd and future Saxon guitarist Paul Quinn, when he formed Saxon with guitarists Graham Oliver and Paul Quinn, bassist Steve Dawson and former Glitter Band drummer Pete Gill. The band was originally called Son of a Bitch, but changed to Saxon in 1978. They released their self- titled debut album in 1979, and became part of what was known as the new wave of British heavy metal, which also included bands like Iron Maiden, Demon and Def Leppard. The band had commercial success as well, charting eight consecutive UK Top 40 albums and five Top 40 singles between 1980 and 1986. At the end of the 1980s, the band declined in popularity, with 1988's Destiny being their last UK charting album until 2007.

Ideas Dai is known for her early critique of the self-Orientalizing tendencies of filmmakers considered to be part of China's Fifth Generation such as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige. According to Dai, the historical imagery of their films tend to produce \\"oriental landscapes\\" that are oriented towards Western reception and prize recognition. In addition, she has written extensively about the representation of women in Chinese film. In one of her most well-known critiques, she examines the trope of gender-crossing through the myth of Hua Mulan (a woman who disguises herself as a man to join the army as a substitute for her father) in a series of women-centered films such as New Women, and revolutionary operas such as White-Haired Girl and the Red Detachment of Women. For her, this myth usefully indicates how drag, which can be subversive of patriarchal systems, can also reinforce them.

One of her analyses of consumerism in China traces the transformation of the word guangchang, which referred to the politicized space of the public square, but now is often used in the names of shopping centers.

It is a puzzle video game played on a three- dimensional tower-like grid viewed in vector graphics with filled polygons. Background The plot of the game is based on the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. At the height of the tower's construction, while it failed in its original purpose to directly contact God, it caught the attention of a passing Zantorian alien spaceship. The Zantorians descended and left three spider-like robots to help the Shinarians in constructing the tower. However, distrust broke out among the two species, and the humans betrayed the robots, stealing their energy packs (called \\"Klondikes\\"). Playing the robots, it is the player's job to find the energy packs to be able to get back home to Zantor. Gameplay The game play is purely puzzle-based. The famous Tower of Babel itself does not actually appear; instead there are several differently- configured 8*8*4 towers (four floors of 8*8 squares each). The Zantorians robots are called the Grabber, the Pusher and the Zapper. Each of these has different abilities. The Grabber can collect Klondikes and operate various devices, the Pusher can push things further away, and the Zapper can destroy things. In a tower, players can be assigned any combination of these robots, depending on the tower's design. In each tower, the player's goal is either to destroy a set number of objects, collect a set number of Klondikes, or both. Towers with Klondikes to collect need the Grabber, but the other robots can sometimes be superfluous, and indeed, the destruction of these robots is sometimes necessary for the completion of a tower. Everything in the game is viewed in a realistic 3D vector graphics view, but the actual movement in the game is far more contained than in games usually associated with such graphics, only allowing square-by-square movement in rectangular directions and vertical movement using special lifts. Various devices, sentry mechanisms and autonomous robots also inhabit each tower. Some of these can be used to gain an advantage, while some hinder progress. =Editor= Tower of Babel also includes a construction kit where players can design their own towers and save them to disk for later play and distribution. The towers can be password- protected to avoid spoiling them by looking directly at the design. One feature of the game is the ability to program the robots. Each robot can be given up to eight orders (for example: Forward, Forward, Left, Fire, Right, Forward). In some levels, programming the robots is mandatory, as they need to coordinate their actions in order to solve the level. =Game objects= ; Block : Can be pushed around but cannot be shot. ; Converter : Changes laser beams into pushing beams and vice versa. ; Exchanger : When activated by the Grabber, switches places with it and vanishes. Deflects laser beams back to their source. ; Flag : Does nothing but fly in the wind and get in the way. Its only use is to be destroyed. ; Force up/down : When activated by the Grabber, moves all lifts not currently holding something either up or down. ; Freezer : When activated by the Grabber, temporarily freezes everything in the tower except the robots and the lifts. Once used, takes several seconds to recharge. ; Glass block : Can be pushed around. Shooting at it deflects the laser beam back to its source, destroying whoever shot at it. ; Hopper : Hops around in a random fashion. Can be destroyed by shooting it. ; Klondike : The robots' energy pack. Can be collected by the Grabber. ; Lizard : Constantly moves in a straight line. When changing direction, eats away a floor tile. Cannot be shot. ; Mine : When it is pushed next to an object, or an object is pushed next to it, it explodes, destroying everything it touches. ; Prism : Deflects laser beams at a 90¬∞ angle. Can be pushed. ; Pushing cannon : Constantly fires a pushing beam. Comes in two varieties, fixed and rotating. Cannot be shot. ; Time bomb : When the timer reaches zero, it explodes, destroying everything it touches. Can be pushed. ; Watcher : Moves around in a random fashion. Cannot be shot. ; Wiper : When activated by the Grabber, eats away all floor tiles in a cross-shaped pattern with itself at the centre. ; Worm : Constantly moves in a straight line. Shooting at it makes it reverse direction. When trapped, can be pushed sideways. Moving worms cannot be pushed. ; Zapping cannon : Constantly fires a lethal laser beam. Comes in two varieties, fixed and rotating. Can be destroyed by shooting it. Legacy Triogical is a Freeware puzzle game for Microsoft Windows inspired by Tower of Babel. Due to its unique nature and the easily usable editor the game has acquired a small, but very dedicated community of fans. Thanks to emulation software like WinUAE the game can be played on modern PCs and homemade towers swapped via the Internet. Currently there is one remake in the making. In July 2015, a remake for iPhone and iPad was released by Laser Point Software Ltd.

Given the differences in climate and crops around the world, harvest festivals can be found at various times at different places. Harvest festivals typically feature feasting, both family and public, with foods that are drawn from crops that come to maturity around the time of the festival. Ample food and freedom from the necessity to work in the fields are two central features of harvest festivals: eating, merriment, contests, music and romance are common features of harvest festivals around the world. In North America, Canada and the US each have their own Thanksgiving celebrations in October and November. In Britain, thanks have been given for successful harvests since pagan times. Harvest festival is traditionally held on the Sunday near or of the Harvest Moon. This is the full moon that occurs closest to the autumn equinox (22 or 23 September). The celebrations on this day usually include singing hymns, praying, and decorating churches with baskets of fruit and food in the festival known as Harvest Festival, Harvest Home, Harvest Thanksgiving or Harvest Festival of Thanksgiving. In British and English-Caribbean churches, chapels and schools, and some Canadian churches, people bring in produce from the garden, the allotment or farm. The food is often distributed among the poor and senior citizens of the local community, or used to raise funds for the church, or charity. Harvest festivals in Asia include the Chinese Mid- Autumn Festival (‰∏≠ÁßãÁØÄ), one of the most widely spread harvest festivals in the world. In Iran Mehrgan was celebrated in an extravagant style at Persepolis. Not only was it the time for harvest, but it was also the time when the taxes were collected. Visitors from different parts of the Persian Empire brought gifts for the king, all contributing to a lively festival. In India, Makar Sankranti, Thai Pongal, Uttarayana, Lohri, and Magh Bihu or Bhogali Bihu in January, Holi in February‚ÄìMarch, Vaisakhi in April and Onam in August‚ÄìSeptember are a few important harvest festivals. Jews celebrate the week-long harvest festival of Sukkot in the autumn. Observant Jews build a temporary hut or shack called a sukkah, and spend the week living, eating, sleeping, and praying inside it. A sukkah has three walls and a semi-open roof, designed to allow the elements to enter. It is reminiscent of the tabernacles Israelite farmers would live in during the harvest, at the end of which they would bring a portion of the harvest to the Temple in Jerusalem.  Customs and traditions  An early harvest festival used to be celebrated at the beginning of the harvest season on 1 August and was called Lammas, meaning 'loaf Mass'. The Latin prayer to hallow the bread is given in the Durham Ritual. Farmers made loaves of bread from the fresh wheat crop. These were given to the local church as the Communion bread during a special service thanking God for the harvest. By the sixteenth century a number of customs seem to have been firmly established around the gathering of the final harvest. They include the reapers accompanying a fully laden cart; a tradition of shouting \\"Hooky, hooky\\"; and one of the foremost reapers dressing extravagantly, acting as 'lord' of the harvest and asking for money from the onlookers. A play by Thomas Nashe, Summer's Last Will and Testament, (first published in London in 1600 but believed from internal evidence to have been first performed in October 1592 at Croydon) contains a scene which demonstrates several of these features. There is a character personifying harvest who comes on stage attended by men dressed as reapers; he refers to himself as their \\"master\\" and ends the scene by begging the audience for a \\"largesse\\". The scene is clearly inspired by contemporary harvest celebrations, and singing and drinking feature largely. The stage instruction reads: > \\"Enter Haruest with a sythe on his neck, & all his reapers with siccles, and > a great black bowle with a posset in it borne before him: they come in > singing.\\" The song which follows may be an actual harvest song, or a creation of the author's intended to represent a typical harvest song of the time: > Merry, merry, merry, cheary, cheary, cheary, Trowle the black bowl to me ; > Hey derry, derry, with a poupe and a lerry, Ile trowle it again to the: > Hooky, hooky, we have shorn, And we have bound, And we have brought Harvest > Home to town. The shout of \\"hooky, hooky\\" appears to be one traditionally associated with the harvest celebration. The last verse is repeated in full after the character Harvest remarks to the audience \\"Is your throat cleare to helpe us sing hooky, hooky?\\" and a stage direction adds, \\"Heere they all sing after him\\". Also, in 1555 in Archbishop Parker's translation of Psalm 126 occur the lines: > \\"He home returnes: wyth hocky cry, With sheaues full lade abundantly.\\" In some parts of England \\"Hoakey\\" or \\"Horkey\\" (the word is spelled variously) became the accepted name of the actual festival itself: > \\"Hoacky is brought Home with hallowing Boys with plum-cake The Cart > following\\". Another widespread tradition was the distribution of a special cake to the celebrating farmworkers. A prose work of 1613 refers to the practice as predating the Reformation. Describing the character of a typical farmer, it says: > \\"Rocke Munday..Christmas Eve, the hoky, or seed cake, these he yeerely > keepes, yet holds them no reliques of popery.\\"Overbury, Thomas Characters: > the Franklin, London, 1613 Early English settlers took the idea of harvest thanksgiving to North America. The most famous one is the harvest Thanksgiving held by the Pilgrims in 1621. National Harvest Thanksgiving ceremony in Poland's Jasna G√≥ra Roman Catholic sanctuary in Czƒôstochowa, Poland. Presidential Harvest Festival in Spa≈Ça, Poland Nowadays the festival is held at the end of harvest, which varies in different parts of Britain. Sometimes neighbouring churches will set the Harvest Festival on different Sundays so that people can attend each other's thanksgivings. Until the 20th century most farmers celebrated the end of the harvest with a big meal called the harvest supper, to which all who had helped in the harvest were invited. It was sometimes known as a \\"Mell-supper\\", after the last patch of corn or wheat standing in the fields which was known as the \\"Mell\\" or \\"Neck\\". Cutting it signified the end of the work of harvest and the beginning of the feast. There seems to have been a feeling that it was bad luck to be the person to cut the last stand of corn. The farmer and his workers would race against the harvesters on other farms to be first to complete the harvest, shouting to announce they had finished. In some counties the last stand of corn would be cut by the workers throwing their sickles at it until it was all down, in others the reapers would take it in turns to be blindfolded and sweep a scythe to and fro until all of the Mell was cut down. Some churches and villages still have a Harvest Supper. The modern British tradition of celebrating Harvest Festival in churches began in 1843, when the Reverend Robert Hawker invited parishioners to a special thanksgiving service at his church at Morwenstow in Cornwall. Victorian hymns such as We plough the fields and scatter, Come, ye thankful people, come and All things bright and beautiful but also Dutch and German harvest hymns in translation helped popularise his idea of harvest festival, and spread the annual custom of decorating churches with home-grown produce for the Harvest Festival service. On 8 September 1854 the Revd Dr William Beal, Rector of Brooke, Norfolk,Dictionary of National Biography held a Harvest Festival aimed at ending what he saw as disgraceful scenes at the end of harvest, and went on to promote 'harvest homes' in other Norfolk villages. Another early adopter of the custom as an organised part of the Church of England calendar was Rev Piers Claughton at Elton, Huntingdonshire in or about 1854. As British people have come to rely less heavily on home-grown produce, there has been a shift in emphasis in many Harvest Festival celebrations. Increasingly, churches have linked Harvest with an awareness of and concern for people in the developing world for whom growing crops of sufficient quality and quantity remains a struggle. Development and Relief organisations often produce resources for use in churches at harvest time which promote their own concerns for those in need across the globe. In the early days, there were ceremonies and rituals at the beginning as well as at the end of the harvest. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica traces the origins to \\"the animistic belief in the corn [grain] spirit or corn mother.\\" In some regions the farmers believed that a spirit resided in the last sheaf of grain to be harvested. To chase out the spirit, they beat the grain to the ground. Elsewhere they wove some blades of the cereal into a \\"corn dolly\\" that they kept safe for \\"luck\\" until seed-sowing the following year. Then they plowed the ears of grain back into the soil in hopes that this would bless the new crop. * Church bells could be heard on each day of the harvest. * A corn dolly was made from the last sheaf of corn harvested. The corn dolly often had a place of honour at the banquet table, and was kept until the following spring. * In Cornwall, the ceremony of Crying The Neck was practiced. Today it is still re-enacted annually by The Old Cornwall Society. * The horse bringing the last cart load was decorated with garlands of flowers and colourful ribbons. * A magnificent Harvest feast was held at the farmer's house and games played to celebrate the end of the harvest.

Elliott is represented on the Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 2 (West Neighborhoods), and uses the ZIP code 15220. History Beginning as a portion of the now-defunct Township of Chartiers and existing for a brief time as an independent borough, Elliott was annexed by the City of Pittsburgh in two pieces; the southern half in 1906 and the northern half in 1921. Elliott grew quickly during this time as a dense and thriving residential community, due to its proximity to downtown Pittsburgh and direct access to several arterial roads and streetcar lines. In the latter half of the twentieth century, however, the neighborhood was affected adversely by industrial decline, economic hardship, and mass emigration to Pittsburgh's then developing suburbs, as well as numerous other socioeconomic factors that affected the region at that time. Today, the West End Elliott Citizens Council is an active community group located in the heart of the neighborhood and is working to help reverse this deterioration. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire houses Engine 30 and Truck 30 in Elliott. Attractions Elliott is home to West End Park which was voted one of Pittsburgh's best- planned community parks. Elliott also contains one of Pittsburgh's most visited attractions, the West End Overlook, which recently underwent a two- year, $2.1 million renovation . Elliott is also home to numerous churches, historic homes, and a newly built senior retirement facility. Its former community public school, Thaddeus Stevens Elementary, closed in 2012 after 73 years of operation. City Steps The Elliott neighborhood has 20 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Elliott, the Steps of Pittsburgh connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel throughout the hilly streets.The Valonia Street city steps in Elliott, Pittsburgh.

Trivia * A notable street in Elliott is called \\"Rue Grande Vue.\\" It is the address of a group of homes known locally as the \\"Ten Commandments,\\" that have an impressive view of the skyline of Pittsburgh similar to the West End Overlook. One of the homes has been demolished, so there are only 9 now. * According to some older residents of Elliott, the neighborhood was once nicknamed \\"dogtown\\" because many of the locals owned dogs as pets.

Menashe Heights) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located on the Menashe plateau between the Carmel mountain range and the Jezreel Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megiddo Regional Council. In , it had a population of . Geography Ramot Menashe is located in the Menashe Heights, after which the kibbutz is named. The kibbutz is surrounded by open terrain, mostly agricultural lands worked by members of the kibbutz. The main traffic routes connecting the kibbutz to its surroundings are Highway 6 and Route 672. According to Benny Morris, the kibbutz is located on land close to Daliyat al-Rawha', a depopulated Palestinian village, while Walid Khalidi notes that the land of Ramot Menashe actually belonged to the former village of Sabbarin. History In 1946, a gar'in of the Hashomer Hatzair movement, made up of Holocaust survivors and Jewish insurgents from Austria and Poland was established. The gar'in was named \\"Bone HaNegev\\" (builders of the Negev) and the members planned to build a settlement in the Negev. In April 1946, the members of the gar'in boarded a ship in La Spezia, Italy along with 1,400 other Jewish holocaust survivors, but the British discovered the ship and prevented it from sailing. The citizens of La Spezia sent food and aid to the ship and put pressure on the British to allow the ship to sail to Palestine, and eventually the British allowed the ship to sail. On 18 May 1946, the members arrived in Palestine. Despite their desire to settle in the Negev, they were sent to Ein HaShofet and Dalia for training and on 29 July, 1948, they settled as a kibbutz, numbering 64 members. The kibbutz served as a military outpost during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and after the war, the members moved to a nearby location. They started clearing the land and planting trees. Living conditions were harsh during the early days, when the members lived in barracks and tents, disconnected from water and electricity. In November 1948, the kibbutz adopted the name \\"Ramot Menashe\\". During the early years, the kibbutz absorbed several gar'ins of Hashomer Hatzair from South America. In 1950, the kibbutz absorbed a group 95 Hashomer Hatzair members from Chile and Uruguay. In 1955, another group of 23 Uruguayan immigrants arrived, and in 1962 another 31 members of a youth group called \\"Eshet\\". In the 1980s, the kibbutz entered an economic crisis as part of the national bank stock crisis. The economic crisis ended in the 1990s, when a strict recovery plan was activated: unprofitable economic sectors were closed, some of the kibbutz's assets were sold to private hands, the community budget was cut and a gradual process of privatization took place. The kibbutz switched the traditional collective structure and moved to a \\"safety net\\" structure. In the early 2000s, the kibbutz built a new neighborhood of 138 households. The residents of the neighborhood are not members of the kibbutz, but enjoy the kibbutz's community services. Thus, the kibbutz reached the limit of households per Israel's National Outline Plan no. 35, which limits the maximum number of households in the kibbutz to 400 until 2020. In 2011, during the nationwide social justice protest, the members of the kibbutz demanded that the government will release land around the kibbutz for its expansion. The main motive was to allow previous members of the kibbutz to return and build their homes in it. Economy The main source of Ramot Menashe's profits comes from industrial activity, while some agricultural sectors are active, such as cowsheds, Avocado groves and field crops. Tourism and entertainment also developed in the kibbutz. Until the 1980s, Ramot Menashe's economy was based on agriculture: crops, plantations, cotton and livestock. In parallel, an effort was made to develop industrial activity, which led to the establishment of the Arad factory. The social structure was collective, where all members received the same salary for different roles and the kibbutz owned most of the property and businesses. After an economic crisis in the 1990s, the kibbutz underwent a series of privatizations and reforms, including the cancellation of equal salaries and the reducing of the collective structure to a social safety net. =Arad Ltd.= The kibbutz owns part of the Arad Ltd. company which manufactures water-meters in a factory located in the kibbutz. The company is run by the kibbutz in partnership with Kibbutz Dalia (the company is based in Dalia). In 2004, the company was issued in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The company owns several other minor companies under the \\"Arad Group\\". =Tourism= *The Kibbutz operates 32 rooms for vacation rental. *The kibbutz used to operate a night club called The Terminal which attracted people from all over the surrounding region. In 2010, the club was closed and a similar club, bearing the same name was built near the Krayot, with no connection to the kibbutz.

Carlson appeared as the host of numerous television programs, most notably on the Saturday edition of The Early Show on CBS News from 2002 to 2005, Fox News‚Äô morning show Fox & Friends from 2005 to 2013 and The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson on Fox News from 2013 to 2016. In July 2016, Carlson filed a lawsuit against then Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes claiming sexual harassment. Subsequently, dozens of other women also stepped forward to accuse Ailes of harassment, and Ailes resigned under pressure. In September 2016, Carlson and 21st Century Fox settled the lawsuit reportedly for $20 million and Carlson received a public apology. Carlson is credited with starting 2016's revolution of the #MeToo movement with her groundbreaking case. Carlson was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People In The World in 2017. She's written two bestselling books, her memoir, Getting Real and the New York Times Bestseller Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back. Carlson has interviewed every Presidential candidate and President over the last two decades. It was announced that Carlson would join PeopleTV as a Special Contributor in October 2020.Gretchen Carlson To Join ‚ÄòPeople (the TV Show!)‚Äô Team As Special Contributor at Deadline; by Alexandra Del Rosario; published October 1, 2020; retrieved October 3, 2020  Early life and education  Gretchen Carlson was born in 1966 in Anoka, Minnesota to Karen (n√©e Hyllengren) and Lee Carlson. Gretchen's father studied Business at Gustavus Adolphus College and later became the President of Main Motor Sales Co. a family owned car dealership that belonged in the Carlson family for 100 years from 1919 to 2019. Gretchen's first job as a teenager was at the car dealership answering the telephone. The business was sold in February 2020. Gretchen's mother was a schoolteacher and homemaker, and later served as CEO of the Carlson family car dealership from 2004 to 2019. Her mother studied to be a teacher at Gustavus Adolphus College and The University of Minnesota. Gretchen is the second child of four children. Carlson is of Swedish descent and was raised in a Lutheran household. Her grandfather was the pastor of the then second-largest Lutheran church in the United States. Growing up, Carlson would travel with her grandfather on international mission trips to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, helping shape her perspective on philanthropy at a young age. One of her childhood babysitters was Michele Bachmann, the future Republican congresswoman who also ran for president. Carlson's hometown of Anoka, Minnesota is the \\"Halloween Capital of the World\\" and hosts the state's second largest parade, which Carlson served as Grand Marshal in 2004. In her youth, Carlson was a prodigy violinist who performed on radio and television. She studied with the most prominent violin teacher in the world, Dorothy Delay, at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She also studied with Mary West of the MacPhail Center For Music in Minneapolis. Carlson competed in several competitions such as the Stulberg International String Competition where she was a finalist in 1982, the American String Teachers Association where she won 2nd place in 1981 to Joshua Bell who became a world famous concert violinist, and the Friends of Minnesota Orchestra which she won in 1979, performing as a soloist with the Minnesota Orchestra as a prize at just 13 years old. She attended Aspen Music Festival from 1976 to 1983 and was a member of the Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphony from 1980 to 1984. Carlson graduated from Anoka-Hennepin School District 11's Anoka High School, where she was a 1984 class valedictorian. In 1984, Carlson was elected as one of the Anoka Homecoming attendants. She won the title of Miss Minnesota in 1988. Carlson was crowned Miss Minnesota in June 1988 and became Miss America 1989 on September 10, 1988. She was the first classical violinist to ever win the title. Following Carlson's Miss America win, she was invited to meet President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office. She made many television appearances during her year of service, including appearing on The David Letterman Show, where he jokingly asked her out on a date. After Carlson's appearance as a newscaster in a sketch on Bloopers and Practical Jokes with Ed McMahon and Dick Clark, television agents began calling, eventually launching her career in broadcast television. Carlson graduated from Stanford University in 1990 with honors, where she studied organizational behavior. While there, she spent a study- abroad period at Oxford University, studying the works of Virginia Woolf. She was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Carlson planned to attend law school after Stanford and completed the LSAT exam, but instead focused on a career in broadcast journalism. In September 2011, Carlson was named to the inaugural class of the Anoka High School Hall of Fame.  Advocacy  = Me Too movement = On July 6, 2016, Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News chairman Roger Ailes in the Superior Court of New Jersey and confirmed on her Twitter account that she was no longer with Fox News. In her complaint, Carlson alleged that she was fired from her program for refusing Ailes's sexual advances. Ailes at the time claimed the accusations were false, while the law firm representing Carlson claimed ten other women had contacted them to speak of Ailes' behavior at Fox News and throughout his television career. Carlson's allegations received widespread media coverage. After Carlson came forward, six more women spoke to Gabriel Sherman of New York magazine, alleging that Ailes had sexually harassed them and that Ailes \\"spoke openly of expecting women to perform sexual favors in exchange for job opportunities.\\" Shortly thereafter, Carlson sat down for an interview with John Koblin of The New York Times, saying, \\"I wanted to stand up for other women who maybe facing similar circumstances.\\" As the case progressed, Carlson reached out directly to her fans, thanking them in a series of Twitter videos and offering her support for fellow victims of sexual harassment. She also criticized Fox's attempt to force her claims to be adjudicated via closed-door mandatory arbitration rather than in court. Fox filed court papers arguing that Carlson was compelled by her contract to adjudicate her claims in arbitration. Carlson said: \\"Forcing victims of sexual harassment into secret arbitration proceedings is wrong, because it means nobody finds out what really happened.\\" After Ailes resigned on July 21, 2016, Carlson said she felt \\"relief that now I would be believed,\\" though she also \\"felt angry that it took so long\\" for Ailes to step down. On September 6, 2016, 21st Century Fox announced that it had settled the lawsuit with Carlson. The settlement was reportedly $20 million. As part of the settlement, 21st Century Fox apologized to Carlson, saying, \\"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve.\\" = Philanthropy and public work = Since her harassment complaint became public, Carlson has focused her public work to modify laws that protect predators. In December 2017, she joined a bi-partisan coalition of legislators to introduce the ‚ÄúEnding Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act,‚Äù which voids forced arbitration agreements that prevent sexual harassment survivors from getting their day in court. Co-sponsors of the bill were Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Lindsay Graham (R-SC) and Representatives Cheri Bustos (D-IL) and Elise Stefanik (R-NY). The bill was reintroduced in the House in February 2019. Carlson testified before the House Judiciary Committee in May, 2019. Carlson created the \\"Gift of Courage Fund\\" in 2017 and partnered with the nonprofit organization All In Together to create the Gretchen Carlson Leadership Initiative, (GCLI) a program meant to \\"bring civic leadership and advocacy training to thousands of underserved women across the country, with a special focus on empowering women who have experienced gender-based violence, discrimination, or harassment.\\" The initiative has hosted 13 community engagement workshops since its founding. In 2018, Carlson's Gift of Courage Fund also supplied the grant to create the Gretchen Carlson March of Dimes Advocacy Fellows, a program that selected 20 women from across the country to become more civically involved in promoting legislation and policies benefitting women and children. More recently, Carlson created the non-profit organization ‚ÄúLift Our Voices‚Äù with the mission of eradicating arbitration clauses in employment contracts and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that serve to silence women and men in the workplace. Carlson is a longtime supporter of Miss You Can Do It, a pageant with an emphasis \\"not on looks but courage.\\" Founded by Abbey Curran, a former Miss Iowa USA winner who was born with cerebral palsy, the pageant honors girls and young women who live with special needs and challenges. It was the subject of an HBO documentary in 2013. In 2016, Carlson served as the pageant's MC. When its organizers fell short of their fundraising goals (threatening the cancellation of the pageant), Carlson volunteered to cover the remaining expenses. On social media, the pageant thanked her for \\"saving Miss You Can Do It.\\" Carlson serves on the Global Leadership Board of the Times Up Foundation, the March of Dimes National Board as a Trustee, the Catherine Violet Hubbard Foundation Gala Committee, the Greenwich Academy Board, and on the Advisory Committee of The Press Forward. She is also a member of Women Moving Millions, a global collective of women making unprecedented gifts of $1 million or more for the advancement of women and girls. In 2017, Carlson was named one of Times Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World, was the recipient of the prestigious Matrix Award, and was named to Variety's Most Powerful Women Of Impact list. In 2018, she received the 2018 YWCA Phenomenal Woman Award and the New York National Organization of Women (NOW) Women of Power and Influence Award. In 2020, Carlson received the Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor Lifetime Achievement Award from the Arizona Foundation for Women. In July 2020, Carlson headlined a panel with Bethenny Frankel on how global emergencies affect philanthropic priorities for Town & Country's 2020 Philanthropy Summit. = Lift Our Voices = At The Hollywood Reporter's 2019 Women in Entertainment ceremony, Carlson spoke about her lawsuit against Fox News over sexual harassment and announced her new anti-nondisclosure agreements initiative, Lift Our Voices, (LOV) which she founded with former Fox News colleagues Julie Roginsky and Diana Falzone. The organization advocates for laws banning the use of arbitration clauses in employment contracts and confidentiality agreements in sexual harassment settlements. The initiative focuses on NDA's solely dealing with toxic workplace environment issues like sexual harassment, not those protecting trade secrets. In November 2020, lawsuits discovered by Business Insider found that multiple women had stated in legal filings that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and presidential candidate, fostered a toxic, fraternity-like culture at his company during the 1990s. Carlson's organization LOV asked every Presidential candidate to sign on to supporting Lift Our Voices in January 2020. Every candidate did except for President Donald J. Trump, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg. Soon thereafter, Carlson's organization wrote an op-ed in The Des Moines Register encouraging the debate moderators in Iowa to ask the Democratic presidential candidates about their stance on NDA's. The question did appear on the debate state and after appearing in his first and only presidential debate, Bloomberg ended his campaign partly due to the heavy scrutiny surrounding the topic of NDAs. Career =Early career and CBS News= President Ronald Reagan in 1988 A year after becoming Miss America in 1989, Carlson secured a role on WRIC-TV, an ABC-affiliated television station serving Richmond, Virginia as a co-anchor on the network and political commentator. Style Weekly deemed it a coup for WRIC-TV at the time. In 1992, she joined WCPO-TV, serving Cincinnati, Ohio as a media commentator and remained at the station for a period of two years. She later worked at WOIO/WUAB in Cleveland, Ohio, where Carlson and her colleague Denise Dufala, became the first women to co-anchor a primetime major-market newscast. Following her time in Cleveland, Carlson served as a weekend anchor and reporter for KXAS-TV in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, from 1998 to 2000. In both Dallas and Cleveland, Carlson performed her own rendition of The Star- Spangled Banner on the violin for Major League Baseball games. Carlson moved to the national television scene as a national correspondent in 2000 and in 2002, she became the co-anchor of the Saturday edition of The Early Show on CBS along with Russ Mitchell. Carlson frequently anchored the weekend edition of the CBS Evening News during her time at the network. There were several cultural moments that Carlson reported on in her early career as a reporter including the Oklahoma City bombing and the O. J. Simpson murder case while at WOIO in Cleveland, and the Timothy McVeigh execution, the September 11 terrorist attacks, and various G7 Summit meetings while at CBS News. =Fox News= Carlson first appeared on Fox & Friends as a weekend substitute host in 2006. On September 25, 2006, after a shifting of anchors, which included E.D. Hill moving to the 10 a.m. hour of Fox News Live, Carlson became the anchor of Fox & Friends. She co-hosted with Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade for almost 8 years. In 2012, Gretchen walked off the set of Fox & Friends when on- air colleagues made offensive comment about women in the workplace. In 2013, Carlson admitted on Brian Kilmeade's radio show that Fox News female anchors were not allowed to wear pants. Despite dress code restrictions, Carlson was known for doing push-ups when military personnel were guests on the show. Carlson returned to Fox and Friends in 2014 during a Cooking With Friends segment with her children and again in 2015 to promote her memoir Getting Real. Carlson left Fox & Friends in September 2013 to anchor a one-hour daytime program, The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson, beginning in the fall of 2013, taking part of the slot opened by Megyn Kelly's move to primetime. Gretchen began covering stories that supported women's rights, including a piece on Robin Wright of the Netflix series House of Cards demanding the same salary as Kevin Spacey. In 2013, Gretchen became the first cable news television anchor to go on air with no makeup. Just three weeks before she was fired, she came forward in support of the assault weapons ban. During her tenure at Fox News Carlson covered multiple world events including both of President Obama's Inauguration, the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, and the Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention in 2008 and 2012. = 2016‚Äìpresent =  Miss America Organization  On January 1, 2018, Carlson was elected chairwoman of the board of directors of the Miss America Organization, a volunteer position. Shortly after joining as Chairwoman, Carlson's first major decision was to remove the swimsuit competition from the pageant, following a unanimous vote from the Board of Directors. It was reported on CNN that Carlson's goals were to transition the pageant into \\"Miss America 2.0\\", where the swimsuit competitions would be replaced with on-stage interviews. The move aimed to shift focus from appearances to achievements, in light of the Me Too movement. The move divided opinion mostly within the organization. In early 2019, it was announced that the Miss America brand would return to NBC. The return was seen as a coup for Miss America under Carlson's leadership, as it would raise much- needed funds prior to its 100th anniversary. After securing the network deal, Carlson resigned from Chairwoman of the Board in June 2019. Miss America 2020, Camille Schrier, said that she used to struggle with an eating disorder and \\"chose not to compete\\" in Miss America until the competition got rid of the swimsuit competition.  Other television and media  In April 2018, Carlson reached a first-look development deal with A&E; Networks, under which she would host three documentary specials across its channels, such as Lifetime. Gretchen Carlson: Breaking the Silence focuses on the every woman story of workplace sexual harassment and premiered on Lifetime on January 14, 2019. In May 2018, Carlson was a correspondent on an episode of the television documentary series America Divided, which airs on Epix. Carlson produced her episode with Norman Lear, titled \\"Washington's War on Women\\" about sexual harassment on Capitol Hill. Carlson also hosted Live PD Presents: Women on Patrol and Escaping Polygamy on Lifetime in 2018. In August 2019, it was announced that Carlson would host of two hourlong documentaries from the \\"Beyond the Headlines\\" franchise. The first called Escaping the NXIVM Cult: A Mother's Fight to Save Her Daughter, and the second The College Admissions Scandal. In December 2019, Carlson wrote an opinion article in New York Times, stating that she still cannot disclose what happened to her due to a nondisclosure agreement, but that it was her desire to be able to do so. In January 2020, Carlson announced a new television deal with Blumhouse Productions to produce a new interview style series.Gretchen Carlson to Host Interview Show From Blumhouse TV at Hollywood Reporter; by Rick Porter; published January 3, 2020; retrieved September 15, 2020 In October 2020, it was announced that Carlson would join PEOPLE (the TV Show!) as a Special Contributor. In the new program from PeopleTV, Carlson will highlight everyday American heroes.  In popular culture  Carlson with Naomi Watts in 2019. Gretchen Carlson has appeared on magazine covers ranging from Good Housekeeping to Time. Vanessa Bayer regularly impersonated Carlson during her tenure on NBC's Saturday Night Live. Jon Stewart dedicated an entire segment to Carlson on The Daily Show criticizing her for dumbing herself down to connect with the Fox News audience who he says, \\"sees intellect as an elitist flaw.\\" = The Loudest Voice miniseries = In 2019, Carlson's career at Fox News was portrayed on the Showtime miniseries, The Loudest Voice. Her role as co-anchor at Fox News was depicted by actress Naomi Watts. Watts stated in interviews that the story of Carlson was \\"inspiring\\" and that she dealt with multiple scenarios with \\"dignity and grace.\\" Other cast members included Russell Crowe as Roger Ailes, Seth MacFarlane as Brian Lewis and Sienna Miller as Beth Tilson. The fifth episode in the series portrayed the deteriorating working relationship between Carlson and Ailes from 2012 onwards. Many incidents were portrayed to the public for the first time, since Carlson was unable to speak directly about the events, due to a confidentiality clause in the settlement between her and Fox News. The Loudest Voice portrayed a number of events at Fox News which were set up by executives to discredit Carlson shortly before she left the organization. Naomi Watts spoke of one such event in an interview, where a random guest was put on her show shortly before it aired live, with the sole goal of attacking Carlson on live television. The series aired the audio recordings taken by Carlson during her time at Fox News for the first time. The recordings were of various incidents at Fox where Carlson was sexually harassed by Ailes and other colleagues at Fox News. The show also follows the incidents leading up to Carlson reporting the sexual harassment she received. The Loudest Voice then portrayed her demotion and the events that followed her filing the internal complaint, many of which were recorded. The recordings went on to play a major part in the settlement negotiations between Carlson and Fox News. = Bombshell film= Bombshell, a film portraying Carlson's career at Fox News, was released on December 13, 2019. Carlson is played by Nicole Kidman, with other cast members including Margot Robbie as Kayla Pospisil (a composite character), Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, and John Lithgow as Roger Ailes. The film follows events at Fox News in the run-up to Ailes resigning from the organization after being exposed for sexual harassment.

She announced on Fox & Friends on June 9, 2009, also repeated on Glenn Beck's Fox News program, that her parents' car dealership had been selected for closure as part of the General Motors reorganization and bankruptcy. A year later, the Star Tribune reported that \\"It took an act of Congress, a national TV appeal and maybe a little bit of history on the owners' side, but Main Motor, the Anoka car dealership that Lee and Karen Carlson's family has owned for 91 years, will keep its General Motors dealership after all.\\" Despite both having worked for Fox News, she is of no relation to commentator Tucker Carlson. Carlson remains an advocate of the arts from her experience as a child violinist. Both of Carlson's children are pianists.

Within homeroom, administrative documents are distributed, attendance is marked, announcements are made and students are given the opportunity to plan for the day. Such classes also act as a form of Pastoral care, where teachers and administrators provide personal, social or health advice. Homerooms differ in their nature, depending on the country and the specific school.  Homerooms by country  = Afghanistan = In Afghanistan, the home room concept (ŸÜ⁄Øÿ±ÿßŸÜ) is widely used in schools. The home room teacher is responsible for almost everything concerning their class. At the start of the school year, it's the homeroom teacher's responsibility to make sure that everyone gets their textbooks and materials, which are supplied by the government. The teacher is also responsible for the attendance. = Argentina = Home room is a concept that does not exist in Argentinian schools, as a single classroom is often used for all assignments (except for lab work or outdoors exercise). Students usually stay in groups of twenty to forty for at least two years without being reshuffled, and often maintain the same grouping throughout both primary and secondary education, with only the group's room and assigned member of staff changing. Typically, Argentine schools will have a 15‚Äì30 minute form period in the morning, a one-hour period for lunch, and a similar period after lunch, albeit not all schools are required to have classes in both the morning and the afternoon. Schools (particularly private ones) will often use classes in the afternoon for secondary languages (English, French, etc.) and sports activities. Students are usually not given much choice in the subjects they study and they all are subject to most academic subjects. The main choice a student has to make in entering secondary school is in deciding a high school that leans towards general knowledge (\\"bachiller\\", which encompasses arts and a general overview of science), economics (\\"comercial\\", whose orientation is towards math, primarily oriented towards accounting and business), engineering (\\"t√©cnico\\" whose orientation is towards engineering and sciences) or pedagogical (\\"normal\\", whose orientation is forming elementary school teachers). Each school is given a lot of latitude in terms of extracurricular activities (teaching of secondary languages, sports, etc.). Argentina educational system is often in flux, as the government changes the curriculum and number of required classes every five years or so. = Australia = Australian homeroom is similar to the US concept, however it varies from school to school. Some schools do not have home room at all, and attendance and announcements are made during the first period of the school day in a \\"student bulletin\\", while other schools run a home room system which is identical to that run in American schools. Alternative names for home room in Australia are \\"admin\\" or \\"administration,\\" \\"form-class,\\" \\"form-period,\\" \\"roll- call\\" or \\"DEAR\\" (drop everything and read). Most schools, as well as having a form-class, also have an \\"assembly\\" which is attended by the entire population of the school. This often entails announcements, advertising for various aspects of school life and listening to or singing along with the national anthem. In many private schools, usually Catholic schools, home room is referred to as \\"PCG\\" (pastoral care group) where the teacher is called a \\"PCA\\" (pastoral care advisor). As in Romania, a 'PCA' also performs the role of a counsellor. = Austria = In Austrian education, from lower secondary schools on, each class mostly stays in the same classroom and teachers move between the classes. Each class has a homeroom teacher (named \\"Klassenvorstand\\" in Austrian German, \\"form teacher\\" in British English). There may be special hours reserved for announcements etc., but Homeroom teachers perform such activities either during regular lesson periods, or a so-called \\"Klassenvorstandsstunde\\", which could roughly be translated as \\"form teacher period\\", which are mandatory for the students. Additionally the attendance is usually checked at the beginning of every period. = Bangladesh = In Bangladesh a homeroom teacher, also referred to as \\"class teacher\\", has the duty of taking attendance records of students in a class and making any minor announcements not covered during assembly. = Canada = Home room in Canadian schools follows the US model as well, but the timing of it differs depending on the school district (and, in many cases, varies by the individual school). Some schools do not have homerooms but the day is broken into 5 periods. = China = In China, students often do not move between classes for different lessons and have a 10-minute period in which additional home room tasks can be done. Often these tasks include the collection or distribution of homework or the cleaning of the classroom. In competitive schools, the composition of home room classes is sometimes based on ability in one or more core subjects. For example, students with a talent for science and math might be grouped together in one home room, while students with more practical or artistic skills are put together in another. In such cases, the class' home room teacher often specializes in one of the core areas used to select his or her class, in addition to provide both academic and life advice to students. There will usually also be a student elected by the others as a class monitor to assist their teachers with homeroom tasks and act as intermediary between the teachers and students. = France = The equivalent in France is the professeur(e) principal(e), who teaches the class in a specific subject (as do other teachers) but accepts additional duties such as distributing administrative documents, giving advice on courses to follow, acting as intermediary in cases of conflict, collating other teachers' impressions of the class and of individual students in preparation for the quarterly report, and various other tasks. For this they receive a small salary bonus. = Germany = For Germany, basically the same is true as for Austria (the teacher is called \\"Klassenlehrer\\"). Teachers normally do not receive a salary bonus but are expected to take classes in turn. = India and Pakistan = In both India and Pakistan, a homeroom teacher is referred to as a class teacher. A class teacher teaches his or her subject in the homeroom and takes the attendance records of students in a class and distributes administrative documents, gives advice on courses to follow, acts as intermediary in cases of conflict, collates other teachers' impressions of the class and of individual students in preparation for the quarterly report, and does various other tasks such as making small announcements regarding trips, etc. = Japan = Home room in Japanese schools forms a greater part of students' lives, with home room teachers acting as a substitute parent in many ways. Students usually have the same home room teacher and fellow students during their entire life at a given school. Students are expected to take on tasks for their home room, including cleaning, day duty (note-taking and classroom organisation), and the organisation of competitive events between home room classes. Students also often eat lunch in their home room. Since teachers must usually travel to the students' home room, rather than students going to a classroom dedicated to a particular subject, the depth of lessons often suffers. Teachers must carry all materials needed for multiple classes, therefore the lessons usually end up taking on a lecture style with students simply taking notes in preparation for testing. = Jordan = In Jordan, the home room concept (ŸÖÿ±ÿ®Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿµŸÅ) is widely used in schools. The homeroom teacher is responsible for almost everything concerning their class. At the start of the school year, it's the homeroom teacher's responsibility to make sure that everyone gets their textbooks and materials, which are supplied by the government. = Malaysia = In Malaysia, most government national schools uses a homeroom system similar to the Japanese as schools and the school life of students in Malaysia have retained some form of influence from them during the Japanese Occupation. Students in primary school often stay in the same homeroom from Standard 1 to Standard 6. In secondary school, students also stay in the same homeroom from Form 1 to 3. In Form 4‚Äì5, the students will be separated based on the streams (Science or Arts) they chose, however this may change in 2020 as the government is currently changing its education policy.https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/539839/no-more-artsscience- streams-form-four-next-year However, some schools have a segregation system where better performing students get shifted to a different class (usually with better teachers) while those who perform poorly or have disciplinary issues get shifted to the more under-performing classes (naughty classes or behind classes), these classes usually have newer teachers. The performances of the students are taken from their annual examination average or overall position in the school near the end of the school year to determine their classes in the following school year. This encourages competition among the students and acts as an incentive to do well in exams while discouraging complacency among the smarter students. However there has been plans since 2018 to abolish such system, allowing equal treatment and opportunities among all the students while allowing the better performing students to help the under-performing ones.https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2018/01/18/ending-segregation-of- students-teachers-must-prepare-for-bigger-challenge/1557053 This also prevents segregation among the students and bias from the teachers. Since the students stay in the same classroom for all subjects, the teachers are the ones that have to travel to the classes, except for subjects that require the use of lab equipment, art equipment or other specialised tools. Students are also given tasks and a duty roster to clean their classroom, decorate their classrooms for events and celebrations, plan and organise events for carnival day or sports day. Most meetings are held before classes start, during the short break times between subjects or during recess. These meetings are often managed by the class monitor, assistant monitor, secretary, treasurer and other members of the class committee. Sometimes, these meetings are held with the school prefects or teachers. The schools will also have assemblies before the students go their class. A 'big assembly' is held every Monday to raise the national flag, sing the anthems and is often when the principal give important speeches or announcements, along with other teachers. This assembly is longer than the usual ones held on other days of the week, where students just gather for a short while before entering their classes. 'Small assemblies' like these are often just announcements without the principal or singing of the anthems. Sometimes prefects are the ones running these small assemblies with or without the supervision of a teacher. It gives them a chance to perform surprise spot-checks or uniform checks. The term \\"homeroom\\" is hardly used, instead students use \\"form teacher\\" or \\"guru tingkatan\\" or \\"‰∏ª‰ªªËÄÅÂ∏à\\" referring to the teacher in charge of the class. Usually one teacher is assigned to one class who will manage the same class until they graduate. Since these teachers spent years with their students, many of them will return to thank their teachers and keeping in touch after graduation have never been easier since the advent of social media. = Netherlands = In the Netherlands, the students are put in a group which more or less stays the same during their high school career. Those groups are sorted into levels, depending on a test children take at the end of primary school and their teachers' advice. Those levels determine how long you stay in high school and what kind of school you can attend after high school. Usually, the only reason to switch groups is when you go up a level or drop a level at the end of a year, based on your grades and performance. This, students always take all classes with exactly the same group, have lunch breaks at the same time, etcetera. Each group is assigned a mentor, which is a teacher who teaches a certain subject to multiple groups at every level. In the meantime, these mentors are responsible for their students well-being, grades and performance, group dynamics and more. They're also there to advise students regarding choices they have to make like, what school to go to next or what career to pick and help them with personal issues, and most of them plan a few fun activities or trips during the school year. All of this has to happen during the mentor's own class, as there is no homeroom. However, some schools schedule a mentor class once a week or once a month, and most mentors make time to talk to each student once or twice in private before or after school. = New Zealand = Home room (or \\"form-class\\") in New Zealand is similar to the US concept, however it varies from school to school. It's mostly used in high schools, because classes are taught by different subject teachers. Classmates in the same form class often split up for different subjects. Morning form combine form period and roll call in the morning, and a period called DEAR (\\"Drop Everything and Read\\"), \\"SSR\\", or silent sustained reading occurs after lunch. Form classes can precede the first period and take place after the school assembly. = Panama = Home room in Panamanian schools is similar to the US model. However, it is not an optional period as all students are required to attend home room sessions every Monday morning (in rare cases, every day). It is called 'Consejer√≠a' (Counseling) and takes place every Monday morning as the first period. The teacher fulfills the role of a counselor (consejero), as s/he is in charge of registering attendance, collecting homework and other assignments, and make announcements. Students are expected to take on tasks for their home room including cleaning, leading morning prayer, leading classroom organization, homework and handling homework and assignments. The homeroom period may also be used for reading and writing after main activities have been fulfilled. = Romania = Homeroom is practiced in all educational institutions in Romania under the name of Dirigen≈£ie, which takes its name from the title of the homeroom teacher, called Diriginte. He or she also fulfills the role of a counselor. = Russia = Homeroom period in Russian schools is called \\"klassny chas\\" (class hour). Students of the same grade (\\"the parallel\\") are divided into \\"classes\\"‚Äîgroups of on average 20‚Äì30 people; this varies by school and grade. Classes are assigned letters (or numbers in some schools) to distinguish between them, for example, 6th grade students may be divided into 5 classes: –ê, –ë, –í, –ì, –î, and each class gets a homeroom teacher (klassny rukovoditel). This homeroom teacher schedules the homeroom period approximately once a month and uses it to make announcements and lead students in deciding various matters by voting. = Singapore = Homeroom periods vary between schools in Singapore. Usually homeroom periods are used for class contact time and as an opportunity to discuss what is going on around the school itself. Sometimes students go to the hall for briefing on any important events like a marathon or an exam. Most secondary schools call it Assembly or Form Teacher (FT) period, as the term \\"homeroom\\" is rarely used. = South Korea = Homeroom hour in South Korea takes a significant role in a child's education. Homeroom teachers play many roles; acting as counselors, administrators, and disciplinarians. Homeroom classes in high school are especially important as the students make their transition to college. Homeroom hour starts before first period and also after the last period, lasting between twenty and thirty minutes each time. Teachers use this time to make announcements, discipline students, and take care of other administrative duties. More importantly, teachers take this time to establish order in class. If a teacher is easygoing, the class is more likely to be disruptive. Likewise, if the teacher is strict, the class is more likely to be orderly. School administrators and staff see the homeroom classes as a reflection on the teachers. Moreover, if the class has bad test scores, it is subsequently blamed on the teacher. The homeroom teacher is responsible for pushing the students to do their best. Students often see their homeroom teachers as their role models, and often visit them in the staff room. It is also common for students to stop by to tease the teacher or ask frivolous questions. In the twelfth grade, homeroom teachers especially press the students to do well on their college entrance exams. The twelfth grade homeroom teacher is considered to be the most important teacher in the student's education. Consequently, twelfth grade teachers have a lot of work and are reluctant to take on teaching this grade. After graduating, students often come back and visit their homeroom teachers. It is customary to come with gifts or food. = Spain = In Spain, home room is basically the same as in France. There is one main teacher called tutor. Some schools do have an hour a week of homeroom, being called tutor√≠a, which is usually placed in high school education. = United Kingdom = Although the term homeroom is not used in the United Kingdom, students are usually assigned to a tutor group or form, with a daily registration period which generally serves the same purpose as a homeroom. The groupings and activities within a tutor group vary between schools and age groups; generally speaking, primary school students remain in their form groups for the majority of the time and there is no defined 'form time'. In secondary school, registration periods (or extensions thereof, such as weekly tutorials) may be the only period a form has with their form tutor‚Äîtheir first point of pastoral contact within a school‚Äîand the time is often used for a variety of purposes from administration (taking the register, making announcements, university and career applications) to more general studies such as personal, social and health education. In Scotland, the use of SEEMIS software to monitor attendance has been trialed, which may lead to more integrated period-by-period registration of pupils. = United States = In the United States, homeroom is considered a planning period or registration. It is scheduled often at the first period of the day or it may follow the lunch break. Sometimes it can be at the end of the day after all lessons have finished; some schools have both AM and PM homerooms, in which case the later period is the time to return to the homeroom class and pack up for the day. In schools where the first period of the day is optional, homeroom may be deferred to the second period. During morning homeroom, teachers take attendance registers, may collect lunch orders, and carry out other administrative activities. Announcements may be made, correspondence distributed, and the Pledge of Allegiance recited with the right-hand-on-heart civilian salute rendered.

Career Already having spent a few years in the business, Legowelt has released a dozen or so projects on various formats, most of them on vinyl released on Bunker records, an electronic music label based in The Hague. He has had some mainstream exposure with Disco Rout, originally released on a Ghostly International compilation but licensed by Cocoon Recordings for a full vinyl release, and subsequently voted track of the year 2002 by the German music magazine, Groove. Legowelt began producing music in the early 1990s after he came in contact with the sounds of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably his all-time favourite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and Mr. Fingers. Later this palette of influences grew with early ¬µ-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, and various releases from the Irdial Discs label. He marks his major influence as Unit Moebius, after he heard them on the radio. He describes their sound as \\"a punky palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi Chicago trax and deep detroit jams made with machines which were found next to the garbage can.\\" It was a surprise to him when he later learned that this music came out of The Hague, Holland, the same city he lived in. He later visited the Bunker Records office where he was taken under the wing of such musical mentors as I-f and Melvin White (aka pametex). He claims they \\"lectured him with even more unknown sounds such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco whose production secrets were closely studied.\\" In 1998 Bunker released Legowelt's first vinyl album, Pimpshifter, a 6-track which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as \\"Sturmvogel\\" and \\"Total Pussy Control\\". Apart from producing, Legowelt has been playing live all over the world for the last five years, spending a lot of time together with Orgue Electronique and the infamous Bunker Team. Some aliases and side projects he has are Catnip (with Luke Eargoggle), The Chicago Shags (with Orgue Electronique), Gladio, Smackos, Smackulator (with Speculator), Squadra Blanco, Salamandos, Raheem Hershel and Venom 18. Most of the music of Danny Wolfers is published by Clone Publishing from Rotterdam. Clone also co-released Legowelt's greatest hits album together with Bunker records. In 2006 Legowelt started his own label called Strange life records. Danny Wolfers is the host of the weekly Astro Unicorn Radio Show on Intergalactic FM, an internet radio station. He presents the show using his Smackos alias, and plays a broad range of music including many of his own productions. It was in 2007 that Wolfers started hosting this show on the Cybernetic Broadcasting System, the predecessor of Intergalactic FM.

It was created to compete with the New York Daily News which was then a sensationalist tabloid and the most widely circulated newspaper in the United States. Hearst preferred the broadsheet format and sold the Mirror to an associate in 1928, only to buy it back in 1932. Hearst hired away the Daily News's Philip Payne as managing editor of Mirror. Payne's circulation building stunts ranged from reviving the sensational Hall-Mills murder case to sponsoring and being a passenger on the Old Glory transatlantic flying record attempt, in which he was killed.Stanley Walker, City Editor. New York, F.A.Stokes, 1934. pp. 202-203 Early on, several bright young writers and photographic journalists joined the Daily Mirror, such as Ring Lardner, Jr., Hy Peskin and the political commentator Drew Pearson.Kenneth T. Jackson: The Encyclopedia of New York City: The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. P. 107. The poet-songwriter Nick Kenny was the paper's radio editor, and Edward Zeltner contributed a column. The gossip columnist Walter Winchell and managing editor Emile Gauvreau were both hired away from the New York Evening Graphic, the city's third sensational tabloid. Winchell was given his own radio show and syndicated, in his prime‚Äîthe 1940s and early 1950s‚Äîin more than 2000 daily papers. During the three tabloids' 1920s circulation war, management of the Mirror estimated that its content was 10% news and 90% entertainment. For example, the Mirror and Graphic both had devoted substantial resources to the exploitation of scandal with repeated stories on such events as the divorce trial of real estate tycoon Edward West \\"Daddy\\" Browning who at age 51 had married 16-year-old Frances Belle \\"Peaches\\" Heenan, as well as constant coverage of the decade's celebrities like Rudolph Valentino, Babe Ruth and Charles A. Lindbergh. By the 1930s, the Daily Mirror was one of the Hearst Corporation's largest papers in terms of circulation. However, the paper never became a significantly profitable property as its earnings were mostly destined to support the company's faltering afternoon papers, and in its later years it declined substantially despite numerous efforts to turn things around. Despite having the second-highest daily circulation of an American newspaper at the time, the Daily Mirror closed in 1963, after the 114-day 1962‚Äì63 New York City newspaper strike. The Great Newspaper Strike of 1962-63 also contributed to the death of the Herald- Tribune, the Journal-American and the World-Telegram Sun.

T. Bell (1883‚Äì1960). After a brief chapter on three ancient mathematicians, it covers the lives of about forty mathematicians who flourished in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. The book is illustrated by mathematical discussions, with emphasis on mainstream mathematics. To keep the interest of readers, the book typically focuses on unusual or dramatic aspects of its subjects' lives. Men of Mathematics has inspired many young people, including the young John Forbes Nash Jr., Julia Robinson, and Freeman Dyson, to become mathematicians. It is not intended as a rigorous history, includes many anecdotal accounts, and presents a somewhat idealised picture of mathematicians, their personalities, research and controversies.  Publication  In July 1935, Bell signed a contract with Simon and Schuster, for a book to be titled The Lives of Mathematicians.Reid, p. 273 He delivered the manuscript at the beginning of November 1935 as promised, but was unhappy when the publishers made him cut about a third of it (125,000 words), and, in order to tie in with their book Men of Art (by Thomas Craven), gave it the title Men of Mathematics which he did not like.Reid, pp. 276‚Äì277 He was also unhappy with how long they took to print it: even before he had received his first printed copy in March 1937, he had written and got into print another book, The Handmaiden of the Sciences.Reid, pp. 276‚Äì277 Contents *Zeno (fifth century BC) *Eudoxus (408‚Äì355 BC) *Archimedes (287?‚Äì212 BC) *Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) *Fermat (1601‚Äì1665) *Pascal (1623‚Äì1662) *Newton (1642‚Äì1727) *Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716) *The Bernoullis (17th and 18th century) *Euler (1707‚Äì1783) *Lagrange (1736‚Äì1813) *Laplace (1749‚Äì1827) *Monge (1746‚Äì1818) *Fourier (1768‚Äì1830) *Poncelet (1788‚Äì1867) *Gauss (1777‚Äì1855) *Cauchy (1789‚Äì1857) *Lobachevsky (1793‚Äì1856) *Abel (1802‚Äì1829) *Jacobi (1804‚Äì1851) *Hamilton (1805‚Äì1865) *Galois (1811‚Äì1832) *Sylvester (1814‚Äì1897) *Cayley (1821‚Äì1895) *Weierstrass (1815‚Äì1897) (1850‚Äì1891) *Boole (1815‚Äì1864) *Hermite (1822‚Äì1901) *Kronecker (1823‚Äì1891) *Riemann (1826‚Äì1866) *Kummer (1810‚Äì1893) *Dedekind (1831‚Äì1916) *Poincar√© (1854‚Äì1912) *Cantor (1845‚Äì1918) Comments In the opinion of Ivor Grattan-Guinness the mathematics profession was poorly served by Bell's book: :...perhaps the most widely read modern book on the history of mathematics. As it is also one of the worst, it can be said to have done a considerable disservice to the profession. Eric Bell was criticized in 1983 for incorrectly ascribing the origin of spacetime to Joseph Lagrange: :There is a general impression based on the widely read book of E.T. Bell that Lagrange, in his M√©chanique Analytique, was the first to have connected time to space as a fourth coordinate. ...However, Lagrange did not express these thoughts quite as precisely as Bell seems to imply....Thus, it is far from certain after consulting the original text whether or not Lagrange came close to formulating, even in his own mind, the concept credited to him by Bell. In reviewing the faculty that served with Harry Bateman at Caltech, Clifford Truesdell wrote: :...[Bell] was admired for his science fiction and his Men of Mathematics. I was shocked when, just a few years later, Walter Pitts told me the latter was nothing but a string of Hollywood scenarios; my own subsequent study of the sources has shown me that Pitts was right, and I now find the contents of that still popular book to be little more than rehashes enlivened by nasty gossip and banal or indecent fancy. An impression of the book was given by Rebecca Goldstein in her novel 36 Arguments for the Existence of God. Describing a character Cass Seltzer, she wrote on page 105: :Right now he was reading E. T. Bell‚Äôs Men of Mathematics, which was the best yet, even though it had real mathematics in to slow him down. Some of these people sounded as if they had to be changelings, non-human visitors from some other sphere, with powers so prodigious they burst the boundaries of developmental psychology, lisping out profundities while other children were playing with their toes.Quoted in the College Mathematics Journal 43(3):231 (May 2010) Notes   References  * Constance Reid (1993), The Search for E.

He played rugby union for his country, winning five caps, and scored 19 tries on the tour to Britain and France in 1947-48, including a memorable effort against England at Twickenham. He also played two home Tests against the Lions in 1950 before deciding to concentrate his attentions on cricket, which he played as a left-arm fast-medium bowler. In the 1952 NSWRFL season he played first-grade rugby league for Manly-Warringah. As a cricketer, Walker made his first-class debut for New South Wales at The Gabba in 1948/49 and played for the state until the 1952/53 season. He was selected for the 1949/50 tour of South Africa led by Lindsay Hassett, but was behind the likes of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall in the pecking order and never played Test cricket. He later played county cricket in England for Nottinghamshire, taking 55 wickets in the 1956 season. He performed the unusual feat of taking four wickets in four balls for Nottinghamshire against Leicestershire at Leicester in 1956. Uniquely, he took the last wicket of Leicestershire's first innings (Jack Firth), and then the first three wickets of the second innings with his first three balls (Gerry Lester, Maurice Tompkin and Gerald Smithson).

Withnall was born in Townsville, Queensland, but attended school at Canterbury High School in Sydney. He studied law at the University of Sydney and later moved to the Northern Territory. He served as the Crown Law Officer for the Territory for many years. He was also the first president of the Northern Territory Law Society in 1968. Withnall was appointed to the Northern Territory Legislative Council in 1960 in his capacity as Crown Law Officer. In 1966, he contested and won an elected seat in the Legislative Council. Among Withnall's votes as an elected member included voting against the abolition of capital punishment and opposing women jurors, stating that the latter would happen \\"over my dead body\\". As a Member of the Legislative Council, Withnall made a name for himself as a fierce advocate of self-determination, and took part in the campaign which ultimately led to the creation of the Assembly in 1974. He ran as an independent in the seat of Port Darwin in the first elections, and ultimately became one of only two non-Country Liberal Party members (the other being fellow independent Dawn Lawrie) in the first Assembly. However, he was to only serve one term in the Assembly, and was replaced by the Country Liberal Party's Tom Harris. Withnall died in late 1990, and several condolence motions were presented in the Assembly upon his death. Shane Stone, in his introductory speech upon his election to the Port Darwin electorate in 1990, referred to Withnall as a \\"fearless and uncompromising advocate of self- government and statehood for the Territory\\". In 1994, then-Chief Minister Marshall Perron also praised Withnall's role in the Territory's achievement of self-governance. A 1976 interview with Withnall is on file at the National Library of Australia.

The parish includes the hamlet of Tanis. History The village now mainly consists of modern brick-built houses, but a number of 17th-century buildings still remain in the centre of the village, including the George & Dragon public house. This was pre-dated in the village by another pub, a timber framed and thatched building that was destroyed by fire in 1938; a replacement, the Cross Keys now stands in its place. On the outskirts of Rowde are the Caen Hill flight of locks of the Kennet and Avon Canal. The canal rises 237 feet by means of 29 locks, 16 of them in a straight line at Caen Hill. The canal was constructed between 1794 and 1810 and served to link Devizes with Bristol and London. It fell into disuse after the coming of the railway but has been restored, and is now used for leisure purposes. The small unsignposted hamlet of Rowde Hill, consisting of around 10 houses, lies around west of the village towards Sells Green and Melksham, at the junction of The Common and Berhills Lane. Amenities The parish has a village hall, built in 1887 as Rowde Reading Room and Coffee Tavern. Rowde C of E Primary Academy serves Rowde and nearby villages. Built in 2006, it replaced a school in Marsh Lane which was built in 1841 and extended in 1907. Rowdeford School, to the north of the village, is a Special Needs school built around a country house of 1812. The Church of England parish church is dedicated to St. Matthew and has a 15th-century tower, the rest having been rebuilt in 1832‚Äì3 to designs of Henry Goodridge. It has a font designed in 1850 by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, architect, who was born in Rowde and lived for a time at Rowdeford House (now the home of Rowdeford School). The six bells in the tower were cast in 1870 by John Taylor & Co. The building was Grade II* listed in 1962. Today the parish is part of the Rowde and Bromham benefice, which also covers Sandy Lane. Local government Rowde is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. In the 2001 census, the district ward of Bromham & Rowde had a population of 2,880 persons. Former railway The Devizes Branch Line was built through the parish in 1857 and a small station ‚Äì Bromham and Rowde Halt ‚Äì was added in 1909 at Sells Green, to the west just outside the parish. The line was closed in 1966.

Brain and planned to be released by Jaleco in 1993. It is a scrolling shooter with primarily horizontal movement.  Plot  Chimera Beast takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by monsters known as eaters, capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of the food chain, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player's creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet's humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, eventually make their way to Earth.  Gameplay  The chief innovation of Chimera Beast is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player's eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a venomous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon. Another difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player's eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough to charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well.  Enemies  The enemies in Chimera Beast are mostly animals, some with equivalent Earth versions and some without. Some of the enemy creatures include jellyfish, a lamprey, clownfish, clams, flying squirrels, and moles. Once the player reaches the human stage, they face war vehicles such as tanks and jets.  Technical details  Chimera Beast runs on dual 68000 processors. Sound is provided by a Ym2151 and dual OKI-M6295 chips. Like most games of its time, it uses a standard JAMMA connector. The game uses the Jaleco Mega System 1 Hardware.

It includes a mix of fixed/semi-fixed and mobile networks. It is also designed for interoperability with US and Coalition C4I systems. Army Battle Command System (ABCS) Version 6.4 is an integrated suite that allows troops to obtain an automated view of friendly activity and supply movement; plan fires, receive situation and intelligence reports, view the airspace and receive automatically disseminated weather reports. Advantages * Provides up-to- date logistical information on a map-based display. * Provides for electronic messaging and data exchange with the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and Movement Tracking System (MTS). * ABCS 6.4 allows for a System of Systems (SoS) concept. Ultimately, the SoS will essentially provide the soldiers with the same type of service that the Internet provides to civilians. In the commercial environment, customers can access the Internet from separate computers without even knowing the location of the network they are attached to. In the future, US soldiers will have a similar capability when using ABCS. * ABCS 6.4 is an integrated set of systems that will allow a commander to see multiple systems on one screen and seamlessly pass data from one program to the next. * High levels of integration allow soldiers to more efficiently exploit the tactical network. * Systems such as AMDWS and FAAD allow for Joint Certified Communications such as JREAP-C Disadvantages * These family of systems does not integrate well with GCCS Family of systems which are the DOD Joint Systems. * Corruption of GCCS databases and thus the Common Operational Picture (COP) are very likely when in joint operations * Track looping concerns become high risk in Joint Operations. * ABCS is highly dependent on well established communication pipe lines except for FBCB2 & JCR. * There is no data standardization verification done at the central repository thus invalid data is possible. Systems ABCS combines six packages into a single system: # The Maneuver Control System (MCS) allows the operator to define routes and view overlays to provide situational awareness. MCS is being phased out and replaced with \\"Lightning\\", an ABCS enabled Flash/Java Program that uses the Web Browser interface. It allows users to publish products from CPOF without using the BCS (Battle Command Server) PASS (Publish and Subscribe Service) Server, making Lightning more flexible as it can be used on any Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet-System) as there is no interface software required besides your web browser (Typically IE 8.0 or higher, not compatible with Opera or Firefox at this time.) The system was developed and integrated by Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp. (FACC), Colorado Springs, Colorado.Army Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Funds, Hearings, 1985, pt. 7, p. 84. # The Air and Missile Defense Workstations (AMDWS) provide soldiers with an Air Defense picture, and supports the Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAM- RAAM) Air Defense Artillery (ADA) system by providing an automated defense planning capability for deployed units. # The Battle Command Sustainment & Support System (BCS3) integrates multiple data sources into one program and provides commanders with a visual layout of battlefield logistics. # The All Source Analysis System (ASAS) can analyze incidents and help determine the patterns of Improvised Explosive Device-related incidents. A commander can determine locations that are typical for IED attacks, so that they know to warn their soldiers of such a threat. # The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) plan and execute fires during each phase of action, whether a deliberate attack or defensive operation. AFATDS is fielded to all Active Component Army and Marine Corps units. About 90% of the National Guard has been fielded. AFATDS is installed on large-deck amphibious assault vessels of the United States Navy. # The Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade & Below/Blue Force Tracking (FBCB2/BFT) system uses satellite and terrestrial communications technology to track and display friendly vehicles and aircraft that appear on a computer screen as blue icons over a topographical map or satellite image of the ground. Commanders and Soldiers can add red icons that show up as enemy on the screen, and are simultaneously broadcast to all the other FBCB2/BFT users on the battlefield. There are about 15,000 FBCB2/BFT systems in use today. # The Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) is an automated system for battlefield airspace management. Additional systems that are integrated with the ABCS suite include: * Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) Provides digital Terrain Analysis, terrain data base(s), updated terrain products, and hard copy repro, in support of Terrain Visualization, IPB, C2, and Battle Staff DMP (CORPS/DIV/BDE). * The Global Command and Control System - Army (GCCS-A) provides a common picture of Army tactical operations to the Joint and Coalition community, and facilitates interoperability of systems across Army/Joint theaters, however no true synchronization occurs with PASS/DDS which introducing many issues on the battlefield for Soldiers, Marines, Sailors and Air force personnel.

Introduced in 2002, the Arena is the only form of pickup by Proton, and is the only Proton model to enjoy significantly more popularity in its export market than domestically. The suspension configuration of the Arena consists of a combination of independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14\\" front ventilated discs and 9\\" rear drum brakes with load sensing proportioning valves (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements. Similar to the car it is based on, the Arena is powered by a 1.5-litre, 12-valve Electronically Fuel Injected (EFI) Mitsubishi 4G15 engine fitted with Proton's proprietary EMS 400 engine management system. The Arena was proclaimed to have met Europe's Euro 2 emission standards, and was also claimed to provide a good power-and-fuel efficiency balance by producing an output of per litre and a power-to-weight ratio of per tonne. While the engine offers a respectable fuel consumption rating (5.8-litre per 100 km on the highway and 8.5-litre per 100 km in the city), it struggles under heavy loads.  Body design  Proton Jumbuck rear The Arena is based largely on Proton's Wira/Persona saloon, sharing similar frontal designs of the then current Wira and mechanics, but having a reduced seating capacity of two confined to a Wira-based cabin and featuring a rear cargo bed measuring x x with a maximum payload of and a maximum load area of x . In Malaysia, the Arena is offered in three variants, which features a variety of cargo bed accessories and trims but does not vary mechanically from the export edition: * The \\"Freestyle\\", the base Arena model with an open bed, exposed metal sports bars, steel rims and hubcaps. * The \\"Sportdeck\\", an open bed variant similar to the Freestyle with covered sports bars, body trims, and alloy rims. * The \\"Fastback\\", an upmarket variant with a hard, streamlined tonneau cover-cum-camper shell (resembling a fastback body style), body trims, and alloy rims. In Australia, the Jumbuck was available in two variants, GLi and GLSi. = Chassis = Like the Wira, the Arena is of unibody construction, but in order to sustain additional loads from the cargo bed, the Arena includes a load-bearing ladder frame connected to a \\"torque box\\" for improved body durability and strength.  Safety features  While freely sold in Malaysia, no stringent third-party safety tests on the Arena were conducted or published publicly in the country. In September 2009, the Jumbuck was crash tested by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP). The Jumbuck fared poorly, receiving a one-star rating out of five. The Jumbuck lacks many of the safety features offered in other modern automobiles, such as airbags and anti-lock brakes. The absence of such safety features in an attempt to lower retail pricing is suspected to be one factor for the one-star crash test result. Proton Cars Australia has criticised the choice of the Jumbuck for the test, arguing the vehicle is the last of an old platform and is due for a replacement in the middle of 2010.  Marketing  Proton Jumbuck GLi (Australia) In Malaysia, the Arena was often marketed for both commercial and recreational use. The stripped down Freestyle variant was specified to be targeted exclusively for a variety of commercial interests, while the Sportdeck variant was offered for both private owners and businesses. The Fastback variant, the top-of-the-line Arena, was targeted at private owners. While the three Arena variants were advertised as models for specialised tasks, all three models may be used in any way. Although the Arena was offered in Malaysia, the Arena was not popular in the local market and was mostly an export model (particularly to the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa, where coup√© utilities are more marketable). The Jumbuck remains a relevant model more than a decade after its British launch. Of the estimated 1,800 units registered between 2003 and 2006 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, over 1,300 units remain licensed as of Q3 2015, with a further 153 units on SORN. Over 80% of all Proton Jumbucks sold in the UK are still on the roads.

The saccule and utricle, in turn, together make the otolith organs. These organs are what allows an organism, including humans, to perceive linear acceleration, both horizontally and vertically (gravity). They have been identified in both extinct and extant vertebrates. Counting the annual growth rings on the otoliths is a common technique in estimating the age of fish. Description Endolymphatic infillings such as otoliths are structures in the saccule and utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of all vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). In vertebrates, the saccule and utricle together make the otolith organs. Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive to a change in horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator). Similar balance receptors called statocysts can be found in many invertebrate groups but are not contained in the structure of an inner ear. Mollusk statocysts are of a similar morphology to the displacement-sensitive organs of vertebrates; however, the function of the mollusk statocyst is restricted to gravity detection and possibly some detection of angular momentum. These are analogous structures, with similar form and function but not descended from a common structure. Statoconia (also called otoconia) are numerous grains, often spherical in shape, between 1 and 50 ¬µm; collectively. Statoconia are also sometimes termed a statocyst. Otoliths (also called statoliths) are agglutinated crystals or crystals precipitated around a nucleus, with well defined morphology and together all may be termed endolymphatic infillings.Nolf, D. 1985. Otolithi Piscium; in H.-P. Schultze (ed.), Handbook of Paleoichthyology, Vol. 10. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, 145pp. Mechanism The semicircular canals and sacs in all vertebrates are attached to endolymphatic ducts, which in some groups (such as sharks) end in small openings, called endolymphatic pores, on the dorsal surface of the head. Extrinsic grains may enter through these openings, typically less than a millimeter in diameter. The size of material that enters is limited to sand- sized particles and in the case of sharks is bound together with an endogenous organic matrix that the animal secretes. In mammals, otoliths are small particles, composed of a combination of a gelatinous matrix and calcium carbonate in the viscous fluid of the saccule and utricle. The inertia of these small particles causes them to stimulate hair cells when the head moves. The hair cells are made up of 40 to 70 stereocilia and one kinocilium, which is connected to an afferent nerve. When the body changes position or begins a movement, the weight of the membrane bends the stereocilia and stimulates the hair cells. Hair cells send signals down sensory nerve fibers, which are interpreted by the brain as motion. The brain interprets the orientation of the head by comparing the input from the utricles and saccules from both ears to the input from the eyes, allowing the brain to discriminate a tilted head from the movement of the entire body. When the head is in a normal upright position, the otolith presses on the sensory hair cell receptors. This pushes the hair cell processes down and prevents them from moving side to side. However, when the head is tilted, the pull of gravity on otoliths shift the hair cell processes to the side, distorting them and sending a message to the central nervous system that the head is no longer level but now tilted. (see: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) This theory may have to be reevaluated because of an experiment in which a blindfolded owl in zero gravity was able to keep its head level while a handler was rocking its body back and forth.Skylab Archives, 1984. There is evidence that the vestibular system of mammals has retained some of its ancestral acoustic sensitivity and that this sensitivity is mediated by the otolithic organs (most likely the sacculus, due to its anatomical location). In mice lacking the otoconia of the utricle and saccule, this retained acoustic sensitivity is lost. In humans vestibular evoked myogenic potentials occur in response to loud, low-frequency acoustic stimulation in patients with the sensorineural hearing loss. Vestibular sensitivity to ultrasonic sounds has also been hypothesized to be involved in the perception of speech presented at artificially high frequencies, above the range of the human cochlea (~18 kHz). In mice, sensation of acoustic information via the vestibular system has been demonstrated to have a behaviourally relevant effect; response to an elicited acoustic startle reflex is larger in the presence of loud, low frequency sounds that are below the threshold for the mouse cochlea (~4 Hz), raising the possibility that the acoustic sensitivity of the vestibular system may extend the hearing range of small mammals. Paleontology After the death and decomposition of a fish, otoliths may be preserved within the body of an organism or be dispersed before burial and fossilization. Dispersed otoliths are one of the many microfossils which can be found through a micropalaeontological analysis of a fine sediment. Their stratigraphic significance is minimal, but can still be used to characterize a level or interval. Fossil otoliths are rarely found in situ (on the remains of the animal), likely because they are not recognized separately from the surrounding rock matrix. In some cases, due to differences in colour, grain size, or a distinctive shape, they can be identified. These rare cases are of special significance, since the presence, composition, and morphology of the material can clarify the relationship of species and groups. In the case of primitive fish, various fossil material shows that endolymphatic infillings were similar in elemental composition to the rock matrix but were restricted to coarse grained material, which presumably is better for the detection of gravity, displacement, and sound. The presence of these extrinsic grains, in osteostracans, chondrichthyans, and acanthodians indicates a common inner ear physiology and presence of open endolymphatic ducts. Ecology =Composition= Animation of the biomineralization of cod otoliths The composition of fish otoliths is also proving useful to fisheries scientists. The calcium carbonate that the otolith is composed of is primarily derived from the water. As the otolith grows, new calcium carbonate crystals form. As with any crystal structure, lattice vacancies will exist during crystal formation allowing trace elements from the water to bind with the otolith. Studying the trace elemental composition or isotopic signatures of trace elements within a fish otolith gives insight to the water bodies fish have previously occupied. Fish otoliths as old as 172 million years have been used to study the environment in which the fish lived. Robotic micromilling devices have also been used to recover very high resolution records of life history, including diet and temperatures throughout the life of the fish, as well as their natal origin. The most studied trace and isotopic signatures are strontium due to the same charge and similar ionic radius to calcium; however, scientists can study multiple trace elements within an otolith to discriminate more specific signatures. A common tool used to measure trace elements in an otolith is a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. This tool can measure a variety of trace elements simultaneously. A secondary ion mass spectrometer can also be used. This instrument can allow for greater chemical resolution but can only measure one trace element at a time. The hope of this research is to provide scientists with valuable information on where fish have traveled. Combined with otolith annuli, scientists can add how old fish were when they traveled through different water bodies. All this information can be used to determine fish life cycles so that fisheries scientists can make better informed decisions about fish stocks. =Growth rate and age= A pair of sagittae from a Pacific Cod (Gadus macrocephalus). red snapper to determine its age Finfish (class Osteichthyes) have three pairs of otoliths ‚Äì the sagittae (singular sagitta), lapilli (singular lapillus), and asterisci (singular asteriscus). The sagittae are largest, found just behind the eyes and approximately level with them vertically. The lapilli and asterisci (smallest of the three) are located within the semicircular canals. The sagittae are normally composed of aragonite (although vaterite abnormalities can occur), as are the lapilli, while the asterisci are normally composed of vaterite. The shapes and proportional sizes of the otoliths vary with fish species. In general, fish from highly structured habitats such as reefs or rocky bottoms (e.g. snappers, groupers, many drums and croakers) will have larger otoliths than fish that spend most of their time swimming at high speed in straight lines in the open ocean (e.g. tuna, mackerel, dolphinfish). Flying fish have unusually large otoliths, possibly due to their need for balance when launching themselves out of the water to \\"fly\\" in the air. Often, the fish species can be identified from distinct morphological characteristics of an isolated otolith. Fish otoliths accrete layers of calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix throughout their lives. The accretion rate varies with growth of the fish ‚Äì often less growth in winter and more in summer ‚Äì which results in the appearance of rings that resemble tree rings. By counting the rings, it is possible to determine the age of the fish in years. Typically the sagitta is used, as it is largest,Fish Age and Growth with Otoliths Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. Retrieved 2007-04-07. but sometimes lapilli are used if they have a more convenient shape. The asteriscus, which is smallest of the three, is rarely used in age and growth studies. In addition, in most species the accretion of calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix alternates on a daily cycle. It is therefore also possible to determine fish age in days. This latter information is often obtained under a microscope, and provides significant data to early life history studies. By measuring the thickness of individual rings, it has been assumed (at least in some species) to estimate fish growth because fish growth is directly proportional to otolith growth. However, some studies disprove a direct link between body growth and otolith growth. At times of lower or zero body growth the otolith continues to accrete leading some researchers to believe the direct link is to metabolism, not growth per se. Otoliths, unlike scales, do not reabsorb during times of decreased energy making it even more useful tool to age a fish. Fish never stop growing entirely, though growth rate in mature fish is reduced. Rings corresponding to later parts of the life cycle tend to be closer together as a result. Furthermore, a small percentage of otoliths in some species bear deformities over time. Age and growth studies of fish are important for understanding such things as timing and magnitude of spawning, recruitment and habitat use, larval and juvenile duration, and population age structure. Such knowledge is in turn important for designing appropriate fisheries management policies. =Diet research= Since the compounds in fish otoliths are resistant to digestion, they are found in the digestive tracts and scats of seabirds and piscivorous marine mammals, such as dolphins, seals, sea lions and walruses. Many fish can be identified to genus and species by their otoliths. Otoliths can therefore, to some extent, be used to reconstruct the prey composition of marine mammal and seabird diets. Otoliths (sagittae) are bilaterally symmetrical, with each fish having one right and one left. Separating recovered otoliths into right and left, therefore, allows one to infer a minimum number of prey individuals ingested for a given fish species. Otolith size is also proportional to the length and weight of a fish. They can therefore be used to back-calculate prey size and biomass, useful when trying to estimate marine mammal prey consumption, and potential impacts on fish stocks. Otoliths cannot be used alone to reliably estimate cetacean or pinniped diets, however. They may suffer partial or complete erosion in the digestive tract, skewing measurements of prey number and biomass. Species with fragile, easily digested otoliths may be underestimated in the diet. To address these biases, otolith correction factors have been developed through captive feeding experiments, in which seals are fed fish of known size, and the degree of otolith erosion is quantified for different prey taxa. The inclusion of fish vertebrae, jaw bones, teeth, and other informative skeletal elements improves prey identification and quantification over otolith analysis alone. This is especially true for fish species with fragile otoliths, but other distinctive bones, such as Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).

In these countries, Practical Action works with poor communities to develop appropriate technologies in renewable energy, food production, agro-processing, water, sanitation, small enterprise development, building and shelter, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. History In 1965, economist and philosopher E. F. Schumacher had an article published in The Observer,How to help them help themselves, The Observer, 29 August 1965 pointing out the limitations of aid based on the transfer of large-scale technologies to developing countries which did not have the resources to accommodate them. He argued that there should be a shift in emphasis towards intermediate technologies based on the needs and skills possessed by the people of developing countries. Schumacher and a few of his associates, including George McRobie, Julia Porter,Obituary: Julia Porter, The Independent, 31 August 1992 Alfred Latham-Koenig and Professor Mansur Hoda, decided to create an \\"advisory centre\\" to promote the use of efficient labour-intensive techniques, and in 1966 the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) was born. Toye, J (2011) \\"The world improvement plans of Fritz Schumacher\\", Camb. J. Econ. 36(2) From its origins as a technical enquiry service, ITDG began to take a greater direct involvement in local projects. Following initial successes in farming, it developed working groups on energy, building materials and rural health, and soon grew to become an international organisation. The group now has seven regional offices, working on over 100 projects around the world, with a head office in the UK. In July 2005, ITDG changed its working name to Practical Action, and since 2008 this has been its legal name. Project work Practical Action works in partnership with poor people and their communities, building on their own knowledge and skills to come up with innovative, sustainable and practical solutions. The organisation's project work is based around four international goals: * Energy that transforms - sustainable access to modern energy services by bringing rural communities, displaced people, energy providers and decision makers together to find sustainable, clean energy solutions. * Farming that works - promoting the use of agroecology, providing the potential to transform the lives of millions of farming families struggling to adapt to a changing climate * Urban water and waste - making sure cities are fit for people. They're helping to make cities in developing countries cleaner, healthier and fairer places to live and work * Disaster risk reduction - having resilience that protects by helping to make resilience a way of life, by adapting to and preparing for a changing climate.

Battle of Daugavpils (also known as the Battle of Dyneburg) was the final battle in the Polish-Soviet campaign of 1919. A joint Polish and Latvian force, operating under Polish Staff orders known as \\"Operation Winter\\", attacked the Red Army garrison in Dunaburg, or Daugavpils, from 3‚Äì5 January 1920.Davies, N., 1972, White Eagle, Red Star, London: Orbis Books, History From the Polish perspective it was a part of the Polish- Bolshevik War, while in Latvia it is referred to as a part of Latvian War of Independence. The Polish commander of the 1st Legions Infantry Division and 3rd Legions Infantry Division, general (later Marshal of Poland) Edward Rydz- ≈ömig≈Çy had been occupying the left bank of the Dvina since August. The Latvian Foreign Minister had met with Pilsudski in Vilnius (then Wilno in Polish) in October 1919, and asked for assistance at Dunaburg. The Poles wanted to prevent the Soviet XVth and XVIth armies from consolidating at this juncture, and readily agreed. A final agreement was reached on 30 December 1919, and a military alliance was signed between the governments of Poland and Latvia. General Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy was given the command over a small Operational Group composed of his 1st Legions Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Legions Infantry Division and several minor Latvian auxiliary forces. In addition, the force included Renault FT tanks of the 2nd company, 1st Tank Regiment, commanded by the French Capt. Jean Dufour. The battle for the city and its surroundings took place under harsh weather conditions, the area was covered with more than of snow and the temperature dropped below , which permitted the Poles to cross the frozen Dvina. The Polish 3rd Legionary Division stormed the Daugavpils fortress, while the 1st Infantry Division attacked from the north. The Red garrison retreated to the west where they surrendered to the Latvians. On 5 January 1920, Dunaburg was turned over to the Latvian Republic. Thanks to that, the inter-war relations between Poland and Latvia were good, although Latvia refused to join Poland in its continued struggle against Soviet Russia. The problems that precluded the Polish and Latvian governments from expanding their relationship were the opposition from Lithuania (which was hostile towards Poland after the Polish-Lithuanian War) and a dispute about six Latvian rural municipalities and the city of Grƒ´va with a big percentage of Polish inhabitants (south to the Daugava River). Several forms of alliance were proposed by Poland, such as Latvia joining the Miƒôdzymorze federation of Poland. It chose to join the Baltic Entente instead.

It is one of the country's major telecommunications providers, along with Globe Telecom. Founded in 1928, it is the oldest and largest telecom company in the Philippines, in terms of assets and revenues. PLDT Financial Results Its core businesses are fixed-line telecommunications, mobile telephony services, broadband, and internet of things services under various brands. It also has investments in broadcasting, print media, utilities, and direct-to-home satellite services, among others. As of 2019, PLDT is listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange (the only Philippine company to be listed in NYSE) and it is being controlled by First Pacific, a Hong Kong-based investment management company; Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, through its subsidiaries; and JG Summit, a major conglomerate that operates airliner Cebu Pacific, food manufacturer Universal Robina and real estate firm Robinsons Land. It received numerous complain from congress and senate regarding on slow internet. History =GTE era= PLDT was established on November 28, 1928, by a Philippine Government act. Philippine legislature and approved by then Governor-General Henry L. Stimson by means of a merger of four telephone companies under operation of the American telephone company GTE.PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY retrieved May 7, 2013 Known as Act 3436, the bill granted PLDT a 50-year charter and the right to establish a Philippine telephone network linking major points nationwide. However, PLDT had to meet a 40-day deadline to start implementing the network, which would be implemented over a period of one to four years. By the 1930s, PLDT had an expansive fixed-line network and for the first time linked the Philippines to the outside world via radiotelephone services, connecting the Philippines to the United States and other parts of the world. Telephone service in the Philippines was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, the Philippines' communications infrastructure was in ruins. U.S. military authorities eventually handed over the remains of the communications infrastructure to PLDT in 1947, and with the help of massive U.S. aid to the Philippines during the 1940s and 1950s, PLDT recovered so quickly that its telephone subscribers outpaced that of pre-war levels by 1953. =Cojuangco Era= On December 20, 1967, a group of Filipino entrepreneurs and businessmen led by Ramon Cojuangco took control of PLDT after buying its shares from the American telecommunications company GTE. The group took control of PLDT's management on January 1, 1968, with the election of Gregorio S. Licaros and Cojuangco as chairman and president of PLDT, respectively. A few months later, PLDT's main office in Makati (known today as the Ramon Cojuangco Building) was opened, and PLDT's expansion programs begin, hoping to bring reliable telephone services to the rural areas. It was also during that time that PLDT was able to use Intelsat II F-4 communications satellite to beam international events such as the Apollo 8 mission and the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. PLDT was permitted to operate during Martial Law. During the 1970s, PLDT was nationalized by the government of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and in 1981, in compliance of then existing policy of the Philippine government to integrate the Philippine telecommunications industry, purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Republic Telephone Company, becoming the country's telephone monopoly. Under this monopoly, service expansion were severely curtailed or practically nonexistent. In the Martial Law years people would apply for phone service only to wait for years and years on end behind an impossibly long application backlog. It is not unheard of for people and small businesses back then to barter for a single telephone line in the black market for tens of thousands of pesos. The incumbent Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew referred to the situation when visiting the Philippines during the term of President Fidel V. Ramos. He said, albeit in jest, ‚ÄúIn the Philippines 95% of the population has no telephone, while the remaining 5% are waiting for that dial tone.‚Äù After President Marcos was overthrown in 1986, the company was re- privatized and Cojuangco's son, Antonio \\"Tonyboy\\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. became chief executive. By 1995, with the passage of the Telecommunications Act and the subsequent deregulation of the Philippine telecommunications industry, the company has been de-monopolized. In 1992, PLDT partnered with AT&T; Corporation to expand its services into rural communities; including USA Direct Roving Van Service, a mobile van equipped with cellular phones, to provide toll service to some previously unserved rural communities; point-to- point international digital leased line service; payphone services; and magnetic prepaid telephone cards. By 1997, the company, through Mabuhay Satellite Corporation, launched the Philippines' first local communications satellite Agila II (It was later divested to Asia Broadcast Satellite in 2009). =First Pacific Era= 4th PLDT logo (1996‚Äì2016) In 1998, Hong Kong- based First Pacific Company Ltd. acquired a 17.5% controlling stake in PLDT for approximately P29.7 billion. Following the acquisition by the First Pacific group, Manuel V. Pangilinan became the new president and CEO of PLDT, replacing Cojuangco, who assumed the post of Chairman until 2004. An additional investment was added in 2000 through a share-swap agreement; where NTT Communications, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, acquired a share in PLDT in exchange for its co-owned wireless telecom company Smart Communications. PLDT acquired 51.55% of the shares of Digital Telecommunications Philippines from JG Summit Holdings in March 2011 with the cost of ‚Ç±69.2 Billion. Because of this, the shares of Digitel and JG Summit in the PSE surges while PLDT's shares remained unchanged. In the deal, JG Summit will have a 12% share in PLDT. It was finalized by the National Telecommunications Commission on October 26, 2011. In exchange of the transaction, PLDT's subsidiary Smart Communications surrendered the mobile frequency and spectrum being used by its service Red Mobile to the government, which was finalized in 2016. In April 2016, the company, then known as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, dropped the \\"long distance telephone\\" from its corporate name and was renamed PLDT Inc. Its board of directors approved the new corporate name to reflect on the company's new range of services, mainly focusing on data services. On June 13, 2016, PLDT and its subsidiary Smart unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot. Operations =Fixed Line= PLDT's fixed line business offers services intended for enterprises, small and medium enterprises, and corporate consumers - including corporate data, ICT solutions, data networking, and cybersecurity solutions. PLDT also offers local exchange telephone services for Subic Bay Freeport, Clark Freeport Zone, Bonifacio Global City, and selected cities in Mindanao through its subsidiaries. PLDT's retail fixed line services are branded under PLDT Home brand. It offers home broadband, IPTV, and triple play packages with devices from TP-Link and Roku. =Wireless= A store of PLDT's flagship wireless brand Smart Communications in SM Megamall, Mandaluyong City. PLDT operates its wireless cellular services through its brands, namely Smart, TNT, and Sun Cellular. Smart, its flagship brand, offers commercial wireless services through its 2G, 3G, 3.5G HSPA+, and 4G LTE networks, with LTE-A and 5G currently being tested and deployed in key areas in the Philippines. Smart also offers terrestrial satellite communication services and wireless complimentary offerings. TNT provides a wide range of offerings in low-cost call, text, and mobile internet packages, as well as other value-added services. Sun Cellular, on the other hand, offers unlimited call, text and internet data services. =Investments= The headquarters of broadcasting company TV5 Network in Mandaluyong City. TV5 Network is funded by PLDT through MediaQuest Holdings. PLDT currently invests in media through Pilipinas Global Network and MediaQuest Holdings, funded through its Beneficial Trust Fund. MediaQuest's assets include broadcasting firms TV5 Network and Nation Broadcasting Corporation, direct-to-home satellite operator Cignal TV, and major newspaper companies The Philippine Star and BusinessWorld, among others. PLDT also has investments in energy utility (Meralco, through PLDT Communication and Energy Ventures), business jet transportation (Pacific Global One Aviation Company), and e-commerce and financial technology development (Voyager Innovations), among others. Ownership The Company's ownership is divided among the public (53.86%), Philippine Telephone Investments Corporation (12.05%), Metro Pacific Resources, Inc. (9.98%); non- Philippine subsidiaries of First Pacific Company Limited (25.6%), NTT DoCoMo, Inc. (14.5%), NTT Communications Corp. (5.85%) and Manuel V. Pangilinan (0.11%). Criticisms =Bandwidth caps= In October 2015, PLDT introduced so-called \\"volume boosters\\" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth throttling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD-LTE connection plans (Ultera). \\"In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume allowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume boosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is refreshed on your next billing cycle.\\" Globe followed the suit with a similar \\"volume boost\\" arrangement. This practice has since been weaned off for fixed broadband such as DSL and fiber optic, particularly with capped rates being silently retired. Globe, who previously retired all their unlimited data rates to capped ones, have reintroduced uncapped rates too. =Lock-in period= In 2015, PLDT increased lock-in period for TD-LTE connection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee equal to the full balance for the remaining period.

This handy percussion instrument is very similar to the pan-Indian damaru. While the damaru is played by rattling knotted cords against the resonators, the idakka is played with a stick. Like the damaru, the idakka's pitch may be bent by squeezing the lacing in the middle. The idakka is slung over the left shoulder and the right side of the instrument is gently beaten with a thin curve-ended stick.  Etymology  It is believed that the word comes from the Malayalam word idakku, meaning \\"centre\\". The word is said to allude to the instrument's position between the temple idol and the devotees.Shri Chendamangalam Unnikrishna Maarar Idakka artist in action - In the middle.  Construction  Similar to the talking drum, The Idakka consists of two circular drum heads each of which is mounted within a circular ring. The hourglass-shaped body is placed between the two heads and lacing is used to pull the two rings towards each other, stretching each drum head over an open end of the body. Snare-like strings made of natural fiber are stretched across the open ends of the drum body, under each drum head. It is not uncommon for the diameter of the drum heads to be larger than the diameter of the body, with the result that the drum heads are often seen mounted significantly off-center.  Acoustics  VIdwan Shri. Tripunithura Krishnadas is an Indian musician and a well-known edaykkya (or Idakka or edakka) and chenda artist from Kerala. The Idakka is a small, high pitched drum with definite pitch. The snares running under the drum heads have been found to interact with the vibrating membrane in a way that causes the pitch of the instrument to be determinate. Different pitches can be obtained by squeezing the lacing around the instrument, which changes the amount of tension in the skins.

In 2004, he starred in a self- penned one man show called Jackson's Way at the Edinburgh Fringe. The intended run for the production was ten days, before the intervention of comedian Stewart Lee. Lee was so impressed by Adamsdale's work that he reportedly threw his full support behind Jackson's Way, lobbying for an extension of the run and using his clout within the industry to garner notice from critics and award committees. Adamsdale secured the Perrier Comedy Award for comedy. Adamsdale has since created several new shows: The Receipt, The Human Computer, and The Summer House. The Receipt, a collaboration with sonic artist Chris Branch, used innovative sound effects to punctuate a story about the little man in the big city. It ran at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006, winning a Fringe First and a Total Theatre Award. It subsequently toured nationally, and internationally to the Melbourne Comedy Festival and 59E59 Theatres in New York. In The Human Computer, Adamsdale, a self-confessed technophobe, explored the world of computers. The show premiered in the new Traverse 3 venue at the Edinburgh Fringe 2007.

Note the \\"Recall\\" button and the Message Waiting Lamp. Hook flash or flash (known in the UK as \\"recall\\") is a button on a telephone that simulates quickly hanging up then picking up again (a quick off-hook/on-hook/off-hook cycle). At the most basic level, using this would just drop the current call, and start a dial tone for the new call. However, on phone lines with special services, this action is used for signalling the telephone exchange to do something. A common use of a hook flash for special action is to switch to another incoming call with the call waiting service. Another use is to indicate a request for voice conferencing, for example, a user may use a procedure like the following to initiate three- way calling: #Pick up phone handset (causing the line to be off-hook). #Hear a dial tone #Dial the first number and greet the first party #Press the hook flash button (or quickly tap the on-hook sensor on the phone) #Hear a stutter dial tone (a series of beeps followed by another dial tone) #Dial the second number and greet the second party #Press the hook flash button again. The second \\"flash\\" signals the Central Office Switch to link the two active conversations, so that all three parties are connected to the same logical telephone line. In contrast to PBX conferencing systems, the two calls are joined at the Central Office switch, rather than at the customer premises PBX. A \\"Follow-on call\\" button on a payphone, which is used for hook flashing; not to be confused with a \\"Redial\\" button nearby. On payphones, this function is usually provided with a button labeled \\"Follow-on call\\", which is mainly used for requesting another dial tone after finishing a call. This allows remaining credit to be used on another call as payphones don't usually return changes. With payphones that do not have this button, flashing the handset on and off- hook quickly will also perform the same action. History The switchhook is the device that senses whether the handset or receiver is in its cradle. The term \\"flash\\" originated from the cord circuit of the early telephone switchboard that telephone company operators used to connect calls. The calling party and called party each had an indicator light on the cord circuit. When the subscriber cycled the telephone on-hook/off-hook, the light would flash. Actors in old movies often demonstrate this method, seeking the operator's attention. The user does a tap-tap-tap. When an operator comes on the line, the actor says, \\"Hello? Operator? We've been cut off.\\" Then the operator attempts to reestablish the connection. The flashing light of this equipment of bygone days is the origin of the phrase \\"flashing the switchhook\\". Centrex telephones added a hook-flash button in the 1960s, after some users incorrectly attempted the attendant-recall function.

Its creator, Giuseppe Bertani, intended LB to stand for lysogeny broth, but LB has also come to colloquially mean Luria broth, Lennox broth, or Luria‚ÄìBertani medium. The formula of the LB medium was published in 1951 in the first paper of Bertani on lysogeny. In this article he described the modified single-burst experiment and the isolation of the phages P1, P2, and P3. He had developed the LB medium to optimize Shigella growth and plaque formation. LB media formulations have been an industry standard for the cultivation of Escherichia coli as far back as the 1950s. These media have been widely used in molecular microbiology applications for the preparation of plasmid DNA and recombinant proteins. It continues to be one of the most common media used for maintaining and cultivating laboratory recombinant strains of Escherichia coli. For physiological studies however, the use of LB medium is to be discouraged.Nikaido, H. (2009). The Limitations of LB Medium. Small things considered - The Microbe Blog. ASM. http://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2009/11/the-limitations-of-lb- medium.html There are several common formulations of LB. Although they are different, they generally share a somewhat similar composition of ingredients used to promote growth, including the following: * Peptides and casein peptones * Vitamins (including B vitamins) * Trace elements (e.g. nitrogen, sulfur, magnesium) * Minerals Sodium ions for transport and osmotic balance are provided by sodium chloride. Tryptone is used to provide essential amino acids such as peptides and peptones to the growing bacteria, while the yeast extract is used to provide a plethora of organic compounds helpful for bacterial growth. These compounds include vitamins and certain trace elements. In his original 1951 paper, Bertani used 10 grams of NaCl and 1 gram of glucose per 1 L of solution; Luria in his \\"L broth\\" of 1957 copied Bertani's original recipe exactly. Recipes published later have typically left out the glucose.  Formulae  The formulations generally differ in the amount of sodium chloride, thus providing selection of the appropriate osmotic conditions for the particular bacterial strain and desired culture conditions. The low salt formulations, Lennox and Luria, are ideal for cultures requiring salt-sensitive antibiotics. * LB-Miller (10 g/L NaCl) * LB-Lennox (5 g/L NaCl) * LB-Luria (0.5 g/L NaCl)  Preparation  LB medium The following is a common method for the preparation of 1 litre of LB: *Measure out the following: **10 g tryptone **5 g yeast extract **10 g NaCl *Suspend the solids in ~800 ml of distilled or deionized water. *Add further distilled water or deionized water, in a measuring cylinder to ensure accuracy, to make a total of 1 liter. *Autoclave at 121 ¬∞C for 20 mins. *After cooling, swirl the flask to ensure mixing, and the LB is ready for use. = Adjusting the pH = Prior to autoclaving, some labs adjust the pH of LB to 7.5 or 8 with sodium hydroxide. However, sodium hydroxide does not provide any buffering capacity to the media, and this result in rapid changes to the pH during bacteria cultivation. To get around this some labs prefer to adjust the pH with 5-10 mmol/L TRIS buffer, diluted from 1 mol/l TRIS stock at the desired pH. However, it is not absolutely necessary to adjust the pH for most situations. Some labs adjust the pH to 7.0 merely as a precaution. Since the buffering with Tris will also be largely ineffective in the face of substantial bacterial growth, adjusting the pH of LB in this particular manner is usually unnecessary. As such, use of Tris in some broth recipes (especially when the culture will be stored at room temperature conditions for extended periods of time) may be considered a superstitious procedure without much scientific merit.

He was a professor of art history at the University of Vienna and a famous member of the Vienna School of Art History, employing a Geistesgeschichte methodology. Early life and education Dvo≈ô√°k was born on 4 June 1874 in Roudnice nad Labem, Bohemia, the son of a Bohemian archivist and librarian. He studied at the universities of Prague and Vienna. In 1897, he completed a PhD thesis in history at the Institut f√ºr √ñsterreichische Geschichtsforschung, Vienna. Having been impressed by the teaching of art historian Franz Wickhoff, he focused his attention to art history and wrote his Habilitationsschrift on Bohemian thirteenth- and fourteenth-century manuscript illumination by Johannes von Neumarkt (1901). Career In 1902, Dvo≈ô√°k was appointed lecturer in art history at the University of Vienna. After Alois Riegl's death in 1905, he became, with the help of Julius von Schlosser, curator of public monuments in Austria. In 1909, he was appointed full professor of art history at the University of Vienna, which caused some problems among the nationalists of the art faculty because of Dvo≈ô√°k's Czech origin. Therefore, Josef Strzygowski set up his own, competing art history institute, known as the \\"Wiener Institut\\", within the same university, resulting in Dvo≈ô√°k and Strzygowski teaching from two different art history \\"centers\\".Ernst Hans Gombrich, Topics of Our Time: Twentieth-century Issues in Learning and in Art.

He was one of the main representatives of the Vienna School of Art History, his most important publication being on the concept of art history as a history of ideas (Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte). In 1905, he succeeded Riegl as general curator of the Imperial Central Commission for the study and conservation of art and historical monuments, today Bundesdenkmalamt. He helped save many Austrian art treasures for post-World War I war reparation. He also continued the publication of the Kunstgeschichtliches Jahrbuch der Zentralkommission f√ºr die Erhaltung der Kunst- und historischen Denkmale, and in 1907, he established an inventory of Austrian and Hungarian monuments, called √ñsterreichische Kunsttopographie. Also in 1907, he created the first complete catalogue of The Lobkowicz Collections. In 1916 he published his standard work, Katechismus der Denkmalpflege, in which he was able to raise a broad understanding for the concerns of monument protection. Personal life and death Dvo≈ô√°k died from a stroke on 8 February 1921 during a visit to his friend Count Khuen von Belasi at Emmahof castle near Hru≈°ovany nad Jevi≈°ovkou in South Moravia. He left a widow and two children.\\"Kleine Chronik: ... Verbleiben des Kunsthistorikers Professor Dvorak in Wien\\", Neue Freie Presse: Morgenblatt, No. 20277, 9 February 1921, p. 5.

He was born in Bangor, Michigan, the first of the three sons of Stanford and Ruth (Barnes) Overton. He grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Life After taking piano lessons as a youngster, Overton realized he'd have to travel beyond his small Midwestern town to find the kind of music instruction he wanted. His high school music teacher recognized Overton's gift and recommended he attend The Chicago Musical College after graduation. Overton studied theory and composition there from 1940 to 1942. He then entered the armed services and served in overseas combat duty with the U.S. 3rd Armored Division until 1945. It was during his time in the service that he learned to play jazz. On discharge from the army, Overton continued his musical studies at The Juilliard School of Music, studying composition with Vincent Persichetti. He graduated in 1951 with an M.S. degree, then became a member of the faculty there. In 1954 Overton moved into a New York City loft at 821 Sixth Avenue, known as the Jazz Loft, where he lived alongside legendary photographer W. Eugene Smith, musicians Dick Cary and Jimmy Stevenson, painter David X. Young and other established and rising musicians and artists. This provided the perfect setting for the musicians to jam and learn together. Smith recorded many of these sessions, which were released in October 2000 as part of the Jazz Loft Project, a large ongoing project involving Smith's photos and tapes from that period. While Overton was writing classical compositions, he was also deeply immersed in jazz, and recorded with such jazz notables as Stan Getz, Duke Jordan, Jimmy Raney and Teddy Charles. Thelonious Monk selected him to score his piano works for orchestra; a performance of these compositions in New York City was recorded live on February 28, 1959 and released on the album The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall. In 1963, Monk recorded a second live album with orchestral arrangements by Overton at the New York Philharmonic Hall, released as Big Band and Quartet in Concert. In later years, Overton taught at the Yale School of Music and the New School of Social Research. He received awards from The Koussevitzky Foundation and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Death Overton died on November 24, 1972, aged 52, from cirrhosis of the liver. Just a few months earlier, his opera Huckleberry Finn, commissioned by the Barney Jaffin Foundation, was presented by The Juilliard Opera Company. Family Overton married Nancy Swain (1926‚Äì2009) in 1949, with whom he had two sons, Richard Adair (Rick) Overton and Steven Swain Overton.

The main challenge in designing magnetic information storage media is to retain the magnetization of the medium despite thermal fluctuations caused by the superparamagnetic limit. If the thermal energy is too high, there may be enough energy to reverse the magnetization in a region of the medium, destroying the data stored there. The energy required to reverse the magnetization of a magnetic region is proportional to the size of the magnetic region and the magnetic coercivity of the material. The larger the magnetic region is and the higher the magnetic coercivity of the material, the more stable the medium is. Thus, there is a minimum size for a magnetic region at a given temperature and coercivity. If it is any smaller it is likely to be spontaneously de-magnetized by local thermal fluctuations. Perpendicular recording uses higher coercivity materials because the head's write field penetrates the medium more efficiently in the perpendicular geometry. The popular explanation for the advantage of perpendicular recording is that it achieves higher storage densities by aligning the poles of the magnetic elements, which represent bits, perpendicularly to the surface of the disk platter, as shown in the illustration. In this not-quite-accurate explanation, aligning the bits in this manner takes less platter area than what would have been required had they been placed longitudinally. This means cells can be placed closer together on the platter, thus increasing the number of magnetic elements that can be stored in a given area. The true picture is a bit more complex, having to do with the use of a magnetically \\"stronger\\" (higher coercivity) material as the storage medium. This is possible because in a perpendicular arrangement the magnetic flux is guided through a magnetically soft (and relatively thick) underlayer underneath the hard magnetic media films (considerably complicating and thickening the total disk structure). This magnetically soft underlayer can be effectively considered a part of the write head, making the write head more efficient, thus making it possible to produce a stronger write field gradient with essentially the same head materials as for longitudinal heads, and therefore allowing for the use of the higher coercivity magnetic storage medium. A higher coercivity medium is inherently thermally more stable, as stability is proportional to the product of bit (or magnetic grain) volume times the uniaxial anisotropy constant Ku, which in turn is higher for a material with a higher magnetic coercivity. Implementations Vertimag Systems Corporation, founded by Professor Jack Judy of the University of Minnesota. As a colleague of Iwasaki, created the first perpendicular disk drives, heads and disks in 1984. 5 MB removable floppy drives were demonstrated in IBM PCs to major computer manufacturers. Vertimag went out of business during the PC crash of 1985. Toshiba produced the first commercially available disk drive (1.8\\") using this technology in 2005. Shortly thereafter in January 2006, Seagate Technology began shipping its first laptop sized hard drive using perpendicular recording technology, the Seagate Momentus 5400.3. Seagate also announced at that time that the majority of its hard disk storage devices would utilize the new technology by the end of 2006. In April 2006, Seagate began shipping the first 3.5 inch perpendicular recording hard drive, the Cheetah 15K.5, with up to 300GB storage, running at 15,000 rpm and claim to have 30% better performance than their predecessors with a data rate of 73‚Äì125 Mbyte/s. In April 2006, Seagate announced the Barracuda 7200.10, a series of HDDs utilizing perpendicular recording with a maximum capacity of 750 GB. Drives began shipping in late April 2006. Hitachi announced a 20 GB Microdrive. Hitachi's first laptop drive (2.5-inch) based on perpendicular recording became available in mid-2006, featuring a maximum capacity of 160 GB. In June 2006, Toshiba announced a hard drive of 200-GB capacity with mass production starting in August, effectively raising the standard of mobile storage capacity. In July 2006, Western Digital announced volume production of its WD Scorpio hard drives using WD-designed and manufactured perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology to achieve 80 GB-per-platter density. In August 2006 Fujitsu extended its lineup to include SATA models utilizing perpendicular recording, offering up to 160GB capacity. In December 2006 Toshiba said its new 100GB two-platter HDD is based on perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) and was designed in the \\"short\\" 1.8-inch form factor. In December 2006 Fujitsu announced its MHX2300BT series of hard disk drives, with capacities of 250 and 300 GB. In January 2007 Hitachi announced the first 1-terabyte hard drive using the technology, which they then delivered in April 2007. In July 2008 Seagate Technology announced a 1.5 terabyte SATA hard drive using PMR technology. In January 2009 Western Digital announced the first 2.0 terabyte SATA hard drive using PMR technology. In February 2009 Seagate Technology announced the first 7,200rpm 2.0 terabyte SATA hard drive using PMR technology with choice of SATA 2 or SAS 2.0 interface.

English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands. After the successes of their 1996 Royal Albert Hall performance and their subsequent album Dark Fields (1997), the duo decided to record a limited edition album featuring the duo's renditions of traditional folk music. It was recorded in September 1998 as a project to connect the band to their roots. It was released as a limited edition release in late 1998 on the band's own label Hands on Music. It was only released via postal order and at the band's concerts and was not reviewed by music press. It was out of print for many years before being re-released in 2015 as a free download to those on the duo's mailing list. Background and content After Show of Hands performed an unexpectedly highly successful performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1996, they released the concert as a live album entitled Live at the Royal Albert Hall, which became the duo's best-selling album.Show Of Hands Biography  OLDIES.com Steve Knightley of the duo noted that as a result of the success of the performance, \\"it's easier to get in local papers. But we now need to replace that with a story about the music. That's the dilemma.\\" The duo followed the success with Dark Fields (1997), an album which the duo had intended to build on their success. Whilst very much a critical success, the single released from the album, \\"Crazy Boy\\", commercially underperformed.Living Tradition CD review of Show Of Hands - Dark Fields In 1998, the duo promoted Dark Fields with a tour. During the tour, the duo decided that they would not so quickly release a new album of music that the duo had composed. Knightley had begun writing songs, but would use them for his first solo album Track of Words (1999). The duo decided to release a limited edition album of the band's renditions of traditional folk music to \\"connect them to their roots\\".Liner notes of Roots: The Best of Show of Hands. The duo recorded the album in September 1998 and were pleased with the results. The album contains ten versions of traditional folk songs, as well as a hidden track featuring a short version of \\"High Germany\\", a song that the duo had previously recorded live for their previous album Dark Fields. Track 10, ‚ÄúThe Train‚Äù / ‚ÄúBlackwaterside‚Äù, includes \\"The Train\\". This is the third appearance on a Show of Hands album for the song, following its inclusion on Dark Fields and the 10-minute reprise of the song which takes the form of a hidden track also on Dark Fields. ‚ÄúThe Train‚Äù / ‚ÄúBlackwaterside‚Äù is the only song still available from the album on CD, as it was released on the best-of album Roots. Release Steve Knightley of the duo (pictured in 2009) found the album successfully connected them to their roots. The album was released by the duo's own label Hands on Music in late 1998 as a limited edition. It was only ever made available via post order and at the band's concerts, and only for a short time. The unusual release meant that the album was not reviewed by any professional music critics. Nonetheless, the duo said that the concept \\"to connect them to their roots\\" worked well. The duo were not quick to follow the album with another album of the duo's own material. They followed Folk Music with an album of re-recordings of their old material, Anglicana (1999), and an album of contemporary cover versions, Covers (2000), before returning to recording an album of new material with Cold Frontier (2001). During 1999, the duo also undertook solo projects, including Knightley's solo album Track of Words and Beer's projects Ridgeriders and The Fiddle Collection. The tenth song, \\"The Train\\"/\\"Blackwaterside\\", was featured on the band's 2007 compilation album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands, becoming the first time music from the album had been available in some eight to nine years. In February 2015, after sixteen years of unavailability, the band re-released Folk Music as a free download to anyone who subscribed to their mailing list.

It was founded in 1867, and works in partnership with individuals and churches across the world. The organization's stated aim is to use the Bible to inspire children, young people and adults to know God. Scripture Union is an autonomous organisation in each country, linked together by Scripture Union International. It is primarily a volunteer organisation with a small number of full-time staff training, encouraging and coordinating ministry workers around the world. Scripture Union is also a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International. Origin In 1867 Josiah Spiers spoke to 15 children in a drawing room in Islington, London, and began the work of sharing the Christian message with children in a way that related to their real needs. George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christian Education, Volume 3, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2015, p. 135 This led to the founding of the Children's Special Service Mission (CSSM) which was later to become \\"Scripture Union\\". At about the same time as Spiers held his meeting in Islington, brothers Samuel and James Tyler and Tom Bond Bishop started a similar meeting in Blackfriars Road, south of the river Thames. Similarly Henry Hankinson and Henry Hutchinson had started meetings in Mildmay Park. All of them had come under the influence of Rev Edward Payson Hammond, a controversial American preacher who had visited London in the early summer of 1867 and held meetings for both children and Sunday School teachers. Hammond's idea was simple: informal, special services for children. Despite the controversy which it sparked amongst Sunday School teachers, Spiers and the others were convinced. The following year, Spiers travelled to Llandudno, North Wales on holiday and began to tell the children there about his faith. He drew the text \\"God is Love\\" in the sand, invited children to decorate it, and then told them a Bible story. Spiers quickly established the CSSM as a mission to oversee his work in Islington. By August 1868 Bishop had joined the committee and by the end of the year, Hankinson was also a member, bringing in the Mildmay Park meetings as well. Whilst Spiers was the engaging children's speaker, Bishop had the organising ability and became the honorary secretary.Sitters, Mrs P (1923) T.B.B. of the C.S.S.M. London: The Children's Special Service Mission. The working partnership of Bond and Spiers was to last for more than 40 years and be the foundation of a movement which has spread to more than 130 countries. In 1879 CSSM started the Children's Scripture Union, a system of daily Bible reading. John H. Y. Briggs, A Dictionary of European Baptist Life and Thought, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2009, p. 455A membership card had a list of daily readings, and this was soon complemented by explanatory notes in children‚Äôs magazines. Booklets of notes were published for troops in the trenches during the First World War and led to the first issue of Daily Notes in 1923. In 1892 the first Boys‚Äô Camp was started in Littlehampton by Major Leibenrood, a veteran from the Zulu War. The following year, the Caravan Mission to Village Children (CMVC) was started using a bakers‚Äô cart. The CMVC became part of CSSM, but in 1960 Scripture Union became the official name of the organisation. In the 1950s CSSM / Scripture Union held an annual book writing competition, resulting in the publication of many children's novels including several by Patricia St John (Treasures of the Snow), still in print today. These were hard back books with illustrations and dust jackets by artist LF Lupton.  Programs  SU's work is carried out through local people in ways which are seen as appropriate to each country, culture and situation in which a movement is based.

Passenger trains are operated by the state-owned VR which covers track length of . They serve all the major cities and many rural areas, though railway connections are available to fewer places than bus connections. Most passenger train services originate or terminate at Helsinki Central railway station, and a large proportion of the passenger rail network radiates out of Helsinki. VR also operates freight services. Maintenance and construction of the railway network itself is the responsibility of the Finnish Rail Administration, which is a part of the Finnish Transport Agency (). The network is divided in six areal centres, that manage the use and maintenance of the routes in co- operation. Cargo yards and large stations may have their own signalling systems. Finnish trains have a reputation for being spacious, comfortable and clean. The scenery surrounding the railway lines is considered to be of outstanding natural beauty, especially in Eastern Finland with its many lakes. Because in most parts of Finland the density of population is low, Finland is not very well suited for railways. Commuter services are nowadays rare outside the Helsinki area, but there are express train connections between most of the cities. As in France, passenger services are mostly connections from various parts of the country to the capital, Helsinki. Currently there are c. 260 passenger round trips driven daily in Finland, excluding Helsinki commuter rail. Nightly passenger trains only operate on the busiest lines between Helsinki or Turku via Oulu to Lapland (minimum distance of . This leaves most of the tracks free for nightly freight traffic (c.40 M tons/y). In addition there are also good long distance bus and airplane connections, both of which are generally little or a lot more expensive than trains. Buses are sometimes faster and/or cheaper than trains (e.g. Helsinki‚ÄìPori). History The Finland Railway Bridge across the Neva connected the Finnish State Railways to Russian Railways. The first rail line between Helsinki and H√§meenlinna was opened on January 31, 1862. As Finland was then the Grand Duchy of Finland, a region of Imperial Russia, railways were built to the broad Russian track gauge of . An extension from Riihim√§ki to the new Finland Station in Saint Petersburg was opened in 1870. However, the Finnish and Russian rail systems remained unconnected until 1912. Russian trains could not have used the Finnish rail network due to a narrower load gauge. Later the Finnish load gauge was widened to match the Russian load gauge, with hundreds of station platforms or tracks moved further apart from each other. Further expansion occurred in the 1800s and by 1900 much of the network had been constructed with 3,300 km of track built. The Finland Railway Bridge across the River Neva in Saint Petersburg, opened in 1912, connected the Finnish State Railways to Russian Railways. Following Finnish independence, the Russian part of the line was handed over to Russian authorities. Future expansion =Track upgrades= Track doubling projects are taking place in various sections of the Finnish rail network. Following a previous project to double the single- line sections of railway from Sein√§joki to Oulu which was completed in 2017, the Luum√§ki-Imatra(-Simpele) section will be fully doubled by 2023. =New lines= Since the 1970s the Finnish Transport Agency has been discussing the possibility of building a second railway line from Helsinki to Turku, allowing for a faster journey time between the two cities. This line is known as the 'ELSA' line, as it would pass through the city of Espoo and the towns of Lohja and Salo. An updated feasibility study was undertaken in 2005, and in 2016 the line was included as a policy in the Finnish Transport Agency's report.http://yle.fi/uutiset/tunnin_junan_suunnittelu_sai_hallitukselta_rahaa/879055 This line forms part of the Finnish government's plans to build high-speed rail links from Helsinki to Turku, Tampere and Kouvola. The planned It√§rata (East Rail) would link Helsinki and Kouvola via Porvoo, shortening journey times to eastern Finnish cities such as Kuopio and Joensuu, along with St Petersburg, Russia.

In November 2017 a freight train left Kouvola between Helsinki and the Russian border carrying 41 containers for Xi‚Äôan in China. This was the first freight train of its type to travel between the two countries.https://www.railpage.com.au/news/s/finland-to-china-freight-service- launched The 9,110 km journey via Russia and Kazakhstan is expected to take 17 days, compared to around 30 days by sea and rail. This service is expected to become a daily departure in the coming months. Proposals for a rail link to Lapland in northern Finland, via Kemij√§rvi or Kolari, from the Norwegian port of Kirkenes are in the planning stages. However, environmental and cultural sensitivities exist which affect these plans, with concerns from the indigenous S√°mi people that the proposed line would pass through reindeer grazing lands. Also, new rail link from Simpele to Elisenvaara, with track doubling and electrification at 25 kV 50 Hz AC from Elisenvaara via Sortavala and Suoyarvi to Petrozavodsk is now proposed, for passenger trains (with Finnish bilevel coaches) from Helsinki to Petrozavodsk, Kirov, Krasnoyarsk, and Khabarovsk (via Baikal-Amur Mainline).  Operators  The national railway company VR has a monopoly on passenger transport. In Helsinki local traffic, class Sm5 EMUs are owned by P√§√§kaupunkiseudun Junakalusto Oy, but are operated by VR. The new class Sm6 Allegro trains are owned and operated by Karelian Trains, a 50/50 joint venture of VR and Russian railway company RZD. The trains are operated by VR personnel while on Finnish soil. While private rail operators can transport freight since 2007, most trains are still run by VR. Ratarahti Oy was granted its safety certificate by the Finnish Transport Safety Agency in September 2011 and it will start shunting work at the Imatra rail yard in 2013, with first test runs on . Proxion Train Oy received its safety certificate in May 2011 and is set to start freight traffic in 2014 after problems with acquiring used equipment from VR. Another new operator, Fenniarail, has found used locomotives in Czech Republic which are convertible to broad gauge, in operation 2016. VR prefers scrapping unneeded rolling stock rather than selling them, in order to limit competition. Used vehicles can't be imported from other countries because of a different rail gauge which vehicles normally can't be converted to. Used vehicles from former Soviet union do not fulfil Finnish regulations. New locomotives are too expensive since they are not constructed for broad gauge.Finland; Kolarit√•gen. (Bildserie) pgr (in Swedish) One private railway company exists in Finland, the Karhula‚ÄìSunila Railroad, a short branch line with freight traffic only, in Karhula, near Kotka.

The largest class of electric locomotives are the Sr1 locomotives that were taken into use in 1973. They are now supplemented by the Sr2- and Sr3-class electric locomotives and the high-speed Sm3 Pendolino units. The first electric trains started to operate on in Helsinki local traffic, initially between Helsinki and Kirkkonummi and slowly extending to Riihim√§ki on . Heading northwards, the electric wires reached Sein√§joki in 1975, Kokkola in 1981, Oulu in 1983, Rovaniemi in 2004, and their current northernmost point in Kemij√§rvi in 2014. In addition to the line to Kemij√§rvi, another line recently electrified was the line from Sein√§joki to Vaasa in 2011. The next railway line to be electrified is the railway from Turku to Uusikaupunki, electrification is scheduled to begin in 2019.https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10035535 = Running speeds = Running speeds on the Finnish railway network at the start of the year 2011. The maximum speed for passenger traffic is , but is achieved only on the Kerava‚ÄìLahti railway line. Freight trains have a maximum speed of . Actual speed limits vary depending on the train type and track portion. Some delays can occur in autumn and winter due to weather conditions (e.g. high winds). = Safety = The signalling system used on the railway network in Finland comprises color-light signals and fixed signs. They are used together with ATP-VR/RHK (EBICAB 900), a train protection system usually referred to as JKV () which has to be used on rolling stock. The system is set to be upgraded to ERTMS/ETCS in the upcoming years, however later than in other European countries due to the low age of the current train protection system. The first ETCS units are set to be installed in rolling stock during 2013, and the first ERTMS signalled portion of track should be opened between 2019 and 2025. = Platform heights = ;Platform height 550mm above rail *Helsinki - H√§meelinna - Tampere *Helsinki - Turku *Kerava - Lahti - Kouvola - Vainikkala (except Luum√§ki) ;Platform height 200mm above rail *The remainder of the stations Lines Most passenger rail services in Finland radiate from Helsinki Central, serving most major cities including Tampere, Turku, Oulu, Rovaniemi, Kouvola, Kuopio, Jyv√§skyl√§ and Joensuu among others.

His oeuvre includes three symphonies, several concertos, part-songs, songs, chamber music and opera (which he called \\"music drama\\" after Wagner). His best known work was the opera The Immortal Hour. His Bethlehem (1915), based on the Coventry Nativity Play and notable for its choral arrangements of traditional Christmas carols, also became very popular with choral societies worldwide. Among his many works, the prolific Boughton composed a complete series of five operas of Arthurian mythos, written over a period of thirty-five years: The Birth of Arthur (1909), The Round Table (1915‚Äì16), The Lily Maid (1933‚Äì34), Galahad (1943‚Äì44) and Avalon (1944‚Äì45). Other operas by Boughton include The Moon Maiden (1918); Alkestis (1920‚Äì22); and The Ever Young (1928‚Äì29). Through the Boughton Trust (see below), many of his major works have been recorded and are available on disc including The Immortal Hour, Bethlehem, Symphony No 1 Oliver Cromwell, Symphony No 2 Deirdre, Symphony No 3, Oboe Concerto No 1, string quartets and various chamber pieces and songs. In addition to his compositions, Boughton is remembered for his attempt to create an \\"English Bayreuth\\" at Glastonbury, establishing the first series of Glastonbury Festivals. They ran with enormous success from 1914 until 1926. Biography Rutland Boughton was the son of grocer William Boughton (1841‚Äì1905) whose shop was situated in Buckingham Street in the town of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. From an early age he showed signs of exceptional talent for music although formal training opportunities did not immediately become available to him. In 1892 he was apprenticed to a London concert agency and six years later he attracted the attention of several influential musicians including members of the Rothschild family which enabled him to raise sufficient monies to study at the Royal College of Music in London. While at RCM, Boughton studied under Charles Villiers Stanford and Walford Davies from 1898 to 1901.Randel, p. 97. He later took up ad hoc work first in the pit of the Haymarket Theatre then as official accompanist to the baritone David Ffrangcon-Davies (whose daughter, Gwen, later became associated with the Glastonbury Festivals in her famous role Etain in The Immortal Hour). In 1903, he married former Aylesbury neighbour's daughter, Florence Hobley; he lived to regret the marriage. It was in 1905 (the year he completed his first symphony Oliver Cromwell) that he was approached by Sir Granville Bantock to become a member of staff at the Birmingham and Midland Institute of Music (now the Birmingham Conservatoire). =Birmingham and Midland Institute of Music= It was while at Birmingham (1905 to 1911) that Boughton was presented with many new opportunities and made many friends. He proved an excellent teacher and an outstanding choral conductor which won him much recognition. He was drawn into socialist ideas through the writings of John Ruskin, William Morris, Edward Carpenter and George Bernard Shaw, the last with whom he developed a lifelong relationship. It was also during those years that he became attached to the young art student, Christina Walshe, who was later to become his partner and artistic \\"right-hand man\\" for his Glastonbury projects. His friendship with Shaw had begun when Boughton had been turned down from his invitation to collaborate on an opera. Shaw initially refused to be associated with any of Boughton's music but Boughton would not be dissuaded and eventually Shaw realised they had something in common that was to endure. Out of his process of self-discovery and self-education came the artistic aims that were to occupy Boughton for all his life. As a young man, he planned a fourteen-day cycle of dramas on the life of Christ in which the story would be enacted on a small stage in the middle of an orchestra while soloists and the chorus would comment on the action. Although this did not come to anything, the idea remained with him and by 1907 Boughton's discovery of the theories and practises of Richard Wagner, combined with his impression that the church's vision of Christianity had somewhat failed, resulted in another subject ‚Äì King Arthur. Based upon the Ring Cycle at Bayreuth, and parallel to the ideas of the young poet Reginald Buckley in his book \\"Arthur of Britain\\", Boughton set out to create a new form of opera which he later called \\"choral drama\\". At this point, the three collaborators ‚Äì Boughton, Buckley and Walshe ‚Äì sought to establish a national festival of drama. Whilst London's Covent Garden was ideal for the established operatic repertoire, it would not prove to be so for the plans that Boughton and Buckley had and eventually they decided that they should build their own theatre and, using local talent, set up a form of commune or cooperative. At first Letchworth Garden City in Hertfordshire was deemed a suitable location for the project (the Arts and Crafts Movement was significant at that time) but they later turned to the Somerset town of Glastonbury, the alleged resting place of King Arthur and in an area steeped in legend. Meanwhile, Sir Dan Godfrey and his Bournemouth orchestra had established a reputation for supporting new English music and it was here where Boughton's first opera from the Arthurian cycle, The Birth of Arthur, received its first performance. It was also at Bournemouth where Boughton's 2nd Symphony had a first hearing and The Queen of Cornwall was performed for the first time using an orchestra, and attended by Thomas Hardy on whose poem the opera was based. Boughton at Glastonbury, circa 1915 =Glastonbury= By 1911, Boughton had resigned from Birmingham and moved to Glastonbury where, together with Walshe and Buckley, he began to focus on establishing the country's first national annual summer school of music. The first production was not the projected Arthurian Cycle but that of Boughton's new choral-drama, The Immortal Hour, composed in 1912, which with a national appeal to raise funds was produced with the full backing of Sir Granville Bantock, Thomas Beecham, John Galsworthy, Eugene Goossens, Gustav Holst, Dame Ethel Smyth and Shaw and others. Sir Edward Elgar promised to lay the foundation stone and Beecham to lend his London orchestra. However, in August 1914, the month set for the opening of the first production, World War 1 had been declared and the full plans had to be postponed. Boughton, however, was determined to proceed and the Festival began and in place of Beecham's orchestra, he used a grand piano and instead of a theatre, the local Assembly RoomsGlastonbury Assembly Rooms that were to remain the centre of activities until the end of the Festivals in 1926, by which time Boughton had mounted over 350 staged works, 100 chamber concerts, a number of exhibitions and a series of lectures and recitals ‚Äì something never previously witnessed in England. In 1922, Boughton's Festival Players went on tour and became established at Bristol in the Folk Festival House (now demolished) and at Bournemouth. From 1911, Boughton also worked as a music critic, initially for the Daily Citizen and Daily Herald, and in later years, for the Sunday Worker. Scene from The Immortal Hour The most notable and most successful of Boughton's works is the opera The Immortal Hour, an adaptation of the play by Fiona Macleod (the pseudonym of William Sharp) based on Celtic mythology. Having been successful in Glastonbury and well received in Birmingham, the director of the then new Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Barry Jackson, decided to take the Glastonbury Festival Players' production to London where it achieved the record breaking run of over 600 performances. On its arrival at the Regent Theatre in 1922, it secured an initial run of over 200 consecutive performances and a further 160 in 1923, with a highly successful revival in 1932. People came to see the opera on more than one occasion (including members of the Royal family) and especially to see and hear the young Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies whose portrayal as Etain began her professional acting career. In addition to The Immortal Hour and Bethlehem, his other operas The Queen of Cornwall (1924) based on Thomas Hardy's play, and Alkestis (1922) based on Gilbert Murray's translation of the Greek play Alcestis, by Euripides (which was performed at Covent Garden by the British National Opera Company and was broadcast by the nascent British Broadcasting Company, both in 1924), were also very well received. These latter works have not been publicly heard since the mid-1960s when the original Boughton Trust, organised by Adolph Borsdorf, sponsored professional concert performances in London and Street in Somerset. King Herod's Court in Bethlehem, Glastonbury 1915 The downfall of the Glastonbury Festivals was hastened when Boughton, sympathising with the miners' lock-out and general strike of 1926, insisted on staging his very popular Nativity opera Bethlehem (1915) at Church House, Westminster, London, with Jesus born in a miner's cottage and Herod as a top-hatted capitalist, flanked by soldiers and police.Liner notes to Hyperion Records, Russell Boughton, The Immortal Hour The event caused much embarrassment to the people of Glastonbury who withdrew their support from Boughton, causing the Festival Players to go into liquidation. Beavans Hill, Kilcot Commemoration plaque at Kilcot =Later life= From 1927 until his death in 1960, Boughton lived at Kilcot, near Newent in Gloucestershire where he completed the last two operas of his Arthurian cycle (Avalon and Galahad, which to this day have not been performed) and produced some of his finest works, the quality of which has only been realised within the past twenty years. These include his 2nd and 3rd symphonies (the latter was first performed at the London Kingsway Theatre in 1939 in the presence of, among others, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Clarence Raybould and Alan Bush), a number of pieces for oboe (including two concertos, one dedicated to his talented daughter Joy Boughton and the other to L√©on Goossens), chamber music and a number of orchestral pieces. In 1934 and 1935, Boughton attempted to repeat his earlier successes at Glastonbury with festivals commissioned at Stroud and Bath, and these saw the release of new works, The Lily Maid (the third opera in the Arthurian Cycle) and The Ever Young. Boughton's reputation was, however, affected by his political leanings towards Communism, and his music was subsequently neglected for the next forty years. Boughton died at the home of his daughter, Joy, in Barnes, London, in 1960.  Quotations about Boughton  * \\"I believe that Boughton's works will eventually be regarded as one of the most remarkable achievements in the story of our music\\" ‚Äì Charles Kennedy Scott, 1915 * \\"The Immortal Hour is a work of genius\\" ‚Äì Sir Edward Elgar, 1924 * \\"... The Immortal Hour enchants me. The whole thing gripped me\\" ‚Äì Dame Ethel Smyth, 1922 * \\"Now that Elgar is gone, you have the only original personal English style on the market...I find that I have acquired a great taste for it\\" ‚Äì George Bernard Shaw, 1934 * \\"I remember vividly how Boughton made his characters live, and the masterly effect of the choral writing\\" ‚Äì Sir Arthur Bliss on The Immortal Hour, 1949 * \\"In any other country, such a work as The Immortal Hour would have been in the repertoire years ago\\" ‚Äì Ralph Vaughan Williams, 1949  The Rutland Boughton Music Trust  The Rutland Boughton Music TrustThe Rutland Boughton Music Trust was established in 1978, the year of the composer's Centenary, to encourage performances and sponsor recordings of his works. Many of these, including some world premieres, now appear on disc with the Hyperion Records label. The Oliver Cromwell symphony ‚Äì first heard in 2005 ‚Äì and three of the Songs of the English (last heard around 1904/5) have been released by Dutton,Dutton as well as a selection of Songs for mezzo and pianoforte on the British Music Society's own label.

A * Ace: Serve where the tennis ball lands inside the service box and is not touched by the receiver; thus, a shot that is both a serve and a winner is an ace. Aces are usually powerful and generally land on or near one of the corners at the back of the service box. Initially, the term was used to indicate the scoring of a point. * Action: Synonym of spin * Ad court: Left side of the court of each player, so called because the ad (advantage) point immediately following a deuce is always served to this side of the court. * Ad: Used by the chair umpire to announce the score when a player has the advantage, meaning they won the point immediately after a deuce. See scoring in tennis * Advantage set: Set won by a player or team having won at least six games with a two-game advantage over the opponent (as opposed to a tiebreak format). Final sets in the singles draws of the French Open remains the only major tennis event to use all advantage sets. In the past, they were used at Olympic tennis events (until 2012), Davis Cup (until 2015), Fed Cup (until 2015), Australian Open (until 2018) and Wimbledon (until 2018) when they all switched to tie breaks. * Advantage: When one player wins the first point from a deuce and needs one more point to win the game; not applicable when using deciding points. * All- Comers: Tournament in which all players took part except the reigning champion. The winner of the All-Comers event would play the title holder in the Challenge Round. * All-court (or All-court game): Style of play that is a composite of all the different playing styles, which includes baseline, transition, and serve and volley styles. * All: Used by the chair umpire to announce scores when both players have the same number of points or the same number of games. When both players are at 40, the preferred term is deuce. * Alley: Area of the court between the singles and the doubles sidelines, which together are known as tramlines. * Alternate: Player or team that gains acceptance into the main draw of a tournament when a main draw player or team withdraws. Such a player may be a lucky loser. * Approach shot: A groundstroke shot used as a setup as the player approaches the net, often using underspin or topspin. * ATP Champions' Race (or ATP Rankings Race To London): ATP point ranking system that starts at the beginning of the year and by the end of the year mirrors the ATP entry system ranking. The top eight players at the end of the year qualify for the ATP Finals. * ATP Finals: Formerly known as the Tennis Masters Cup (see T below), it is the annual season-ending tournament featuring eight of the top-ranked men in the world (plus two alternates). * ATP: Abbreviation for Association of Tennis Professionals, the main organizing body of men's professional tennis; governs the ATP World Tour with the largest tournaments for men. * Australian formation: In doubles, a formation where the server and partner stand on the same side of the court before starting the point. B Ball boy in action * Backcourt: The area of the tennis court between the baseline and the service line. * Backhand: Stroke in which the ball is hit with the back of the racket hand facing the ball at the moment of contact. A backhand is often hit by a right-handed player when the ball is on the left side of the court, and vice versa. * Backhand smash: A type of smash played over the backhand side. * Backspin: Shot that rotates the ball backwards after it is hit; also known as slice or underspin. The trajectory of the shot is affected by an upward force that lifts the ball. See Magnus effect. * Backswing: Portion of a swing where the racket is swung backwards in preparation for the forward motion to hit the ball. * Bagel: Colloquial term for winning or losing a set 6‚Äì0 (the shape of the zero being reminiscent of the round shape of a bagel). See also breadstick. * Bagnall‚ÄìWild: A method of draw which places all byes in the first round. Introduced in the 1880s. * Ball boy (also ball girl or ballkid): a person, commonly a child tasked with retrieving tennis balls from the court that have gone out of play and supplying the balls to the players before their service. Ball boys in net positions normally kneel near the net and run across the court to collect the ball, while ball boys in the back positions stand in the back along the perimeter of the arena. Ball boys in the back are responsible for giving the balls to the player serving. * Ball toss: The action of throwing up the ball prior to the serve. * Baseline: Line at the farthest ends of the court indicating the boundary of the area of play. If the ball goes over the baseline it will be the other player's point. * baseliner: Player who plays around the baseline during play and relies on the quality of their ground strokes. * Big serve: Forceful serve, usually giving an advantage in the point for the server. * Bisque: One stroke (point), which may be claimed by the receiver at any part of the set. Part of the handicapping odds and used during the early era of the sport. Abolished by the LTA in 1890. * Block (or blocked return): Defensive shot with relatively little backswing and shortened action instead of a full swing, usually while returning a serve. * Bounce: The upward movement of the ball after it has hit the ground. The trajectory of the bounce can be affected by the surface and weather, the amount and type of spin and the power of the shot. * Breadstick: Colloquial term for winning or losing a set 6‚Äì1, with the straight shape of the one supposedly being reminiscent of the straight shape of a breadstick. See also bagel. * Break back: To win a game as the receiving player or team immediately after losing the previous game as the serving player or team. * Break point: Point which, if won by the receiver, would result in a break of service; arises when the score is 30‚Äì40 or 40‚Äìad. A double break point or two break points arises at 15‚Äì40; a triple break point or three break points arises at 0‚Äì40. * Break: To win a game as the receiving player or team, thereby breaking serve. At high level of play the server is more likely to win a game, so breaks are often key moments of a match. Noun: break (service break) (e.g. \\"to be a break down\\" means \\"to have, in a set, one break fewer than the opponent\\", \\"to be a double break up\\" means \\"to have, in a set, two breaks more than the opponent\\"). * Breaker: Colloquial term for tiebreak. * Buggy whip: Forehand hit with a follow-through that does not go across the body and finish on the opposite side, but rather goes from low to high, crosses the opposite shoulder (optionally) and finishes on the same side (similar to the driver of a horse-drawn carriage whipping a horse). Used, for example, by Rafael Nadal (racket head crosses the opposite shoulder) and Maria Sharapova (racket head stays on the same shoulder). * Bumper guard: A piece of plastic that protects the outside of the upper-half of the racket head. * Bye: Automatic advancement of a player to the next round of a tournament without facing an opponent. Byes are often awarded in the first round to the top-seeded players in a tournament. *Bunt: To use the power of the opponents shot and hit it back with a short swing. C court with its dimensions and components * Call: Verbal utterance by a line judge or chair umpire declaring that a ball landed outside the valid area of play. * Can opener: Serve hit by a right-handed player with slice, landing on or near the intersection of the singles tramline and service line in the deuce court (or in the ad court for a left-handed server). * Cannonball: Somewhat archaic term for a very fast, flat serve. * Career Golden Slam: In addition to having won all four major titles in their career, a player that has also won an Olympic gold medal is said to have achieved a career Golden Slam. Only four players have ever achieved this in singles: Steffi Graf (1988), Andre Agassi (1996), Rafael Nadal (2010) and Serena Williams (2012). The term is rarely used in doubles, although the feat has been more common in that discipline. It has been achieved individually by nine wheelchair tennis players and three able- bodied players (Pam Shriver, Gigi Fern√°ndez, Daniel Nestor), and by three teams (The Woodies, the Williams sisters, and the Bryan brothers). Tennis at the Olympics was not played 1928‚Äì1984. * Career Grand Slam (or career slam): Players who have won all four Major championships over the course of their career (but not within the same calendar year) are said to have won a career Grand Slam. * Carpet: A surface for tennis courts consisting of textile or polymer materials supplied in rolls. Previously common for indoor professional events, the surface was dropped from major pro tournaments in 2009.

A let can also be called during play when there is some distraction to either player not caused by the players themselves, such as a ball boy moving behind a receiver, debris flying across the court in windy conditions, or a ball accidentally falling out of a player's pocket or entering from a neighboring court. The call is made by the chair umpire when one is assigned to the match, as in professional matches, or one of the players when there is no chair umpire.

If the opposing player or players are up at the net, the intention may be an offensive lob in order to win the point outright. In a defensive lob, the intent is to give the player time to recover and get in position, or, if the opponents are at the net, to force them to chase down the lob. See also moonball. * Love game: Shutout game, won without the opponent scoring a single point. * Love: A score of zero (e.g. \\"15-0\\" is spoken \\"fifteen-love\\"; \\"to hold to love\\" means \\"to win the game when serving with the opponent scoring zero points\\"; \\"to break to love\\" means \\"to win the game when receiving with the opponent scoring zero points\\").

He is also the winner of the 2013 Herzberg Medal of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the 2017 Killam Prize. Doolittle has made significant contributions to the study of cyanobacteria. He found evidence for the endosymbiont origins of chloroplasts, and developed a theoretical basis for the initial evolution of eukaryotes. He has shown the importance of horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotic evolution. , he has been Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He received his BA in Biochemical Sciences from Harvard University in 1963 and his PhD from Stanford University in 1967, under Charles Yanofsky. He went on to do postdoctoral fellowships with Sol Spiegelman and Norman R. Pace. In 1981, Doolittle received some level of notoriety for his article in The CoEvolution Quarterly entitled \\"Is Nature Really Motherly?\\". This was a sharp rebuttal of J. E. Lovelock's formulation of the Gaia Theory. Doolittle's article is often cited by Lovelock's critics. Because of his philosophical musings on the non-existence of an all-encompassing Tree of Life, Doolittle has occasionally been cited on Intelligent Design blogs. However, though Doolittle argues that a bifurcating tree is not an adequate metaphor for the evolution of life on earth, he is not a supporter of Intelligent Design. A single common ancestor and tree relating all of life on earth is not a necessary component of the theory of descent with modification, the essence of evolution. Doolittle is currently involved in a debate about the proper use of function (biology) within evolutionary biology sparked by controversy over the results of the ENCODE consortium stating that 80% of the genome is \\"functional\\". He is a supporter of the concept of junk DNA. In addition to his contributions to evolutionary biology, Doolittle is an artist who studied at NSCAD University, achieving a BA in photography.

The character has been depicted as a member of the Young Avengers, a team of superheroes in the Marvel Universe. Hulkling's character is patterned on the Hulk, with shapeshifting abilities that go far beyond the ability to mimic the Hulk, and superhuman strength. Publication history Hulkling was created by writer Allan Heinberg and artist Jim Cheung and first was in Young Avengers #1 (April 2005) along with other teenage heroes patterned after founding Avengers members. Hulkling was originally planned to be a female character. According to Tom Brevoort, \\"Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as a man. I suspect this was as close as Allan felt he could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic. But as we got underway... he started to have second thoughts and approached me about maintaining Hulkling and Wiccan as two involved male characters\\".Xtra: In print Young Avengers He was also featured in Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways and appeared in the Civil War crossover event. Hulkling then appeared in the 2013 Young Avengers series by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie, and appeared with Wiccan in New Avengers as part of All-New All-Different Marvel. Most recently, Hulkling has been a key player in Empyre, Marvel's summer 2020 crossover event. A one-shot, Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling, written by Chip Zdarsky and queer author Anthony Oliveira, fills in some of the backstory of how Hulkling was called on to become emperor and his relationship with Wiccan. Fictional character biography Teddy in Young Avengers Vol. 1, #9 (December 2005) Art by Jim Cheung. In his first appearance, little is revealed about Hulkling except for the fact he is raised by a single mother. All this changes when the shapeshifting extraterrestrial known as the Super-Skrull appears, stating that Teddy is a Skrull. The Super-Skrull is surprised to learn that Teddy has super strength and wonders \\"perhaps the rumors about his father are true.\\" The Super Skrull follows the Young Avengers to Wiccan's house, where Teddy's mother is waiting for him. The Super-Skrull releases a device designed to turn Teddy into his true form in an attempt to prove his Skrull heritage. While the device does not change Teddy's physical appearance, Ms. Altman, who is also caught in the device's beam, turns into a Skrull. When the Super-Skrull accuses her of being a traitor to her race, she responds by saying that the Empress ordered her to protect Teddy, even from the likes of the Super-Skrull, pulling out a gun. The Super-Skrull responds by killing her, though it was unintentional.Young Avengers #9 (December 2005). Marvel Comics. The Super- Skrull reveals that years ago during the Kree-Skrull War, he kidnapped Captain Mar-Vell, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch, presenting them to the Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII. Though the heroes later escaped, the Emperor's daughter Princess Anelle conceived a child with Mar-Vell. At birth, the child was marked for death by Dorrek VII. However, his chambermaid smuggled him to Earth and raised him as Teddy. The Super-Skrull reveals that his intention is to bring Teddy back to the Empire so that he may unify his people. However, Kree soldiers arrive to take Teddy as one of their own. A battle erupts between the Kree and the Skrull. Teddy ends the conflict by surrendering himself. It is settled that Teddy will spend half an Earth-year with the Kree and the other half with the Skrull, at which time he will declare his ultimate allegiance. However, the \\"Teddy\\" that left Earth is actually the Super-Skrull in disguise. The real Teddy remains on Earth.Young Avengers #12 (August 2006). Marvel Comics. =Civil War= Along with the rest of his team, Hulkling sides with Secret Avengers against the Superhuman Registration Act during the Civil War storyline. He plays a pivotal role in Captain America's plan for the final confrontation with Iron Man's forces, impersonating Yellowjacket in order to free the imprisoned heroes of Prison 42.Civil War #6. Marvel Comics. =Meeting Captain Marvel= Hulkling contacts the mysteriously revived Captain Marvel to confront him about his identity as Mar-Vell's son. Mar-Vell confirms the Super Skrull's story concerning Teddy's origins and that he could be Teddy's father, though he was unaware of Teddy's existence because he and the Skrull Princess Anelle never saw each other again. Mar-Vell comforts a frustrated Teddy, who is upset at Mar-Vell's intention to return to the past, expressing an interest in spending more time with him before he dies. Later, Teddy asserts that he never saw Mar-Vell alive again.Young Avengers Presents #2. Marvel Comics. Teddy exhibits frustration with being essentially orphaned during the events of \\"Family Matters\\" and his hopes of establishing a father- son relationship with Mar-Vell, his last remaining parent. Later storylines reveal that the \\"revived\\" Captain Marvel that Teddy met was a Skrull imposter named Khn'nr, intended by Skrull scientists to impersonate the original Kree soldier. Due to some misprogramming, the Skrull actually believed himself to be Mar-Vell.Captain Marvel (vol. 7) #5. Marvel Comics. In the Children's Crusade: Young Avengers One Shot a future version of Teddy is shown to have taken up the mantle of Captain Marvel wearing a version of his father's classic costume with the white and green coloring of his original Kree uniform. =Secret Invasion= The Young Avengers confront a group of rampaging super-powered Skrulls. He tries to use his Skrull heritage to calm them but is instead battered down with energy blasts.Secret Invasion #3 It was revealed that Veranke and a few higher up in position of the invasion have specifically ordered Teddy's death, without informing the soldiers of his royal heritage, for fear that it could confuse and divide the loyalties of their soldiers. Teddy is saved from execution at the last second by Xavin.Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers #1. Marvel Comics.

With his friends Marvel Boy and Prodigy (David Alleyne), Hulkling tries to save innocent people from being overwhelmed by cosmic secrets that are driving them insane.Original Sins #1‚Äì5 (2014). Marvel Comics. =All-New, All-Different Marvel= As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Hulkling (alongside Wiccan) became a member of Sunspot's New Avengers. Eventually, a small group of Kree‚ÄìSkrull hybrids arrive on Earth and kidnap Teddy so that he can assume his position as king and unite the two warring alien races. Teddy gains the sword of the prior king and uses it to defeat ghost wizard Moridun but announces that he has commitments to protect Earth and will return to fulfill his destiny if and when he is ready. Later, he manages to rescue Billy who was taken over by Moridun by convincing him to fight. =Empyre= Teddy later accepts his heritage and the mantle of \\"Dorrek VIII\\", and, at the cost of leaving Billy, becomes the new ruler of the Kree‚ÄìSkrull Alliance, upon which he begins preparations to invade Earth for \\"the final war\\".Incoming! #1. Marvel Comics. This was further depicted when Raksor and Bel-Dann visit Teddy during his trip to Krakoa where they want him to bring the Kree and the Skrull to an alliance in order to combat a growing threat on the Moon. Their meeting is crashed by some Skrull soldiers that make up the Children of Lost Tarnax who called them heretics. A fight breaks out until Teddy becomes Hulkling and grabs the Sword of Space which frightens the remaining Children of Tarnax. Upon being beamed up to the Imperial Flagship, Hulkling meets with Tanalth the Translator who names him Dorrek VIII of the newly-founded Kree‚ÄìSkrull Alliance. When Tanalth the Pursuer wants to deal with the Empyre's insurgency, Hulkling states that they should do a peace offering first. She then introduces the royal guards that will be working for Hulkling like Captain Glory and the Kree‚ÄìSkrull sorceress M'ur-Ginn of the Knights of the Infinite. When the latest member is revealed to be Super-Skrull, Hulkling punches him for what he did to his mother. Super-Skrull stated that he actually slew the chambermaid that raised him after absconding him from Princess Anelle which he now regrets. After breaking up the argument, Tanalth the Pursuer explains that the Kree and Skrull fleets are proceeding to the Titan stargate near Saturn. He does suggest they make a stop first. Hulking visits Mar-Vell's grave where he states that his mom has told him about his heroics. Though Hulkling had to break ties with Wiccan who states that he'll be on Earth when he returns. As well as setting Hulkling up for the Empyre event, Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling also shows the importance to Hulkling of his relationship with Wiccan. It was important to co-author Anthony Oliveira that the one-shot depict the everyday \\"queer life\\" that Hulkling lives and to expand on his character, who is often \\"left on the bench\\" while \\"Wiccan is off saving the world\\". Oliveira had previously shown the couple having a queer everyday life with Wiccan going to a drag brunch with Loki, with Hulkling largely lounging on the sofa at home, eating breakfast cereal from a bowl balanced on Excelsior, his Star Sword. The events of Emperor Hulkling start at a drag bar, where Hulkling is drinking with fellow Young Avengers Prodigy and Speed, who are also depicted as a gay couple. Relationships Exchanges between Wiccan (when Wiccan was known as Asgardian) and Hulkling (and the latter's character design) in early issues of Young Avengers led some readers to speculate that the two young men had a much more intimate bond than mere friendship. As early as Young Avengers #2, each issue's letters page included an exchange of reader opinions between people who supported and people who were against the portrayal of gay superheroes. Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation at a San Diego Comic-Con panel, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship in issue #12, and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly. In Young Avengers Special, the team agrees to give an interview to Kat Farrell and Jessica Jones, and warns Billy and Teddy that Farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true. After some deliberation, the two decide to tell her, referencing one of Marvel's most prominent gay superheroes when Teddy adds, \\"Why should Northstar have all the fun?\\" In Cable & Deadpool #30, Deadpool is caught by Captain America's Secret Avengers, with whom the Young Avengers had merged. Deadpool, a typical breaker of the fourth wall, made a smart-ass reference to Hulkling's and Wiccan's being gay by referring to the team as \\"...The Ripe, Nubile Young Avengers! And I'm especially discomfited to admit that Wiccan and Hulkling are looking especially nubile...\\" In Avengers: The Children's Crusade #9, Teddy proposes to Billy and the two share their first on-panel kiss. In New Avengers, the hybrids refer to Teddy as King Dorrek VIII and Billy as his \\"prince consort\\". A flashforward to 20XX shows an older Billy and Teddy living happily together with a daughter, Katie. Powers and abilities Hulkling is the extraterrestrial hybrid offspring of an enhanced Kree warrior, Captain Marvel, and Skrull royalty, Princess Anelle, resulting in various abilities derived from the unique combination of his parents' genetic material. His powers exceed those of ordinary individuals of either race; they most likely are much stronger than those of other potential hybrids due to his father's various enhancements prior to Hulkling's conception. His shape-shifting and accelerated healing factor derive from his Skrull heritage, while his superhuman strength originates from his enhanced Kree background. His shape- shifting abilities allow him to impersonate others, independently alter parts of his body, and manifest different physical abilities. For example, he can form claws, extend his reach, create body armor, and grow wings (which enable him to fly). Hulkling can use his shapeshifting to increase his body's density and composition, giving him a very strong resistance to pain and injury. He is able to withstand great impact forces, such as falls from great heights, repeated bludgeoning from superhumanly strong beings, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury. High caliber bullets and bladed weapons are also unable to pierce his skin. Hulkling's shapeshifting also demonstrated the ability to operate without his conscious thought in order to protect himself from injury; his body shifted its biomass to protect vital organs, while the Warden of The Cube was attempting to vivisect him in Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways. His healing factor allows him to heal wounds quickly, but not on a scale with Wolverine or Hulk. Hulkling's alien anatomy also prevents him from being controlled by pheromone-based powers, such as those used by Daken.Dark Reign: Young Avengers #5. Marvel Comics. In recent stories Teddy has come into possession of Excelsior, a mystical cosmic sword owned by his ancestor Dorrek Supreme, which only passes down to those of Dorrek's line. Its wielder, as unmitigated ruler of both Kree and Skrull and Lord of the Knights of Infinity, is entitled to inherit rulership of the entire cosmos. Its skin alone has arcane abilities such as negating and absorbing magic as well as canceling out eldritch entities (i.e., an entity from the universe before the present one) using its knife edge.New Avengers Vol 4 #4. Marvel Comics. In two comics written by Anthony Oliveira, Hulkling is also shown (mis)using Excelsior as background furniture ‚Äî in Drag Brunch with Loki, Hulkling is depicted eating breakfast cereal using Excelsior as a table; in Emperor Hulkling, Excelsior is leaning against his nightstand, with a dirty sock hanging over the hilt.

Route description I-15/US 93 to the north end of SR 604 in 2015 State Route 604 exists in two discontinuous sections. The first is a section of Las Vegas Boulevard at the intersection of Tropicana Avenue. The second is the section of Las Vegas Boulevard going northeast from Carey Avenue in North Las Vegas. SR 604 enters the unincorporated town of Sunrise Manor, where it has intersections at Cheyenne Avenue (SR 574), Lamb Boulevard (SR 610) and Nellis Boulevard (SR 612). After that, SR 604 then passes Nellis Air Force Base where it intersects Craig Road (SR 573) and the main entrance of Nellis AFB. The highway then continues northeast as SR 604 passes the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and later re-enters an undeveloped area of the city of North Las Vegas.

It is one of the more remote towns in Umbria, on a mountain road from Norcia and Cascia (33 km and 12 km NNE respectively) to Leonessa and Rieti in the Lazio (10 km S and 51 km SSW). The population of the comune was 648 in 2010, with the town proper accounting for about half of that; the frazioni of Monteleone are Butino, Rescia, Ruscio, and Trivio. Monteleone is famous for one of the world's great archaeological finds: a 6th‚Äëcentury BC Etruscan chariot that quickly followed the path of money and by the early 20th century had already wound up in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. A copy of the chariot is on display in Monteleone. There remain, however, few if any traces of the town's Roman days: destroyed and rebuilt by the Spoletans in the 12th century, it offers at present an essentially medieval appearance. The main monument in Monteleone is the 14th-century church of San Francesco, with a cloister now serving as a lapidary museum, a Gothic door and a fresco of Christ crucified in the full robes of a bishop, with a loaf of bread under one foot and a chalice of wine under the other. Under the cloister a second church can be seen, complete with a 14th‚Äëcentury fresco. Other monuments include several other medieval churches, the 15th‚Äëcentury Palazzo Bernab√≤, and vestiges of the town's medieval walls, including a clock tower.

Its members are known for their loud, enthusiastic support and the raucous atmosphere they create at Timbers games, along with their leftist political positions. Centered in section 107 of Providence Park in Portland, Oregon, the Army has grown steadily over the years to encompass much of the north end of the stadium.  History  The Timbers Army in 2009 performing a common tifo after a goal.The Timbers Army was founded in 2001 as the Cascade Rangers, a reference to the Cascade Range of mountains in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The group began with a group of eight people who decided to step up their support, and began congregating in section 107 (erroneously labeled on the stadium diagram to be behind the north goal) of the stadium then known as PGE Park to create a European-style rooting section for the club, complete with drumming, flags, scarves, smoke bombs and constant chanting and cheering. By 2002, the group had changed its name to the Timbers Army in order to lose any perception of partiality toward Scottish football club Rangers and because the Timbers uniforms at the time resembled those of Rangers rival Celtic. although this perception has since changed. As noted in a feature story on the front page of The Oregonian's Sports section in 2004, the Army had grown from a small group of dedicated fans to approximately 200 passionate supporters. By 2005, when the Army was the subject of a cover story by Willamette Week, its game day support was estimated at over 1,000. In 2008, the group's lobbying was credited with helping to convince the Portland City Council to approve a deal to bring Major League Soccer to Portland in 2011. The Timbers Army were named the fifth most influential Oregon sports figure in 2010 by The Oregonian, two spots ahead of Timbers owner Merritt Paulson. In the piece, sports columnist John Canzano said of the Army: > Drumming, chanting, scarf-wearing soccer supporters transformed overnight > from a band of PGE Park rowdies to an effective and influential political > organization. Their political clout ends up greasing the wheels on the > effort to bring Major League Soccer to Portland. The Army in March 2015 The supporters group gained national exposure in 2009 when they were featured in a two-page photo spread in the July 13-20 issue of Sports Illustrated which showed Army members celebrating after the Timbers scored against Seattle Sounders FC of MLS in the third round of the 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, a game they lost 2-1. A tifo created by the Timbers Army for that game was in 2011 named one of the five best tifos in MLS historyFrancis, Shawn (8 March 2011). \\"Supporters Week: Top 5 all-time MLS tifo\\", \\"MLS Soccer.com\\". Retrieved 21 March 2013.‚Äîit featured a giant Timber Jim chainsawing down Seattle's Space Needle‚Äîdespite the Timbers having played in the USL at the time. Culture Timbers Army during a 2014 match at Providence ParkThe Timbers Army has a strong history and culture of vocal support. The Timbers Army have utilized chants from all over the world (ex. \\"Guinness Boys\\", \\"Korobeiniki\\"), as well as having drums and trumpets to add to the noise in addition to the inclusion of pogoing, scarf waving, and dancing to add to the effect of various chants.http://www.katu.com/portlandpulp/blogs/rough-draft/126273308.html Timbers Army traditions are to sing the song \\"Portland Boys\\" immediately after kickoff, \\"Rose City 'Til I Die\\" when a goal is scored against the Timbers, \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" in the 80th minute, and \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" in the 85th minute. Various other chants are drawn from Russian, Greek, Latin American, Italian, and Arabian origins, speaking to the diversity of the section. The group engages in a number of charitable activities, including volunteering for the Portland-based nonprofit Friends of Trees and raising money for a trust fund established for Keiana Serrill, the granddaughter of Timber Jim, the team's lumberjack mascot. Timber Jim's daughter, Hannah, was killed in an automobile accident in 2004, and in her memory, the TA has made a tradition of singing \\"You Are My Sunshine.\\" Timber Jim retired in 2008, but the tradition is carried on by Jim's successor, \\"Timber Joey.\\" In 2010, the Timbers Army established 107 Independent Supporters Trust, or 107ist, in order to plan tifo, bus trips to away matches, and charitable work.  The Iron Front  In 2019, the Timbers Army made national news as they clashed with the MLS front office over the use of the Iron Front symbol on flags flown by Timbers supporters. MLS banned the anti-fascist symbol along with far-right regalia in a blanket ban of \\"political signage\\", which the Army contested, arguing in a statement that opposition to fascism, racism, and sexism was not political. A protracted public battle between the Army and MLS brass occurred, culminating in a protest during the August game against Seattle where the TA deliberately stayed silent for the first 33 minutes of the nationally- televised clash to commemorate 1933, the year that the Iron Front was disbanded in Nazi Germany. After the protests by the Timbers Army gained media exposure, Major League Soccer officials announced they would meet with the Army and other supporter groups around the league. A month later, on September 24, 2019, the league announced it would be reversing the policy that prohibited the Iron Front, allowing Timbers supporters to use the symbol again. This was a rare instance in American sports (and one of the first in MLS) that a supporter group had directly taken on the league with an organized response and forced a change in policy.  2020 George Floyd protests  After the George Floyd/Black Lives Matter protests swelled nationwide and with national attention on Portland, the Army released a statement re-upping their support for marginalized people of color and protestors. Included in the official release, the supporter group stated that they \\"strongly oppose the systems of racism and injustice that have caused so many black deaths in our country and our communities. [We] continue to mourn the loss of black lives at the hands of police and others\\", as well as a general call for direct action. = Police destruction of No Pity Van = The Army adopted a 1995 Chevrolet P30 van nicknamed the \\"No Pity Van\\" in 2010 that sells merchandise outside of Providence Park on gamedays. During the George Floyd protests, the No Pity Van had been active in providing water and medical supplies to protestors in downtown Portland. On the night of August 13, 2020, Portland Police Bureau officers slashed all 4 tires of the van despite the driver complying with police orders to vacate the area. This was the second instance of police vandalism to the van, after a federal officer fired munitions at the van on July 25, damaging the windshield. In response, the Army released a statement saying they had not only repaired the van but pledged to double down on their support of the protests. The next night, the van was back out on the streets providing aid.  Subgroups  The Timbers Army is composed of several different subgroups. These subgroups are unique in their own fashion and consist of many different personalities. However, all subgroups fall under the Timbers Army umbrella. Many of the subgroups produce their own special apparel and other items while the proceeds go directly back to Timbers Army causes. Unlike many teams in Major League Soccer, the Timbers Army is the only recognized independent supporters group of the Portland Timbers, while many other clubs have several supporters groups. The subgroups of the Timbers Army rival the size of many other supporters groups in MLS.

He held the positions of Regents Professor Emeritus and Writer-in-Residence at St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. Biography Hassler's boyhood home in Plainview, Minnesota Jon Hassler was born in Minneapolis, but spent his formative years in the small Minnesota towns of Staples and Plainview, where he graduated from high school. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from St. John's University in 1955. While teaching English at three different Minnesota high schools, he received his Master of Arts degree in English from the University of North Dakota in 1960. He continued to teach high school until 1965, when he began his collegiate teaching career: first at Bemidji State University, then Brainerd Community College (now called Central Lakes College), and finally at Saint John's, where he became the Writer-in- Residence in 1980. During his high-school teaching years, Hassler married and fathered three children. His first marriage lasted 25 years. He had two more marriages, the last to Gretchen Kresl Hassler. In 1994, Hassler was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a disease similar to Parkinson's. It caused vision and speech problems, as well as difficulty walking, but he was able to continue writing. He was reported to have finished a novel just days before his death. Hassler died in 2008, at the age of 74, at Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The Jon Hassler Theater in Plainview, Minnesota, is named for him. Works Much of Hassler's fiction involves characters struggling with transitions in their lives or searching for a central purpose. Many of his major characters are Catholic (or lapsed Catholics), and his novels frequently explore the role small-town life plays in shaping or limiting human potential. Hassler's novels have several recurring characters, including Miles Pruitt (the protagonist in Staggerford, who is referred to in A Green Journey, The Love Hunter, and The New Woman); Agatha McGee (in Staggerford, A Green Journey, Dear James, The Staggerford Flood, and The New Woman); Larry Quinn (in The Love Hunter and Rookery Blues); and Frank Healy (in North of Hope and The New Woman). =Novels= *Staggerford (1977) *Simon's Night (1979) *The Love Hunter (1981) *A Green Journey (1985) *Grand Opening (1987) *North of Hope (1990) *Dear James (1993) *Rookery Blues (1995) *The Dean's List (novel) (1998) *The Staggerford Flood (2002) *The Staggerford Murders (2004) *The New Woman (2005) =Short story collections= *Keepsakes and Other Stories (2000) *Rufus at the Door and Other Stories (2000) =Nonfiction= *Saint John's in Pictures - Introduction (1994) *My Staggerford Journal (1999) *Good People... from an Author's Life (2001) *Stories Teachers Tell (2004) =Children's literature= *Four Miles to Pinecone (1977) *Jemmy (novel) (1980) =Anthologized stories= *Inheriting the Land, edited by Mark Vinz and Thom Tammaro (\\"The Undistinguished Poet\\", 1993) *Imagining Home, edited by Mark Vinz and Thom Tammaro (\\"Remembering Houses\\", 1995) References External links *Jon Hassler's official website *Jon Hassler's writing room *The Jon Hassler Theater, which is a not for profit theater affiliated with the Rural America Arts Partnership, is located in Plainview, Minnesota.

Most were descended from late 18th-century settlers recruited by Austria-Hungary to repopulate the area and restore agriculture after the expulsion of the Ottoman Empire. They were able to keep their language and religion and initially developed strongly German communities in the region. The Danube Swabians are considered the most recent group of ethnic German people to emerge in Europe. In the 21st century, they are made up of ethnic Germans from many former and present-day countries: Germans of Hungary; Satu Mare Swabians; the Banat Swabians; and the Vojvodina Germans of Serbia's Vojvodina and Croatia's Slavonia, especially those in the Osijek region. They called themselves Schwowe in a Germanized spelling, or \\"Shvoveh\\" in an English spelling; in the singular first person, a Danube Swabian identified as a Schwob or a Shwobe. In Serbo-Croatian, Danube Swabians, alongside the local populace would refer to them as ≈†vabo, or Njemci, referring to their ethnic origin. However, the Carpathian Germans and Transylvanian Saxons are not included within the Danube Swabian group. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following the First World War, the settlement areas of the Danube Swabians were divided into three parts by the Allied Powers. One part remained with Hungary, the second part was allocated to Romania, and the third part fell to the newly established state of Yugoslavia. In this atmosphere of ethnic nationalism, the Danube Swabians had to fight for legal equality as citizens and for the preservation of their cultural traditions. In the 1930s, Nazi Germany promoted National Socialist ideas to the Danube Swabians and claimed the right to protect them as part of its reason for expanding into eastern Europe.gbv.de, Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Johannes H√ºrther: Rezension: Casagrande, Thomas: Die volksdeutsche SS-Division ‚ÄûPrinz Eugen‚Äú ‚Äì Die Banater Schwaben und die nationalsozialistischen Kriegsverbrechen. , 18. Dezember 2003, S. 8 The Danube Swabians faced particular challenges in the Second World War, when the Axis powers, including Germany, overran many of the nations where they lived. While they were initially favored by the occupiers, some were moved from their homes. As the war progressed and Germany needed more soldiers, the men were conscripted. Many atrocities took place during and after the war, as a result of the complicated allegiances and the brutality of the Nazis. Toward the end of the Second World War, tens of thousands of Danube Swabians fled west ahead of the advancing Soviet army. After the war, the remaining Danube Swabians were disenfranchised, their property seized, and many were deported to labor camps in the Soviet Union. Hungary expelled half of its ethnic Germans.Mathias Beer: Flucht und Vertreibung der Deutschen. Voraussetzungen, Verlauf, Folgen. M√ºnchen, 2011, , S. 205, hier S. 91. In Yugoslavia, the local \\"ethnic Germans\\" were collectively blamed for the actions of Nazi Germany and branded as war criminals. Immediately after the end of the war, partisan troops conducted mass executions of numerous Yugoslav Danube Swabians. Survivors were later confined to labor and internment camps by the Yugoslavian authorities.Zoran Janjetoviƒá, Die Konflikte zwischen Serben und Donauschwaben, S. 162 In ‚ÄûDer Einfluss von Nationalsozialismus auf Minderheiten in Ostmittel- und S√ºdeuropa‚Äú, Published by Mariana Hausleitner and Harald Roth, IKS Verlag, Munich, 2006 (Wissenschaftliche Reihe ‚ÄûGeschichte und Zeitgeschichte‚Äú der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich, Volume 107: Published by Edgar H√∂sch, Thomas Krefeld und Anton Schwob) Following the dissolution of the camps, the majority of the remaining Yugoslav Danube Swabians left the country, seeking refuge in Germany, other parts of Europe, and the United States. Of the 1.4 to 1.5 million pre-war population of Danube Swabians, the overwhelming majority of the survivors resettled in German- speaking countries: about 660,000 in Germany and about 150,000 in Austria. Danube Swabians also resettled in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia. The diaspora communities of Danube Swabians maintain their language and customs in numerous societies and clubs. The number of organizations is shrinking as the generations that lived in the Danube Swabian homelands die. Moreover, due to the waning population of Danube Swabians within the Balkans, the word ≈†vabo now refers to the ex-Yugoslavian diaspora communities that live/work as g√§starbeiters in German-speaking countries, such as Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, and sometimes the Netherlands, Belgium, or Luxembourg. In a negative context, the term is confided with the English equivalent to a rich kid/spoiled brat, due to the unprecedented wealth that is gained by one family in said countries that their relatives that still live in the ex-Yugoslavia region often struggle to obtain, due to the high unemployment rates in their respective countries.  History  Danube Swabian men's tracht, from the historic house of the parents of Stefan J√§ger, Hatzfeld (Jimbolia), Romanian Banat. = Origins= Beginning in the 12th century, German merchants and miners began to settle in the Kingdom of Hungary at the invitation of the Hungarian monarchy (see Ostsiedlung). Although there were significant colonies of Carpathian Germans in the Spi≈° mountains and Transylvanian Saxons in Transylvania, German settlement throughout the rest of the kingdom had not been extensive until this time. During the 17th‚Äì18th centuries, warfare between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire devastated and depopulated much of the lands of the Danube valley, referred to geographically as the Pannonian plain. The Habsburgs ruling Austria and Hungary at the time resettled the land with people of various ethnicities recruited from the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the Habsburgs, including Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Serbs, Romanians, Ukrainians, and Germanic settlers from Swabia, Hesse, Palatinate, Baden, Franconia, Bavaria, Austria, and Alsace-Lorraine. Despite differing origins, the new immigrants were all referred to as Swabians by their neighbor Serbs, Hungarians, and Romanians. The Baƒçka settlers called themselves Schwoweh, the plural of Schwobe in the polyglot language that evolved there. The majority of them boarded boats in Ulm, Swabia, and traveled to their new destinations down the Danube River in boats called Ulmer Schachteln. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had given them funds to build their boats for transport. = Settlement = Maria Theresa The first wave of resettlement came after the Ottoman Turks were gradually being forced back after their defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The settlement was encouraged by nobility, whose lands had been devastated through warfare, and by military officers including Prince Eugene of Savoy and Claudius Mercy. Many Germans settled in the Bakony (Bakonywald) and V√©rtes (Schildgebirge) mountains north and west of Lake Balaton (Plattensee), as well as around the town Buda (Ofen), now part of Budapest. The area of heaviest German colonization during this period was in the Swabian Turkey (Schw√§bische T√ºrkei), a triangular region between the Danube River, Lake Balaton, and the Drava (Drau) River. Other areas settled during this time by Germans were P√©cs (F√ºnfkirchen), Satu Mare (Sathmar), and south of Mukachevo (Munkatsch). After the Habsburgs annexed the Banat area from the Ottomans in the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), the government made plans to resettle the region to restore farming. It became known as the Banat of Temesv√°r (Temeschwar/Temeschburg), as well as the Baƒçka (Batschka) region between the Danube and Tisza (Theiss) rivers. Fledgling settlements were destroyed during another Austrian-Turkish war (1737‚Äì1739), but extensive colonization continued after the suspension of hostilities. The late 18th-century resettlement was accomplished through private and state initiatives. After Maria Theresa of Austria assumed the throne as Queen of Hungary in 1740, she encouraged vigorous colonization on crown lands, especially between Timi»ôoara and the Tisza. The Crown agreed to permit the Germans to retain their language and religion (generally Roman Catholic). The German farmers steadily redeveloped the land: drained marshes near the Danube and the Tisza, rebuilt farms, and constructed roads and canals. Many Danube Swabians served on Austria's Military Frontier (Milit√§rgrenze) against the Ottomans. Between 1740 and 1790, more than 100,000 Germans immigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary. The Napoleonic Wars ended the large-scale movement of Germans to the Hungarian lands, although the colonial population increased steadily and was self-sustaining through natural increase. Small daughter-colonies developed in Slavonia and Bosnia. After the creation of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Hungary established a policy of Magyarization whereby minorities, including the Danube Swabians, were induced by political and economic means to adopt the Magyar language and culture. Beginning in 1893, Banat Swabians began to move to Bulgaria, where they settled in the village of Bardarski Geran, Vratsa Province, founded by Banat Bulgarians several years prior to that. Their number later exceeded 90 families. They built a separate Roman Catholic church in 1929 due to conflicts with the Bulgarian Catholics. Some of these Germans later moved to Tsarev Brod, Shumen Province, together with a handful of Banat Bulgarian families, as well as to another Banat Bulgarian village, Gostilya, Pleven Province. After the treaties of Saint-Germain (1919) and Trianon (1920) following World War I, the Banat was divided between Romania, Yugoslavia, and Hungary; Baƒçka was divided between Yugoslavia and Hungary; and Satu Mare went to Romania. Before World War II, the biggest populations of Germans in the Vojvodina were at Hodschag, Werbass, and Apatin. There were approximately two million ethnic Danube Swabians in the region before World War II. In Romania, census of 1930 recorded 745,421 Germans; Hungarian Census of 1933 recorded 477,153; and Yugoslavian Census of 1921, 513,472. German estimations from the interwar period place those estimations at 850,000; 600,000 and 620,000 for Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia respectively. = World War II, expulsion, and post-war = Traditional Swabian house in Hungary Institute for Danube Swabian history and geography Beginning in 1920 and especially after World War II, many Danube Swabians migrated to the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Austria, Australia, and Argentina. Some of them, descending from French-speaking or linguistically mixed families from Lorraine, had maintained the French language for some generations, as well as an ethnic identity, later referred to as Banat French, Fran√ßais du Banat. They were resettled in France around 1950. In 1941 much of Yugoslavia was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany as part of the Second World War, and in the German-occupied Banat, they granted the Swabian minority superior status over the other ethnic groups in the Yugoslav population. The Baranja and Baƒçka Swabians reverted to Hungary.Tomasevich 1975. The Danube Swabians were already under heavy Nazi influence by that time and served as the Axis fifth column during the invasion of Yugoslavia, although many served in the royal Yugoslav army in the brief war against the Nazis in April 1941. The Independent State of Croatia (1941‚Äì1945), a fascist puppet stateIndependent State of Croatia ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia created within Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, was home to 182,000 Danube Swabian ethnic Germans (who were called Folksdojƒçeri in Croatian). In addition, the Danube Swabian minority were granted the separate autonomous region of Banat within German-occupied Serbia In Backe in 1941, Danube Swabians formed around 20% of the population. Yugoslav Danube Swabians supplied more than 60,000 troops for German military formations, some voluntarily but many more under duress. They actively participated in the sometimes brutal repression of Yugoslav Partisans and their suspected sympathizers, including 69,000 Jews living in Yugoslavia. The local collaborationist authorities were forced to make it illegal to draft Danube Swabians. However, of the approximately 300,000-strong Danube Swabian minority in occupied Yugoslavia (182,000 in the NDH, 350,000 in Vojvodina), 500,000 in Romania and 500,000 in Hungary, approximately 100,000 eventually entered service in various German and Axis military organizations, most notably in the two locally formed Waffen-SS volunteer divisions, the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, and the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Maria Theresa (which was made-up of Hungarian Danube Swabians). Although these military units were initially formed as volunteer units, SS officials ultimately imposed conscription under the dubious legal pretext that occupied Serbia was deutsches Hoheitsgebiet, and the archaic Tiroler Landsturmordung (Tyrol General Levy Act) of 1872 was invoked. The 7th SS Prinz Eugen was formed as a volunteer unit, but historians have demonstrated that later in the war, the local German authorities of Banat came under significant pressure from the German authorities. Essentially, coercion was used to recruit more troops. Guenther Reinecke, chief of the Hauptamt SS-Gericht (SS legal office) wrote to Himmler that the Prinz Eugen was \\"no longer an organization of volunteers, that on the contrary, the ethnic Germans from Serbian Banat were drafted, to a large extent under threat of punishment by the local German leadership, and later by the SS Erg√§nzungsamt.\\" Of about 100,000 Danube Swabians who served in the various SS units, approximately 29,000 were killed. This total includes 2,000 POWs from the 7th SS Prinz Eugen who were summarily executed by the Allied Yugoslav troops as Yugoslav citizens collaborating with the enemy. Between 1941 and 1943, a total of 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were transferred to Germany as part of Adolf Hitler's Heim ins Reich policy. These included 164 Banat Swabians from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya. In 1944, a joint advance of the Yugoslav Partisans, and the Soviet Red Army saw the liberation of northern areas of German-occupied Yugoslavia, which were home to the Danube Swabian minority. In Yugoslavia in particular, with many exceptions, the Danube Swabian minority \\"collaborated . . . with the occupation\\". Consequently, on November 21, 1944 the Presidium of the AVNOJ (the Yugoslav parliament) declared the ethnic German minority in Yugoslavia collectively hostile to the Yugoslav state.Ramet 2006, p. 159. The AVNOJ Presidium issued a decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property of Nazi Germany and its citizens in Yugoslavia, persons of ethnic German nationality (regardless of citizenship), and collaborators. The decision acquired the force of law on February 6, 1945.Tomasevich 1969, p. 115, 337. The reasons for this announcement are still debated by historians, but revenge against the ethnic German minority and the expropriation of Swabian agricultural lands to facilitate collectivization in Yugoslavia appears to have been the prime reasons. During the Second World War, many ethnic Germans sent the youngest and the oldest of their families to Germany. From 1945‚Äì48, many ethnic Germans in Hungary were dispossessed and expelled to Allied-occupied Germany under the Potsdam agreement. In the Baƒçka, which had been part of Hungary from 1941, Schwowisch villages were emptied forcibly in March 1945. The old and the young were imprisoned in camps in several villages of Vojvodina (in modern Serbia) including Gakovo, Kru≈°evlje, Rudolfsgnad (Kniƒáanin), Molidorf (Molin), Baƒçki Jarak, and Sremska Mitrovica, and two villages in the Slavonia region of Yugoslavia (now part of Croatia), Krndija, Valpovo. Those able to work were used as slave labor throughout the countryside. On March 1, 1946 there was a proposal to expel 130,388 interned Yugoslav ethnic Germans under the Potsdam Agreement.Lt.-Gen. Avsich, Yugoslav Military Mission, Berlin to the Allied Control Commission. Foreign Office 1032/2284. This proposal was turned down but provides a good estimate of the number of Shwovish internees. Many thousands were forcibly removed by cattle cars to Russia as Allied \\"war reparations\\", being put to work as slave labor in Siberian coal mines and elsewhere until 1949, when the program was shut down. The conditions were poor, and about half of those sent to Russia died from malnutrition or disease. In Yugoslavia in 1945, most ethnic Germans had their land confiscated and some were stripped of their citizenship by the new communist government. They faced summary executions, massacres, deportations. They were rounded up en masse, and some were sent to concentration and labor camps, where they died in considerable numbers. About 27,000 ‚Äì 37,000 women aged 18‚Äì40 were sent to the Soviet Union to perform forced labor. In addition, 35,000‚Äì40,000 Swabian children under age sixteen were separated from their parents and force into prison camps and re-education orphanages. Many were adopted by Serbian Partisan families. Of a pre-war population of about 350,000 ethnic Germans in the Vojvodina, the 1958 census revealed 32,000 left. Officially, Yugoslavia denied the forcible starvation and killing of their Schwowisch populations, but reconstruction of the death camps reveals that of the 170,000 Danube Swabians interned from 1944 to 1948, about 50,000 died of mistreatment. Since only families with the very young (under three), very old, and mothers were interned and starved, many others were unaccounted for in slave labor settings throughout the countryside and in Russia; but their death rates were probably much lower. The Germans in Romania were not deported but were instead dispersed within Romania. Austrian historian Arnold Suppan considers the destruction of the Danube Swabians to be genocide. Since 1990 Many left Romania for West Germany between 1970‚Äì90, and this trend increased in 1990. Since the fall of communism and the formation of new nations with new borders, the forces for movement of people among European nations have changed. Hungary joined the European Union and travel between nations became simpler. From 2001 to 2011, the number of those identifying as German in Hungary increased sharply, comparing the census tables from the two years. Explanations for the increase seem complex, including the willingness of citizens to claim the ethnic identity.  Culture  Danube Swabian women's tracht, from the historic house of the parents of Stefan J√§ger, Hatzfeld (Jimbolia), Romanian Banat. Prior to the First World War, the Swabians were the largest ethnic group to assimilate into Hungarian society, seconded by the Galician Jews and the Slovaks. They were first and foremost Catholics, peasants thereafter, and thirdly loyal subjects to Kaiser Franz Joseph. But a distinct Hungarian Swabian ethno-national consciousness didn't develop until the spread of Romantic Nationalism in the late nineteenth century. For the greater portion of their history, the Danube Swabian did not share a cultural identity. The term Swabian has its roots in the first wave a German-speaking immigrants from Swabia to re-settle southern Hungary after the expulsion of the Ottomans in 1689. However, it came to encompass all German-speaking people who followed in migrations from across the Holy Roman Empire in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The term Swabian was not originally a self-proclaimed identity of a singular people but a term ascribed by Magyar lords to refer to German-speaking Catholic peasants, tavern keepers, and poor artisans. For the most part Swabians lived in villages, had few privileges, and no developed intellectual layer. In 1930 Hungary 55.4% of the total Swabian population were engaged in agriculture; 28.8% in industry, crafts, commerce, or transport; and 3.1% were in state administration. The rest were employed in the service sector. The Danube Swabian culture is a melting pot of southern German regional customs, with a large degree of Balkan and mostly Hungarian influence. This is especially true of the food, where paprika is heavily employed, which led to the German nickname for Danube Swabians as Paprikadeutsche. The architecture is neither Southern German nor Balkan but is unique to itself. The houses, often made of stamped mud and straw walls or mud bricks, are ubiquitous throughout the Vojvodina region. Georg Weifert was responsible for developing one of the most famous beers in the Serbia/Yugoslavia region and later became an important banker and politician in Belgrade (his image currently features on the Serbian 1000 dinar note).Georg Weifert on the 1000 Serbian dinar bill. = Language = The Danube Swabian language is only nominally Swabian (Schwowisch, as it was referred to locally). In reality, it contains elements or many dialects of the original German settlers, mainly Swabian, Franconian, Bavarian, Pf√§lzisch, Alsatian, and Alemannic, as well as Austro-Hungarian administrative and military jargon. Loanwords from Hungarian, Serbian, or Romanian are especially common regionally regarding cuisine and agriculture, but also regarding dress, politics, place names, and sports. Other cultures of influence include Serbian and Croatian, Russian (for communist concepts), Romanian, Turkish (Hambar), English (for football), and general Balkan and South Slavic loanwords like Kukuruts (corn). The plural of loanwords is in most cases formed in the Shwovish way. Conjunctions and adverbs from the respective contact languages may be integrated as well. Many German words used by speakers of Danube Swabian dialects may sound archaic. To the ear of a Standard German speaker, the Danube Swabian dialect sounds like what it is: a mix of southwestern German dialects from the 18th century with many strange words from other languages. Due to relative isolation and differing proximities to nearby German speakers (Austrians and Transylvanian Saxons), the language varies considerably, with speakers able to distinguish inhabitants of neighboring villages by the words they use for such things as marmalade (Leckwaar and Schleckle being two variants), or by how many (usually Hungarian) loanwords they employ. This even applied to verb conjugations. For example, the German verb \\"haben\\" was conjugated as \\"han\\" in Sankt Hubert and as \\"hava\\" In Mramorak, although both were in Banat.Hess, Michael, personal experience with native speakers from each town Herman Ruediger, a German sociologist, reports that in his trips throughout the Baƒçka in the 1920s, he noted that Danube Swabians from widely separated villages had to use standard high German to communicate with each other because their speech was so different. This was particularly true for towns like Esseg (Osijek) where Shwoveh were thoroughly with majority Croatians.Ruediger, H. (1931) Die Donauschwaben in der s√ºdslawischen Baƒçka, Schriften des Deutschen Ausland-Instituts Stuttgart. Reihe A. Bd. 28. Stuttgart, 1931 For instance, the ethnic Germans of Esseg were so thoroughly assimilated with Croatia that their Shwovish or 'Essekerish' could only be understood by those who also spoke Croatian or Serbian. =Naming= As is the custom in Hungary (as well as southern Germany), Danube Swabians often put the surname first, especially when writing, for example Butscher Jakob (see photo of memorial). Danube Swabian villages tend to have relatively few family names as the villagers stem from only a few families, but usually the same family name does not appear in more than a couple of villages, meaning that there are many Danube Swabian family names. The names come from throughout southern Germany, from assimilated Hungarians, and occasionally from Balkan and Italian origins. There are usually no middle names, but often double first names, if a distinction can be made. The variety of first names is few, since children were usually named after grandparents or godparents. Popular names for women include: Anna, Barbara, Christina, Elisabeth, Eva, Katharina, Magdalena, Maria, Sophia, Theresia, and many two-name combinations thereof. Popular names for men include: Adam, Anton, Christian, Franz, Friedrich, Georg, Gottfried, Heinrich, Jakob, Johann, Konrad, Ludwig, Mathias, Martin, Michael, Nikolaus, Peter, Philipp (or Filipp), and Stefan (or Stephan). With so few names in villages, other modifiers or nicknames were almost always used to distinguish people. The modifiers were often size related (e.g., \\"Kleinjohann\\" or \\"Little Johann\\"), occupation related (\\"Tischler Stefan\\" or the \\"carpenter Stefan\\"), or location related (usually by prefixing the streetname).  Coat of arms  Coat of arms of the Banat Swabians created by Hans Diplich in 1950. A coat of arms designed in 1950 by Hans Diplich has been adopted by many Danube Swabian cultural organizations. Its blazon is \\"Parti per fess wavy 1 Or, an eagle displayed couped Sable langued Gules; 2 parti per fess Argent and Vert, a fortress Argent roofed and turreted Gules surmounted with Sun and Crescent waning Or; chief wavy Azure\\". It depicts: *a black eagle representing the protection of the Emperor of Austria; *a blue ribbon representing the Danube River; *a crescent moon representing the waning of Islamic influence through the withdrawal of the Ottoman Turks; *the Sun representing both Prince Eugene of Savoy and the light of Christianity; and *a fortress representing the fortified city of Temeschburg (Timi»ôoara).

She died a child aged 5, after which the earldom of Warwick was inherited by her paternal aunt. The title then passed by marriage to Anne's maternal uncle, Richard Neville, the famous 'Kingmaker' of the later Wars of the Roses. Life Anne Beauchamp was born on 14 February 1444 at Cardiff in Wales. Her father was Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick (1425‚Äì1446), the last male of the medieval Beauchamp family to hold the Warwick title. Anne's mother was Cecily Neville, sister to Richard Neville, who later played a key role in the Wars of the Roses. On 11 June 1446, Anne's father died. The dukedom of Warwick, created in 1445, had been originally granted to heirs male only, and so became extinct upon Henry Beauchamp's death, but the earldom (created in 1088) allowed for female succession and was therefore inherited by his daughter. She also inherited from her father the barony of Burghersh, being the 7th person to hold that title since its creation in 1330. Upon the death of King Henry VI's uncle Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, on 23 February 1447, Anne also succeeded to the lordship of the Channel Islands, which had been previously entailed on her father. The infant Anne was one of the greatest heiresses of her day, alongside the infant Lady Margaret Beaufort, the daughter of the 1st Duke of Somerset who had died in 1444. Both girls became wards of Anne's maternal step-great-grandmother, Alice Chaucer (widow of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury and a lady-in-waiting to Queen Margaret of Anjou) and William de la Pole, shortly to be Duke of Suffolk, who intended Anne to marry his own heir, John de la Pole (1442‚Äì1492). Anne died on 3 June 1449, aged five, at Ewelme (the Chaucer homeWatts, John. \\"Pole, William de la, first duke of Suffolk\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 23 September 2004.

Reading may have been chosen as her burial site because her great grandmother, Constance of York, had been buried there. Anne's title Countess of Warwick was inherited by her paternal aunt, Lady Anne. The barony of Burghersh fell into abeyance between her aunts. After Anne's death, the Duke of Suffolk instead arranged a 'solemn betrothal' between his son and Lady Margaret, a marriage contract that by law could be, and on the initiative of the king was, dissolved while the bride was below the age of twelve; Margaret herself never subsequently recognized John as her first husband.Jones, Michael K. and Underwood, Malcolm G. \\"Beaufort, Margaret [known as Lady Margaret Beaufort, countess of Richmond and Derby\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 23 September 2004.

Not to be confused with the Yamaha Sidewinder SRX, which is a snowmobile. In an attempt to repeat the success of the SR500, Yamaha placed a more modern engine derived from the XT600 into a light, sporty street bike. While still being an air-cooled, overhead-camshaft single-cylinder like its predecessor, the new engine featured a four-valved cylinder head, a two- staged carburetor, a balance shaft, and various improvements. The chassis was a lightweight steel frame with alloy wheels, a double disc brake on the front- and a single disc brake on the rear wheel. However, unlike its cheaper predecessor, the SRX600 did not compete well on the international market. Nimble handling, light weight, and unique styling did not compete well with the heavier, faster multi-cylinder bikes available for a similar price. Still, Yamaha claims to have sold 19,000 units of the SRX. In the USA, the SRX was officially sold only in 1986; in Germany, sales continued until 1990; while in Japan the model was produced up until 1997.  Japanese models  1990 Yamaha SRX400 In Japan, the SRX was sold with a reduced displacement of 400 cc for tax reasons, or 608 cc. Also, these models featured an oil cooler. From 1988, the 2NX model was sold, which featured a 17-inch front wheel and single 320 mm brake disc. There was also an SRX250 on the Japanese market, although this differed somewhat in the presence of a headlight fairing and electric start. 1989 Yamaha SRX250 When the international marketing of the SRX stopped, in Japan there was a new production line 3VN; it received an engine derived from the newer XT600E, equipped with an electrical starter. Also, the classic twin- shock configuration was dropped for a mono shock design. This iteration was produced until 1997, when production altogether ceased.

It is akin to a Western medieval tonus, an Andalusian tab', an Arab naƒ°am (since 1400 \\"maqam\\"), or a Persian parde (since 18th-century dastgah). Overview and semantics The noun echos in Greek means \\"sound\\" in general. It acquired the specialized meaning of mode early on in the development of Byzantine music theory since the Octoechos reform in 692. In general, the concept of echos denotes a certain octave species, its intervallic structure as well as a set of more or less explicitly formulated melodic rules and formulae that represent a certain category of melodies within the musical genre. As such, echos is the basis for composing or improvising new melodies that belong to it, as well as for properly performing existing pieces that have been written in it. These rules include the distinction of a hierarchy of degrees (tones, notes), where certain degrees figure as cadence notes (·ºëœÉœÑœéœÑŒµœÇ) around which the melody will revolve prominently, or on which the melody will end most of the time. However, only very late stages of the theory (19th-20th century) actually provide systematic descriptions of echoi, while earlier stages use mostly diagrams, indirect descriptions and examples. Explicit detailed descriptions must still be provided based on extensive analysis, as is the case with modal phenomena in numerous other cultures. History and reconstruction Early treatises only state the initial or \\"base\\" degree (Œ∑ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒÆ) which is the tone sung as a burden (·º¥œÉŒøŒΩ) by certain singers of the choir called isokrates in order to support any melody composed in a certain echos. By this support singers (psaltes) could easily recognise the relative position of each note as it was organised by tetrachords based on the basis note of each echos. This base degree of the mode was communicated by an intonation formula of a foresinger, known as enechema. 1832, p. 168). Note that the deuteros and tetartos have exchanged their position within the modern Octoechos, since they are represented as mesoi. There are different styles by which to notate enechema which are crucial to the understanding of the different chant books and their notation. All these forms were written in red ink. The explicit long form was called by J√∏rgen Raasted intonation,J√∏rgen Raasted (1966). but only the books of the cathedral rite used such explicit intonations, also between the sections, where these intonations were called medial intonation. This explicit form made sense, since the intonation also communicated the changes between the left and the right choir and their leaders performed these intonations to coordinate these changes. There was a short form as well which was called modal signature. It indicated the echos by the numeral like œÄŒªŒ±' for \\"plagios protos,\\" while the neumes sung with the last syllable of the enechema were written above right to the numeral. This short form was used in two different ways, as main signature it indicated the echos of a whole composition, but especially in sticheraria notators also wrote medial signatures between the neumes above a kolon of the text, in order to indicate that the melos changed here into another echos. The traditional Greek term for these medial signatures was \\"martyria\\" (), since the medial signature also \\"testified\\" the phthongos of the cadence made at the kolon. = Echemata of the dialogue treatise = Within the dialogue treatise (erotapokriseis) a catalogue of short formulas memorizes each echos of the Hagiopolitan octoechos and its two phthorai (ŒΩŒµŒΩŒ±ŒΩ·ø∂ and ŒΩŒ±ŒΩ·Ω∞). These formulas are also called \\"echemata\\" (·º†œáŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ±)‚Äîor more often \\"enechemata\\" (·ºêŒΩŒ∑œáŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ±) or \\"apechemata\\" (·ºÄœÄŒ∑œáŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ±). The use echemata was also imitated by Carolingian cantors who used similar intonation formulas and collected them in a separate book called tonary. > Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÄŒªŒ±Œ≥ŒØœâŒΩ ·ºàœÄŒø œÑŒø·ø¶ œÄŒªŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒøœÖ œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÖ ·º§œáŒøœÖ œÄŒ¨ŒªŒπŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒØŒΩŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ≠œÉœÉŒ±œÅŒ±œÇ œÜœâŒΩŒ¨œÇ, > Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œµ·ΩëœÅŒØœÉŒ∫ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ œÄŒ¨ŒªŒπŒΩ œÄŒªŒ¨Œ≥ŒπŒøœÇ œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÖ¬∑ ·ΩÖœÖœÑœâœÇ Œ¥·Ω≤ / ·ºÑŒΩŒ±ŒΩŒµ ·ºÑŒΩŒµœÇ ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω≤ ·ºÑŒΩŒµœÇ¬∑ > Intonation according to Erotapokriseis and standard intonation of : \\"You > descend 4 steps [œÜŒøŒΩŒ±·Ω∂] from the echos protos [kyrios protos/authentic > protus] and you will find again the plagios protos, this way\\" ·ΩâŒºŒøŒØœâœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ > Œ≤' ·º§œáŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒØŒΩœâŒΩ œÜœâŒΩŒ¨œÇ Œ¥', Œµ·ΩëœÅŒØœÉŒ∫ŒµŒπœÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ œÄŒªŒ¨Œ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶, ·º§Œ≥ŒøœÖŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ œÄŒªŒ¨Œ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ > œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒ≠œÅŒøœÖ. œÄŒª Œí Œø·ΩïœÑœâœÇ Œ¥Œ≠.

Traditional protopsaltes at Athos and Istanbul who belong to local schools of the eighteenth century, do indeed not follow the Chrysanthine intonation, they always intone a pentachord on a pure fifth between the bases of echos varys and kyrios tritos. *there is no absolute nor fixed position of the octave species. Sticheraric and papadic chant genres exploit not only the possibility to change between the echoi, but also the characteristic that every note (phthongos \\"sound, voice\\") has an echos defined by the octoechos. A register change is usually arranged by a transposition about a fifth, which turns a kyrios into a plagios and vice versa. Also other temporary transpositions are possible (see the five rings of the bigger Koukouzelian wheel), but not frequent. *the ruling tone system is tetraphonic and based on fifth equivalence which allows the fore mentioned register changes. Heptaphonia (similar to the Western use of systema teleion and solf√®ge with seven syllables) exist only on the level of a melos within a certain echos. Changes to the triphonic system are indicated by the phthora nana. *except of a pure diatonic octoechos the chromatic and enharmonic genus is not excluded, since even the Hagiopolitan octoechos accepted the use of two phthorai (ŒΩŒµŒΩŒ±ŒΩ·Ωº and ŒΩŒ±ŒΩ·Ω∞). \\"Parallage of John Koukouzeles\\": The four peripheral wheels for the Octoechos (top left: ; top right: ; bottom left: ; bottom right: ) and the tetraphonic tone system and its transpositions in the center‚ÄîKoukouzelian wheel in an 18th-century manuscript (manuscript of the private collection by Demetrios Kontogiorges) = Echemata of the Papadikai and their modern interpretation = More information on the structure of echoi is only indicated in a very rudimentary way through diagrams involving neumes‚Äîthe Byzantine round notation. The details of the actual intervallic and melodic structure of echoi are virtually impossible to deduce from theoretical treatises prior to the 18th century. In fact, only relatively late systematic comparisons of the echoi with the makamlar of Ottoman court music, such as those by the Kyrillos Marmarinos, Archbishop of Tinos, in his manuscript dated 1747, and the reform of the Byzantine notation by Chrysanthos of Madytos at the first half of the 19th century make it possible to understand the structure of echoi and to attempt reconstructions of melodies from earlier manuscripts. 1832, p. 30) He already introduced his readers into the diatonic genus and its phthongoi in the 5th chapter of the first book, called \\"About the parallage of the diatonic genus\\" (Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±ŒªŒªŒ±Œ≥·øÜœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒîŒπŒ±œÑŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫Œø·ø¶ ŒìŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ).

Each of these echemata had the potential to develop an own melos within its melody types: London, British Library, Harley 5544, fol. 8r) Each echema is followed by the incipit of a sticheron idiomelon which illustrates a certain melos of the echos. The following book Kekragarion illustrates, how the hesperinos psalm Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒµ ·ºêŒ∫Œ≠Œ∫œÅŒ±ŒæŒ± has to be sung according to the sticheraric melos of each echos. The Kekragarion was later included in the printed editions of the Anastasimatarion or Voskresnik. = Chrysanthos' exegesis of the papadic enechemata = In the chapter \\"On the apechemata\\" () of his \\"Great Theoretikon\\",Chrysanthos of Madytos (1832, 135-42‚Äî¬ß¬ß307‚Äì317). Chrysanthos translated the Byzantine octoechos and its intonation formulas (apechemata, or enechemata), as they could be found in the Papadikai, by offering an exegesis of the papadic apechemata in comparison to the simpler forms used by Orthodox chanters today. They served as kind of model for the composition within a certain melos, similar to the seyirler of an Ottoman makam.  Protos echos  For the diatonic echos protos, the medieval enechema had the finalis on the top of the protos pentachord, while the enechema passes through it: Chrysanthos 1832, 137) Chrysanthos made this exegesis to explain the melos of the whole echos: Chrysanthos 1832, 137) In the first descending half he made the usual cadence on D (, phthongos ) which corresponds to the finalis of the modern melos, while it was once the finalis and the basis of the plagios protos. The second half, when the melos raises again, but within the papadic melos (used with a cherubikon or koinonikon) it prepared a change to another base tone on the upper tetrachord like a (, phthongos ).As an example listen to the papadic protos melos at the beginning of Petros Bereketis' kalophonic composition about (Demosthenis Pa√Økopoulos). After three minutes the base tone changes to the higher tetrachord. Hence, according to the current practice of Orthodox chant the protos mele were rather based on the lower tetrachord, but the formula could be used a fifth higher likewise. The step between the phthongoi of tetartos () and protos () could be C‚ÄîD (‚Äî) or G‚Äîa (‚Äî). Chrysanthos 1832, 137) Concerning the enechema of the plagios protos, it had not changed during the centuries. Chrysanthos 1832, 139) Unlike the tradition which always used register changes, the modern interpretation did not fix the base degree of echos plagios protos to the bottom of the pentachord, it could appear regularly at the top like in the troparic and heirmologic melos: a ()‚Äîc ()‚Äîb ()‚Äîa () or D ()‚ÄîF ()‚ÄîE ()‚ÄîD ().In the papadic melos of echos plagios protos it is rather in the lower register, but this melos is nearly the same with respect to the one of kyrios protos. Listen to the fifth section of Bereketis' , where Demosthenis Pa√Økopoulos uses a free monosyllabic enechema which seems closer to the kyrios formula. The difference is a stronger emphasise of the mesos or diphonos F () which sometimes attracts G (), especially among Phanariotes (17'50\\"). Chrysanthos' exegesis just passed the protos pentachord D ()‚Äîa () in an ascending movement, before using the cadence pattern to the base degree of the mode. Chrysanthos 1832, 139)  Deuteros echos  Chrysanthos' bridges between the diatonic of the Byzantine past and the chromatic melos of the present Orthodox traditions. The latter is characterised by the constant use of the mesos form, which is not on the of ‚Äîb natural (, Œ≤') and E (, phthongos œÄŒªŒ≤'), but between them on G (, œÄŒªŒ¥'). The usual diatonic form was this , but only the descending part would lead to the base tone of the . Chrysanthos 1832, 137) As a consequence, Chrysanthos' exegesis starts and ends on this mesos, but it follows the Hagiopolitan convention to pass through the former pentachord, but he even passes through the pentachord C (, œÄŒªŒ¥')‚ÄîG (, phthongos Œ¥'), as it used by the current melos of . Chrysanthos 1832, 137f) Concerning the chromatic melos of the in the current octoechos, the papadic had become \\"soft chromatic\\" under the influence of the . Chrysanthos 1832, 137f) Nevertheless, according to the very particular interpretation of Chrysanthos the melos and scale of is ruled by a diphonic organisation based on just two diatonic intervals: the major and minor tone. As a result, the octave C‚Äîc between ŒΩŒ∑ and ŒΩŒ∑' becomes slightly diminished. Chrysanthos' concept of diphonia was so radical that it found no commonplace in current chant manuals, instead a lot alternative interpretations proposed various divisions of the chromatic tetrachords between ŒΩŒ∑‚ÄîŒ≥Œ± (C‚ÄîF) and Œ¥Œπ‚ÄîŒΩŒ∑' (G‚Äîc). 1832, pp. 106-108) At the end of his chapter \\"on the apechemata\\" Chrysanthos offers a separate exegesis of phthora nenano as a modern deduction of the , whose medieval form was this. But it had moved now with the to the of .For the proper intonation of the enharmonic diesis which is augmented in descending direction, listen to Demosthenis Pa√Økopoulos' interpretation of the section in Petros Bereketis' didactic chant (mathema) (24'02\\"). Chrysanthos 1832, 138)  Tritos echos  Chrysanthos did not offer any exegesis for the apechema of the diatonic echos tritos. He only mentions the intonation of phthora nana instead, which is still used as the echos tritos intonation formula in current Orthodox traditions. Chrysanthos 1832, 137f) Hence, his exegesis of this enharmonic phthora is within the enharmonic genus and the triphonic tone system of the phthora nana.Listen the tritos section of Bereketis' kalophonic composition (9'15\\"). The same enharmonic interpretation was done with the plagios called \\"echos varys\\" (grave mode), obviously in certain cases, when the plagios tetartos was expected of fourth under the base tone. Hence, the enharmonic tritos echoi are not separated by a pentachord, but usually both set on F (, phthongos Œ≥' as well as œÖŒ±œÅ), in troparic, sticheraric and heirmologic mele: Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß313) Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß313) Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß313) Within the papadic chant genre (cherubika, koinonika), but also during the composed recitation of Polyeleos psalms and kalophonic heirmoi (·ºåŒæŒπŒøŒΩ ·ºêœÉœÑŒØŒΩ), the diatonic melos of echos varys was chosen. Its base tone was one phthongos below the plagios tetartos. According to Chrysanthos it diminished the tritos pentachord to a kind of tritone, at least when it was set on fret arak of the Ottoman tambur, but there are also more traditional ways of intonation depending on the local school of a chanter.The Chrysanthine intonation is commonly used in all Orthodox monodic traditions of the Balkans, but there are traditionalists at Istanbul and Athos who prefer another diatonic varys intonation according to the trochos system (Gerlach 2006, 889-890). Demosthenis Pa√Økopoulos for example uses the trochos intonation of the Patriarchal school, when he sings the varys section of Petros Bereketis' kalophonic composition about (29'16\\"). Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß313)  Tetartos echos  The tetartos echoi have changed between the Byzantine and the Orthodox octoechos today. The original tetartos pentachord between plagios and kyrios‚ÄîC () and G () or likewise G () and d ()‚Äîdoes still exist in the papadic melos of echos tetartos, which is known as the \\"papadic Agia\\" ().Listen to the section echos tetartos in Petros' kalophonic theotokion which he composed in this melos (12'58\\"). Chrysanthos 1832, 138‚Äî¬ß312) Chrysanthos made for the papadic melos this exegesis. Chrysanthos 1832, 138‚Äî¬ß312) A commonly used form of might be the one which Chrysanthos mentions as the one used by Petros Peloponnesios. Chrysanthos 1832, 139‚Äî¬ß312) The diatonic plagios of tetartos according to the enechema known from the treatises called PapadikaiHence, it also still in use within the papadic melos of the current echos plagios tetartos, listen to the eighth section of Petros' kalophonic composition passing through all the eight echoi (34'51\\"). Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß316) which was interpreted by Chrysanthos, as follows. Chrysanthos 1832, 140‚Äî¬ß316) Since the has moved to the phthongos of plagios protos (œÄŒªŒ±'), the original of the diatonic was vacant. In fact, as a diatonic phthora it was represented by a medial signature of the so-called \\"echos legetos\\" () which had preserved the diatonic intonation of .It was used by Petros Bereketis in the section of his composition (4'58\\"), although as the . Chrysanthos 1832, 141‚Äî¬ß317) The signature was used within the , since heirmoi of were still treated as a diatonic melos unlike the school of Petros Peloponnesios and his follower Petros Byzantios. According to their school the was part of the , as a it was used for the heirmologic melos, where the base and final degree was a low intoned E (Œ≤ŒøœÖ), and for the , which had the base degree of the mode and closing cadences on D (œÄŒ±), but the concluding finalis E (Œ≤ŒøœÖ). Chrysanthos interpreted also echos legetos as a diatonic mesos tetartos. Chrysanthos 1832, 141‚Äî¬ß317) He also mentioned a common enechema as it was used by Iakovos the Protopsaltes. Chrysanthos 1832, 141‚Äî¬ß317) In this last paragraph of the chapter about the apechemata Chrysanthos referred to ten echoi within the tradition of Hagiopolites. > .Chrysanthos of Madytos (1832, 141‚Äî¬ß317). > The echoi of the psalmody are eight. The apechemata preserved though are > ten, because the , and the of the , have two apechemata each. But unlike the Hagiopolites, where the was mentioned as a \\"\\" and the as \\"\\", seemed to have slipped into the role, but it was a diatonic mesos, not an enharmonic like . In fact, Chrysanthos could not longer mention nana and nenano as additional , since their melos had already replaced the diatonic mele of the and . Echos vs. maqam in eponymous compositional practice In other Ottoman music traditions like the list of composed Mevlevi dance suites as models of well-known and new makamlar created by eponymous masters resulted in a proliferation of modes (makamlar, maqamat),About an exact situation of makamlar as a melodic model between improvisation and composition, see Habib Hassan Touma (1971). echoi are not attributed to specific composers, but are rather regarded as belonging to the collective and anonymous heritage of liturgical chant. Eponymous compositions do exist throughout most of the history of Byzantine chant, but their echos is always classified from within the system of existing . Due to an interest for makamlar compositions Phanariotes like Georgios the Protopsaltes, one of the great teachers of Orthodox chant, also became a student of the dervish composer Dede Efendi, after he had learnt Turkish. Byzantine notation developed as a universal notation system during the 19th century which includes even attempts to integrate makamlar within the mele of the Octoechos, while ornamental details became part of an oral tradition.For a rather systematic approach, see the treatises by Ke√Øvelis (1856) and Keltzanides (1881). Cultural \\"relations\\" The system of echoi is rich and diverse. Closer study and comparison with modal systems of neighboring cultures reveals a complex network of cultural and ethnic influences throughout the centuries‚Äîa vivid exchange between musicians across the borders of ethnic and religious identity (Phanariotes).Rudolf M. Brandl (1989). The basic theory of echoi is formalized in a system of eight modes called the Octoechos. See the article Neobyzantine Octoechos for a discussion of its origins and a critique of this concept vis- a-vis actual practice.

History  = Founding = Dr. Florenz Ziegfeld, Sr (1841‚Äì1923), founded the college in 1867 as the Chicago Academy of Music. The institution has endured without interruption for years. Ziegfeld was the father of Florenz Jr., the Broadway impresario. The Academy was credited as being the fourth conservatory in America. In 1871, the conservatory moved to a new building which was destroyed only a few weeks later by the Great Chicago Fire; despite the conflagration, the college was again up and running by the end of the year. = Name change = In 1872, the school changed its name to Chicago Musical College (CMC); over 900 students were enrolled in that year. A Normal Teachers' Institute was added to the school's offerings. Tuition in those was an average of one dollar per lesson. Four years later, the State of Illinois accredited the college as a degree granting institution of higher learning. A Preparatory Division was opened which established branches throughout the city. Rudolph Ganz joined CMC's faculty in 1900 and, except for a brief hiatus in the 1920s, remained associated with the school until his death in 1972. In 1917, CMC offered a Master of Music Degree, and seven years later the school became a charter member of the National Association of Schools of Music. By 1925, the college moved into its own eleven-story building, Steinway Hall at 64 E. Van Buren Street. One hundred and twenty-five names appeared on the faculty roster for that year, and the school opened three dormitory floors for students. In 1936, CMC was admitted as a full member to the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the only independent music college in the Midwest to enjoy such status. By 1947, the college was offering doctorates in Fine Arts and Music Education. = Merger with Roosevelt University = In 1954, CMC merged with Roosevelt University's School of Music which had been founded in 1945. The name \\"Chicago Musical College\\" was retained for the new united college. All operations moved to join the university in the now national landmark Auditorium Building at 430 South Michigan Avenue in Chicago's Loop. The building houses one of the finest auditoriums in the world, in addition to the Rudolph Ganz Memorial Recital Hall. = Reorganization as a conservatory = In the fall of 1997, Roosevelt established a College of Performing Arts, which joined Chicago Musical College and the Theater Program under one administrative unit led by founding dean Donald Steven. In 2000, under the leadership of new dean James Gandre, the name was changed to Chicago College of Performing Arts. The college has two divisions: the Music Conservatory and the Theatre Conservatory. written by Don Draganski, edited by Brian Wis.

In 1915, he joined the National School of Fine Arts. He traveled to Europe in 1920, and attended the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. Back in Brazil, he worked in the architecture section of the National Heritage service at the Ministry of Finance, where he became friends with the poet Murilo Mendes. In 1922, he married Adalgisa Ferreira. In this period, he produced works with an expressionist tendency. His favorite themes are always linked to the human figure: portraits, self- portraits and nudes. He is not interested in national, indigenous and Afro- Brazilian themes. It diversifies the techniques used. He is also a scenographer . In 1929, he had two solo exhibitions, in Bel√©m and Rio de Janeiro . The welcome disappoints him. He also participates in a group exhibition of Brazilian painting in New York. = Sickness and death = That same year 1929, after a trip to Argentina and Uruguay, a diagnosis revealed that he was carrying tuberculosis, which forced him to live in a sanatorium for two years. He comes out apparently neat. He participated in a few shows, such as the Sal√£o Revolucion√°rio in Rio de Janeiro in 1931 and the Exposi√ß√£o de Arte Moderna da SPAM in S√£o Paulo in 1933. But in 1933, the disease returned irreversibly. He died in 1934, at the age of thirty-three, in Rio de Janeiro, at a time when his notoriety beyond the circle of connoisseurs was still nascent. He is buried dressed in Franciscan, in a homage of the monks to his ardent Catholic faith.  Legacy  In 1959, Adalgisa Nery published an autobiographical novel, A Imagin√°ria , which became a bestseller. The book relates in particular the common years with Ismael Nery. Adalgisa Nery describes the fascination she initially felt for her husband, but also their agitated relationship, the internal torments of Ismael Nery, and her violence in everyday life. Ismael Nery's work was forgotten by the public and critics until the 1960s, when his name was inscribed on the Biennale of S√£o Paulo, In the room devoted to surrealism and fantastic art. His works were also exhibited in the 10th Biennale. In 1966 in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1984, at the Museum of Contemporary Art of the University of S√£o Paulo (Ismael Nery Retrospective - 50 years later), two retrospectives of his creations were presented.

They were designed by Henry Ivatt in 1897. In total 22 were built between 1898 and 1903 at Doncaster Works. The class were commonly known as 'Klondykes' , after the 1897 Klondike gold rush. They could reach speeds of up to 90 mph (145 km/h). History The 4-4-2 or Atlantic type made its first appearance in 1888 in the United States of America. It was the natural development of the 4-4-0 the additional trailing truck not only supporting a larger firebox but improving the riding. Ten years later the GNR's Henry Ivatt introduced the Atlantic type engines to Britain. Ivatt had the daunting task of replacing the venerable Patrick Stirling at the head of the GNR's locomotive department. Stirling, who had died in office aged 75, was revered not only for the performance of his locomotives but for their looks as well. 'Artistry in metal' was one description of his work and many consider the legendary Stirling Single to be the apotheosis of British locomotive aesthetics. By the turn of the century, however, these single wheelers were being taxed by increasing train loadings on the East Coast Main Line. Seeking greater power and adhesion, Ivatt took the American route. He was not alone; his counterpart on the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, John Aspinall was also working on an Atlantic. Possibly to register a British first construction of the type, Ivatt's Atlantic was given a high priority by the GNR. Numbered No.990 and named Henry Oakley after the general manager of the railway, it was outshopped from Doncaster works in 1898, beating Aspinall's prototype by a few months. Like Churchward on the Great Western Railway Ivatt placed great importance on the boiler design. On No.990 he opted for a large capacity vessel and it was this extra steam raising capacity that gave the Atlantics the edge over Stirling's single wheelers. The first production Atlantics entered service in 1900 and proved fast, lively runners. So lively indeed, that Ivatt had to caution his drivers to rein in the speed because stretches of the track between London and Doncaster were considered too uneven for safety! In their turn, the enginemen would have told Ivatt that the cylinders were no match for the boiler. These first Atlantics had to be worked at undesirable and uneconomic rates to achieve the expected performance; in other words they were thrashed. Ivatt attempted to rectify this by fitting superheaters, starting with 988 with the Schmidt variety in 1909. From 1914 until 1925, the remaining engines were fitted with Robinson superheaters. In line with contemporary thinking, when fitted with superheaters, the boiler pressure was reduced from 170 psi to 160 psi, while the cylinders were enlarged to 19 inches diameter to compensate. Following on from this success Ivatt built the large boiler GNR Class C1. LNER ownership After the 1923 grouping this class became London and North Eastern Railway (LNER} Class C2, whereas the large boiler engines were LNER Class C1. GNR's own Class C2 Atlantic tank locomotives became LNER Class C12.  Preservation  Only one of the small boiler C1 class has survived into preservation and it was the very first. No. 990 Henry Oakley is preserved as part of the National Collection. Although operated since preservation, it is, as of April 2016 on static display at the National Railway Museum, York.

S. Fleet\\", The Okaloosa News-Journal, Friday 7 March 1941, Volume 27, Number 9, page 3 and commissioned on 10 March 1944 with Commander H.W. Gordon in command. Service history =World War II, 1944‚Äì1945= After shakedown in Bermuda and training out of Norfolk, Virginia, Ingraham sailed for duty with the United States Pacific Fleet, arriving at Eniwetok on 31 October 1944 in time to begin the final World War II Allied push against the Japanese toward the Japanese Home Islands. In mid- November 1944, Ingraham commenced screening aircraft carriers during strikes on Luzon in the Philippine Islands in which considerable damage was done to the dwindling Imperial Japanese Navy and aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army. Ingraham continued patrol and antisubmarine duty until 12 December 1944, when she departed for the assault and landings on Mindoro. On 15 December 1944, in company with destroyer , she sank a Japanese cargo ship off the southwest tip of Mindoro. After a brief stay, she departed San Pedro Bay on 2 January 1945, for operations in the Lingayen Gulf. Arriving off the Gulf on 6 January 1945, she added her powerful anti-aircraft fire to that of the invasion fleet, and bombarded the shore targets behind the beaches. At the end of January 1945, Ingraham joined a fast carrier task force for strikes on the Japanese homeland. Following repairs at Saipan on 20 February 1945, she joined the invasion fleet off Iwo Jima on 23 February 1945, and provided accurate call fire for the United States Marines. On 21 March 1945 Ingraham took up radar picket duty in support of the Okinawa-Gunto operation. On 4 May 1945, she came under concerted air attack, and shot down four Japanese planes before a fifth crashed into her above the waterline on the port side, its bomb exploding in the generator room. With only one gun operative, and with 51 casualties aboard included in those numbers were 15 dead. Ingraham retired to Hunter's Point, California, for repairs. She was still in the United States when World War II ended on 15 August 1945. =Post- World War II, 1946‚Äì1952= After additional repairs, Ingraham operated along the United States West Coast until 7 May 1946 when she departed for the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. Those duties completed, Ingraham departed San Diego, California, on 24 February 1947 for the Far East. She engaged in various exercises and in late June 1947 arrived in Manila to act as official U.S. representative at the Philippine Independence anniversary. As part of the \\"Goodwill Tour\\" she also visited Guam, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. The ship participated in a wreath laying ceremony at the site of the Battle of Coral Sea. She returned to San Diego on 8 October 1947. Ingraham operated along the California coast until 4 April 1949 when she departed San Diego for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there on 20 April 1949. She participated in training exercises in the Atlantic Ocean until 24 November 1950, when she departed Norfolk for four months of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. She commenced exercises in the Atlantic Ocean during the summer of 1951, then made another cruise to the Mediterranean during the fall of 1951 and summer of 1952. =Korean War, 1953= Ingraham departed Norfolk 24 April 1953 to escort the aircraft carrier to Japan via the Mediterranean and Suez Canal. She arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 9 June 1953 and later that month joined the aircraft carrier task force providing air support to United Nations forces in Korea during the Korean War. Her accuracy was excellent as she destroyed gun emplacements and supply areas. =Peacetime operations, 1953‚Äì1965= Following the armistice that ended the Korean War, Ingraham operated on security patrol before returning to Norfolk on 27 October 1953. During 1954 she operated on antisubmarine hunter-killer operations, cruised to South America, and participated in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises out of Northern Ireland. She resumed training operations following overhaul in June 1955 and steamed on a summer training cruise to the Scandinavian countries, returning to Norfolk on 6 September 1955. Ingraham departed Norfolk on 28 July 1956 for duty with the United States Sixth Fleet as trouble flared over the Suez Canal during the Suez Canal Crisis. She returned to Norfolk on 4 December 1956. She returned to Norfolk 4 December to begin a series of training cruises climaxed by a NATO exercise in September and October 1957. Ingraham returned to Sixth Fleet duty in February 1958 and operated on patrol and exercises in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 July 1958 prior to the Lebanon crisis, in which the Sixth Fleet played a major role in the outcome in Lebanon. Ingraham then operated on the United States East Coast until 13 February 1959, when she departed for another tour with the Sixth Fleet, and during which a crisis with the Warsaw Pact over Berlin was averted. Departing the Mediterranean on 30 August 1959, she arrived at Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 7 September 1959 and began overhaul. Ingraham underway in June 1962. During 1960, Ingraham engaged in operations out of Mayport, Florida, before embarking on another cruise with the Sixth Fleet, beginning late September 1960. She resumed readiness training out of Mayport in March 1961, before undergoing the extensive eight-month Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) II- overhaul at Portsmouth, Virginia. Ingraham arrived at her new home port, Newport, Rhode Island, on 23 February 1962, then engaged in fleet operations in the Atlantic and in the Caribbean. In September and October 1962 she was assigned to the recovery area for the Project Mercury flight of \\"Sigma 7\\" and under more somber conditions took part in the 1962 blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which ended in the removal of Soviet ballistic missiles from Cuba. She continued operations along the United States East Coast until 1 October 1963, when she sailed for another deployment to the Mediterranean. Regular deployment with the Atlantic Fleet occupied Ingrahams time until 29 September 1965. =Vietnam War, 1965‚Äì1966= On 29 September 1965, Ingraham departed Newport for the Western Pacific and service in the Vietnam War, arriving on 31 October 1965 at Yokosuka, Japan. for resupply before operations in the South China Sea. Though acting as a part of the screen for the aircraft carrier , she also performed fire support missions for ground troops ashore. On 12 November 1965, Ingraham steamed ten miles up the Saigon River in South Vietnam to bombard an enemy supply base, and, on 13 November 1965, shelled a Viet Cong assembly area some This metric conversion assumes that the distance given is 300 statute miles; if it is 300 nautical miles, the metric conversion is 556 kilometers. from the site of her action the previous day. In early December 1965, Ingraham maintained regular surveillance on a Soviet submarine off Chinas Hainan Island, bordering the Gulf of Tonkin. From 1 January 1966 to 24 January, Ingraham operated with Task Force 77 off Vietnam. Ingraham left Vietnamese waters bound for Newport on 4 February 1966 by way of the Suez Canal. =Service, 1966‚Äì1971= Arriving on 8 April 1966 at Newport, Ingraham began a repair and training period. From 14‚Äì21 June 1966 she participated in Operation Beachtime, an amphibious landing in the Caribbean. Ingraham spent 28 October 1966 to 28 November 1966 preparing for service in the Mediterranean. On 8 December 1966 she arrived at Gibraltar. :[1966-1971]  Summer 1969: Guantanamo training exercises.

He served as NASA Deputy Administrator from August 19, 1958, until his death. Biography Dryden was born in Pocomoke City, Maryland, the son of Samuel Isaac and Nova Hill Culver Dryden, and was named after a popular local Methodist clergyman. During the financial panic of 1907, his father lost his job and the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. As a student, Dryden excelled in mathematics. He graduated from Baltimore City College, a high school, at the age of 14, and was the youngest student ever to graduate from that school. He was awarded the Peabody Prize for excellence in mathematics. With a scholarship, he was admitted to Johns Hopkins University and graduated with honors after only three years. He earned a M.S. in physics in 1916. His thesis was titled, \\"Airplanes: An Introduction to the Physical Principles Embodied in their Use.\\" In 1918, Dryden joined the National Bureau of Standards, becoming an inspector of gauges. With the help and influence of Dr. Joseph S. Ames, he obtained a transfer to the bureau's Wind Tunnel division, and began taking graduate courses in fluid dynamics to complete his Ph.D. In 1919 at the age of 20, he was awarded his degree in physics and mathematics from Johns Hopkins University, the youngest person ever to have received a doctorate from that institution. His thesis was on the \\"Air Forces on Circular Cylinders\\". In 1920 Dryden was appointed the director of the Aerodynamics Division of the National Bureau of Standards, a newly created section. Collaborating with Dr. Lyman J. Briggs, he performed studies of airfoils near the speed of sound. He also performed pioneering aerodynamics research on the problems of airflow, turbulence, and especially the boundary layer phenomenon. His work contributed to the design of the wings for the P-51 Mustang, as well as other aircraft designed during World War II. By 1934, Dryden was appointed the bureau's Chief of the Mechanics and Sound Division, and in 1939 he became a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). With the start of World War II, Dryden served in an advisory capacity to the Air Force. He led the development of the \\"Bat\\", a radar-homing guided bomb program that was successfully employed in combat in April, 1945 to sink a Japanese destroyer. After the war, Dryden became the Director of Aeronautical Research for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1946. While at the NACA he supervised the development of the North American X-15, a rocket plane used for research and testing. He also established programs for V/STOL aircraft, and studied the problem of atmospheric reentry. He held the position of Director of NACA, NASA's predecessor, from 1947 until October 1958. In addition he served on numerous government advisory committees, including the Scientific Advisory Committee to the President. From 1941 until 1956 he was editor of the Journal of the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences. After NACA became NASA, he became the Deputy Director of that organization, serving until his death. After John Glenn's orbital flight, an exchange of letters between President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev led to a series of discussions led by Dryden and Soviet scientist Anatoli Blagonravov. Their talks in 1962 led to the Dryden-Blagonravov agreement, which was formalized in October of that year, the same time the two countries were in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The agreement was formally announced at the United Nations on December 5, 1962. It called for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth's magnetic field, and joint tracking of the U.S. Echo II balloon satellite.. Unfortunately, as the competition between the two nation's manned space programs heated up, efforts to further cooperation at that point came to an end. They would be revived in 1969 by NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine and led to the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. He died from cancer on December 2, 1965. Michael Gorn, chief historian at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, described Dryden as a quiet, reserved man who was self-effacing and diligent. He was patient, a good teacher, and effective when collaborating with others. He was also a devout Methodist, who, as a result, had a dislike of self- promotion. He served as a lay minister for his entire adult life. He was married to Mary Libbie Travers, and the couple had four children. Tom Wolfe, writing in 2009 at the 40th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11, credited Dryden with having been the individual who spoke up, with President John F. Kennedy in April, 1961, and suggested that manned flight to the Moon was the way to \\"catch up\\" with the Soviets in the space race. Wolfe describes President Kennedy as having been in \\"a terrible funk\\" at the time of the meeting with James E. Webb, the NASA administrator, and Dryden, his deputy, as the president wrestled with the string of Soviet \\"firsts\\" in space flight which had started with Sputnik 1 in 1957 and, that month in 1961, had extended to include Yuri Gagarin's Earth-orbital flight. Within a month of the meeting with Webb and Dryden, President Kennedy announced the Apollo Project-scale goal of putting a man on the Moon within 10 years, the goal that Apollo 11 was ultimately to meet. In setting the goal, the president did not credit Dryden's input, according to Wolfe.\\"One Giant Leap to Nowhere\\" Op-Ed by Tom Wolfe, The New York Times, July 18, 2009 (7/19/09 p. WK11 of NY ed.).

Other nitrate towns of the Atacama Desert include Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works. Unlike most of the other ghost towns in the Atacama Desert, Chacabuco became a concentration camp during the Pinochet regime in 1973. To this day, it remains surrounded by approximately 98 lost landmines, left by the Chilean military when Chacabuco was used as a prison camp.  Nitrate Town History Founded in 1924 by the Lautaro Nitrate Company Ltd., Chacabuco soon fell into ruin as the nitrate mining boom in Chile came to an abrupt halt at the end of the 1930s. Synthetic nitrate had been invented in Germany at the turn of the 20th century and by the 1930s and 40s had severely crippled northern Chile's nitrate industry. What had accounted for virtually 50% of Chile's Gross National Product fell to almost zero within a few decades. A total of 170 nitrate towns were shut down throughout Chile's Atacama Desert, only one remains open today, Mar√≠a Elena, about 95 kilometers north of Chacabuco. Chacabuco shut its doors in 1938. As a town, it had only survived 14 years.  Concentration camp history  In 1971, president Salvador Allende declared Chacabuco a Historic Monument of Chile, at which point restoration began. But in 1973, after the military coup, Pinochet turned it into a concentration camp until the end of 1974. As a concentration camp, it held up to 1,800 prisoners many of whom were doctors, lawyers, artists, writers, professors and workers from all over Chile.  Chacabuco today  By the 1990s, Chacabuco was in need of extensive restoration and several international organizations began the restoration of parts of Chacabuco. In 1991, a former political prisoner of Chacabuco, Roberto Sald√≠var, returned to Chacabuco in order to live in the abandoned town and guard it against vandalism and pillaging. He lived there almost completely alone until January 2006. Pedro Barreda replaced Roberto when he left as caretaker of Chacabuco. Currently living in Chacabuco alone, Pedro considers himself to be Roberto's apprentice and remains dedicated to the cause Roberto started.

Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the town is located at the point where Ryedale leaves the moorland and joins the flat Vale of Pickering. It is situated on the River Rye on the A170 road, east of Thirsk, west of Pickering and some due north of York. The southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park passes through Helmsley along the A170 road so that the western part of the town is within the National Park. The settlement grew around its position at a road junction and river crossing point. Helmsley is a compact town, retaining its medieval layout around its market place with more recent development to the north and south of its main thoroughfare, Bondgate. It is a historic town of considerable architectural character whose centre has been designated as a conservation area. The town is associated with the Earls of Feversham, whose ancestral home Duncombe Park was built overlooking Helmsley Castle. A statue of William Duncombe, 2nd Baron Feversham stands in the town's square. The town is a popular tourist centre and has won gold medals in the Large Village category of Yorkshire in Bloom for three years. The town square is a meeting place for motorcyclists as it is at the end of the B1257 road from Stokesley, which is a favourite with bikers. The Cleveland Way National Trail starts at Helmsley, and follows a horseshoe loop around the North York Moors National Park and Yorkshire coast for to Filey. The remains of Helmsley Castle, which was destroyed in the Civil War, loom over the town. History 2nd Baron Feversham Monument, Town Square Archaeological discoveries indicate that the area around Helmsley was first settled in around 3,000 BC and small farming communities existed here throughout the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages and into Roman times. Finds of beehive querns confirm local agriculture and the milling of grain since at least the Iron Age. There are also reports of finds of Roman pottery and a second-century Roman coin. The ancient settlement, whose Old English name was Elmeslac, pre-dates the Domesday Book. It means ‚ÄòHelm‚Äôs forest clearing‚Äô and indicates the nature of the landscape at that time.Vikings also left their mark in the Old Norse, \\"gate\\" ending of the names of many of the streets. The ownership of much of the town and its surrounding land has changed hands only twice since the Norman Conquest. After the conquest it was governed within the wapentake of Maneshou in the North Riding of Yorkshire, held by William the Conqueror‚Äôs half brother the Count of Mortain;Open Domesday Online: Helmsley land to the west of Helmsley was a royal deer park. The ancient pollarded oak trees in Duncombe Park date from this period and the park is now a national nature reserve. In about 1100 the estate passed to Walter Espec, founder of Rievaulx Abbey. Walter Espec‚Äôs heirs were the eldest surviving sons of his three sisters and the Helmsley properties devolved upon Robert De Ros, the son of the youngest sister, Adeline. In 1191 Robert de Ros granted Helmsley its Borough Charter, which established it as the market town. Helmsley Castle The charter created the burgage plots ‚Äì long, narrow plots which can still be seen in the property boundaries on the west side of Castlegate and east side of Bridge Street. Large-scale sheep farming, wool production and weaving were the mainstay of Helmsley‚Äôs economy for several centuries. Despite setbacks, including marauding Scots and the Black Death, Helmsley grew steadily throughout the Middle Ages. When wool production declined after the dissolution of Rievaulx Abbey, Helmsley‚Äôs weavers turned to flax, much of which was imported. The weavers were located on Bond and Bridge Streets. By the beginning of the 17th century the form of Helmsley was largely complete, and many buildings in use today date from this period. The oldest surviving house is Canon's Garth, the vicarage. The town remained with the holders of the barony of De Ros through the Earls of Rutland and the Dukes of Buckingham until it was sold to the city financier, Sir Charles Duncombe in about 1689. The ruined Norman castle is the most significant medieval survival of the buildings in the town, although parts of the parish church and Canon‚Äôs Garth are mediaeval in origin. The 18th and 19th centuries saw major developments and expansion in the hands of the Duncombe family, beginning with the construction of Duncombe Park outside the town. At the beginning of the 19th century the cottage weaving industry declined in the face of competition from new industrial cities. Despite this, the 19th century saw various major development in the town, notably the rebuilding of All Saints' Church, and at the end of the century, building of the town hall. More houses were built along Bondgate and, after the arrival of the railway in 1871, along Station Road. This period also saw older houses remodelled so that little thatch remained in the town. With the decline of weaving, agriculture became the mainstay of the economy. On 30 June 2011, the BBC Two programme History Cold Case featured an archaeological investigation into four 2,000-year-old skeletons found in Windy Pits caves, concluding that at least one had been the victim of a ritual killing, including scalping. The findings, including the facial reconstruction of the scalping victim, were presented, at Duncombe Park, to local history experts.\\"The Skeletons of Windy Pits\\", in Series 2 of the BBC2 \\"History Cold Case\\" series, broadcast 30 June 2011 Conservation area Looking up Borough BeckThe conservation area covers about 91.2 acres (36.9 hectares) and contains some 433 buildings within its bounds. It contains all 51 listed buildings in the town, approximately 12% of the building stock, and two scheduled ancient monuments. Of the listed buildings, 48 are classified Grade II and three are Grade II*. Most small buildings in the conservation area are built of local cream and honey-coloured stone. Most buildings, even those of higher status, are constructed using rubble stone which has been laid to course. Most roofs are covered with pantiles. Some of the larger, more imposing town houses and civic buildings have been constructed using ashlar stone and slate as a demonstration of affluence. Geography Helmsley is situated on the southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park approximately above sea level. The town's geology is sandstone. To the west and the north of the settlement the moorland areas are predominantly limestone. Helmsley lies in a hollow in undulating open countryside, flanked by heather moor to the north and the rolling farmland of the Howardian Hills to the south. The flat lowland of the Vale of Pickering stretches eastwards from the town towards Malton. The River Rye runs by the town to the south where it is joined at Rye Bridge by the Borough Beck flowing southwards through the town from the moors. Meadows south of the Rye form an important buffer and create an attractive setting for the town from the southern approach. The area was affected by flash flooding on the night of 19 June 2005. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north from Helmsley with a total population of 3,066 measured at the 2011 Census. Population The population of the larger Helmsley ward area was recorded by the 2001 Census as being 3,097. North Yorkshire County Council, however, estimated in 2000 that the population of the actual urban town area was approximately 1,500, measured at 1,515 in the 2011 census. The town is in the catchment area of Ryedale School. Economy and education Helmsley Market Place In the late 20th century a large amount of housing was built on backland sites in the older part of town and in residential developments outside its historic core and a small industrial estate was developed in the south-eastern corner. Developments included award-winning council house development at Elmslac Road in the 1950s, a primary school, health centre, \\"affordable housing\\" at Storey Close, housing for the elderly at Elm Green and Pottergate and development of the industrial sector, particularly Thomas's Bakery and a veterinary surgery. The castle visitor centre provides an important attraction for the town. Helmsley is well provided with retail space but less well provided with office space. The main employers are Duncombe Park Estate, Thomas‚Äôs Bakery and the North York Moors National Park Authority. The industrial estate is a vital economic asset of Helmsley. The Black Swan Hotel Tourism plays an important role in the area's economy. The national park receives around 9 million day-visits each year. Day visitors make up 40% of all visitor days, with people staying within the park making up 31% and people staying outside the park making up 29%. 31% of park visitors stay in serviced accommodation, compared with 64% who stay in self- catering accommodation. Daily expenditure in the national park is approximately ¬£9.10 per person, which excludes accommodation costs. Visitor revenue within the national park was ¬£169 million in 1998, ¬£152 million in 1997 and ¬£119 million in 1996. This can be compared to the figure for the whole of North Yorkshire, which stood at ¬£1,054 million in 1996. However, employment in tourism is, by nature, seasonal. Helmsley draws the largest number of day visitors (32%) within the year, for the North York Moors National Park as a whole. It attracts 37% of longer stay visitors. Helmsley Community Primary School is on Carlton Lane. Culture, media and sport Helmsley Arts Centre has a 140-seat auditorium and 40-seat studio/exhibition space. It provides film screenings, live music, theatre performances, comedy clubs, art exhibitions and workshops/classes. The 1812 Theatre Company is the resident amateur theatre company at the centre. It mounts at least three productions per year in the main theatre and two in the studio. The 1812 Youth Theatre meets there on a regular basis, putting on two shows a year. Inside the Walled Garden The indie rock band One Night Only is from the town. The Helmsley Walled Garden, originally built in 1756, is being restored as a working kitchen garden. A walled garden for the castle stood along the banks of the river to the south. Soon after the family moved out of the castle into Duncombe Park this walled garden was built. The garden incorporates glass houses designed in 1850 as a vine house. The ongoing programme of restoration uses appropriate plants where possible. Helmsley has an open-air swimming pool and a recreation ground providing facilities for tennis, bowls, cricket and football. The Cleveland Way, a horseshoe-shaped route around the North York Moors National Park starts in Helmsley. It follows the moor's western escarpment to meet the coast at Saltburn-by-the-Sea, and then follows the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Heritage Coast to end at Filey. Other places of interest include the International Centre for Birds of Prey, Rievaulx Abbey and Helmsley Arts Centre. Local newspapers are the Malton and Pickering Mercury and the Gazette and Herald. Helmsley Library is situated at the front of the town hall, in the Market Place. Staff at the library received an award for North Yorkshire County Council's Library of the Year in 2010. =Helmsley Archive= The Helmsley Archive is a collection of more than 5,000 images illustrating the history of Helmsley over the last 150 years. John Collier bequeathed his collection to Helmsley Town Council who, with the Ryedale Area Committee of North Yorkshire County Council, support the project. The archive is being augmented by local residents. Religion Church of All Saints There are four churches in Helmsley. The Anglican church is the Church of All Saints a Grade II* listed building.

The university enrolls an estimated 1,300 undergraduate and graduate students. It offers 27 four-year undergraduate programs, an MBA and a master of education. Established in 1923, it has been coeducational since 1932. The university is also home to Greystone Preparatory School, a college-level service academy preparatory program for those who did not receive appointments or nominations straight out of high school. History Captain Charles Schreiner Sr. founded Schreiner Institute (sometimes called Schreiner Military Institute) in 1917 and worked toward its establishment until 1923. The military institute, a residential school, was created for young boys and included both secondary school and junior college curricula to prepare students for further education. 1971 marked the end of military training at the institute. In 1973, it began focusing on a college curriculum and changed its name to Schreiner College. The college experience changed once more in 1981 when it became a four-year college. The college became Schreiner University in 2001 and began offering master's degrees. Schreiner University now hosts a number of lecture series and academic conferences, including its annual popular culture symposium. In 2017, Schreiner surpassed its five-year capital campaign fundraising goal of $50 million. Since 2012, the institution has received $52.4 million from approximately 3,600 donors. Nearly $30 million of the amount raised is earmarked for student scholarships, which have been previously funded at $13 million. The school will add endowed chairs in mathematics, science, and humanities and hire a visiting artist and performer or designer in residence. Schreiner has a current enrollment of 1,300.Lauren Caruba, \\"Schreiner tops goal of raising $50 million, San Antonio Express-News, May 22, 2017. Campus The university no longer operates the Hill Country Museum in the house of its founder, the Capt. Charles Schreiner Mansion.

Bonus stage either have no enemies or hazards, or replace the normal penalties for being struck by enemies or hazards with simply being thrown out of the bonus stage. Many bonus stages need to be activated or discovered in some manner, or certain conditions must be satisfied to access them. Otherwise, they appear after the player has completed a certain number of regular stages. They are often much shorter than regular stages. Unlike most regular stages, a bonus stage does not normally have to be completed to move on. While a regular stage must be replayed until completion, possibly using up lives or continues upon failures, when a player begins a bonus stage they have one chance at it. Some bonus stages do contain an end location or condition to reach, but regardless of whether the player succeeds or fails, game play resumes at the next regular stage after one attempt. Other bonus stages have no end to reach, the player must simply survive as long as they can before inevitably failing at some point. Some bonus stages have a short time limit, where the player must either complete the stage before the time runs out, or simply survive until the clock runs down to zero. As bonus stages are often shorter and over in one attempt, players cannot as easily practice and perfect their play through of them in the same way as regular stages that permit or demand more attempts upon failure. In some games, bonus stages have an interface and game paradigm that is completely different and disconnected from the rest of the game, as in the slot machine bonus stage of Super Mario Brothers 2. Other bonus stages use the same gaming paradigm as the rest of the game, as in the car smashing bonus stage of Street Fighter II or the bonus stages in Super Monkey Ball where players collect bananas to earn extra points and lives. History Namco's Rally-X from 1980s contains a bonus round presented with the title \\"CHALLENGING STAGE.\\" The gameplay goal is to collect all of the flags in the scrolling maze, but enemy cars don't move. Namco's Galaga from the following year, also has a \\"Challenging Stage\\" with enemies that do not attack. The player is rewarded extra points based on how many enemies are eliminated. Most modern bonus stages reward the player with power-ups rather than points. Modern games have often blurred the traditional distinction between bonus stages and ordinary levels. Most first-person shooter games allow players to enter bonus rooms within larger (non-bonus) levels to temporarily power up. Some games have optional bonus stages which must be discovered and whose completion impacts the mechanics of the rest of the game, as in the \\"Star Road\\" levels of Super Mario World. Comparison with secret levels Bonus stages are often confused with secret levels; however, in the majority of games, they are two distinct things. The key differences are the following: *Bonus stages are often mentioned within the manual or during in-game hints. In comparison, a secret stage is more or less hidden, and only vaguely mentioned in the manual or during gameplay (for instance, on the world map). *Secret levels feature enemies, death-traps and various hazards, even introducing special, new hazards or enemies which are not present anywhere else inside the game. Most games have little to no resistance or hazards on bonus levels. *Many bonus stages have a time limit. Therefore, many bonus stages doesn't have any exits either, the clock shall yank the player out of the level eventually. Most secret levels have no time limit at all and their exit must be located to progress further in the game, just like any other regular level. The Crash Bandicoot series contain various other non-linear paths in levels and even levels in their own right that, unlike bonus stages, require certain feats or collectibles to access them.

He is ranked fifth among the world's 100 top chemists in the list released by Thomson Reuters. In 2009, he was named the Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National LaboratoryAbout the Director-Berkeley Lab and in 2014 he was named a laureate for the National Medal of Science.White House to honor Alivisatos, Hu with National Medals of Science, Technology, Berkeley News In 2016 he was named U.C. Berkeley's Vice Chancellor for Research. As of July 1, 2017, he is University of California, Berkeley's Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, and will continue on as Vice Chancellor for Research on an interim basis. Alivisatos is also Samsung Distinguished Professor in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research and Professor of Chemistry and Materials Science & Engineering at UC Berkeley. In addition, he directs the Kavli Energy Nanosciences Institute (ENSI), a new institute on the UC Berkeley campus launched by the Kavli Foundation to explore the application of nanoscience to sustainable energy technologies.  Early life  Paul Alivisatos was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he lived until the age of 10, when his family moved to Athens, Greece. Alivisatos has said of his years in Greece that it was a great experience for him because he had to learn the Greek language and culture then catch up with the more advanced students. \\"When I found something very interesting it was sometimes a struggle for me to understand it the very best that I could,\\" he has said of that experience. \\"That need to work harder became an important motivator for me.\\" Alivisatos returned to the United States to attend the University of Chicago in the late seventies.  Training and Career  In 1981, Alivisatos earned a B.A. with honors in chemistry from the University of Chicago. In 1986, he received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked under Charles Harris. His Ph.D. thesis concerned the photophysics of electronically excited molecules near metal and semiconductor surfaces. He then joined AT&T; Bell Labs working with Louis E. Brus, and began research in the field of nanotechnology. Alivisatos returned to UC Berkeley in 1988 as an assistant professor of chemistry, becoming associate professor in 1993 and professor in 1995. He served as Chancellor's Professor from 1998-2001, and added an appointment as a professor of materials science and engineering in 1999. Alivisatos‚Äô affiliation with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (or Berkeley Lab) began in 1991 when he joined the staff of the Materials Sciences Division. From 2005 to 2007 Alivisatos served as Berkeley Lab's Associate Laboratory Director for the Physical Sciences area. In 2008, he served as Deputy Lab Director under Berkeley Lab Director Steven Chu, and then as interim director when Chu stepped down to become the Secretary of Energy. He was named the seventh Director of the Berkeley Lab on November 19, 2009, by the University of California Board of Regents on the recommendation of UC President Mark Yudof and with the concurrence of the U.S. Department of Energy. Energy Secretary Steven Chu noted that Alivisatos is \\"an incredible scientist with incredible judgment on a variety of issues. He‚Äôs level-headed and calm, and he has an ability to inspire people‚Ä¶[and he can] take projects from material science to real-world applications.\\"  Nanosciences Research  Alivisatos is an internationally recognized authority on nanochemistry and a pioneer in the synthesis of semiconductor quantum dots and multi-shaped artificial nanostructures. Further, he is a world expert on the chemistry of nanoscale crystals; one of his papers (Science, 271: 933-937, 1996) has been cited over 9,100 times. He is also an expert on how these can be applied, for example as biological markers (e.g., Science, 281: 2013-16, 1998; a paper cited over 7,400 times). In addition, his use of DNA in this area (DNA nanotechnology) has shown the surprising versatility of this molecule. He has used it to direct crystal growth and create new materials, as in Nature, 382: 609-11, 1996, and even to measure nanoscale distances (see Nature Nanotechnology, 1: 47-52, 2006). He is widely recognized as being the first to demonstrate that semiconductor nanocrystals can be grown into complex two-dimensional shapes, as opposed to simple one-dimensional spheres. Alivisatos proved that controlling the growth of nanocrystals is the key to controlling both their size and shape. This achievement altered the nanoscience landscape and paved the way for a slew of new potential applications, including biomedical diagnostics, revolutionary photovoltaic cells, and LED materials. = Nanocrystals = Nanocrystals are aggregates of anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of atoms that combine into a crystalline form of matter known as a \\"cluster.\\" Typically a few nanometers in diameter, nanocrystals are larger than molecules but smaller than bulk solids and therefore often exhibit physical and chemical properties somewhere in between. Given that a nanocrystal is virtually all surface and no interior, its properties can vary considerably as the crystal grows in size. Prior to Alivisatos‚Äô research, all non-metal nanocrystals were dot-shaped, meaning they were essentially one- dimensional. No techniques had been reported for making two-dimensional or rod-shaped semiconductor nanocrystals that would also be of uniform size. However, in a landmark paper that appeared in the March 2, 2000 issue of the journal Nature, Alivisatos reported on techniques used to select the size but vary the shapes of the nanocrystals produced. This was hailed as a major breakthrough in nanocrystal fabrication because rod-shaped semiconductor nanocrystals can be stacked to create nano-sized electronic devices. The rod- shaped nanocrystal research, coupled with earlier work led by Alivisatos in which it was shown that quantum dots or \\"qdots\\"‚Äìnanometer-sized crystal dots (spheres a few billionths of a meter in size)‚Äì made from semiconductors such as cadmium selenide can emit multiple colors of light depending upon the size of the crystal, opened the door to using nanocrystals as fluorescent probes for the study of biological materials, biomedical research tools and aids to diagnosis, and as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Alivisatos went on to use his techniques to create an entirely new generation of hybrid solar cells that combined nanotechnology with plastic electronics. = Technology Transfer and Translational Impact = Alivisatos is the founding scientist of Quantum Dot Corporation, a company that makes crystalline nanoscale tags that are used in the study of cell behavior. (Quantum Dot is now part of Life Technologies.) He also founded the nanotechnology company Nanosys, and Solexant, a photovoltaic start-up that has since restarted as Siva Power. His research has led to the development of applications in range of industries, including bioimaging (for example, the use of quantum dots for luminescent labeling of biological tissue); display technologies (his quantum dot emissive film is found in the Kindle Fire HDX tablet); and renewable energy (solar applications of quantum dots).  U.S. Patents  More than 20 as of 2014.  Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (also Berkeley Lab)  Under Alivisatos‚Äô leadership, Berkeley Lab has embarked upon an ambitious period of strategic scientific infrastructure renewal, and shifted its priorities to the more interdisciplinary areas of renewable energy and climate-change research. During his tenure, the Lab began construction on new buildings for computational research, buildings efficiency, solar energy research, and biological science. During this time, the Lab also cleared the legacy Bevatron site and has partially cleared and is working to finish cleaning the \\"Old Town\\" site. This has left the Lab better able to contribute to the Department of Energy's mission today, and with room for potential growth on brownfield sites in the future. In addition, Alivisatos has proactively invigorated Berkeley Lab's safety culture, elevated the Lab's community outreach and operational efficiency efforts, and is currently working to build a more diverse and inclusive community within the lab. On March 23, 2015 Alvisatos announced that he is stepping down as Director when a replacement is identified. As he develops these initiatives across the Lab, Alivisatos has remained focused on integrating the Lab into the nation's innovation ecosystem, especially in the areas of energy and the environment. While some of the groundwork for this integration was laid by former Director Steve Chu, Alivisatos has led efforts to leverage the wide range of scientific capabilities at Berkeley Lab with a variety of industry partners and entrepreneurs. These public/private sector collaborations have resulted in technology transfer for industries as diverse as automobiles and medicine, and have contributed to an increased speed of development in manufacturing and renewable energy. In addition to his emphasis on innovation and outreach to the private sector, Alivisatos is also working to create a more closely connected network of the U.S. Dept. of Energy's 17 national labs. He serves as the chair of the National Lab Directors Council, and has encouraged greater alignment and collaboration across the labs on such issues as diversity and workforce development. Alivisatos has also been outspoken on the issue of basic science funding at the federal level and America's ability to stay competitive in the areas global scientific research and development.

It is strategically located, controlling access to the river which runs through former Joseon and the present South Korean capital Seoul. Its fortifications were repeatedly attacked during the 19th century. With an area of , it constitutes most of Ganghwa County (a division of Incheon). The island has a population of about 65,500, half of whom live in Ganghwa Town (Ganghwa-eup) in the northeast. Name \\"Ganghwado\\" or \\"Ganghwa-do\\" (, formerly ) means \\"island made prosperous\\", \\"illustrious\\" or \\"flourishing by the river\\" (in reference to its formation from the silt carried downriver by the Han River). Former romanizations include \\"Kang-hoa\\" and \\"Kang-hwa\\". Geography The island is in the estuary of Korea's Han River. It is , long and wide, the fourth-largest island in South Korea. The island's highest point is Mani-san ( above sea level). =Climate= History With the primary fortifications protecting the Joseon capital of Seoul from foreign invasion, Ganghwa Island was the site of several 19th- century punitive expeditions. The mass execution of Catholic French missionaries and Korean converts under the ministry of the Heungseon Daewongun in the mid-1860s led to a French invasion in 1866 which held the island for several weeks, although the inability of Admiral Pierre-Gustave Roze to sail up the shallow, uncharted Han River and attack its fortified monasteries prevented overland incursion. In 1871, a Korean assault on an American diplomatic mission led to the Battle of Ganghwa. Rear Admiral Rodgers took five forts on the island, but withdrew after the Koreans refused to negotiate. After an 1868 diplomatic incident related to Korea's refusal to recognize the imperial status of the emperor of Japan, the forts at Ganghwa fired on a Japanese boat from the surveying gunship Un'y≈ç in 1875. During the Japanese Battle of Ganghwa, Un'y≈ç captain Inoue Yoshika silenced the batteries with superior firepower and landed a raiding force which plundered local communities. The Imperial Japanese Navy blockaded the area and compelled the 1876 Treaty of Ganghwa, which opened Korea to Japanese commerce. =1871 invasion by U.S. warships= In 1866, the General Sherman arrived at Pyongyang via the Daedong River. A Welsh pastor, Thomas, was a crewman traveling for missionary work to Joseon. Pyongyang governor Park Gyu-su, Park Ji-won's grandson, informed the crew about his refusal to allow trade and advised them to go back. Disputes worsened among the crew; after they kidnapped a Joseon official and held him hostage, Korean authorities sank the boat and killed the surviving crew. In 1871, during the Joseon expedition, the U.S. decided to open a port. It ordered the Joseon expedition to Asia, led by Fleet Commander Rogers. On June 1, The U.S. led sounding navigation of the Ganghwa Strait. When the fleet arrived in Sondolmok, it was attacked from the coastline by a Ganghwa artillery unit. The American fleet seized the Chojijin Fort with naval gunfire. The American army took over Deokjjinjin Fort on June 11, and began the Gwangseongbo operation. After an hour of land and sea shelling, the American army captured Gwangseongbo. Three Americans were killed, and 10 wounded. Three hundred fifty Koreans were killed, and 20 wounded. Therapeutic turnip The island's turnip (Brassica rapa) has been cultivated for over a thousand years. Its moisture content is over 90 percent, and its main component is carbohydrate. The dark-purple, taproot vegetable has a mustardy scent and tastes like ginseng. The turnip's seeds and fully-grown vegetable are used in folk remedies and Oriental medicine. Its leaves have vitamins, and its roots contain tryptophan and glycyrrhizin. Said to have anticancer activity, the turnip helps cure skin diseases, digestive ailments, tuberculosis and respiratory disease with an anti-bacterial effect.

It is a Brahmic script and is written left-to-right. Mahajani refers to the Hindi word for 'bankers', also known as 'sarrafi' or 'kothival' (merchant). History Mahajani has been used as a primary accounting script for Marwari traders and for the use of Hindi and Punjabi in a wide region across northwest India and eastern Pakistan. It was taught in merchant schools as part of the education system. A vast majority of documents in which it is found are financial documents, in addition to primers. Its use has been reported by bookkeepers in Haryana as the Langdi script, although its relationship with Langdi is uncertain. Mahajani descended from Landa scripts in the greater Punjab region in historic times and was well known as a merchant's script throughout north India. It may have also been influenced by Kaithi and Devanagari. Characters It has fewer vowels than most North Indian scripts, and the use of them is optional. The vowels i and u can represent both their short and long forms in addition to diphthongs and related vowels. Since vowels are optional, they must be interpreted in context for most Mahajani texts. There are no special conjunct consonant forms, and there are no viramas to indicate them. Nasalization, if indicated, is typically represented by 'na'. It also has various fraction marks, accounting marks, and textual organization marks, to indicate paragraph and word spacing, and abbreviation, punctuation, and space marks. As many Mahajani texts are accounting books, accounting symbols have been found, but they are undergoing further research for proper encoding. It also uses a Devanagari-like baseline only to mark title headings on texts, not like in Devanagari where the baseline is an integral part of the characters. Some characters also have glyphic variants, which can be found in greater detail in the Unicode Proposal. Unicode Mahajani script was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.

Designed by Patrick Stirling, they are characterised by a single pair of large (8' 1\\") driving wheels which led to the nickname \\"eight-footer\\". Originally the locomotive was designed to haul up to 26 passenger carriages at an average speed of .\\" pp. 140 They could reach speeds of up to 85 mph (137 km/h).  Development  On his arrival at GNR, Stirling set out to standardise the railway's rolling stock. He also borrowed a 'single-wheeler' from the Great Eastern Railway and, in 1868, designed two versions of 2-2-2 with driving wheels. The outcome, in 1870 was a locomotive with driving wheels, designed specifically for high speed expresses between York and London. The norm in those days was inside cylinders. Not only were there frequent failures of the cranked axle shafts, with such large driving wheels, they would have set the boiler too high. He therefore used outside cylinders with a four-wheeled bogie for lateral stability at the front end. According to Hamilton Ellis's description entitled 'Pat Stirling's masterpiece,' the design was a version of a 2-2-2 designed by Stirling for the Glasgow and South Western Railway, 'considerably enlarged, and provided with a leading bogie.' A total of 53 were built at Doncaster between 1870 and 1895, in three series introduced in 1870, 1884, and 1894;. (George Frederick Bird, referred to the three series as 'G, G2 and G3 classes' in 1910, and this classification has been used in other sourcesHerring, p.23. but it does not appear to have been used officially by the GNR.) The GNR did not number its locomotives sequentially, instead using numbers freed up by withdrawing older locomotives. Thus the 1870 series was numbered between GNR No. 1 and 671, the 1884 series 771-8 and 1001-2, and 1894 series 1003-8.  Performance  No. 544 with a domed boiler These locomotives were able to haul trains at an average of , with a top speed, on lighter trains, of ,Herring, p. 23. taking part in the 1895 Race to the North. GNR Stirling No 775 made the from Grantham to York in 1 hour 16 minutes. This translates to an average speed of . Members of the 1894 series were originally built weighing but following two high-speed derailments in 1895 the weight was reduced by 1% to .Ellis, pp.79-80. Accidents and incidents *On 7 March 1896, a passenger train hauled by locomotive No.1003 was derailed at Little Bytham, Lincolnshire due to the premature removal of a speed restriction after track renewal. Two people were killed. *On 10 November 1895, an overnight Scottish express hauled by locomotive No. 1006 derailed at St Neots when it encountered a broken rail. One person was killed. The accident report by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate commented on the abnormally heavy axle loading of the locomotive: nearly 20 tons on the driving axle. Withdrawal and preservation With the arrival of the Ivatt Atlantics after 1898, the class began to be displaced from the most prestigious express services. Several examples were rebuilt by H.A. Ivatt after 1898 with a domed boiler, but withdrawals of the 1870 series began in 1899. The last examples of the class were in use on secondary services until 1916. Preserved No. 1 The first of the class, No 1 is the only engine to be preserved. It is exhibited at the National Railway Museum, York. It was restored to running order during the 1930s for the fiftieth anniversary of the race to the north and steamed again during the 1980s. The locomotive remains in good mechanical condition, though it has not steamed since 1985, and was used recently to act as a star player in York Theatre Royal's stage- performance of The Railway Children play, in which it was seen to move into a stage set of a period station, created initially at the National Railway Museum and more recently in the redundant Waterloo International station. The locomotive appeared to be in steam for its 'performances', however it was not, with fog machine generated smoke being used to portray escaping steam. In reality the locomotive was shunted into position during the performance using a Class 08 Diesel Shunter which remained out of sight of the main stage.  Modelling  An 18\\" gauge model of No.1 was built in 1898, at the Regent Street Polytechnic, from a set of parts supplied by W. G. Bagnall. Amongst the students at Regent Street who worked on the model was Henry Greenly who later became a celebrated miniature locomotive builder and supplied locomotives for the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. The locomotive was initially sold to Mr.E.F.S. Notter the Great Northern Railway District Locomotive Superintendent at Kings Cross, who between 1910 and 1914 operated it at Alexander Park (London) and later kept it in King Cross 'Top Shed', the home of the full size Stirling Singles. In 1926 this locomotive was bought by the Fairbourne Miniature Railway and in 1936 it was sold to the Jaywick Miniature Railway, which ran it until 1939. It then passed through the hands of a number of private owners until it was bought by the World of Country Life Museum at Sandy Bay, Exmouth, Devon, in 1986. Bagnall had earlier, in 1893, supplied a similar model (works number 1425) to Lord Downshire of Easthampstead Park, Crowthorne Berkshire. This engine was later preserved by Mr Hoare in the Boys Reading Room at the Training Ship Mercury at Hamble. It was subsequently sold to a private owner in Southampton in 1946. Its current whereabouts is unknown. Nuremberg toymaker Georges Carette's range included a 2.5 inch-gauge model of Stirling Single 776, in around ~1900. It was marketed in the UK by Bassett- Lowke, appearing in their 1904 catalogue. An unpowered 5\\" gauge model of a Stirling Single locomotive, engineered by Dennis Hefford, is on display at the entrance to Arch Two of Brighton Toy and Model Museum. A 1/12 scale model of No.93, built by 'R Jackson' around 1888, is displayed at Worthing Museum and Art Gallery. Kitmaster produced an injection moulded plastic kit of the Stirling Single in the 1950s. David Boyle, founder of Dapol Model Railways, recalls seeing the moulds being destroyed in the early 1980s, leading him to purchase the tooling for and reissue the remaining Kitmaster kits. Aster Hobby introduced Gauge1 live steam model in 1996.Great Northern Railway Stirling Single In April 2015, Rapido Trains announced that a forthcoming OO gauge model would be exclusively available from Locomotion Models.

Her eldest brother, Sancho VII of Navarre, succeeded their father as King of Navarre and was the last male descendant of the first dynasty of Kings of Navarre, the Pamplona dynasty, dying childless. Her elder sister Berengaria of Navarre married Richard I of England. Life =Regency= Blanche married Theobald III, Count of Champagne,Theodore Evergates, The Aristocracy in the County of Champagne, 1100-1300, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007), 248 on 1 July 1199 at Chartres, when she was 22-years-old and he was 20-years-old. However, Theobald III died young on 24 May 1201, leaving her pregnant. When she gave birth to a son on 30 May 1201, he immediately became Theobald IV, Count of Champagne (Theobald I of Navarre). Blanche ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned 21 years old in 1222. The regency was plagued by a number of difficulties. Blanche's brother-in-law, count Henry II had left behind a great deal of debt. Furthermore, their son Theobald IV's right to the succession of Champagne was challenged by Henry's daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, Count of Ramerupt and one of the more powerful Champagne nobles. The conflict with the Briennes broke into open warfare in 1215, in what became known as the Champagne War of Succession, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time Theobald and Blanche bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment. Blanche had also arranged the dowry of Henry II's elder daughter Alice of Champagne, when she married the young Hugh I of Cyprus. In the 1230s, in order to settle with Alice, Theobald IV had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Ch√¢teaudun to Louis IX of France. With her regency completed, in 1222 Blanche withdrew to the Cistercian convent of Argensolles, whose foundation she had funded herself, for her retirement. =Later years= Since some barons suspected Theobald for having a hand in the death of Louis VIII (in November 1226), Blanche of Castile withdrew his invitation to the coronation of Louis IX and proffered it to Blanche instead.Abulafia, David. The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 1198-c. 1300, 1999. Blanche also took over administration of the kingdom of Navarre when her brother Sancho VII went into retirement (\\"El Encerrado\\"). Blanche died on 13 March 1229, seven years after the end of her regency, at the age of 52. In her will she left 5 marks of gold to the Cathedral of Reims, which was used to build a statue to contain the Holy Milk of the Virgin.Historical Aspects of the Reconstruction of Reims Cathedral, 1210-124, Robert Branner, Speculum, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Jan., 1961), 33. After Blanche's death, her brother in retirement remained as King of Navarre and her son Theobald continued as Count of Champagne. Their eldest sister, Berengaria of Navarre, Queen of England (widow of Richard the Lionheart), died without issue in 1230, leaving Sancho as the sole surviving child of Sancho VI. When he died in 1234, Blanca's son Theobald IV of Champagne was recognized as the next King of Navarre. Theobald had married twice during Blanche's lifetime and had one daughter by the time of her death, who was also named Blanche. Children Blanche had two children with Theobald III of Champagne: #Marie ‚Äì Blanche is noted as having borne an older daughter named Marie to Theobald III before his death in May 1201. References to this Marie in documentation are scant, but as Blanche was married in July 1199, Marie would have been under two years old at the time of her father's death. One of the conditions of Blanche's treaty with Philip II confirming her son's inheritance was that Marie had to be sent away to be raised in the royal court at Paris. #Theobald I of Navarre.

Wideopen adjoins the settlements of Seaton Burn, Brunswick Village and Hazlerigg. The village straddles the historic Great North Road, formerly the A1 trunk road, but is now bypassed by a new alignment of the A1 immediately to the west. The village lies in an area with a strong mining history and had its own colliery. Weetslade Country Park, to the east of the village, is reclaimed from an extensive area of coal mining activity. In 2012 work commenced on the building of a new housing estate by Bellway homes, called Five Mile Park. It is located to the east of the Great North Road, between Lockey Park and Weetslade Country Park. The name refers to the distance from the centre of Newcastle ‚Äì similarly there is a Three Mile Inn to the south, and a Six Mile Bridge to the north. History The village is present on an 1860s Ordnance Survey map as 'Wide Open', with the settlements of 'East Wideopen' to the east, and 'West Wideopen' to the south. The village name is nowadays written as one word in widespread use and appears on signage at either end of the village, but the alternative form of Wide Open is still occasionally found on maps and elsewhere. This leads to an inconsistency in contemporary addresses. =Wideopen Colliery= Drawing by Thomas Harrison Fair, 1844 The pit shafts for the colliery were sunk and opened by Perkins and Thackrah in 1825. The colliery produced its first coal in May 1827. The coal was transported by the Fawdon Wagonway to Scotswood. The colliery was sketched by Thomas Harrison Hair in 1844 as part of his collection. There was for many years a scrapyard on the site, but this closed in 2011 to make way for new housing. =Sacred Heart Church= To the south of the village is the 19th-century Sacred Heart RC Church, a Grade II listed building notable for its stained glass windows, which bear designs by Pre- Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown and William Morris. Other churches in Wideopen are St Columba's, the Anglican parish church,http://www.stcolumbaswideopen.co.uk/ and St John's URC church.

This allows the balloon to keep a stable altitude for long periods. This is in contrast with much more common variable-volume balloons, which are either only partially filled with lifting gas, or made with more elastic materials. Also referred to as pumpkin or Ultra Long Distance Balloons (ULDB) balloons, the sealed balloon envelopes have a pumpkin shape at flight altitude. In a variable-volume balloon, the volume of the lifting gas changes due to heating and cooling in the diurnal cycle. The cycle is magnified by a greenhouse effect inside the balloon, while the surrounding atmospheric gas is subject to a much more limited cyclical temperature change. As the lift gas heats and expands, the displacement of atmospheric gas increases, while the balloon weight remains constant. Its buoyancy increases, and this leads to a rise in altitude unless it is compensated by venting gas. Conversely, if the balloon cools and drops, it becomes necessary to release ballast. Since both ballast and gas are finite, there is a limit to how long a variable-volume balloon can compensate in order to stabilize its altitude. In contrast, a superpressure balloon will change altitude much less without compensation maneuvers. Since the volume of the balloon is more constrained, so is the volume of air displaced by it. In accordance with the Principle of Archimedes, the upwards force on the balloon is equal to the weight of the displaced ambient gas. But the weight of the atmospheric gas is reduced as the balloon rises, because its density diminishes with increasing altitude. So the force pushing the balloon upwards diminishes with altitude and at some particular altitude, the upwards force will equal the weight of the balloon. As a result, the balloon will be stable in a finite equilibrium altitude range for long periods. The disadvantage is that such balloons require much stronger materials than non-pressurized types. Applications Superpressure balloons (SPB) are typically used for extremely long duration flights of unmanned scientific experiments in the upper atmosphere, where atmospheric gas temperature is quite stable through the diurnal cycle. In 1985, such balloons were used for aerobots flying at an altitude of approximately in the atmosphere of Venus, in the international, Soviet-led Vega program. In February 1974, Colonel Thomas L. Gatch Jr, USAR attempted to make the first crossing of the Atlantic by balloon in a superpressure balloon named Light Heart. Following the loss of at least two of the ten balloons which provided lift, and after deviating substantially from the course that Colonel Gatch had plotted to take advantage of the jet stream, the last reported sighting of the Light Heart was west of the Canary Islands; no further trace of the aircraft was ever found. NASA Super Pressure Balloon Wanaka Airport, New Zealand In March 2015, NASA launched a SPB to an altitude of for 32 days from New Zealand and landed in Australia after a leak was detected. This was the first time a SPB was flown for a long duration through the day and night cycle. When fully inflated, it was the size of a football stadium. Google's Project Loon uses superpressure balloons to achieve flights of over 200 days. The SPB TRAVALB-2 surpassed previous Antarctic balloon flights by staying aloft for 149 Days, 3 hours, and 58 minutes after launch from the NASA Long Duration Balloon (LDB) site at LDB Camp, McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The operation was supported by National Science Foundation and United States Antarctic Program. After the Travalb-1 launch abort, the Travalb-2 lifted off on 29 December 2019 to test NASA balloon trajectory predictions in Antarctica and to study electron loses from Earth's radiation belts.

Bartel was perhaps most known for his 1982 hit black comedy Eating Raoul, which he wrote, starred in and directed. Bartel appeared in over 90 movies and TV episodes, including such titles as Eat My Dust (1976), Hollywood Boulevard (1976), Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), Get Crazy (1983) and Amazon Women on the Moon (1987). He frequently co-starred with friend and former Warhol girl Mary Woronov; the pair appeared in 17 films together, often as husband and wife. Bartel also directed 11 low-budget films, many of which he also acted in or wrote. He started in 1968 with the short The Secret Cinema, a paranoid delusional fantasy of self-referential cinema. He graduated to features in 1972 with the horror-comedy Private Parts. He would go on to direct such cult films as Death Race 2000 (1975), Eating Raoul (1982), Lust in the Dust (1985) and Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989). Biography Bartel was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jesse and William Bartel, who was an advertising executive.What A Character! He studied film and theatre at the University of California, Los Angeles, and spent a year on a Fulbright scholarship at the Centro Sperimentale film school in Rome, before returning to the US. He fulfilled his military service by talking his way into the Army Signal Corps Pictorial Center in Long Island City and later made films for the United States Information Agency. =Early films= Bartel's first films were made in high school, primarily abstract and animated 16mm shorts, including titles such as Cinema Experimental (1954), Non Objective Film (1956), Margaret Whiting Sings 'The Money Tree' (1956), and Camel Rock (1957). After making the 35mm short Italian-language film Progetti (1962) while attending the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, Bartel produced The Secret Cinema (1966). Shot on an extremely low budget in 35mm and with his own money, The Secret Cinema was the film that began his reputation as a new and unusual independent voice in narrative cinema. He followed it with another short he wrote and directed, Naughty Nurse (1969). He co-wrote the feature Utterly Without Redeeming Social Value (1969), also starring in the lead. He worked as an actor only in Hi, Mom! (1970) directed by Brian De Palma. Bartel's first feature as director was Private Parts (1972), a comedy horror film for MGM. It was produced by Gene Corman and Bartel was in the cast. =New World Pictures= Corman's brother Roger ran a production company, New World Pictures and hired Bartel to be second unit director on Big Bad Mama (1974), an action film. Bartel also played a small role. Roger Corman gave Bartel the job of directing Death Race 2000 (1975), a satirical action comedy starring David Carradine, Sylvester Stallone and Mary Woronov. Bartel also played a small role. The film was a huge success at the box office and quickly established itself as a cult favorite. Corman promptly offered Bartel to do a similar action film with Carradine for New World, Cannonball (1976). Bartel also worked on the script. The film is littered with cameos from people such as Joe Dante and Martin Scorsese. Bartel later said he worked for a year on Death Race 2000 for $5,000 \\"so when it was finished I desperately needed money. The only thing anybody wanted from me was another car picture, hence Cannonball. Corman had drummmed into me the idea that if Death Race had been \\"harder\\" and \\"more real\\" it would have been more popular. Like a fool, I believed him. I am not, and never have been, very much interested in cars and racing\\" so he decided to load up the film \\"cameos and character gimmicks that did interest me.\\" Bartel was in much demand from other directors at New World to play small parts in their pictures: he appeared in Eat My Dust (1976) for Ron Howard, Hollywood Boulevard (1976) for Joe Dante and Alan Arkush (quite a large role, as a director, which Bartel credited for really kicking off his acting career), Mr Billions (1977) for Jonathan Kaplan (not a New World film but Bartel met Kaplan at the company), Grand Theft Auto (1977) for Howard, Piranha (1978) for Dante, and Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979) for Arkush. Outside New World he appeared in The Hustler of Muscle Beach (1980) for Kaplan and Heartbeeps (1981) for Arkush. =Eating Raoul= Bartel wrote a script with Richard Blackburn, Eating Raoul (1982). Bartel managed to raise the finance and starred in the film along with Woronov. Made for $230,000 (raised by himself and his parents) it was a hit on the art house circuit, grossing $10 million, and became a cult movie. Bartel had small roles in White Dog (1982), directed by Sam Fuller and produced by New World alumni Jon Davison, Trick or Treats (1982), Heart Like a Wheel (1983) for Kalpan, and Get Crazy (1983) for Arkus. The success of Eating Raoul enabled Bartel to raise $3 million in finance (ten times the budget of Raoul) for a screwball comedy he had co written and wanted to direct, Not for Publication (1984). It was a box-office disaster. More successful was Lust in the Dust (1985) starring Tab Hunter and Divine. Bartel continued to be in demand as an actor, appearing in Frankenweenie (1984), a short for Tim Burton, Into the Night (1985) for John Landis, European Vacation (1985) for Amy Heckerling, and Follow That Bird (1985). Bartel directed The Longshot (1986) based on a script by Tim Conway who starred. Bartel said he was a \\"director for hire\\" on the project. \\"My sensibility was on some level antipathetic to what Tim Conway wanted. I was trying to find interesting things under the surface, and he just wanted more surface.\\" He appeared in an episode of Fame directed by Arkush, and reprised his Raoul character in Chopping Mall (1986) for Jim Wynorski produced by Julie Corman (Wynorski says Bartel and Woronov adlibbed their roles). He appeared in \\"The Jar\\", an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents directed by Burton, and the film Killer Party (1986). He directed two episodes of Amazing Stories, both from his own scripts, both featuring him as an actor: \\"Secret Cinema\\" (a remake of his short film of the same name) and \\"Gershwin's Trunk\\". He had roles in Munchies (1987) (produced by Roger Corman), Amazon Women on the Moon (1987) (in a segment directed by Dante), an episode of Crime Story, Baja Oklahoma (1988), and Shakedown (1988). Bartel co wrote but did not direct Mortuary Academy (1988); he and Woronov also played small roles. He was an executive producer on Out of the Dark (1988), in which he had a small role. He had a role in Caddyshack II (1988) directed by Arkush. Bartel directed Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989), based on a story of his. He wrote a sequel to Eating Raoul called Bland Ambition, where Paul and Mary wind up running for Governor of California. It was about 10 days from the start of filming when Vestron withdrew its financial backing. Bartel appeared in Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog (1989), Far Out Man (1990), Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) (for Dante), Dan Turner, Hollywood Detective (1990), an episode L.A. Law directed by Arkush, Liquid Dreams (1991), and Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel (1991). Bartel had a large supporting role in The Pope Must Diet (1991), directed by Peter Richardson of The Comic Strip. and was in The Living End (1992) from Gregg Araki, Soulmates (1992), and Posse (1993). A musical adaptation of Eating Raoul premiered off Broadway in 1992.Eating Raoul at the Internet Off-Broadway Database . Bartel appeared in some episodes of The Comic Strip Presents..., even directing on (\\"Demonella\\"). He was in Acting on Impulse, Tales of the City and Grief (1993). Bartel's last feature as director was Shelf Life (1993). It was based on a play and done for a low budget and struggled to find distribution. =Final years= Bartel appeared in Twin Sitters (1993), The Usual Suspects (1995), and The Jerky Boys (1995). He had a rare star role in The Wacky Adventures of Dr. Boris and Nurse Shirley (1995) but was normally seen in minor parts: Naomi & Wynonna: Love Can Build a Bridge (1995), Not Like Us (1995) for Corman's new company Concorde Pictures, A Bucket of Blood (1995) also for Concorde, Number One Fan (1995), Red Ribbon Blues (1996), Joe's Apartment (1996), Escape from L.A. (1996), and Basquiat (1996). He directed 2 episodes of Clueless, \\"We Shall Overpack\\" and \\"Cher Inc\\". He also appeared in both. He was in Prey of the Jaguar (1996), The Elevator (1996), Lewis & Clark & George (1997), Boston Common, Skeletons (1997), The Inheritance (1997), Chicago Hope, The Devil's Child (1997), Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998), More Tales of the City, Race, Vengeance Unlimited, Dreamers,Hard Time: The Premonition, episodes of Ally McBeal and Snoops directed by Arkush, Good vs Evil, Zoo (1999), Hamlet (2000), Dinner and a Movie (2001) and Perfect Fit (2001). =Personal life= Bartel was openly gay; this influenced his career choice, as he found himself more accepted and afforded more opportunities within the independent film industry than he would have in Hollywood. In 1979, he was a member of the jury at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival. =Death= Bartel died May 13, 2000, of a heart attack two weeks after liver cancer surgery; he was 61 years old. His final screen appearance was a posthumous role as \\"Dad\\" alongside Mary Woronov (\\"Mom\\") in the 2001 independent film Perfect Fit. Legacy The Belgian horror movie Calvaire paid a tribute to the late Bartel ‚Äì the mad innkeeper character is named \\"Paul Bartel\\".

The title refers to the classical elements of fire, earth, air, and water, plus the fifth element, spirit, accessible when one has balanced the other four. Plot The novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe which has fractured the United States into several nations. The protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who \\"listen and dream\\". The novel describes \\"a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.\\"Sch√∂npflug, Karin, Feminism, Economics and Utopia: Time Travelling Through Paradigms (Oxon/London: Routledge, 2008 ()), p. 22 (and perhaps see chap. 7) (author economist, Austrian Ministry of Finance, & lecturer, Univ. of Vienna) (author Sch√∂npflug named Starhawk's work as \\"The Fifth Element\\" in original but perhaps intended \\"The Fifth Sacred Thing\\", per Worldcat, as accessed Nov. 18, 2011, as no work titled The Fifth Element by Starhawk is known, per Worldcat, as accessed Nov. 18, 2011). To the south, an overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other. The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction. Setting In the utopia described in the novel, the streets have been dug up and are replaced with gardens and fruit trees. Additionally, every house is equipped with a small garden plot. The food is available to everyone and access to food is not limited by money, power, or ownership. Farms where the city's fruit and vegetables grow are hidden behind the blocks of homes. There is plenty of food and everyone is said to have more than enough to eat. The gardens are lined with streams that run throughout the city. The only remnants of the pavement that once existed are narrow paths meant for walking, cycling, or rollerblading. These paths are accented with colorful stones and mosaics. The city is depicted as a beautiful locale where everything is shared yet nothing is lacking. In this ecotopian city, food and many other resources are understood as a commons, rather than a commodity. When the city is threatened by an army marching from the South, food becomes central to the non-violent philosophy and practice of the inhabitants as they grapple with how to respond to the possibility of violent attack. The inhabitants decide to invite soldiers to leave the army and to join them living in this ecotopian city. They say to the soldiers 'there is a place set for you at our table, if you will choose to join us' (p.235). This invitation, and the possibility of never going hungry, is almost incomprehensible to the soldiers who have been stripped of their given names and reduced to numbers, survive on small amounts of poor-quality food, and many have never seen running water. Reception The novel won \\"Best Science Fiction, Fantasy or Horror Novel\\" at the 6th Lambda Literary Awards. Kirkus Reviews described the book as \\"a big, shaggy, sloppy dog of a fantasy\\" and added, \\"Starhawk deserves points for her idealism, but her vision and characterizations are only half-realized here‚Äîand further muddied as she goes on far, far too long.\\" The review from Publishers Weekly called it a \\"sometimes clumsy but compelling first novel\\" by Starhawk: \\"[she] delivers her message with a heavy hand and several cliches: her besieged utopia echoes the liberal politics and ecofeminism of her nonfiction; her dystopia features the overused SF bugbear of Christian fanaticism. However, she creates memorable characters‚Äîa young midwife, a broken musician, an old Witch-Woman‚Äîand skillfully conveys their emotions in gripping, sometimes harrowing scenes set against vivid backdrops.\\" Prequel and sequel A prequel, Walking to Mercury (), was released in 1997.

He is now a commentator on cycling events, working most notably for the BBC and ITV. Personal life Porter was born and raised in Wolverhampton and educated at the city's St Peter's Collegiate School. His father, Joe, was a cyclist and at 10, Hugh was taken to the Halesowen Velodrome to watch British sprint world champion Reg Harris. He is married to British Olympic swimming gold medallist, Anita Lonsbrough; they met while travelling to Tokyo for the 1964 Summer Olympics and married in 1965. Cycling career =Junior career= Aged 16, Porter began racing as a junior for Wolverhampton Wheelers cycling club, finishing third in his first road race. He also became a regular competitor in weekly track league meetings at Wolverhampton‚Äôs Aldersley Stadium cycle track. =Senior competition= As a senior, he won his first race in July 1958 and by the end of the season another victory and other high placings led to a first-category licence for the 1959 season. First was the highest of three classes dependent on racing successes. Six victories came that season on the road, along with a gold medal on the track as part of his club's team pursuit squad at the national track championships at the Fallowfield Stadium, Manchester. He also won the Midlands title in the individual pursuit, but remained focused on developing as a road racer. In the early 1960s he represented Great Britain in the Tour of Czechoslovakia in 1961 (26th overall) and in the Tour of Ireland. He also finished second that year in the season-long Star Trophy points competition assessed by results in set races through a season, and 17th in his first ride in the Tour of Britain. A year later he was 20th in the same event, and earned selection for the 1962 world championships in Italy to ride both the road race and team time trial events. However, over-exertion in the time trial led to a poor performance in the road race. =First national track title= Porter still dabbled in track racing and in 1963 performed well in the individual pursuit at Aldersley Stadium's Easter international meeting, before winning the final 10-mile scratch race. Encouraged, Porter began to consider contesting the national individual pursuit championship. In the meantime, he also raced in the national 25-mile individual time trial championship in Gloucestershire, finishing second. The individual pursuit championship was decided at Fallowfield Stadium; Porter was the fastest qualifier and, although headed in the early stages of the final, soon eased into the lead to beat Harry Jackson and win his first individual national title. Porter then travelled to the Rocourt velodrome, near Li√®ge in Belgium, for the 1963 world championship, where he reached the semi-final, to be pipped by 0.18 seconds by Belgian Jean Walschaerts for a place in the final. He won the third-place ride-off to take a bronze medal. =Olympic disappointment= 1964 was dominated by thoughts of the Olympic Games in Tokyo where Porter was already selected to ride the pursuit, though he still defended his British championship, emerging victorious at Herne Hill and shaving almost a second off the championship record. He also tested himself in the national 10-mile time-trial championship, finishing second, and was a member of the Wolverhampton Wheelers squad which won the national team pursuit title. However, while Porter qualified fifth fastest in Tokyo, he was suffering from a cold and was eliminated at the quarter-final stage, and went home without a medal, but he did meet his future wife, fellow Olympian and swimmer Anita Lonsbrough whom he married in Huddersfield on 17 June 1965. While Porter retained his British individual pursuit title and won several road races, 1965 was otherwise not memorable. He was defeated in the quarter-finals of the world pursuit championship in Spain (a timetable change meant he almost missed the contest, and, without his normal pre-race routine, he was narrowly defeated by Colombian Martin Rodriguez in the fastest race of the event). =Commonwealth champion= However, 1966 proved more successful. Porter began with 12 successive road race victories, and won a pursuit match in the Good Friday meeting at Herne Hill. He then rode the Tour of Britain, winning one stage, finishing second on three other stages, taking ninth place overall and second place in the points classification. His road victories assured him of victory in the season-long Star Trophy series. Without any further track races, he travelled to Jamaica for the 1966 Commonwealth Games, where he set a games record in qualifying for the semi-final of the individual pursuit, and then beat Australian Jan Bylsma in the final to take the gold medal. =First professional steps= Hugh Porter at the 1967 World Championships In early 1967 Porter turned professional, riding for the Condor Mackeson team. The step up to the professional ranks meant that in the individual pursuit he was now racing 5,000m instead of 4,000m, but in his first test at the distance, he emerged victorious, beating Dave Bonner to win the professional title in Leicester. Porter was then selected to race in the world professional pursuit event in Amsterdam. Porter qualified for the final, but, unsettled by a puncture to his opponent, Tiemen Groen, that forced a re-run, he was beaten by two seconds. Nonetheless, his silver medal led to contracts from track promoters, including an invitation to ride the London six-day race ‚Äì his first. He crashed on the fourth day, breaking his collar bone, and missed contracts for other six-day races. However, he recovered and spent much of the winter track-racing in Belgium, finishing the Antwerp six-day before returning to England for the start of the 1968 road season. =Professional success= Porter began 1968 with a time-trial stage victory and second place overall in a three-day race in Bournemouth, plus two stage wins and sixth overall in the Tour of the West. He was then selected for the British team to ride the Tour de France. Having retained his British pursuit title, he was expected to do well in the prologue time trial ‚Äì and finished seventh of 120 starters. However, an injury returned and he abandoned on the third stage ‚Äì a retirement that allowed him to concentrate on the world championship in Rome in late August. He was the fastest qualifier, and recorded his fastest time of the championship in the quarter final, beating Siegfried Adler, then holder of the world professional indoor hour record. In the final, Porter faced Ole Ritter, later holder of the outdoor hour record, of Denmark and beat him by eight seconds to win his first world title, an achievement that merited the Bidlake Memorial Prize for 1968. The following year Porter again qualified for the final of the individual pursuit at the Worlds in Antwerp, however he was defeated by Ferdinand Bracke, who started the final quickly and caught Porter within a dozen laps. Porter regained his title in 1970 on home soil when the Worlds were held at Saffron Lane sports centre in Leicester, setting the fastest time in qualifying by seven seconds and beating Lorenzo Bosisio in the final by eleven seconds. At the 1971 Worlds in Varese, Porter finished third, prompting rival Dirk Baert to claim: \\"Porter is finished, he is an old man\\". However Porter rebounded the following year to take his third individual pursuit title at the Worlds in Marseille, defeating Bracke, despite Bracke holding a two and a half second lead by lap seven. Porter described this as his \\"most cherished\\" world championship: \\"I beat Bracke, the rider I had the most respect for... He held the Hour record, finished third in the Tour de France and won the Vuelta. He was some rider\\". In 1973 Porter took his fourth world title in San Sebastian, qualifying fastest and catching Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez in the quarter-finals (gaining revenge for the 1965 Amateur World Championships, also in San Sebastian, where Porter had also qualified fastest but had been knocked out by Rodr√≠guez in the next round) before beating Mogens Frey in the semis and defeating Ren√© Pijnen by ten seconds in the final after trailing him with seven laps remaining. Commentary work Porter is a TV commentator and public-address commentator at events. He started his broadcasting career at Radio Birmingham. He has often worked for BBC Sport and ITV Sport and has voiced the Olympic and Commonwealth Games (track and road), World Championships (track and road) and World Cup track meetings. He commentated on cycling at every Olympics from the 1984 Games in Los Angeles to the 2012 Games in London. He commentated on the 2009 Tour of Britain for ITV4, while also public-address commentator. Porter kept referring to the 'stage announcer', which was himself. Porter is a regular at Manchester and Newport velodromes. He is the voice of the Revolution series at Manchester.

He was the editor of The New Republic from 1997 to 1999. During his tenure as editor, Lane oversaw, in large part, the work of Stephen Glass, a staff reporter who fabricated significant portions or all of some 41 articles, in one of the worst journalistic fabrication scandals of contemporary American journalism. After the New Republic, Lane went to work for the Post, where, from 2000 to 2009, he covered the Supreme Court of the United States and issues related to the criminal justice system and judicial matters. He has since joined the newspaper's editorial page, where he currently works. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Early life and education Born to a Jewish family in 1961, Lane went to Bethesda- Chevy Chase High School, where he was managing editor of the school newspaper, The Tattler. He earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1983. As a Knight Fellow, he earned a Master of Studies in Law from Yale Law School in 1997. Career Lane is a former foreign correspondent for Newsweek and served as the magazine's Berlin bureau chief. For his coverage in Newsweek of the former Yugoslavia, Lane earned a Citation of Excellence from the Overseas Press Club.\\"That same reporting about the former Yugoslavia was also featured in the book Crimes of War: What the Public Should Know, edited by Roy Gutman and David Rieff. The New Republic's owner, Marty Peretz, appointed Lane as editor in 1997 after firing then-editor Michael Kelly. Kelly had published a series of articles that Peretz felt were too critical of President Bill Clinton and his Vice President, Al Gore. Gore had been a student of Peretz's at Harvard, and the two men remained close friends afterwards. Peretz was reported to be upset that Kelly often ignored his demands to write more pro- Gore articles and editorials in the magazine, especially as Gore was embarking on a presidential run of his own, as Clinton's second term was about to end. In 1998, one of the worst journalistic scandals in contemporary American history arose at The New Republic when fabricated reporting by a staff writer, Stephen Glass, was discovered. Lane fired Glass. Peretz, in turn fired Lane, complaining that Lane should have discovered the Glass' fraud earlier. Peretz replaced Lane with Peter Beinart. Lane reportedly learned of his firing from the media before he heard about it from Peretz. The Glass fabrications constituted \\"the greatest scandal in the magazine's history and marked a decade of waning influence and mounting financial losses,\\" the New York Times would later report. Explaining why it took so long to catch Glass' fraud, Peretz blamed both Kelly and Lane, who had supervised and edited Glass, for not catching the fraud earlier. Lane, Peretz claimed, ignored obvious warning signs of the fabrication, and then attempted to unfairly lay the blame to his predecessor, Kelly. Peretz angrily said that Lane's alleged inaction \\"sullied the good name of the New Republic. Peretz subsequently fired Lane.\\" According to an account in the American Prospect, \\"Lane got the news [of his firing] from a Washington Post reporter who called to inquire about his future plans.\\" After his firing as editor of the New Republic, Lane became an editorial writer for the Washington Post. Later, Lane covered the Supreme Court for the Post, before then rejoining the Post's editorial board in 2007. During his second stint on the newspaper's editorial board, Lane wrote primarily about fiscal and economic policy Lane has also taught journalism part-time at Georgetown University in Washington, DC and at Princeton University. In 2008 Lane published The Day Freedom Died: The Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court, and the Betrayal of Reconstruction, about the Colfax massacre of 1873 in Louisiana of blacks by white militia, including the murder of surrendered prisoners. He explored its political repercussions during Reconstruction, including the resulting Supreme Court case from United States prosecution of perpetrators, United States v. Cruikshank (1876). The Court ruled that actions of individuals were not covered by constitutional protections and suggested that individuals should seek relief in state courts. But during Reconstruction and for many decades after, rarely was anyone prosecuted, and no one ever convicted, when white men committed offenses against blacks. In 2009, in an article appearing in the Post entitled \\"Medical Marijuana Is An Insult to Our Intelligence,\\" Lane belittled a woman named Angel Raich, who was a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case claiming a right to medical marijuana. Lane wrote of Raich that she \\"might consider a consultation for hypochondria, or perhaps marijuana dependency.\\" The Post subsequently had to print a correction and clarification to the article which disclosed that Raich was \\"about to undergo an operation to repair her Schwannoma, which is a benign brain tumor.\\" It was also later disclosed that, at the time of Lane's comments, Raich had been facing a \\"highly risky surgery ‚Äì surgery that her doctors had originally ruled out because it is too dangerous ‚Äî because her brain tumor has now become life- threatening.\\" The Post came under further criticism, when in an attempt to cover up Lane's original comments, which many of the Post's readers found to be inappropriate or offensive, editors of Lane's at the Post scrubbed Lane's remarks\\" from the website, so that some readers would never know that they had ever been written in the first place. In 2010, Lane was again the subject of criticism for disparaging comments he made about overweight or obese people in a blog post in the Post he attempted to discredit an Agriculture Department study which concluded that millions of Americans faced hunger or \\"food insecurity.\\" In the blog post, Lane wrote: \\"Adults are asked if they ever lost weight due to a lack of food money -- but not how much weight, or what they weighed before. In theory, a 300-pound man who lost a pound could count as 'food insecure.'\\" Lane wrote that \\"it is a tribute to the abundance of the United States, and to the safety net, public and private,\\" that more Americans were not \\"food insecure.\\" or didn't have enough to eat. In 2011, Lane wrote that he hoped that Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was unable to speak as a result of having been shot in the head a few weeks earlier, would speak out against union workers in Wisconsin if she \\"could speak normally\\". Lane's statement was criticized by some as exploitative and insensitive. Stephen Bennen commented in the Washington Monthly: \\"Keep in mind, Charles Lane isn‚Äôt some Fox News personality. I‚Äôve seen him publish a variety of worthwhile commentaries in recent years. But reading this, I can‚Äôt imagine what he was thinking.\\" Popular culture The 1998 journalism scandal at The New Republic was portrayed in the 2003 film Shattered Glass. Lane was portrayed by actor Peter Sarsgaard. Lane appears on the commentary on the DVD, alongside writer/director Billy Ray. Glass published a \\"biographical novel\\" entitled The Fabulist (2003) about his career of journalistic fabrication. \\"Robert Underwood\\" was a major character in the \\"novel\\" and taken as a fictionalized version of Charles Lane. Reviewing the book for the Washington Post, Chris Lehman wrote that the Underwood character \\"is meant to induce in- the-know readers to think poorly of Charles Lane.\\" Personal life Lane is married to a German immigrant from the former East Berlin. They have three children.

History =World Championship Wrestling (1995‚Äì2000)= The Blue Bloods were formed in 1995 in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) by Regal after he split with his manager, Sir William and became a tag team wrestler. Originally, Regal scouted Jean-Paul Levesque and was slated to be a tag team, before Levesque left to join the WWF. Eventually, Regal recruited Alabama-born Bobby Eaton, getting him (kayfabe) \\"knighted\\" to rename him \\"Earl Robert Eaton\\" and taking it upon himself to teach Eaton the finer points of the British lifestyle; including the Queen's English and proper dining etiquette. The team feuded with Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) and the team of Bunkhouse Buck and Dick Slater over the WCW World Tag Team Championship but never got their hands on the titles. Later they were joined by \\"Squire\\" David Taylor and a butler named Jeeves, whom they openly abused. Eaton eventually left the group, leaving Taylor and Regal to feud with him. Taylor and Regal continued to team together until Regal was released from WCW in February 1998, at which point Taylor went on to compete in the singles division. When Regal returned to WCW in July 1999, Regal and Taylor would reform the Blue Bloods in August. They would compete primarily on WCW Saturday Night, until the team disappeared from television in January 2000. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2006‚Äì2007)= In 2006, Regal (with his ring name changed to William) and Taylor reunited as a tag team on the SmackDown brand of World Wrestling Entertainment, however they used no parts of their previous \\"Blue Bloods\\" gimmick, instead becoming sadistic fighters, willing to go to just about any lengths for a win.

Paper bags are commonly used as shopping bags, packaging, and sacks. History In 1852, Francis Wolle, a schoolteacher, invented the first machine to mass-produce paper bags. Wolle and his brother patented the machine and founded the Union Paper Bag Company. In 1871, inventor Margaret E. Knight designed a machine that could create flat-bottomed paper bags, which could carry more than the previous envelope-style design. In 1883, Charles Stilwell patented a machine that made square-bottom paper bags with pleated sides, making them easier to fold and store. This style of bag came to be known as the S.O.S., or \\"Self-Opening Sack\\".MoMA  Margaret E. Knight and Charles B. Stilwell. Flat-Bottomed Paper Bag. 1870s-1880s In 1912, Walter Deubener, a grocer in Saint Paul, Minnesota, used cord to reinforce paper bags and add carrying handles. These \\"Deubener Shopping Bags\\" could carry up to 75 pounds at a time, and became quite popular, selling over a million bags a year by 1915. Paper bags with handles later became the standard for department stores, and were often printed with the store's logo or brand colors. Plastic bags were introduced in the 1970s, and thanks to their lower cost, eventually replaced paper bags as the bag of choice for grocery stores. With the trend towards phasing out lightweight plastic bags, though, some grocers and shoppers have switched back to paper bags. In 2015, the world's largest paper shopping bag was made in the UK and recorded by Guinness World Records. Production Standard brown paper bags are made from kraft paper. Tote-style paper bags, such as those often used by department stores or as gift bags, can be made from any kind of paper, and come in any color. Paper bags can be made from recycled paper, with some local laws requiring bags to have a minimum percentage of post-consumer recycled content. Single layer Two small paper bags ‚Äì bottom: flat gusseted bag top: square bottom, self-opening Paper shopping bags, brown paper bags, grocery bags, paper bread bags and other light duty bags have a single layer of paper. A variety of constructions and designs are available. Many are printed with the names of stores and brands. Paper bags are not waterproof. Types of paper bag are: laminated, twisted, flat tap. The laminated bag, whilst not totally waterproof, has a laminate that protects the outside to some degree. Multiwall paper sacks A multiwall bag of dog food Valve bag containing cement Multiwall (or multi- wall) paper sacks or shipping sacks are often used as shipping containers for bulk materials such as fertilizer, animal feed, sand, dry chemicals, flour and cement. Many have several layers of sack papers, printed external layer and inner plies. Some paper sacks have a plastic film, foil, or polyethylene coated paper layer in between as a water-repellant, insect resistant, or rodent barrier. There are two basic designs of bags: open mouth bags and valve bags. An open mouth bag is a tube of paper plies with the bottom end sealed. The bag is filled through the open mouth and then closed by stitching, adhesive, or tape. Valve sacks have both ends closed and are filled through a valve. A typical example of a valve bag is the cement sack. Recycling Paper bags are readily recyclable. Plastic or water-resistant coatings or layers make recycling more difficult.R. McKinney: Technology of Paper Recycling, 1995, p. 351. Paper bag recycling is done through the re-pulping of the paper recycling and pressing into the required shapes. Brown bag While brown is the color of the most common type of paper bag, this pair of words connotes more than just the color. The verb form of brown bag, depending on content, may be an act of civil disobedience (and illegal) or an action by \\"60 million American brown baggers\\" whom a marketing research study's review by the New York Times described as \\"upscale.\\" The former refers to lack of a liquor license, whereas the latter are for \\"particularly those on vegetarian, low-salt, low-cholesterol or kosher diets.\\" The noun form of the term included in the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 1950 refers to use of a paper bag instead of a lunch box. William Safire traces this to an article in Time magazine. When the content is solid food, it may be preserved or enhanced before being consumed because \\"a substantial minority of brown baggers have access to microwave ovens or refrigerators.\\" =Anti-brown-bag law= The words \\"Brown- bagging is the genteel disguise ... by a patron to furnish his own liquor when he dines at the local restaurant\\" were published in 1967. To prevent individuals (or groups) from bringing alcoholic beverages into food establishments that lack a liquor license, in 1985 the New York State Liquor Authority pushed for legislation that New York City's Mayor Ed Koch denounced, months after being \\"arrested\\" for this. The New York Times noted that some call the bill \\"the anti-brown-bag law.\\" =Brown Bag Report= The advertising agent who, prior to the Marlboro Man, developed ads for the product as a filtered \\"feminine brand\\"\\"Burnett repositioned Marlboro cigarettes from a feminine brand to one that shouted masculinity\\" in 1981 developed \\"The Brown- Bag Report\\" with funding from Swift, Carnation, General Mills and American Can. =Symbolism= While in the United States the lunch box or lunch pail has been used as a symbol of the working class, Safire wrote: \\"In the metaphor of the modern worker, the brown bag has replaced the lunch pail.\\" About a third of the brown baggers are schoolchildren.

Publishing history This novel was re- published under its original title by WARNER PAPERBACK LIBRARY EDITION on January, 1973. Summary An Idaho railroad project tunnels through Mount Rainod (a black basalt \\"Glass Mountain\\"). A green mist column appears electrocuting men. An elderly Pawnee scares workers with tales of a rain god in the mountain. Benson is asked to investigate and get the project back on track. Josh, prominent in the action, acts as camp cook and is remarkably heroic throughout. Rrevived by Benson after being electrocuted, Josh is left realistically thoughtful; he describes death as like being unconscious. Mac, also shocked, is saved by heavy rubber soles. The villain impersonates Benson and commits murder. Tampering with project surveys occurs. Nellie Gray's rather minor role imperils her more than usual. Both Benson and one of the gang pose as the elderly Pawnee‚Äîat one point the story has three old Indians. The villain learned that the mountain is hollow; he can build a tunnel at a fraction of the projected cost, pocketing the difference. The tunnel is flooded deliberately from an underground stream to stop work and kill Benson and his team; typically, this planned death trap destroys the criminals.

In 2014, Hess completed a multi-year transformation to an exploration and production company by exiting all downstream operations, generating approximately $13 billion from assets sales beginning in 2013. Hess sold its gas station network to Marathon Petroleum (which operates under the retail brand Speedway); sold its wholesale and retail oil, natural gas and electricity marketing business to Direct Energy; closed its refineries in Port Reading NJ and St. Croix USVI (Hovensa JV with PDVSA); sold its bulk storage and terminalling business mostly to Buckeye Partners; and sold its 50% interests in two New Jersey power plants to their respective JV partners (Bayonne Energy Center: ArcLight Capital and Newark Energy Center: Ares EIF). Hess also sold its 50% interest in its JV commodities trading arm HETCO (Hess Energy Trading Company) to Oaktree Capital. HETCO is now known as Hartree Partners. The company has exploration and production operations on-shore: United States (North Dakota) and Libya and off-shore: United States (Gulf of Mexico), Canada, South America (Guyana & Suriname), Denmark and Southeast Asia (Malaysia and the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand). History In 1919, British oil entrepreneur Lord Cowdray formed Amerada Corporation to explore for oil in North America. The firm was incorporated February 7, 1920, in Delaware as a holding company for its principal subsidiary, the Amerada Petroleum Corporation. The oil producer experienced growth during most of the 1920s, hitting a peak in 1926 with a net income of US$4.9 million. However, in the years leading to the Great Depression, weakness in the oil markets contributed to sluggish profits. The aftermath of the market crash aggravated the unsteady oil industry. In the first quarter of 1930, the company experienced a minor loss. The early years of the Depression were a struggle against wavering demand and overproduction in some regions. Later into the 1930s, the financial forecast became more sanguine for Amerada. In December 1941, the company reorganized by merging the holding company with the principal operating subsidiary, Amerada Petroleum Corporation, into a simplified operating company. The new entity also adopted the former subsidiary's name. Robust postwar growth rocketed the company past US$100 million in sales in 1955. Hess Oil and Chemical, an oil refiner and marketer founded by Leon Hess, acquired 10% of the company for US$100 million in 1966 after the British government sold a stake it had amassed during World War II. Albert Levinson became the senior vice president and designed the Hess logo. Hess and Amerada would announce plans for a merger in December 1968. Some Amerada stockholders led by Morton Adler criticized the arrangement as being too favorable for Hess. Adler argued Amerada's oil reserves would contribute the lion's share of assets for the proposed company, so Amerada stockholders should retain more control of the new company. Before the stockholder vote on the matter, Phillips Petroleum, an integrated oil firm, approached Amerada with its own merger proposal, but the offer was declined in March. Still interested, Phillips nonetheless stated it would not carry out a proxy fight against the proposed Hess deal. Hess, fearing such a strategy, made a cash tender offer of US$140 million for an additional 1.1 million shares of Amerada, which would double its holding in the company. The new shares would be employed in a May stockholder vote deciding the merger's fate. The vote took place amidst shareholder rancor that in addition to echoing Adler's arguments, objected to Amerada's financing of the recently completed tender offer. Hess planned to cancel the shares and the cost of the acquisition would be absorbed by the newly formed company. One shareholder at the meeting quipped, \\"It looks to me as if Hess is buying Amerada with Amerada's money.\\" Proponents of the deal won, and the US$2.4 billion merger combining a purely production company with a refinery and marketer operation was completed.Benedict, Roger W. (May 16, 1969). \\"Merger of Amerada Petroleum, Hess Oil, Valued at $2.4 Billion, Voted by Holders\\". The Wall Street Journal, pg 4. However controversy was not yet extinguished by the stockholder confirmation. A class action federal lawsuit in 1972 claiming the proxy vote information was misleading. In 1976, a court agreed that the company falsely claimed to have considered each company's assets as a reason for the merger.\\"Court Rules Amerada's Holders Were Misled In Merger With Hess\\" (August 2, 1976). The Wall Street Journal, p. 4. A former Hess Station in Rensselaer County, New York In February 2000, Hess acquired the 51% shares of the Meadville Corporation it didn't already own, and rebranded all 178 Merit gas stations as Hess. The Merit gas station chain were primarily in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia markets. In 2001, Amerada Hess purchased Triton Energy Limited in a cash tender deal valued at approximately US$3.2 billion. Triton, one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the U.S., had earned a reputation as a maverick oil company due to its highly successful yet potentially risky overseas exploration. According to Amerada Hess press releases at the time, Triton's major oil and gas assets in West Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia would strengthen its exploration and production business and give it access to long life international reserves. Hess also stated that the purchase was expected to immediately increase the company's per-day barrel output by more than 25 percent. Also in 2001, Amerada Hess entered into a joint venture with A.T. Williams Oil Co. of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The company and its gas stations were called WilcoHess. Eventually, there were 1200 WilcoHess stations. Following on the heels of the Triton purchase, energy prices fell and global economies weakened. Amerada Hess struggled through the following years, posting a US$218 million loss in 2002 due primarily to a US$530 million charge relating to its write-down of the Ceiba oil field, but then posting steadily increasing profits from 2003 through 2006, when the company posted US$1.920 billion in net income. In May 2006, Amerada Hess Corp. changed its name to Hess Corp. On January 18, 2012 the company announced that it would close the Hovensa refinery in St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands by mid-February 2012. The refinery will then serve as a storage terminal. Hess permanently closed its Port Reading, New Jersey petroleum refinery by the end of February 2013: Gas prices had risen to their highest levels since October 2012 and Hess said it will lay off 170 of 217 employees at the plant, exit the refinery business and seek a buyer for its 19 storage terminals. It will focus on exploration and production.

On March 4, 2013 Hess announced that it would sell its domestic refineries and retail operations. The New York Times also reported that Hess retail and refinery operations contributed about 4 percent of the company's revenue. It also noted that Hess will sell its holdings in Indonesia and Thailand.De La Merced, Michael J. New York Times. \\"Hess to Sell Gas Stations as Part of a Shift in Strategy.\\" March 4, 2013. Retrieved March 6, 2013. The company will focus exclusively on oil production, following a recent trend in the oil industry for companies to spin off their downstream assets and focus on their more profitable upstream business; ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil have also made similar spinoffs in recent years with Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum, respectively. In April 2013, Hess Corp announced it would be selling its Russian unit to Lukoil for $2.05 billion. In July 2013, Hess Corp said it would sell its energy marketing unit to UK firm Centrica for around $1.03 billion. Hess Corp announced in October 2013 that it was planning on selling its East Coast and St.Lucia storage terminal network to Buckeye Partners LP for $850 million. Hess Corp announced in December 2013 that it is selling its Indonesian assets to an Indonesian petroleum consortium. On January 8, 2014, Hess filed for a tax-free spin-off of its gas station network. The newly formed company was to be known as Hess Retail and would include over 1,200 stores throughout the Eastern United States. Before completing the spin-off, Marathon Petroleum subsidiary Speedway LLC announced on May 22, 2014 that it would acquire the retail unit of Hess Corp for $2.87 billion. Following the closure of the acquisition in late 2014, all Hess gas stations were rebranded as Speedway gas stations by the end of 2017. The transaction completed the transformation of Hess into an energy company focused solely on exploration and production, effectively reversing the Amerada merger almost 50 years prior. Environmental record The New York Times reported on October 28, 1990, that a barge with a load of of kerosene struck a reef in the Hudson River, spilling of fuel. Immediately, Hess assumed responsibility for the cleanup; the Coast Guard worked alongside the Red Star company to clean and to contain the spill to one area. Coast Guard official Mr. Holmes said \\"The weather and wind conditions are almost as close to perfect as they could get,\\" and this contributed to a quicker and surer cleanup than could otherwise be. According to The New York Times, Mr. Holmes also said that 70 percent of the spill would be gone in three days due to the natural evaporation rate of kerosene. Even though most kerosene evaporates, toxic chemicals such as benzene stay in the water and harm certain fish. Hess claims that their corporate policy has \\"long stressed\\" their \\"fundamental commitment to comply with applicable environment, health and safety laws and regulations,\\" and they claim to clean every spill made.Hess Corporation: 2006 In accordance with a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) agreement the Hess Corporation will pay $1.1 million in fines and also \\"bring 65 gasoline stations and oil storage facilities into compliance with state requirements.\\" The agreement addresses more than 100 violations at 65 gas stations and Hess's Brooklyn major oil storage facility. The agreement is aimed at resolving Hess's violations in the DEC's New York City and lower Hudson Valley regions. In a recent water contamination case against several major US oil companies, the Hess Corporation will pay part of a $422 million settlement. The case was filed by 153 public water providers in 17 states against the oil companies \\"over drinking water contamination caused by the gasoline additive Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE).\\" The settlement also stipulates that the settling parties pay their share of treatment costs of the plaintiff's wells that may become contaminated or require treatment for the next 30 years. In regard to greenhouse gas emissions, Hess outlined in their 2006 Corporate Sustainability Report a \\"four element\\" strategy to reduce and control emissions. The strategy's steps include monitoring, measuring, managing, and mitigating. Through reporting results, energy efficiency and recovery, and carbon capture and trading the company intends to improve its environmental impact.\\"2006 Corporate Sustainability Report\\" Accessed May 12, 2008 Locations Prior to the March 4, 2013 announcement of its withdrawal from refining and retail sales of petroleum products, Hess operated gas stations in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Indonesia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. In May 2014, Speedway LLC, a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Company, announced they would purchase Hess Corporation's retail business for $2.6 billion. Hess had 1,342 locations along the Eastern United States. The conversion from Hess branding to Speedway branding took place over the course of 2015. Hess locations still remain in select states as of 2018, including Connecticut.  See also  * Alaska v.

Together they held the WCW World Tag Team Championship and were voted the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Tag Team of the Year in 1991. History The Enforcers (named for Anderson's nom du guerre in The Four Horsemen) were formed when Arn Anderson and Larry Zbyszko started teaming in the summer of 1991 in WCW. Scott Steiner was injured in June and the WCW World Tag Team Championship had become vacant because the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick Steiner) were not able to defend the title within the 30-day window. The Enforcers were entered into the tournament for the titles and made it to the finals against Rick Steiner and Bill Kazmaier at Clash of the Champions XVI: Fall Brawl on September 5, 1991. The Enforcers were known for their dirty tactics and did not fail to deliver upon that at the Clash. They attacked Kazmaier with one of his weights during a power lifting demonstration at the beginning of the Clash. When the match came, they took advantage of his injured ribs and won the titles. They then began a feud with Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes and broke Windham's hand in an out of ring attack before Halloween Havoc started on October 27, 1991. Windham and Rhodes had just arrived for an interview in Windham's car and the Enforcers slammed his hand in his car door as he was getting out of the vehicle. This injury came just before they were supposed to get their title match against the Enforcers at Clash of the Champions XVII on November 19, 1991. Nobody knew who Rhodes would get for a partner until just before the match when the returning Ricky Steamboat came out. The Enforcers lost the titles to them at the Clash. After this Clash, The Dangerous Alliance was formed, with Anderson and Zbyszko as members. New manager Paul E. Dangerously paired Anderson with Bobby Eaton, ending the Enforcers' run as a tag team, before teaming up one last time for New Japan Pro Wrestling's January 4 Dome Show in 1992, defeating the team of Shiro Koshinaka and Michiyoshi Ohara.

Sherwood, won futures tournaments in Wrexham and Edinburgh, and also reached the semi-final in Mulhouse and the final in Plaisir, France. By 2003, Sherwood had acquired a reputation for a lackadaisical attitude, a party loving life style and negatively influencing younger players. While at a Jamaica Futures event in November 2003, Sherwood delivered an on-court barrage at his Lawn Tennis Association coach. Back in the UK, he missed a training session claiming he was ill, despite living five minutes away from the LTA's headquarters with an on-site doctor. Next day, the LTA's team manager Mark Petchey expelled him from the LTA. With the support of his parents, Sherwood put his tennis career back on track. By November 2004, Mark Petchey was funding his coaching throughout the winter. In March 2005 Sherwood played doubles with Andy Murray in their joint Davis Cup debuts for the Europe/Africa Zone Group I match against Israel. Surprisingly, Sherwood/Murray beat the World No 4 doubles team of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram, to help Great Britain win 3-2. He entered the singles at Wimbledon in 2005, and defeated Ricardo Mello in the first round before losing to Feliciano L√≥pez. In September 2005, at the World Group Play- off against Switzerland, Sherwood was beaten in the first singles dead rubber, with Great Britain losing 5-0. Since retiring from playing in 2008, Sherwood became a nationally recognised Lawn Tennis Association coach, coaching top performance players in the country.

The paper began in the 19th century as the Leicester Daily Mercury and later changed to its present title.British Library catalogue Early history The paper was founded by James Thompson, already proprietor of the Leicester Chronicle which he had merged with the Leicestershire Mercury ten years earlier. The Leicester Daily Mercury would be an evening paper, the first to be published in Leicester, and give extra support to the Liberal Party in the forthcoming general election. The first issue was published on 31 January 1874 from the paper's offices at 3 St Martin's, consisting of four pages of five columns each. The paper had a staff of 25 and a circulation of 5000. Recent history Along with the rest of Britain's regional daily press, the Leicester Mercury has struggled in circulation terms over the past two decades. The paper had an average circulation of 69,069 per day in the first half of 2008, down from 73,634 per day the previous year. This represents a year-on-year decline of some 5.7% and a drop of 47% when compared with a sale of 139,357 copies in the equivalent audit period for 1989. The newspaper is the sixth largest-selling regional title in England. In 2001, after a re-design and relaunch, it was named Regional Newspaper of the Year. In 2006 the paper attempted to reduce costs by ceasing publication of its localised weekday editions for Loughborough, Hinckley, North West Leicestershire, Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough. They have been replaced with two general editions, covering the east and west of Leicestershire respectively. There are however still two editions published daily to cover the city of Leicester itself. The Mercury has retained its reporting staff in each of the market towns, despite substantial editorial staff cuts in other areas - achieved through non- replacement of departing staff. The company also closed its Sports Mercury edition due to declining readership, and the fact ABC rules no longer permitted the paper to include the sport paper's sales within the circulation figure for the main daily editions. In addition, the paper relaunched its Sporting Blue sports newspaper with t√™te-b√™che binding to cover the city's two major sports teams; Leicester City and Leicester Tigers. From January 2010 to September 2011 the paper also championed its own youth paper: The Leicester WAVE which appeared as a supplement on the last Wednesday of every month. Its content was entirely written by people under the age of 25, often taking unique angles on some of the Mercury's hard hitting stories by illustrating how they would affect young people. During 2011 it was edited by Sam Newton. Since June 2016 the paper has been edited by George Oliver, who took over the editorship following the resignation of Kevin Booth for personal reasons earlier in the year. The newspaper's headquarters underwent a complete external transformation, at a reported cost of ¬£12.5m, and has now reopened to the general public. The new-look building is in keeping with the city's plans for an \\"office core\\" close to the Mercury's head office. However, in April 2009, some of the back-end production work was moved to a hub in Nottingham which also carries out work for the Nottingham Post and the Derby Telegraph. However, about 60 journalists remain in the main Leicester office. In 2016 it was reported that Trinity Mirror had put the third floor of the paper's iconic building up for let and that consequently in 2017 all of the papers journalists would be moved to a new office. All of the newspaper's reporters remain in Leicester or other Leicestershire towns, as do the sports writers, photographers and feature writers, along with the proofing function. The offices were moved to New Walk from Mercury Place in March 2017.https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2017/news/regional-daily-set-to-move- into-new-city-centre-office/ In December 2006, it was reported that 79% of the Mercury's workforce had voted in favour of National Union of Journalists recognition, the paper being only the second Northcliffe Newspapers chapel to win union representation. In 2012, Local World acquired Northcliffe Media from Daily Mail and General Trust. It was sold again in 2015 to Trinity Mirror. = Editors = James Thompson 1874 -1877 Francis Hewitt 1877-1882 Harry Hackett 1882-1923 Vernon Hewitt 1923 - John Fortune 1952-1974 Neville Stack 1974-1987 Alex Leys 1987-1993 Nick Carter 1993-2009 Keith Perch 2009-2011 Richard Bettsworth 2011-2014 Kevin Booth 2014 -2016 George Oliver 2016 - References External links * Leicester Mercury Website Category:Companies based in Leicester Category:Newspapers published in Leicestershire Category:Northcliffe Media Category:Daily newspapers published in the United Kingdom ","title":"Leicester Mercury"},{"id":"2086716","text":"Tully Cameron Banta-Cain (born August 28, 1980) is a former American football linebacker. He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the seventh round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at California. Banta-Cain earned two Super Bowl rings during his first stint with the Patriots. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers. Early years Tully Banta-Cain is of African-American and Scottish/Irish descent. He is the cousin of former NBA forward Rodney Rogers and former MLB outfielder Jeffrey Leonard. While attending Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, California, Banta-Cain won All- League honors playing outside linebacker as a senior, was the League's Defensive Player of the Year as a junior, and gained more than 1,000 yards as a running back. College career Banta-Cain played college football at the University of California, Berkeley where he finished his career with 112 tackles and 26.5 sacks. He redshirted in 1998, and then appeared in five games as a freshman in 1999. As a sophomore, Banta-Cain recorded 35 tackles and 5.5 sacks, and as a junior in 2001, he started every game at defensive end and tallied eight sacks and 33 tackles. As a senior in 2002, Banta-Cain was named to the All-Pac-10 first team and was the team's Defensive Most Valuable Player, finishing with 39 tackles, 13 sacks, and 22 tackles for a loss. His 26.5 career sacks ranked third in the school's record books behind Regan Upshaw and Andre Carter. While at Berkeley, Banta-Cain was a member of the Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House. Professional career =New England Patriots 2003‚Äì2006= Banta-Cain was drafted by the New England Patriots in the seventh round (239th overall) in the 2003 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, he played in nine games recording 11 tackles and one sack against the Buffalo Bills on December 27. In 2004, he played in all 16 games and finished the season with 28 tackles, 1.5 sacks and his first career interception again against the Buffalo Bills on November 14. He also was part of the Super Bowl XXXVIII winning team. The following season, he only managed to record nine tackles and 0.5 sacks but again was part of the team which won Super Bowl XXXIX. In his final year with the Patriots, he played in all 16 games including five starts and finished the season with 43 tackles and a career- high 5.5 sacks. =San Francisco 49ers 2007‚Äì2008= Banta-Cain was signed to a 3-year $12 million deal by the San Francisco 49ers as an unrestricted free agent on March 3, 2007. In his debut season, Banta-Cain started in four consecutive games until suffering a high ankle sprain during the 2nd quarter of a close 9‚Äì7 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. However, Banta-Cain continued to play due to a timely bye week following the injury, allowing him to not miss a game and still record a career-high 61 tackles and 3.5 sack on the year. He also scored the game-winning touchdown, in a November 25, 2007 game against the Arizona Cardinals, by recovering a fumble in the endzone in overtime. The win snapped an eight-game losing streak. He ended the year with ten starts and the 49ers ended the season with a 5‚Äì11 record. In his second season with the 49ers, Banta-Cain was inactive for the first four games of the season under Mike Nolan then activated to start on sub packages and special teams against the New England Patriots recording a half a sack and 5 tackles. Banta-Cain did not play another defensive snap for the season; however, he did manage to lead the team with 20 Special Teams tackles on a 6th ranked Special Teams unit coached by Al Everest (now with the Pittsburgh Steelers). The team finished with a 7‚Äì9 record. He was released under Mike Singletary on February 10, 2009. =New England Patriots 2009‚Äì2010= Just eight days after his release from the 49ers, Banta-Cain was re-signed by the New England Patriots on February 18, 2009. Banta-Cain was released on October 19 and reportedly re-signed the next day to a new contract through the 2011 season. However, the signing was not official as of the end of the regular season. He started 10 of the 16 games he played in 2009, recording 55 tackles and a career-high 10 sacks. Banta-Cain was officially re-signed to a three-year contract on March 5, 2010, the first day of free agency. The deal included a $6 million signing bonus, and averages $4.5 million per year. However, that yearly average can be raised to as high as $6 million if all performance incentives are met, raising the maximum value of the 3-year deal to $19 million. In Week 2 of the 2010 season, Banta-Cain started against the New York Jets, recording eight tackles and one sack in the Patriots loss. In the second quarter, Banta-Cain was penalized 15 yards for unnecessary roughness, and was pulled from the game in favor of rookie Jermaine Cunningham, who replaced Banta-Cain as a starter in the Patriots' base defense for the next game. Banta-Cain went on to make 6 starts in 15 games played, recording 45 tackles and five sacks. On July 29, 2011, it was announced that Banta-Cain had been released by the New England Patriots.

Career =College and Amateur= Cameron grew up in New York City, attended Cardinal Spellman High School in The Bronx, and played college soccer at the University of Michigan, where he is second in the school's all-time record for goals (28) and points (72), and was named Big Ten Player of the Year his junior year. Playing in the indoor and rec league's while in Michigan, Cameron excelled in the bare-foot method of playing soccer, and once scored 14 goals in an indoor soccer game while playing with no shoes on. During his college years Cameron also played in the USL Premier Development League for the Brooklyn Knights and the Michigan Bucks. Knox also played for Pasco Soccer Club from Wayne, NJ during his high school years. He helped the team win countless tournaments and was one of a handful of players from the club to move on to play professional soccer. =Professional= Cameron suffered a serious knee injury while playing for the Michigan Bucks, and subsequently missed much of his senior year at Michigan. As a result of this, and doubts over his signability, Cameron slipped to the fourth round of the 2005 MLS SuperDraft, where he was drafted by Columbus Crew. He went on to play 30 games and score 4 goals for the team over the next two years, but following the 2006 season, he was waived by the team. During his time with the Crew he played a friendly against English side Everton and thanked them on the scoreboard for coming to Columbus so he could beat them. Following his release by Crew, Cameron played for amateur team Canton Celtic, which plays in Michigan's MUSL Men's Open 1st Division. Celtic won the Michigan section of the USASA National Amateur Cup Championship, and represented the state at the 2008 USASA Regional tournament in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Cameron returned to play for the Michigan Bucks in the USL Premier Development League in 2009, and then signed with Detroit City FC in 2012. He made his DCFC debut against the Erie Admirals on May 26, 2012, scoring the first goal in a 3-0 victory. He continued to play for DCFC in 2013, and scored two goals in their opener and another in the home opener. Cameron scored again in DCFC's 2-0 over Zanseville AFC, giving him 4 goals on the season. =Post-Professional= Cameron now is a co-owner and player for AFC Ann Arbor in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Cameron also helps with a youth soccer club called Saline FC. =International= Cameron elected to represent the United States internationally, and played for various youth national teams, being brought to UAE in 2003 for FIFA World Youth Championship.

Rather than relying on her own songwriting, Baez instead selected work by younger folk and rock artists to perform. She included Dar Williams' \\"If I Wrote You\\", Richard Shindell's \\"Reunion Hill\\", and Betty Elders' \\"Crack in the Mirror\\", as well as two Sin√©ad Lohan compositions. Around the time of the album's release, Baez confessed that she no longer found herself able to write songs, and felt more comfortable reverting to her original role, as an interpreter. The one track for which she receives credit, \\"Lily\\" (about a girlhood friend), was a poem written by Baez, to which Greenberg and Wilson added music. In addition to giving the young songwriters a career boost by recording their songs, Baez took two of them‚ÄîShindell and Williams‚Äîon tour with her to support this album. Initial limited editions of this album, available only at Borders bookstores in the US, included a bonus CD of two songs: Betty Elders' \\"Long Bed from Kenya\\" and a duet with Dar Williams on Paul Simon's \\"Dangling Conversation\\", both of which were recorded live at the 1997 Newport Folk Festival. In 2009 a \\"Collector's Edition\\" of the original 10-track album was re-issued in a 2-CD set.

Tepper, published in 1988. It describes a world set three hundred years into the future after a catastrophic war which has fractured the United States into several nations. Setting The story is set in \\"Women's Country\\", apparently in the former Pacific Northwest. They have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy based on small cities and low-tech local agriculture. They have also developed a matriarchy where the women and children live within town walls with a small number of male servitors, and most of the men live outside the town in warrior camps. Plot The Gate to Women's Country is set in the future, 300 years after a nuclear war destroyed most of human civilization. The book focuses on a matriarchal nation known as Women's Country, and particularly the city of Marthatown. Stavia, the novel's hero, is the younger daughter of Morgot, an important member of the Marthatown Council. The book opens with Stavia as an adult, heading to meet her fifteen-year-old son, Dawid. He has spent the last ten years living outside the city walls with the warriors, as is customary for Women's Country boys, and is now old enough to decide whether he wishes to remain a warrior or accept a life of study and service among the women as a servitor. At the meeting Dawid formally renounces his mother and chooses to become a full-fledged warrior. Stavia also renounces Dawid. Afterwards, Stavia remembers when her younger brother was sent to live with the warriors. Much of the rest of the novel is told in flashback, following Stavia's life from childhood to adulthood. In the story's present, Stavia prepares for her role as Iphigenia in Marthatown's annual performance of Iphigenia at Ilium, a reworking of the Greek tragedy The Trojan Women that weaves through the novel as a leitmotif. While still a child, Stavia met Chernon, the son of one of her mother's friends. Although Chernon lives in the garrison with the other boys and men, he and Stavia form a friendship. They meet at the twice-annual Carnival, the only event in Women's Country where warriors and women can mix freely and during which time boys who have not yet chosen to become warriors can visit their families. Stavia eventually agrees to smuggle books to Chernon for him to read, even though this is forbidden for boys in the garrison. In fact, Chernon has been ordered by his commander, Michael, to learn more about the secrets of the women who rule Women's Country. After confessing to breaking the ordinances, Stavia is sent away from Marthatown for several years to train as a doctor. On her return, Chernon pursues their relationship again. When Stavia is selected for an exploration mission to the south, Chernon leaves the garrison (on Michael's orders) meets her there and rapes her. While away from Women's Country, Stavia and Chernon are captured by a band of \\"Holylanders\\", members of a struggling community to the south of Women's Country. They practice polygamy and a fundamentalist patriarchy with Christian underpinnings. The Holylanders are brutally misogynistic, treating women as slaves to their husbands, and children (both sons and daughters) are subject to severe corporal punishment which they term 'chastisement'. Chernon betrays Stavia after their capture, during which time she realizes she is pregnant by Chernon. She makes an escape attempt, and is struck a blow to the head and incapacitated. Upon her return to Women's Country, she finally learns the secrets of the Women's Country Council and the choices they have made to preserve their way of life. The secret of Women's Country is that the council has been engaged in a selective breeding program with the population, using select servitors to propagate desirable traits through artificial insemination amongst select women; additionally selective sterilization has been used among the women. Chernon also is changed by his experiences, and returns to his garrison promoting the ways of the Holylanders as an alternative to their current societal structure. The Marthatown garrison is soon sent to battle against another Women's Country city, and no survivors return. Major themes The story explores many elements from ecofeminism, which has been a hallmark of much of Tepper's writing, both in her feminist science fiction and in her pseudonymous mysteries. The question of the causes of human violence is also a major theme, and in the novel Stavia's society hopes they are successfully breeding violence out of humanity. In the novel, violence appears to be biologically determined. By selecting only nonviolent individuals to breed, society is slowly increasing the number of such nonviolent members. Tepper is careful to demonstrate that it is only unreasoning violence, not the ability to learn to fight and defend oneself and others, that is being bred out. For instance, she shows the servitor Joshua and Morgot as skilled fighters -- so skilled they are able to defeat the men who have trained as fighters their entire lives. So it is clear that it is only certain personality traits--violence, especially in men--that is being weeded out. Women are also given hysterectomies and tubal ligations at the discretion of the medical officers. The biological determinism of Tepper's world also controls sexuality, and the novel constructs homosexuality as a genetic and hormonal disorder which has been eugenically removed from the population. Jane Donawerth, applauding the depth and richness of Tepper's exploration of this theme, describes Tepper's approach as a \\"chillingly homophobic solution\\".Frankenstein's daughters Tepper thus illustrates a world approaching a feminist utopia through the vision of a powerful leadership who impose rigid behavioral control on their society, and engineer the removal of those traits they consider undesirable (mainly violence) through forced sterilization. Their world remains vulnerable to ideological attack, as can be seen by the plots of the garrisons to take over the women's cities every generation and to force the women to serve them, as well as in Chernon's susceptibility to the violently misogynist ideology of the Holylanders. However, the Council's decision to interfere with its citizens' reproduction, without their consent or knowledge, is shown as a serious ethical issue -- a \\"damned\\" choice as described by one of the leaders.

They formalise the various situations in geometry and algebra in which inverse images (or pull- backs) of objects such as vector bundles can be defined. As an example, for each topological space there is the category of vector bundles on the space, and for every continuous map from a topological space X to another topological space Y is associated the pullback functor taking bundles on Y to bundles on X. Fibred categories formalise the system consisting of these categories and inverse image functors. Similar setups appear in various guises in mathematics, in particular in algebraic geometry, which is the context in which fibred categories originally appeared. Fibered categories are used to define stacks, which are fibered categories (over a site) with \\"descent\\". Fibrations also play an important role in categorical semantics of type theory, and in particular that of dependent type theories. Fibred categories were introduced by , and developed in more detail by . Background and motivations There are many examples in topology and geometry where some types of objects are considered to exist on or above or over some underlying base space. The classical examples include vector bundles, principal bundles, and sheaves over topological spaces. Another example is given by \\"families\\" of algebraic varieties parametrised by another variety. Typical to these situations is that to a suitable type of a map f: X ‚Üí Y between base spaces, there is a corresponding inverse image (also called pull-back) operation f* taking the considered objects defined on Y to the same type of objects on X. This is indeed the case in the examples above: for example, the inverse image of a vector bundle E on Y is a vector bundle f*(E) on X. Moreover, it is often the case that the considered \\"objects on a base space\\" form a category, or in other words have maps (morphisms) between them. In such cases the inverse image operation is often compatible with composition of these maps between objects, or in more technical terms is a functor. Again, this is the case in examples listed above. However, it is often the case that if g: Y ‚Üí Z is another map, the inverse image functors are not strictly compatible with composed maps: if z is an object over Z (a vector bundle, say), it may well be that : f^*(g^*(z)) eq (g\\\\circ f)^*(z). Instead, these inverse images are only naturally isomorphic. This introduction of some \\"slack\\" in the system of inverse images causes some delicate issues to appear, and it is this set-up that fibred categories formalise. The main application of fibred categories is in descent theory, concerned with a vast generalisation of \\"glueing\\" techniques used in topology. In order to support descent theory of sufficient generality to be applied in non-trivial situations in algebraic geometry the definition of fibred categories is quite general and abstract. However, the underlying intuition is quite straightforward when keeping in mind the basic examples discussed above. Formal definitions There are two essentially equivalent technical definitions of fibred categories, both of which will be described below. All discussion in this section ignores the set-theoretical issues related to \\"large\\" categories. The discussion can be made completely rigorous by, for example, restricting attention to small categories or by using universes. =Cartesian morphisms and functors= If œÜ: F ‚Üí E is a functor between two categories and S is an object of E, then the subcategory of F consisting of those objects x for which œÜ(x)=S and those morphisms m satisfying œÜ(m)=idS, is called the fibre category (or fibre) over S, and is denoted FS. The morphisms of FS are called S-morphisms, and for x,y objects of FS, the set of S-morphisms is denoted by HomS(x,y). The image by œÜ of an object or a morphism in F is called its projection (by œÜ). If f is a morphism of E, then those morphisms of F that project to f are called f-morphisms, and the set of f-morphisms between objects x and y in F is denoted by Homf(x,y). A morphism m: x ‚Üí y in F is called œÜ-cartesian (or simply cartesian) if it satisfies the following condition: : if f: T ‚Üí S is the projection of m, and if n: z ‚Üí y is an f-morphism, then there is precisely one T-morphism a: z ‚Üí x such that n = m ‚àò a. A cartesian morphism m: x ‚Üí y is called an inverse image of its projection f = œÜ(m); the object x is called an inverse image of y by f. The cartesian morphisms of a fibre category FS are precisely the isomorphisms of FS. There can in general be more than one cartesian morphism projecting to a given morphism f: T ‚Üí S, possibly having different sources; thus there can be more than one inverse image of a given object y in FS by f. However, it is a direct consequence of the definition that two such inverse images are isomorphic in FT. A functor œÜ: F ‚Üí E is also called an E-category, or said to make F into an E-category or a category over E. An E-functor from an E-category œÜ: F ‚Üí E to an E-category œà: G ‚Üí E is a functor Œ±: F ‚Üí G such that œà ‚àò Œ± = œÜ. E-categories form in a natural manner a 2-category, with 1-morphisms being E-functors, and 2-morphisms being natural transformations between E-functors whose components lie in some fibre. An E-functor between two E-categories is called a cartesian functor if it takes cartesian morphisms to cartesian morphisms. Cartesian functors between two E-categories F,G form a category CartE(F,G), with natural transformations as morphisms. A special case is provided by considering E as an E-category via the identity functor: then a cartesian functor from E to an E-category F is called a cartesian section. Thus a cartesian section consists of a choice of one object xS in FS for each object S in E, and for each morphism f: T ‚Üí S a choice of an inverse image mf: xT ‚Üí xS. A cartesian section is thus a (strictly) compatible system of inverse images over objects of E. The category of cartesian sections of F is denoted by : \\\\underset{\\\\longleftarrow}{\\\\mathrm{Lim}} (F/E) = \\\\mathrm{Cart}_E(E,F). In the important case where E has a terminal object e (thus in particular when E is a topos or the category E/S of arrows with target S in E) the functor : \\\\epsilon\\\\colon\\\\underset{\\\\longleftarrow}{\\\\mathrm{Lim}} (F/E) \\\\to F_e,\\\\qquad s\\\\mapsto s(e) is fully faithful (Lemma 5.7 of Giraud (1964)). =Fibred categories and cloven categories= The technically most flexible and economical definition of fibred categories is based on the concept of cartesian morphisms. It is equivalent to a definition in terms of cleavages, the latter definition being actually the original one presented in Grothendieck (1959); the definition in terms of cartesian morphisms was introduced in Grothendieck (1971) in 1960‚Äì1961. An E category œÜ: F ‚Üí E is a fibred category (or a fibred E-category, or a category fibred over E) if each morphism f of E whose codomain is in the range of projection has at least one inverse image, and moreover the composition m ‚àò n of any two cartesian morphisms m,n in F is always cartesian. In other words, an E-category is a fibred category if inverse images always exist (for morphisms whose codomains are in the range of projection) and are transitive. If E has a terminal object e and if F is fibred over E, then the functor Œµ from cartesian sections to Fe defined at the end of the previous section is an equivalence of categories and moreover surjective on objects. If F is a fibred E-category, it is always possible, for each morphism f: T ‚Üí S in E and each object y in FS, to choose (by using the axiom of choice) precisely one inverse image m: x ‚Üí y. The class of morphisms thus selected is called a cleavage and the selected morphisms are called the transport morphisms (of the cleavage). A fibred category together with a cleavage is called a cloven category. A cleavage is called normalised if the transport morphisms include all identities in F; this means that the inverse images of identity morphisms are chosen to be identity morphisms. Evidently if a cleavage exists, it can be chosen to be normalised; we shall consider only normalised cleavages below. The choice of a (normalised) cleavage for a fibred E-category F specifies, for each morphism f: T ‚Üí S in E, a functor f*: FS ‚Üí FT: on objects f* is simply the inverse image by the corresponding transport morphism, and on morphisms it is defined in a natural manner by the defining universal property of cartesian morphisms. The operation which associates to an object S of E the fibre category FS and to a morphism f the inverse image functor f* is almost a contravariant functor from E to the category of categories. However, in general it fails to commute strictly with composition of morphisms. Instead, if f: T ‚Üí S and g: U ‚Üí T are morphisms in E, then there is an isomorphism of functors : c_{f,g}\\\\colon \\\\quad g^*f^* \\\\to (f \\\\circ g)^*. These isomorphisms satisfy the following two compatibilities: # c_{f,\\\\mathrm{id}_T} = c_{\\\\mathrm{id}_S,f} = \\\\mathrm{id}_{f^*} # for three consecutive morphisms h,g,f\\\\colon\\\\quad V \\\\to U \\\\to T \\\\to S and object x\\\\in F_S the following holds: c_{f,g\\\\circ h} \\\\cdot c_{g,h}(f^*(x)) = c_{f\\\\circ g, h}(x)\\\\cdot h^*(c_{f,g}(x)). It can be shown (see Grothendieck (1971) section 8) that, inversely, any collection of functors f*: FS ‚Üí FT together with isomorphisms cf,g satisfying the compatibilities above, defines a cloven category. These collections of inverse image functors provide a more intuitive view on fibred categories; and indeed, it was in terms of such compatible inverse image functors that fibred categories were introduced in Grothendieck (1959). The paper by Gray referred to below makes analogies between these ideas and the notion of fibration of spaces. These ideas simplify in the case of groupoids, as shown in the paper of Brown referred to below, which obtains a useful family of exact sequences from a fibration of groupoids. =Splittings and split fibred categories= A (normalised) cleavage such that the composition of two transport morphisms is always a transport morphism is called a splitting, and a fibred category with a splitting is called a split (fibred) category. In terms of inverse image functors the condition of being a splitting means that the composition of inverse image functors corresponding to composable morphisms f,g in E equals the inverse image functor corresponding to f ‚àò g. In other words, the compatibility isomorphisms cf,g of the previous section are all identities for a split category. Thus split E-categories correspond exactly to true functors from E to the category of categories. Unlike cleavages, not all fibred categories admit splittings. For an example, see below. =Co-cartesian morphisms and co-fibred categories= One can invert the direction of arrows in the definitions above to arrive at corresponding concepts of co-cartesian morphisms, co-fibred categories and split co-fibred categories (or co-split categories). More precisely, if œÜ: F ‚ÜíE is a functor, then a morphism m: x ‚Üí y in F is called co-cartesian if it is cartesian for the opposite functor œÜop: Fop ‚Üí Eop. Then m is also called a direct image and y a direct image of x for f = œÜ(m). A co-fibred E-category is anE-category such that direct image exists for each morphism in E and that the composition of direct images is a direct image. A co-cleavage and a co-splitting are defined similarly, corresponding to direct image functors instead of inverse image functors. Properties =The 2-categories of fibred categories and split categories= The categories fibred over a fixed category E form a 2-category Fib(E), where the category of morphisms between two fibred categories F and G is defined to be the category CartE(F,G) of cartesian functors from F to G. Similarly the split categories over E form a 2-category Scin(E) (from French cat√©gorie scind√©e), where the category of morphisms between two split categories F and G is the full sub-category ScinE(F,G) of E-functors from F to G consisting of those functors that transform each transport morphism of F into a transport morphism of G. Each such morphism of split E-categories is also a morphism of E-fibred categories, i.e., ScinE(F,G) ‚äÇ CartE(F,G). There is a natural forgetful 2-functor i: Scin(E) ‚Üí Fib(E) that simply forgets the splitting. =Existence of equivalent split categories= While not all fibred categories admit a splitting, each fibred category is in fact equivalent to a split category. Indeed, there are two canonical ways to construct an equivalent split category for a given fibred category F over E. More precisely, the forgetful 2-functor i: Scin(E) ‚Üí Fib(E) admits a right 2-adjoint S and a left 2-adjoint L (Theorems 2.4.2 and 2.4.4 of Giraud 1971), and S(F) and L(F) are the two associated split categories. The adjunction functors S(F) ‚Üí F and F ‚Üí L(F) are both cartesian and equivalences (ibid.). However, while their composition S(F) ‚Üí L(F) is an equivalence (of categories, and indeed of fibred categories), it is not in general a morphism of split categories. Thus the two constructions differ in general. The two preceding constructions of split categories are used in a critical way in the construction of the stack associated to a fibred category (and in particular stack associated to a pre-stack).  Categories fibered in groupoids  There is a related construction to fibered categories called categories fibered in groupoids. These are fibered categories p:\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{C} such that any subcategory of \\\\mathcal{F} given by # Fix an object c \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{C}) # The objects of the subcategory are x \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{F}) where p(x) = c # The arrows are given by f:x\\\\to y such that p(f) = \\\\text{id}_c is a groupoid denoted \\\\mathcal{F}_c. The associated 2-functors from the Grothendieck construction are examples of stacks. In short, the associated functor F_p:\\\\mathcal{C}^{op} \\\\to \\\\text{Groupoids} sends an object c to the category \\\\mathcal{F}_c, and a morphism d \\\\to c induces a functor from the fibered category structure. Namely, for an object x \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{F}_c) considered as an object of \\\\mathcal{F}, there is an object y \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{F}) where p(y) = d. This association gives a functor \\\\mathcal{F}_c \\\\to \\\\mathcal{F}_d which is a functor of groupoids. Examples = Fibered categories = #The functor Ob : Cat‚ÜíSet, sending a category to its set of objects, is a fibration. For a set S, the fiber consists of categories C with Ob(C)=S. The cartesian arrows are the fully faithful functors. #Categories of arrows: For any category E the category of arrows A(E) in E has as objects the morphisms in E, and as morphisms the commutative squares in E (more precisely, a morphism from (f: X ‚Üí T) to (g: Y ‚Üí S) consists of morphisms (a: X ‚Üí Y) and (b: T ‚Üí S) such that bf = ga). The functor which takes an arrow to its target makes A(E) into an E-category; for an object S of E the fibre ES is the category E/S of S-objects in E, i.e., arrows in E with target S. Cartesian morphisms in A(E) are precisely the cartesian squares in E, and thus A(E) is fibred over E precisely when fibre products exist in E. #Fibre bundles: Fibre products exist in the category Top of topological spaces and thus by the previous example A(Top) is fibred over Top. If Fib is the full subcategory of A(Top) consisting of arrows that are projection maps of fibre bundles, then FibS is the category of fibre bundles on S and Fib is fibred over Top. A choice of a cleavage amounts to a choice of ordinary inverse image (or pull-back) functors for fibre bundles. #Vector bundles: In a manner similar to the previous examples the projections (p: V ‚Üí S) of real (complex) vector bundles to their base spaces form a category VectR (VectC) over Top (morphisms of vector bundles respecting the vector space structure of the fibres). This Top-category is also fibred, and the inverse image functors are the ordinary pull-back functors for vector bundles. These fibred categories are (non-full) subcategories of Fib. #Sheaves on topological spaces: The inverse image functors of sheaves make the categories Sh(S) of sheaves on topological spaces S into a (cleaved) fibred category Sh over Top. This fibred category can be described as the full sub- category of A(Top) consisting of √©tal√© spaces of sheaves. As with vector bundles, the sheaves of groups and rings also form fibred categories of Top. #Sheaves on topoi: If E is a topos and S is an object in E, the category ES of S-objects is also a topos, interpreted as the category of sheaves on S. If f: T ‚Üí S is a morphism in E, the inverse image functor f* can be described as follows: for a sheaf F on ES and an object p: U ‚Üí T in ET one has f*F(U) = HomT(U, f*F) equals HomS(f ‚àò p, F) = F(U). These inverse image make the categories ES into a split fibred category on E. This can be applied in particular to the \\"large\\" topos TOP of topological spaces. #Quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes: Quasi-coherent sheaves form a fibred category over the category of schemes. This is one of the motivating examples for the definition of fibred categories. #Fibred category admitting no splitting: A group G can be considered as a category with one object and the elements of G as the morphisms, composition of morphisms being given by the group law. A group homomorphism f: G ‚Üí H can then be considered as a functor, which makes G into a H-category. It can be checked that in this set-up all morphisms in G are cartesian; hence G is fibred over H precisely when f is surjective. A splitting in this setup is a (set-theoretic) section of f which commutes strictly with composition, or in other words a section of f which is also a homomorphism. But as is well known in group theory, this is not always possible (one can take the projection in a non-split group extension). #Co- fibred category of sheaves: The direct image functor of sheaves makes the categories of sheaves on topological spaces into a co-fibred category. The transitivity of the direct image shows that this is even naturally co-split. = Category fibered in groupoids = One of the main examples of categories fibered in groupoids comes from groupoid objects internal to a category \\\\mathcal{C}. So given a groupoid object > x \\\\overset{s}\\\\underset{t}\\\\rightrightarrows y there is an associated groupoid object > h_x{\\\\overset {s}{\\\\underset {t}{\\\\rightrightarrows }}}h_y in the category of contravariant functors \\\\underline{\\\\text{Hom}}(\\\\mathcal{C}^{op},\\\\text{Sets}) from the yoneda embedding. Since this diagram applied to an object z \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{C}) gives a groupoid internal to sets > h_x(z){\\\\overset {s}{\\\\underset {t}{\\\\rightrightarrows }}}h_y(z) there is an associated small groupoid \\\\mathcal{G}. This gives a contravariant 2-functor F: \\\\mathcal{C}^{op} \\\\to \\\\text{Groupoids}, and using the Grothendieck construction, this gives a category fibered in groupoids over \\\\mathcal{C}. Note the fiber category over an object is just the associated groupoid from the original groupoid in sets.  Group quotient  Given a group object G acting on an object X from a:G \\\\to \\\\text{Aut}(X), there is an associated groupoid object > G\\\\times X \\\\underset{t}\\\\overset{s}\\\\rightrightarrows{} X where s:G\\\\times X \\\\to X is the projection on X and t:G\\\\times X \\\\to X is the composition map G\\\\times X \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\left(a, \\\\text{id}\\\\right)} \\\\text{Aut}(X)\\\\times X \\\\xrightarrow{(f,x) \\\\mapsto f(x)} X. This groupoid gives an induced category fibered in groupoids denoted p:[X/G] \\\\to \\\\mathcal{C}.

He briefly served in politics, as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Cork City, and was later the president of University College Cork. He also became a priest following the death of his wife. Education and academia Born (with the last name Rahilly) in Listowel, County Kerry, he was first educated at St. Michael's College, ListowelJ. Anthony Gaughan, Alfred O'Rahilly Biography (Kingdom Books, 1986) () and at Blackrock College in Dublin. O'Rahilly first earned University College Cork degrees in mathematical physics (BA 1907, MA 1908).alt= He studied scholastic philosophy at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire following his master's degree, then returned to UCC for a BSc (1912). In 1914, he was appointed assistant lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics at UCC, and then in 1917 he was made Professor of Mathematical Physics. In 1919 he received a doctorate from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He became Registrar of UCC in 1920, and held the post until 1943 when he became President of the University. O'Rahilly founded Cork University Press in 1925. He spent a year, in 1927, at Harvard studying social and political theory. In 1938, he published a controversial book surveying electromagnetic theory called Electromagnetics (Longman, Green and Company), republished in 1956 by Dover as Electromagnetic theory, a critical examination of fundamentals. In 1939, UCC conferred on him the degree D.Litt., and in 1940 the National University of Ireland awarded him a DSc. The O'Rahilly Building was one of the major developments on the UCC campus in the 1990s and was named in honour of O'Rahilly. Politics and public life After the 1916 Easter Rising, O'Rahilly publicly supported Sinn F√©in and was elected to Cork City Council as a Sinn F√©in and Transport Workers candidate. Arrested early in 1921 for political writings, O'Rahilly was interned in Spike Island prison. Released in October 1921 he was constitutional adviser to the Irish Treaty Delegation. O'Rahilly supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and in 1922 he composed a draft constitution for the Irish Free State with Darrell Figgis. O'Rahilly lead Irish delegations to the International Labour Organization conferences in 1924, 1925 and 1932, and took on a conciliatory role in trade union and employers disputes in Munster. As President of University College Cork, he initiated workers' education courses in the university in the late 1940s which proved popular with Cork trade unionists. Standing as a candidate in Cork Borough for Cumann na nGaedheal, he was elected to the 4th D√°il at the 1923 general election. He resigned in 1924, causing a by-election later that year which was won by the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate Michael Egan. Religion A deeply religious Catholic from early life, O'Rahilly was a member of the Society of Jesus but left before ordination and was dispensed from his vows. He maintained his (sometimes controversial) religious views throughout his life, and became a priest, and then Monsignor, in later years following the death of his wife. He wrote a biography of Fr. Willie Doyle SJ - which was subsequently translated into other languages. In 1954, Pope Pius XII conferred on him the Pontifical Order of Saint Gregory the Great, the highest distinction awarded by the Pope to Catholic laymen. He was also an advisor on university education to the Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid and sat on an informal committee from 1950. The committee included O'Rahilly, and the other presidents of the National University of Ireland; Michael Tierney of UCD, Monsignor P√°draig de Br√∫n, Cardinal D'Alton, and Bishops Cornelius Lucey of Cork and Michael Browne of Galway. Science In O'Rahilly's major survey of electromagnetic theory, Electromagnetics (1938),Worldcat entry for \\"Electromagnetic theory, a critical examination of fundamentals\\" - First edition published in 1938 under title: \\"Electromagnetics\\" he opposed Maxwell's dominant (British) theory of the electromagnetic field and followed the French Catholic physicist, historian of science, and philosopher of science Pierre Duhem in rejecting Maxwell's field account.See Pierre Duhem: Against ‚ÄúCartesian Method‚Äù: Metaphysics and Models from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for why Duhem rejected Maxwell's theory. As a logical consequence of his rejection of Maxwell, O'Rahilly also rejected Einstein's theory. O'Rahilly embraced Ritz's ballistic theory of light and Ritz's electrodynamics.For a short description of O'Rahilly's criticism of the special theory of relativity, see this section of Challenging Modern Physics by Al Kelly While Ritz's theory reduces to Coulomb's Law and Ampere's Law, since its derivation is phenomenological, it differs from the Lienard-Wiechert potential. O'Rahilly also wrote against applying the theory of evolution to human society. Because O'Rahilly thought Cork lacked a social science curriculum he volunteered to teach courses in economics and sociology. When told that they could not spare him from the physics courses, he volunteered to teach an economics course and sociology course along with his physics courses. Writings O'Rahilly's writings include: Father William Doyle, S.J.- a Spiritual Study, Electromagnetic Theory, Money, The Burial of Christ, Religion and Science, Aquinas versus Marx, Moral Principles, Social Principles, The Family at Bethany and Gospel Meditations.

History  The Revolution was formed by Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Shane Douglas and Perry Saturn on the July 29, 1999 edition of WCW Thunder. When the group first came together as fan favorites, it was with the idea that they were a group of younger wrestlers who had felt slighted by WCW management, never giving them the chance to be stars, while always giving older, more established wrestlers the top spots. The concept held some truth, and in reality the stable was actually made up of close friends, as Douglas, Benoit, Malenko and Saturn knew each other from their days in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Douglas, Benoit, and Malenko also were the original Triple Threat stable in ECW, while Saturn was part of The Eliminators with John Kronus. During a house show on September 11 at the Baltimore Arena, three days after the death of WCW referee Mark Curtis, Douglas, Benoit and Malenko paid tribute to their friend and dedicated the show to him. In October of that year, after Vince Russo became head writer, the gimmick of the group changed to one that was anti-America and anti-government. This was established with Benoit taking a microphone, looking toward the entrance stage, and stating that they were \\"tired of the politics going on in the back\\". This blurred the line between storyline and real-life in regards to how WCW was being managed. The group even went so far as to create their own flag and claim to have left the United States and formed their own government. Their theme music had a guitar and percussion sound very similar to Marilyn Manson's \\"The Beautiful People\\". Benoit and Malenko left the group in October, but Malenko turned on Benoit in a setup where Malenko had never really left The Revolution. The Revolution then added Asya and feuded with The Filthy Animals. The Revolution kidnapped Torrie Wilson and put her freedom up in a match against The Filthy Animals, which they lost. In January 2000, Malenko, Saturn and Benoit left WCW along with Eddie Guerrero in a dispute with management and formed The Radicalz in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), while Douglas took a hiatus, before returning to WCW in April.

He played college football for the University of New Hampshire, and was selected by the Bears in the fifth round of the 1999 NFL Draft.  Early years  Azumah is the first-generation American son of Theophilus and Bertha Azumah, natives of Ghana. Azumah was born in Oklahoma and grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts. At an early age, he played for the Worcester Vikings Pop Warner football team. Azumah attended Saint Peter-Marian High School receiving football honors as a Central Massachusetts and Shriners All-Star.  Collegiate years  Azumah attended the University of New Hampshire where he was a four-year starter on offense for Chip Kelly. He was an All-American tailback. At the time, Azumah was the only player in Division I-AA history to have four seasons of 1000+ rushing yards. In 1999, Azumah was the first recipient of the Jim Urquhart Student-Athlete of the Year Award. This annual award is bestowed upon UNH senior student-athletes who excel both in athletic competition and the classroom, in addition to possessing sportsmanship, great character and passion for sports. During Azumah's senior year he was elected, by unanimous vote, All-American and All-Atlantic 10 Conference while shattering conference and school season records with 22 touchdowns and 2,195 rushing yards. He also won the Walter Payton Award as the best offensive player in Division I-AA football. In his college playing career, Azumah set the Division I-AA career rushing record with 6,193 yards. He also set the Division I-AA record with 8,276 career all-purpose yards. In 2005 Azumah was inducted into the New Hampshire Wildcats Athletic Council Hall of Fame.  NFL career  Azumah was selected by the Chicago Bears as the 147th pick of the 1999 NFL Draft out of the University of New Hampshire. In Azumah's first year with the Chicago Bears, he won the prestigious Brian Piccolo Award. This award is given to a Chicago Bear by his teammates. Brian Piccolo played four seasons as a running back for the Chicago Bears from 1965‚Äì1968. Piccolo died from cancer in 1970 when he was just 26 years old. The Chicago Bears created the Brian Piccolo award to honor a teammate's courage, loyalty, teamwork and dedication. Azumah, who was a running back in college, continued to make the transition into an NFL defensive back. As his NFL experience grew, he also saw time on special teams and special situations on defense. In 2001 Azumah was given a contract extension. On January 19, 2002, during the divisional playoff game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, Azumah intercepted then quarterback Donovan McNabb and returned the ball 39 yards for a touchdown. That was the last touchdown scored in old Soldier Field. His best season came in 2003 when he led the league in kickoff returns with a twenty- nine-yard average and two touchdowns. In 2004, Azumah was selected to represent the NFC in the NFL Pro Bowl as a kick returner. In that game Azumah broke the record for return yards with 228. He also recovered a fumble. For Azumah's career, he appeared in 105 games with 48 starts. He had 384 tackles, 10 interceptions, 29 pass defense, 6.5 sacks, 6 forced fumbles and one recovery. Azumah retired in March 2006.  Post NFL career  Azumah has been seen on the Chicago Bears post game coverage and commentary on WFLD-TV, Fox Chicago and appeared weekly on Fox Chicago's Good Day Chicago. Azumah started his television broadcasting career on Comcast SportsNet Chicago in 2006 as a post game analyst and feature reporter. Azumah also worked for ESPN 1000 radio in Chicago in 2010.  Philanthropic activity  Azumah became a board member of the University of New Hampshire Foundation in 2001. The Foundation builds private support for the University of New Hampshire. In the summer of 2003, Azumah donated a six-figure gift to the Foundation which was directed to the University's athletic department. The Jerry Azumah Performance Center was a direct result of Azumah's gift. At age 25, Azumah became the youngest UNH alumnus to give a gift over $100,000. In 2004 Azumah started the Azumah Student Assistance Program (ASAP). ASAP is a charitable 501(c)(3) organization and provides scholarships for disadvantaged students that attend private, secondary education. The program helps students in both Massachusetts and Illinois. As a retired member of the Chicago Bears Football Club, Azumah joined the Board of Directors of Bears Care in 2006, the philanthropic arm of the Chicago Bears. Bears Care was founded in 1989 and supports youth athletics, education, medical research and treatment programs for breast and ovarian cancer.

It starred Robert Ri'chard as Bobby, a young boy whose life changed when his strange cousin Skeeter came to live with his family. With Skeeter's help, Bobby learns life lessons and tackles the ups and downs of growing up. The show also included Meagan Good as Bobby's friend Nina, Rondell Sheridan as Bobby's father Andre, and Angela Means as Bobby's mother Vanessa. Skeeter is portrayed by a hand puppet with Bill Bellamy providing his voice, and Drew Massey performing the puppetry, assisted by Alice Dinnean. Within the show, Skeeter is treated like a regular human and no mention of him being a puppet is made. Although the series was shot in a single-camera format, the show used a laugh track. The show's theme song is a parody of 702's 1996 hit \\"Steelo\\", written by Missy Elliott.  Overview  Cousin Skeeter first aired in September 1, 1998 on Nickelodeon, sharing the 8‚Äì9pm programming block with The Wild Thornberrys. Cousin Skeeter was one of many shows at this time to touch on the idea of multicultural themes in television around this time, with notable shows such as The Brothers Garc√≠a originating around this time as well. The show focused primarily on issues that many African Americans were facing during this time period, by presenting them in a comical way via the use of Skeeter. Skeeter frequently causes mischief, which is often balanced out by Bobby having to correct the situation. Episodes  Characters  = Main = * Skeeter (performed by Drew Massey, voiced by Bill Bellamy) - Skeeter is a puppet whose life changed when he moved from Georgia to New York City to live with his cousin Bobby. He is a loud-mouthed, impulsive, and reckless ladies' man, who spends each episode getting Bobby into trouble. Skeeter is also friends with several notable celebrities, including Michael Jordan, Queen Latifah, MC Lyte (whose life he apparently saved), and Dennis Rodman. He's not easily angry, unless someone remarks on his extreme shortness, which causes him to fly into a rage. The fact that he is a puppet is never acknowledged on the series. * Bobby Walker (portrayed by Robert Ri'chard) - Originally from Inglewood, California. Bobby is smart and well- behaved. Often the victim of his cousin's mischief, Bobby often gets mad at Skeeter, but Bobby likes him nonetheless. * Andr√© Walker (portrayed by Rondell Sheridan) - Bobby's father who is a music producer. * Nina Jones (portrayed by Meagan Good) - Nina is Bobby's best friend. She and Bobby have a crush on each other at the start of the show and later start dating. She is a fast talker and Nicole's best friend. * Vanessa Walker (portrayed by Angela Means) - Bobby's mother, a lawyer, is often annoyed by Skeeter just like Bobby is. She and Andre can't wait for the boys to go to college, and the couple will do anything to get Skeeter and Bobby out of their hair. =Supporting= * Nicole (voiced by Tisha Campbell-Martin) - A female puppet character, Nicole has more class and manners than Skeeter. She first appeared as a new student in the second season's TV movie, \\"New Kids on the Planet\\". Nicole quickly became friends with Nina and they are like sisters. She is depicted as tough, once wanting to join the high school football team, and threatening to hurt the school bully if he hurt Skeeter. * Duke - Bobby's friend Duke appeared in the first and second seasons of the series. * Geoff - One of Bobby's friends from school, Geoff always seems to be a bad role model for the boys. * Brenda (voiced by Lisa Lopes)  Reception  = Critical = Cousin Skeeter received mixed reviews. A writer from The Hollywood Reporter described the shows characters as \\"undeveloped\\" and \\"dependent on a one-liner approach\\". Others note that the contrast between Bobby and Skeeter is meant to act as a kind of role model for children, but the message is lost in the strange behavior of Skeeter. Many viewers found it odd that the fact that Skeeter is an actual puppet is never acknowledged by any other characters, which left them to wonder why he was even a puppet in the first place. Ray Richmond, a writer for Variety, found the content borderline offensive, calling it an \\"a half-hour entrant in Nickelodeon‚Äôs primetime \\"Nickel-O-Zone\\" lineup\\" that sends \\"TVs view of black culture careening back to the Stone Age\\". However, Rotten Tomatoes rated it as one of five 1990s children's shows that helped \\"pave the way for black representation on TV\\", with the article citing the episode \\"The Bicycle Thief\\" which tackled the issue of police interacting with black children. = Ratings = According to a Variety article from February 1999, Cousin Skeeter was \\"consistently ranked as the top-rated live-action series for the [Nickelodeon] network\\". = Award and nominations = * 1999 ** Young Artist Award nominated for best performance in a TV Drama or Comedy series - Leading Young Actor: Robert Ri'chard ** Outstanding Performance in a Youth or Children's Series/Special: Bill Bellamy * 2000 ** Outstanding Youth or Children's Series/Special ** Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Children's Programs: Johnathan Winfrey ** Best Performance in a TV Comedy Series - Guest Starring Young Performer: Rachel Glenn ** Best Performance in a TV Comedy Series - Leading Young Actor: Robert Ri'chard * 2001 ** Outstanding Youth or Children's Series/Special ** African American Achievement award for supporting actresses - Rissa JB Milhouse (episode 14) ** Best Performance in a TV Comedy Series - Leading Young Actor: Robert Ri'chard  References  ; Other sources * External links * * Category:1998 American television series debuts Category:2001 American television series endings Category:1990s Nickelodeon original programming Category:2000s Nickelodeon original programming Category:1990s American teen sitcoms Category:2000s American teen sitcoms Category:1990s American black sitcoms Category:2000s American black sitcoms Category:1990s American single-camera sitcoms Category:2000s American single-camera sitcoms Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series about families Category:American television shows featuring puppetry Category:Television series by Tollin/Robbins Productions Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Fictional African-American people ","title":"Cousin Skeeter"},{"id":"2086847","text":"Ostraciidae is a family of squared, bony fish belonging to the order Tetraodontiformes, closely related to the pufferfishes and filefishes. Fish in the family are known variously as boxfishes, cofferfishes, cowfishes and trunkfishes. It contains about 23 extant species in 6 extant genera. Description Members of this family occur in a variety of different colors, and are notable for the hexagonal or \\"honeycomb\\" patterns on their skin. They swim in a rowing manner. Their hexagonal plate-like scales are fused together into a solid, triangular or box-like carapace, from which the fins, tail, eyes and mouth protrude. Because of these heavy armoured scales, Ostraciidae are limited to slow movements, but few other fish are able to eat the adults. Ostraciid boxfish of the genus Lactophrys also secrete poisons from their skin into the surrounding water, further protecting them from predation. Although the adults are in general quite square in shape, young Ostraciidae are more rounded. The young often exhibit brighter colors than the adults. The scrawled cowfish, Acanthostracion quadricornis, can grow up to in length, but is generally smaller at higher latitudes. =Range= Ostraciids occur in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, generally at middle latitudes, although the common or buffalo trunkfish (Lactophrys trigonus) which lives mainly in Florida waters may be found as far north as Cape Cod. =Toxic defences= The various members of this family are able to secrete cationic surfactants through their skin which can act as a chemical defense mechanism.Abdulhaqq, A.J. & Shier, W.T. (1991): Icthyocrinotoxins and their potential use as shark repellents. Journal of Toxicology-Toxin Reviews, 10 (3): 289-320. An example of this is pahutoxin, a water-soluble, crystalline chemical toxin that is contained in mucus secreted from the skin of Ostracion lentiginosus and other members of the trunkfish family when they are under stress. Pahutoxin is a choline chloride ester of 3-acetoxypalmitic acid that behaves similarly to steroidal saponins found in echinoderms. When this toxic mucus is released from the fish, it quickly dissolves in the environment and negatively affects any fish in the surrounding area. It is possible since this toxin resembles certain detergents so closely, that adding these detergents as pollutants to seawater has potential to interfere with receptor-mediated processes in marine life.

He was born in Hamburg, Germany, to a white German mother and a black Liberian Vai father, the grandson of Momulu Massaquoi, the consul general of Liberia in Germany at the time. Childhood in Germany Massaquoi's paternal grandfather Momulu as King of the Gallinas in 1905. In his autobiography, Destined to Witness, Massaquoi describes his childhood and youth in Hamburg during the Nazi rise to power. His autobiography provides a unique point of view: he was one of the very few German-born children of German and African descent in all of Nazi Germany. He was often shunned but miraculously escaped Nazi persecution. This duality remained a key theme throughout his early life until he witnessed racism as practiced in colonial Africa and later in the Jim Crow American South. Massaquoi enjoyed a relatively happy childhood with his mother, Bertha Baetz, who had arrived to Hamburg from Nordhausen and earlier from Ungfrungen. His father, Al-Haj Massaquoi, was a prince of the Vai people that was in Dublin studying law and who only occasionally lived with the family at the consul general's home in Hamburg. Eventually, his grandfather Momulu, the first African posted to the diplomatic corps in Europe, was recalled to Liberia, and Hans Massaquoi and his mother remained in Germany. The early adaptability of the young Massaquoi was remarkable. He was not aware of any other mixed race children in Hamburg, and like most German children his age, he was lured by Nazi propaganda into thinking that joining the Hitler Youth was an exciting adventure of fanfare and games and wished to join.Massaquoi, H J: Destined to Witness, page 80. Fusion Press, 2002 There was a school contest to see if a class could get a 100% membership of the Deutsches Jungvolk (a subdivision of Hitler Youth), and Massaquoi's teacher devised a chart on the blackboard which showed who had joined and who had not. As the chart was filled in after each person joined, Massaquoi was pointedly the sole student left out. He recalled saying, \\"But I am German ... my Mother says I'm German just like anybody else\\". His later attempt to join his friends by registering at the nearest Jungvolk office was also met with contempt. Massaquoi's denial of this rite of passage reinforced his perception of being ostracized due to being deemed \\"Non-Aryan\\" despite his German birth and mostly traditional German upbringing after his grandfather returned to Liberia. After the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935, Massaquoi was officially classified as non-Aryan. As such, though highly capable and would have been eligible had he not been bi-racial, he was barred from pursuing educational advancement leading to a professional career and instead was forced by the Nazis to embark on an apprenticeship as a laborer. A few months before completing school, Massaquoi was required to go to a government-run job center where his assigned vocational counselor was Herr von Vett, a member of the SS. Upon seeing the \\"telltale black SS insignia of dual lightning bolts in the lapel of his civilian suit\\",Massaquoi, H J: Destined to Witness, page 118. Fusion Press, 2002 Massaquoi expected humiliation. Instead, he was surprised when he was greeted with \\"a friendly wink\\", offered a seat and asked to present something which he had made. After showing Von Vett an axe and discussing his experience in working for a local blacksmith shop, Massaquoi was informed that he could \\"be of great service to Germany one day\\" because there would be a great demand for technically trained Germans who would go to Africa to train and develop an African workforce when Germany reclaimed its African colonies.Massaquoi, H J: Destined to Witness, page 119. Fusion Press, 2002 Before Massaquoi left the interview, Von Vett invited him to shake his hand, an unusual move not in keeping with other Nazi officials Massaquoi had encountered outside of his neighborhood.Massaquoi, H J: Destined to Witness, page 118-119. Fusion Press, 2002 Though barred from dating Aryans, Massaquoi courted a white girl, but they had to keep their relationship a secret, especially as her father was a member of the police and the SS. Such relationships were forbidden and classified as Rassenschande (race defilement) by the race laws. To keep the relationship secret, they met only in the evenings, when they would go for walks. As he dropped his girlfriend off at her house one night, he was stopped by a member of the SD, the intelligence branch of the SS. He was taken to the police station as he was believed to be \\"on the prowl for defenseless women or looking for an opportunity to steal\\".Massaquoi, H J: Destined to Witness, page 136. Fusion Press, 2002 However, he was recognized by a police officer as living in the area and working: \\"This young man is an apprentice at Lindner A.G., where he works much too hard to have enough energy left to prowl the streets at night looking for trouble. I happen to know that because of the son of one of my colleagues apprentices with him\\". The SD officer closed the case and gave the Nazi salute, and Massaquoi was allowed to leave the station. Increasingly as he matured, Massaquoi came to despise Hitler and Nazism. His skin color made him a target for racist abuse. However, in contrast to European Jews or the Roma-Sinti people and many other politically targeted enemies of Hitler's hegemony, Massaquoi escaped extermination most likely due to the fact that individuals of African descent were not as viciously antagonized. He was often targeted by Nazi employers, denied citizenship and was excluded from serving in the German army during World War II. As unemployment, hunger, and poverty grew rampant, he tried to enlist, but he was once again abusively castigated and rejected by Nazi officers. During the period following the Allies near destruction of Hamburg, he befriended the family of Ralph Giordano, a half- Jewish acquaintance of the surreptitious Swing Kids jazz devotees. The Giordanos managed to survive the war by hiding and helped Massaquoi and his mother secure a nearby basement after their Hamburg neighborhood was destroyed. Giordano, a lifelong friend, became a renowned journalist as well. Emigration In 1948 Massaquoi's father, Al-Haj, secured his passage for residency in Liberia. Massaquoi was fascinated and chagrined by Africa. While appreciative that his father made possible his escape from post-World War II Germany, he eventually grew estranged from his father, whom he considered arrogant and somewhat tyrannical. However, the two reconciled just before his father's death which preceded Massaquoi's reconnecting with his maternal family in the United States. Massaquoi emigrated to the United States in 1950. He served two years in the army as a paratrooper in the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and fought in the Korean War. He later became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His GI bill helped fund his journalism degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and he worked on his masters at Northwestern University until the impending birth of his first son catapulted into his career at Jet magazine and then Ebony magazine, where he became managing editor. His position allowed him to interview many historical figures of the arts, politics and civil rights movement in America and Africa. He was interviewed in turn by Studs Terkel for his oral history The Good War, and related his unique experiences in Germany under the Nazi government. Massaquoi visited family and friends in Germany many times throughout his life, always cognizant of Germany's complex history as the country of his childhood. Personal life At the time of his death, Massaquoi was married to Katharine Rousseve Massaquoi. He had two sons by a previous marriage, Steve and Hans Jr., who also survived him.Hans Massaquoi family References External links *Growing up Black in Nazi Germany Category:1926 births Category:2013 deaths Category:American magazine editors Category:American male journalists Category:American male writers Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:German people of Liberian descent Category:Journalists from Hamburg Category:United States Army soldiers Category:University of Illinois alumni Category:Massaquoi family Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States ","title":"Hans Massaquoi"},{"id":"2086853","text":"Pioneer Courthouse Square in downtown Portland Tourism in Portland, Oregon is a profitable industry that serves many.

The six-and-a-half mile standard gauge line was the only section built of a plan to connect Shrewsbury with mid Wales. It was part of a joint venture between the Great Western Railway and London and North Western Railway companies. History =Plans= The route, which was conceived in the late 1850s, was planned to connect Shrewsbury via Hanwood on the Cambrian Line, with Pontesbury, Minsterley, Montgomery and Newtown. Services would also be able to continue to the Welsh coast. At Pontesbury station, transfer sidings connected the narrow gauge Snailbeach District Railway, which ran to lead mines at Snailbeach. =Opening= On 14 February 1861, the first section of line was opened from Cruckmeole Junction, on the Cambrian Line, to Minsterley. However, with the northerly section of the Cambrian main line into Wales opening the following year in 1862 (connecting Newtown via Welshpool to Shrewsbury), it became apparent there was little need to continue beyond Minsterley to Newtown. The station became the terminus of the cancelled project. =Decline and closure= By the start of World War II, regular traffic on the line had almost ended. Passenger services ceased to Minsterley in 1951, although Hanwood station on the Cambrian Line remained open to passengers until 1960 and to goods until 1964. The rest of the branch line to Minsterley continued to carry goods (mainly for the Minsterley Creamery) until 1967 when the line was closed as part of the Beeching cuts. The track was lifted after closure. Minsterley site today The former terminus at Minsterley is now a large meat factory (a large dairy- related factory also exists on either side of the old trackbed just before the terminus) and the stationmaster's house has been converted to a private residence.

Early life Brandon was born in 1912 in Berlin, Germany, the son of Hildegard and Hugo R. von Kleinbach, a merchant. His parents emigrated to the United States while he was still an infant. After attending Stanford University, where he was a member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity,Photograph of Kleinbach 1929/30, Stanford University Library, Photo ID:15352. http://insight.stanford.edu/luna/servlet/detail/stanford~4~1~18160~116875?qvq=w4s:/what/Kleinbach, Henry;lc:Stanford~11~1,Stanford~6~1,Stanford~3~1,Stanford~4~1&mi;=0&trs;=2 he trained as a theatre actor at the Pasadena Community Playhouse and subsequently performed on Broadway, continuing to return to the stage periodically throughout his career. Film career He made his motion picture debut in 1932 as an uncredited spectator at the Colosseum in The Sign of the Cross. At age 22 in 1934, he played the role of Silas Barnaby, the villain in the Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy classic Babes in Toyland. In 1936, having until then been performing under his real name of Henry Kleinbach, he adopted the stage name of Henry Brandon. He portrayed the villainous manager of an opera company in Our Gang Follies of 1938. He played the character of Renouf, a deserter from the French Foreign Legion, in the 1939 remake of Beau Geste. In 1940, he featured in the title role of the successful Republic serial Drums of Fu Manchu. In 1943, he played Major Ruck, a British secret agent in the guise of an SS officer in Edge of Darkness. Brandon, standing at 6 ft 4\\" in height, managed to make Errol Flynn look short in the scenes in which they appeared together in Edge of Darkness in spite of Flynn's height of 6 ft 2\\". In 1948 he appeared as Giles de Rais in Joan of Arc. He played a French army captain in Vera Cruz (1954). He portrayed Jesse James in Hell's Crossroads (1957). In 1958, he portrayed Acacius Page in Auntie Mame. In 1959, he played the role of Gator Joe in \\"Woman in the River\\" in the crime drama Bourbon Street Beat. On October 12, 1959 he played the role of Jason in Euripides' Medea as a part of the Play of the Week television series. =As non-European characters= Brandon often played non-European characters, especially Native Americans in Westerns. He also played the Chinese villain Fu Manchu. The successful serial Drums of Fu Manchu (1940) with Brandon in the title role was cancelled by its producer Republic Pictures at the express request of the State Department in 1941 after the U.S. entry into World War II out of concern that it was inciting anti-Chinese sentiment in the American public, which conflicted both with the interests of the Chinese-American population and the international relationship with China as an allied power in the war against Japan. He appeared as the African tribal chieftain M'Tara in Tarzan and the She-Devil (1953). In 1956, he played the chief villain, a Comanche chieftain called Scar, in John Ford's The Searchers. In 1960, he played a Native American character again as Running Wolf in the episode \\"Gold Seeker\\" in the television series The Rebel. He played Asian characters in two 1961 episodes, viz. \\"Angel of Death\\" and \\"The Assassins\\", of the television series Adventures in Paradise. In 1961, he played an American Indian chieftain again in John Ford's Two Rode Together. In 1965, he played the Shug chief in the pilot episode of F Troop. Personal life Brandon married in 1941, the marriage produced one son before ending in 1946.'Henry Brandon: King of the Bogeymen', by Bill Cassara & Richard Greene (Pub. BearManor Media, 2018). He subsequently had a long relationship with the actor Mark Herron.Lynn Kear, James King, Evelyn Brent: The Life and Films of Hollywood's Lady Crook, McFarland, 2009, p.224 Herron left Brandon in the mid-1960s, and was briefly the fourth husband of Judy Garland. Herron and Garland separated after five months of marriage, after which Herron returned to Brandon and remained with him until Brandon's death. Death Brandon lived in West Hollywood in his final years. He died on 15 February 1990 at the age of 77 of a heart attack at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. His body was cremated, and the ashes reportedly were scattered at an undisclosed theatre location.Obituary for 'Henry Brandon', New York Times, 22 February 1990. https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/22/obituaries/henry-brandon-77-stage-and-film- actor.htmlEntry for Henry Brandon, Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, by S.

It formerly aired on Sunday afternoons at 1PM (1:30PM in Newfoundland and Labrador), as well as on Saturday evenings on 6:30PM with repeats on Friday mornings at 11 AM. It was replaced in September 2006 by a comedy show The Debaters. The show travelled around Canada, recording in front of a live audience at various local venues. The show provided a mix of stand-up, improvisational, sketch, and musical comedy. Elliott usually began the show with a monologue, and introduced the acts that followed, often comedians who were local to the area, who were given the chance of national exposure through the program. Elliott's work first caught the attention of CBC with the airing of one of his concert performances on Definitely Not the Opera. He also did additional comedy segments for other CBC radio shows, including Basic Black, Sunday Showcase and Morningside. He was given the retiring Royal Canadian Air Farce's traditional radio show timeslot in 1996, and the show became a regular weekly showcase of Canadian comedy. The name of the show was derived from a line used by famous Canadian humourist Stephen Leacock in his story \\"Gertrude the Governess\\". (\\"Lord Ronald said nothing; he flung himself from the room, flung himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions.\\") This phrase was both literally and figuratively applicable, as the show travelled across Canada, and the host and his guests covered the full range of the comedy spectrum. There were two years that the format was changed, and Elliott travelled exclusively to smaller venues, accompanied only by Derek Edwards. These tours were intended to be more intimate affairs, and also served as a bit of a break for Elliott, as the pared-down format required much less planning and arranging. After a summer series consisting of repeats in 2006, the show was quietly replaced by The Debaters in its former timeslots.

A pink-collar worker is someone working in the care-oriented career field or in fields historically considered to be women‚Äôs work. This may include jobs in the beauty industry, nursing, social work, teaching, secretarial work, or child care. While these jobs may also be filled by men, they are typically female-dominated and may pay significantly less than white-collar or blue-collar jobs. Etymology The term pink-collar was popularized in the late 1970s by writer and social critic Louise Kapp Howe to denote women working as nurses, secretaries, and elementary school teachers. Its origins, however, go back to the early 1970s, to when the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was placed before the states for ratification. At that time, the term was used to denote secretarial staff as well as non-professional office staff, all of which were largely held by women. These positions were not white-collar jobs, but neither were they blue- collar, manual labor. Hence, the creation of the term \\"pink-collar,\\" which indicated it was not white-collar, was nonetheless an office job and one that was overwhelmingly filled by women.  Occupations  Pink-collar occupations tend to be personal-service-oriented worker working in retail, nursing, and teaching (depending on the level), are part of the service sector, and are among the most common occupations in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that, as of May 2008, there were over 2.2 million persons employed as servers in the United States. Furthermore, the World Health Organization's 2011 World Health Statistics Report states that there are 19.3 million nurses in the world today. In the United States, women comprise 92.1% of the registered nurses that are currently employed. Pink-collar occupations include:  Background (United States)  Historically, women were responsible for the running of a household.Ware 1982, p. 17 Their financial security was often dependent upon a male patriarch. Widowed or divorced women struggled to support themselves and their children.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 333 Western women began to develop more opportunities when they moved into the paid workplace, formerly of the male domain. In the mid 19th and early 20th century women aimed to be treated as the equals to their male counterparts, notably in the Seneca Falls Convention. In 1920 American women legally gained the right to vote, marking a turning point for the American women's suffrage movement; yet race and class remained as impediments to voting for some women. At the turn of the 19th century into the 20th, large numbers of single women in the United States traveled to large cities such as New York where they found work in factories and sweatshops, working for low pay operating sewing machines, sorting feathers, rolling tobacco and other similar menial tasks.Gourley 2008, p. 103 In these factories, workers frequently breathed dangerous fumes and worked with flammable materials.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 239 In order for factories to save money, women were required to clean and adjust the machines while they were running, which resulted in accidents where women lost their fingers or hands. Many women who worked in the factories earned meager wages for working long hours in unsafe conditions and as a result lived in poverty. Throughout the 20th century women such as Emily Balch, Jane Addams, and Lillian Wald were advocates for evolving the roles of women in America.Gourley 2008, p. 99. These women created settlement houses and launched missions in overcrowded squalid immigrant neighborhoods to offer social services to women and children. In addition, women gradually became more involved with church activities and came to take on more leadership roles in various religious societies. The women who joined these societies worked with their members, some of whom were full-time teachers, nurses, missionaries, and social workers to accomplish their leadership tasks. The Association for the Sociology of Religion was the first to elect a woman president in 1938. = World War I and II = A U.S. Navy recruiting poster from World War II, showing an officer of the Navy WAVES before a hospital ship This poster made in 1942 titled \\"We Can Do It!\\" captures the WWII era cultural icon Rosie the Riveter depicted by J. Howard Miller who created this poster as an inspirational image to boost female worker morale. World War I sparked a demand for \\"pink-collar jobs\\" as the military needed personnel to type letters, answer phones, and perform other secretarial tasks. One thousand women worked for the U.S. Navy as stenographers, clerks, and telephone operators.Gourley 2008, p. 119 In addition, Military nurses, an already \\"feminized\\" and accepted profession for women, expanded during wartime. In 1917, Louisa Lee Schuyler opened the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing, which was the first to train women as professional nurses.Gourley 2008, p. 123 After completing training, female nurses worked in hospitals or more predominantly in field tents. World War II marked the emergence of large numbers of women working domestically in industrial jobs to assist in the war effort as directed under the War Manpower Commission which recruited women to fill war manufacturing jobs. Notably, American women in World War II joined the armed services and were stationed domestically and abroad through participation in non combat military roles and as medical personnel. One thousand female pilots joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots, one hundred and forty thousand women joined the Women's Army Corps and one hundred thousand women joined the U.S. Navy as nurses through WAVES in addition to administrative staff.  The 20th Century Female Working World (United States)  This graph shows the increase in women graduating high school and attending college, while there is a decrease in high school dropouts. A typical job sought by working women in the early 20th century was a telephone operator or Hello Girl. The Hello Girls began as women who operated on telephone switchboards during WWI by answering telephones and talking to impatient callers in a calming tone. The workers would sit on stools facing a wall with hundreds of outlets and tiny blinking lights. They had to work quickly when a light flashed by plugging the cord into the proper outlet. Despite the difficult work, many women wanted this job because it paid five dollars a week and provided a rest lounge for the employees to take a break. Female secretaries were also popular. They were instructed to be efficient, tough, and hardworking while also appearing soft, accommodating, and subservient. Women were expected to be the protector and partner to their boss behind closed doors and a helpmate in public. These women were encouraged to go to charm schools and express their personality through fashion instead of furthering their education. Social work became a female-dominated profession in the 1930s, emphasizing a group professional identity and the casework method.Ware 1982, p. 74 Social workers gave crucial expertise for the expansion of federal, state and local government, as well as services to meet the needs of the Depression. Teachers in primary and secondary schools remained female, although as the war progressed, women began to move on to better employment and higher salaries.Ware 1982, p. 102 In 1940, teaching positions paid less than $1,500 a year and fell to $800 in rural areas. Women scientists found it hard to gain appointments at universities. Women scientists were forced to take positions in high schools, state or women's colleges, governmental agencies and alternative institutions such as libraries or museums. Women who took jobs at such places often did clerical duties and though some held professional positions, these boundaries were blurred. Some found work as human computers. Mostly women were hired as librarians, who had been professionalized and feminized from the late 19th century. In 1920, women accounted for 88% of librarians in the United States. Two-thirds of the American Geographical Society (AGS)'s employees were women, who served as librarians, editorial personnel in the publishing programs, secretaries, research editors, copy editors, proofreaders, research assistants and sales staff. These women came with credentials from well-known colleges and universities and many were overqualified for their positions, but later were promoted to more prestigious positions. Although female employees did not receive equal pay, they did get sabbaticals to attend university and to travel for their professions at the cost of the AGS. Those women working managerial and library or museums positions made an impact on women in the work force, but still encountered discrimination when they tried to advance. In the 1940s, clerical work expanded to occupy the largest number of women employees, this field diversified as it moved into commercial service.Susan M. Hartmann, The Home Front and Beyond (Boston, MA: G.K. Hall &Co.;, 1982), p. 94. The average worker in the 1940s was over 35 years old, married, and needed to work to keep their families afloat.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 314 During the 1950s, women were taught that marriage and domesticity were more important than a career. Most women followed this path because of the uncertainty of the post-war years.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 326 Suburban housewives were encouraged to have hobbies like bread making and sewing. The 1950s housewife was in conflict between being \\"just a housewife\\" because their upbringing taught them competition and achievement. Many women had furthered their education deriving a sense of self-worth.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 332 = Pay = A single woman working in a factory in the early 20th century earned less than $8 a week, which is equivalent to roughly less that $98 dollars a week today. If the woman was absent or was late, employers penalized them by docking their pay.Gourley 2008, p. 105 These women would live in boarding houses costing $1.50 a week, waking at 5:30 a.m. to start their ten-hour work day. When women entered the paid workforce in the 1920s they were paid less than men because employers thought the women's jobs were temporary. Employers also paid women less than men because they believed in the \\"Pin Money Theory\\", which said that women's earnings were secondary to that of their male counterparts. With this being said, women took typical jobs that were \\"considerably less substantial than their husbands' in terms of both the average number of hours worked per week as well as continuity over time\\".Silver, Hilary. \\"Housework and Domestic Work,\\" Sociological Forum 182 no.2 (1993). However, working women still experienced stress and overload because they were still responsible for the majority of the housework and taking care of the children. This left women isolated and subjected them to their husband's control. In the early 1900s women's pay was one to three dollars a week and much of that went to living expenses.Archer, Jules (1991). Breaking Barriers (New York: The Penguin Group), p. 27. In the 1900s female tobacco strippers earned five dollars a week, half of what their male coworkers made and seamstresses made six to seven dollars a week compared to a cutter's salary of $16.Woloch 1984, p. 27 This differed from women working in factories in the 1900s as they were paid by the piece, not receiving a fixed weekly wage.Humowitz Weissman 1978, pp. 236‚Äì237 Those that were pinching pennies pushed themselves to produce more product so that they earned more money. Women who earned enough to live on found it impossible to keep their salary rate from being reduced because bosses often made \\"mistakes\\" in computing a worker's piece rate.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 240 As well as this, women who received this kind of treatment did not disagree for fear of losing their jobs. Employers would frequently deduct pay for work they deemed imperfect and for simply trying to lighten the mood by laughing or talking while they worked. In the 1937 a woman's average yearly salary was $525 compared to a man's salary of $1,027. In the 1940s two-thirds of the women who were in the labor force suffered a decrease in earnings; the average weekly paychecks fell from $50 to $37. This gap in wage stayed consistent, as women in 1991 only earned seventy percent of what men earned regardless of their education. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s as women began to fight for equality, they fought against discrimination in jobs where women worked and the educational institutions that would lead to those jobs. In 1973 the average salaries for women were 57% compared to those of men, but this gender earnings gap was especially noticeable in pink-collar jobs where the largest number of women were employed.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 364 Women were given routine, less responsible jobs available and often with a lower pay than men. These jobs were monotonous and mechanical often with assembly-line procedures.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 304 In 1975, a study was carried out that examined the pay differences between single and married women. It was found that married women made substantially less than single women, as single women made up to 97% of what a single man would make and married women would only make up to 62% of married men's pay. This was found to potentially be because of taking maternity leaves, as less work related experience would be gained in the time that these women left to care for their children, leading to less investment from the company. It was also found that women now are more likely to join or re-join the work force after having children, rather than the traditional role of becoming a stay at home mother. = Education = Women entering the workforce had difficulty finding a satisfactory job without references or an education.Gourley 2008, p. 104 However, opportunities for higher education expanded as women were admitted to all-male schools like the United States service academies and Ivy League strongholds.Woloch 1984, p. 525 Education became a way for society to shape women into its ideal housewife. In the 1950s, authorities and educators encouraged college because they found new value in vocational training for domesticity.Woloch 1984, p. 500 College prepared women for future roles because while men and women were taught together, they were groomed for different paths after they graduated.Woloch 1984, p. 405 Education started out as a way to teach women how to be a good wife, but education also allowed women to broaden their minds. Being educated was an expectation for women entering the paying workforce, despite the fact that their male equivalents did not need a high school diploma.Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 316 While in college, a woman would experience extracurricular activities, such as a sorority, that offered a separate space for the woman to practice types of social service work that was expected from her.Woloch 1984, p. 404 However, not all of a woman's education was done in the classroom. Women were also educated through their peers through \\"dating\\". Men and women no longer had to be supervised when alone together. Dating allowed men and women to practice the paired activities that would later become a way of life. New women's organizations sprouted up working to reform and protect women in the workplace. The largest and most prestigious of these organizations was The General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC), whose members were conservative middle-class housewives. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) was formed after women shirtwaist makers went on strike in New York City in 1909. It started as a small walkout, with a handful of members from one shop and grew to a force of ten of thousands, changing the course of the labor movement forever. In 1910 women allied themselves with the Progressive Party who sought to reform social issues. Another organization that grew out of women in the workforce, was the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor. The Women's Bureau regulated conditions for women employees. As female labor became a crucial part of the economy, efforts by the Women's Bureau increased. The Bureau pushed for employers to take advantage of \\"women-power\\" and persuaded women to enter the employment market. In 1913 the ILGWU signed the well-known \\"protocol in the Dress and Waist Industry\\" which was the first contract between labor and management settled by outside negotiators. The contract formalized the trade's division of labor by gender. Another win for women came in 1921 when congress passed the Sheppard-Towner Act, a welfare measure intended to reduce infant and maternal mortality; it was the first federally funded healthcare act. The act provided federal funds to establish health centers for prenatal and child care. Expectant mothers and children could receive health checkups and health advice. In 1963 the Equal Pay Act was passed making it the first federal law against sex discrimination, equal pay for equal work, and made employers hire women workers if they qualified from the start. Unions also became a major outlet for women to fight against the unfair treatment they experienced. Women who joined these types of unions stayed before and after work to talk about the benefits of the union, collect dues, obtain charters, and form bargaining committees. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was approved in May 1933. The NRA negotiated codes designed to rekindle production. It raised wages, shortened workers' hours, and increased employment for the first time maximizing hour and minimizing wage provisions benefiting female workers. The NRA had its flaws however, it only covered half of the women in the workforce particularly manufacturing and trade. The NRA regulated working conditions only for women with a job and did not offer any relief for the two million unemployed women who desperately needed it. The 1930s proved successful for women in the workplace thanks to federal relief programs and the growth of unions. For the first time women were not completely dependent on themselves, in 1933 the federal government expanded in its responsibility to female workers. In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act grew out of several successful strikes. Two million women joined the workforce during the Great Depression despite negative public opinion. Pink ghetto \\"Pink ghetto\\" is a term used to refer to jobs dominated by women. The term was coined in 1983 to describe the limits women have in furthering their careers since the jobs are often dead-end, stressful and underpaid. The term pink ghetto is just simply another way of describing pink- collar work. Pink ghetto was more commonly used in the early years, when women were finally able to work. Pink-collar work became the popular term once it was popularized by Louise Kapp Howe, a writer and social critic, in the 1970s. Pink ghetto can also describe the placement of female managers into positions that will not lead them to the board room, thus perpetuating the \\"glass ceiling\\". This includes managing areas such as human resources, customer service, and other areas that do not contribute to the corporate \\"bottom line\\". While this allows women to rise in ranks as a manager, their careers may eventually stall out and they may be excluded from the upper echelons.  Pink or Velvet Ghetto in the field of Public Relations  The pink collar ghetto, also known as the velvet ghetto, concerns the phenomena of women entering a certain field employment and subsequently the status and pay grade of this profession drops along with the new influx of women workers. Some scholars, such as Elizabeth Toth, claim this is partially the result of women taking technician roles instead of managerial roles, being less likely to negotiate higher pay, and being perceived as putting family life before work . Other scholars, such as Kim Golombisky, acknowledge the inequalities of women, and especially women of color and different classes, as part of the cause of this phenomenon. Traditionally, Feminism in public relations focuses on gender equality, but new scholarship makes claims that focusing on social justice would better aid feminist cause in the field. This brings the idea of intersectionalism to the pink collar ghetto. The issue is not caused by what women lack as professionals, but caused by larger societal injustices and interlocking systems of oppression.  Male integration  Scholars such as Judy Wajcman argue that technology has long been monopolized by men and is a great source of their power historically. However, more millennial men are doing pink collar work because technology is affecting blue collar work. Machines are able to perform many of the tasks that were typically gendered male within factories. In a 1990 study conducted by Allan H. Hunt and Timothy L. Hunt, they examined how industrial robots would impact both the creation of jobs as well as job displacement among unskilled workers in the United States. It was concluded that the impact of unemployment due to the spread of robotics would be felt the greatest by uneducated, unskilled blue-collar workers. New technology in the form of robotics eliminates many semi or unskilled jobs, and has taken traditional male filled roles away from the job market. Judy Wajman maintains that skills involving machines and strength are associated with masculinity. This means that the least technical jobs (pink-collar) jobs are associated with women. These machines designed by men, using the technology they have always monopolized, are now displacing them and forcing them into feminized pink-collar work. It was found as well that men going into traditionally claimed pink collar jobs are felt discriminated and threatened in their jobs. Men going into positions such as teaching, nursing and childcare faced many negative stereotypes in these lines of work, as men have traditionally been viewed as stern, strong and holding dominant attitudes. This stereotype about men negatively impacts men in these lines of work, as it is expected that a woman with the same position would be more nurturing, caring and well suited for the work.

The Philippi Collection. The Papal shoes were the red leather outdoor shoes worn by the Pope. They should not be confused with the indoor Papal slippers or the Episcopal sandals, which are the liturgical footwear proper to all ordained Catholic bishops of the Latin Rite. Description As did many noblemen, the Pope wore slippers (pantofole) inside his residences and leather shoes outside. The indoor Papal Slippers were made of red velvet or silk and were heavily decorated in gold braid, with a gold cross in the middle. Throughout Church history, the color red has been deliberately chosen to represent the blood of Catholic martyrs spilt through the centuries following in the footsteps of Christ. The red papal shoes are also linked to Christ's own bloodied feet as he was prodded, whipped, and pushed along the Via Dolorosa on his way to his crucifixion, culminating in the piercing of his hands and feet on the cross. The red shoes also symbolize the submission of the Pope to the ultimate authority of Jesus Christ. Beyond this, it is said the red papal shoes also signify God‚Äôs burning love for humanity as exhibited during Pentecost when red vestments are worn to commemorate the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles as tongues of fire rest upon their heads. The papal shoes, along with the camauro, papal mozzetta, and cloak (tabarro), are the only remnants of the former red color of the papal garments. Pope Pius V (1566 - 1572), who was a Dominican, changed the papal color to white by continuing to wear the white color of his Dominican religious order, and it has remained so since. Recent use Before 1969, the Pope, like all bishops and prelates, wore episcopal sandals during the Mass. The color of the Episcopal sandals varied to match the liturgical color of the Mass. The Papal outdoor shoes were made of plain red Morocco leather and had a wide cross in gold braid. The cross once extended across the shoe and down to the sole. In the eighteenth century the ends of the cross were shortened, as shown in the photo of Pius VII's shoes. This old-fashioned type of dress shoe is very thin-soled and is sometimes called \\"pantofola liscia\\" or smooth slipper model. After 1958, Pope John XXIII added gold buckles to the outdoor papal shoes, making them similar to the red shoes worn by cardinals outside of Rome. Pope Paul VI eliminated the gold cross and completely discontinued the custom of kissing the papal foot. Paul VI can be seen wearing red buckled shoes in photographs from his 1964 trip to Jerusalem. In 1969, Paul VI abolished buckles from all ecclesiastical shoes, which had been customarily required at the Papal Court and for prelates. He also discontinued the use of the indoor velvet papal slippers and the Paschal mozzetta and shoes. Paul VI wore plain red leather shoes throughout the rest of his pontificate. Pope John Paul I, who was pope for only 33 days, continued wearing the plain red leather shoes as worn by Paul VI. Early in his pontificate Pope John Paul II wore red shoes; however he later adopted wearing brown shoes. Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II were buried in the red leather papal shoes. Pope Benedict XVI restored the use of the red papal shoes, which were provided by his personal cobbler, Adriano Stefanelli of Novara, who has several pictures and documents in his shoe-shop attesting the fact. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI also restored the use of the white damask silk Paschal mozzetta, which was previously worn with white silk slippers. The current pope, Pope Francis, has chosen to wear black shoes, forgoing the tradition for his pontificate.

AOML's research spans tropical cyclone and hurricanes, coastal ecosystems, oceans and human health, climate studies, global carbon systems, and ocean observations. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs). AOML‚Äôs organizational structure consists of an Office of the Director and three scientific research divisions. The Office of the Director oversees the Laboratory‚Äôs scientific programs, as well as its financial, administrative, computer, outreach/education, and facility management services. Research programs are augmented by the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a joint enterprise with the University of Miami‚Äôs Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. CIMAS enables AOML and university scientists to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and facilitates the participation of students and visiting scientists. The Laboratory is a member of a unique community of marine research and educational institutions located on Virginia Key in Miami, Florida. Approximately $150M per year is invested in marine science and education among the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the Miami Seaquarium, the Maritime and Science Technology Academy (MAST Academy). History The deeper roots of AOML can be traced to the oceanographic investigations of the U.S. Coast Survey beginning in the mid-19th century under the direction of Professor Alexander Dallas Bache, great grandson of Benjamin Franklin and a preeminent U.S. science figure of the age. In subsequent decades, the urgency of charting coastal waters in support of growing commerce, a task increased by the acquisition of Alaska, Hawaii, and other island territories, came to require all the resources of the Coast Survey. The modern era can be considered to have begun during the 1960s. In early 1966, an Institute for Oceanography was created, primarily from research groups of the then U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA, forerunner of NOAA). The following year the Institute was relocated to Miami for a variety of reasons, including the presence already in Miami of meteorological research groups of ESSA dedicated to hurricane research, and air-sea interaction was a hot topic of the time in weather research. All of these groups were reorganized as the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories (AOML) and by 1973 took occupancy in the new laboratory constructed on Virginia Key. New projects include expansion of the use of satellite and locally operated remote sensing techniques to enhance the coverage and detail of observations. Outreach via electronic communication is enabling AOML to serve a larger constituency with access to oceanographic and meteorological observations. Research AOML conducts research that seeks to understand the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and processes of the ocean and atmosphere, both separately and as a coupled system. The Laboratory‚Äôs research themes (oceans and climate, coastal ecosystems, and hurricanes and tropical meteorology) employ a cross-disciplinary approach, conducted through collaborative interactions with national and international research and environmental forecasting institutions. =Oceans and its link to extreme weather and climate= AOML carries out interdisciplinary scientific investigations of the physics of ocean currents and water properties, and on the role of the ocean in climate, extreme weather events, and ecosystems. The tools used to carry out these studies range from sensors on deep ocean moorings to satellite-based instruments to measurements made on research and commercial shipping vessels and autonomous vehicles, and include data analysis and numerical modeling as well as theoretical approaches. AOML manages, leads, or participate in the design, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of several key components of the global ocean observing system and, with these and other data, conducts research in several areas including: * Meridional Overturning Circulation * Tropical Atlantic variability * Oceans and extreme weather (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, etc.) * Physical oceanography * Oceans and ecosystems * Global carbon cycle * Research to Applications and Operations * Development of oceanographic instrumentation =Coastal ecosystems= Coastal and regional ecosystem research has been a focus of AOML activities for more than two decades. Current interdisciplinary field efforts include physical, biological, and chemical studies supporting the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) effort and the underlying health of this ecosystem to the regional Intra- Americas Sea program, as well as the status and health of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.

Formerly Alburquerque had one of the longest and heaviest pythons in captivity, with a length of , weighing and with a girth of . This female python died in 2013, but the mounted creature is still exhibited.  Etymology  * The town was formerly called \\"Sagunto\\", but according to the research of Jess Tirol of Bohol, it was called \\"Segunto\\". * Local folklore holds that Alburquerque was named in honour of Afonso de Albuquerque, the famous Portuguese seafarer and conqueror of Malacca, Sumatra, though it might be odd to use a Portuguese name as a name of a place which is under Spanish control. * The name Alburquerque, which comes from either albus querqus (\\"white oak\\" in Latin) or (\\"country of cork oaks\\" in Arabic), is very widespread in all of the Americas and the Philippines. Since then, Segunto was changed to Alburquerque and its inhabitants are called Alburanons (Alburquerque√±os in Spanish, Alburquerqueans in English).  History  During the Spanish era, the way to travel around Bohol was by sea. Many coastal areas with a sheltered cove or harbor became progressive settlements. Among them was a place called \\"Lo-oc\\", Baclayon, Bohol. It was a sheltered cove good for berthing seacraft. It was also the breeding place of the \\"Bulinaw\\". Since Lo-oc was relatively far from the poblacion, the people had difficulty in attending Holy Mass on Sundays. Accordingly, they had the idea of constructing their own chapel and having a priest from Baclayon come to serve the people. Lady Mariona Irag, a prominent lady in the community took the mantle of leadership. In 1842, she requested the parish priest of Baclayon, Fr. Pedro de la Encarnacion, to supervise the construction of the chapel, a school, and a convent to be built by the people. The construction of these structures gave way to the establishment of Lo-oc as a barrio under the civil and religious jurisdiction of Baclayon and it was renamed Segunto after a town in Catalu√±a, Spain. The first kapitan of the place was Pedro Jala who lived in the sitio of Carnago and was the leader of Segunto. Carnago was a barrio separated from the town. Its name was changed to Sikatuna, in honor of the chieftain Datu Sikatuna, who made a blood compact with Spanish conquistador, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. The town's name changed to Alburquerque following its expansion in 1861. In June 1868, Gov. General Jose de la Gandara, issued the decree establishing the new town of Alburquerque in its civil jurisdiction. In November 1868, the Fr. Provincial of the Recollects approved the creation of the town as to its religious jurisdiction. In June 1869, the Bishop of Cebu in which Bohol was a part of the diocese, made Alburquerque a separate diocesan parish under the Augustinian Recollects, dedicated to Santa Monica. In June 1869 Fr. Tomas Hernandez assumed his post as the first curate of Alburquerque.  Geography  Alburquerque is located in the western part of Bohol, from Tagbilaran. The town has a total land area of which is relatively mild rolling to rolling and hilly. The land is used as built-up area , agricultural purposes , timberland , mining/quarrying , roads , and landfill site . = Physiography = The central part of municipality, from the east extending toward northwest is characterized by rolling to moderately steep terrain (18-30% slope), with ground elevation ranging from amsl. The area in northeastern and southwestern part is characterized by steep terrain (30‚Äì50% slope), with ground elevation up to amsl. The southeastern part is characterized with undulating to rolling terrain (8‚Äì18% slope) with ground elevation up to amsl. The area along the coast is characterized by level to nearly level terrain (0-3% slope), with ground elevation ranging from zero near the coast to amsl inland. Alburquerque municipality is covered by hydrosol and three sorts of clay namely, faraon, bolinao and lugo clay. The northern portion of municipality is covered mostly by lugo clay, the southern half portion is mostly covered by faraon and bolinao clay, while hydrosol has a very limited extent along the coast. The municipal area is covered by grassland, coconut, shrubs and built-up area. The northern portion is mostly covered with grass, with exception of small area in the northeast, which is covered with shrubs. The southern portion along the coast is covered with coconut, with a small built-up area in the west. The whole of Bohol is in Coronas climate type IV, characterized by rainfall evenly distributed over the year. The average annual rainfall is estimated at per year. The average annual rainfall is the sum of the average annual rainfall from respective river basin, multiplied with percentage of respective municipal area within respective river basin. = Rivers and river basins = Several small rivers and creeks, which have their headwaters in the elevated terrain in the northern part, traverse the Alburquerque municipality. These rivers and creeks generally flow in a north to south direction and drain the major part of municipality into Bohol Sea. The only major river basin is the Tagbuane River Basin situated on the eastern part of Alburquerque ( or 94.64% of municipal area). The municipality of Albuquerque has a poorly developed drainage system, due to presence of permeable limestone, which covers most of municipal area and enables infiltration of large portion of effective rainfall into underground. This is characteristic for karstified limestone terrain. Surface water runoff (estimated at ), is estimated to be on average, which is sufficient to satisfy the water demand of for irrigation purposes. The potable water demand, including domestic, industrial, institutional and commercial water demands of urban and rural population, was estimated in 1998 to be , projected to increase to by 2030. Majority of this water demand (67.4%) in 2030 is for urban population. The water demand estimated at , is required to irrigate of land in brgy Ponong. =Climate= =Barangays= Alburquerque comprises 11 barangays, of which six are characterized as coastal (Bahi, San Agustin, Western Poblacion, Eastern Poblacion, Sta Felomina, and Tagbuane) and five as upland (Ponong, Toril, Basacdacu, Cantiguib and Dangay). Furthermore, the urban population is located in three barangays namely, East and West Poblacion and Ponong. { style=\\"margin:0 auto;\\"   style=\\"padding:4.9em 0 0 2em;vertical-align:top;background-color:white;\\"   style=\\"padding:4.9em 0 0 0;width:300px;vertical-align:top;\\"  thumb } Demographics At the 2000 census, Alburquerque had a total of 8,715 inhabitants, with a population density of of land and an average population growth rate of 2.66% per annum. The population increased to in the census, with population density of . Alburanons speak in Cebuano/Visayas dialect. Economy Roadside sari-sari stores in Alburquerque Alburquerque has an average annual income of Php 27,431,496. The town has a labor force of 37% with an employment rate of 90%. The average family income is Php 4,500/month with an average family expenditures of Php 4,000/month. The town's major agricultural project is the \\"Gintong Ani\\" project in all barangays. One industry is situated in Eastern Poblacion - the Santisima Trinidad Ice Plant. There are 66 micro-type and 2 cottage-size registered business establishments with total combined investments of Php 1.5 million. The existing tourists destinations are Sta Monica stone church and convent, Sta Fe beach resort, calamay making, ceramics making, salt making, loom weaving, basket and broom-making. The potential attractions are Tarsiers Park, Lourdes Spring, Aquarium Fish, Butterfly Sanctuary. =Cottage industries = Household weaving takes place in barangay Basacdacu. Buri cloth is made from local young buri leaves for export to Cebu. Midribs of the buri palm leaf are sold for basket making, and bundles of bure stems (pawa) to Tagbuane barangay for broom-making. Several households use strips of older buri leaves to make spear-head-shaped fans and smaller fans of that they sell in Cebu. There are 50 households in the area making brooms from buri stems and bamboo poles. Salt-making is another source of income for some Alburanons. Production begins when the upland farmers plow their fields for rice production. This is because the \\"asinderos\\" salt-makers trade their salt for rice in a barter system, and salt production takes about as long as the growth of the rice it will be exchanged for. The pottery-making enterprise is located beside the main road in East Poblacion. Clay is dug from a pit near the sea, and mixed with silicate soil before being ground through the large rollers of an electric mill, in a pit beside the pottery works. This is mixed with water and molded into pots of various sizes and shapes on a potter's wheel. Tourism The municipality of Alburquerque has natural wonders and micro local industries like the making of calamay, traditional method of manufacturing pottery, and the weaving of raffia using locally made loom. = Municipal Marine Sanctuary = The Municipal Marine Sanctuary, established in 2000 at brgy Sta Felomina where the beach and the Mangrove Protected Area are located, is set up in the area selected to be fit for the purpose due to its coral cover. The sanctuary contributed to rising fish stocks and corals that had been destroyed by illegal fishers. Bamboo rafts have been put in place to observe the marine ecology. It has been considered as a dive site of the municipality for local and foreign tourist visiting the place. Other activities include trekking up to Tagbuane River passing through a Forestal Reserve Zone. =Python sanctum = 'Prony' the Python Until March 2012, Alburquerque was the home to a female python 17 years old with a length of approximately and an estimated weight of about . It was the biggest python in captivity ever known. The python named Prony was Albuquerque's star and was owned by Sofronio Salibay. The Animal Kingdom Federation, Inc. (AKFI), an SEC registered, non-profit and non-stock animal welfare organization registered with the Animal Welfare Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry in coordination with the LGU Alburquerque built an animal sanctuary in Albuquerque. The AKFI made this commitment after hearing reports that the then long python was being fed with stray dogs. The reports caught the attention of many local and foreign tourists. It even caught the attention of GMA 7 who sent a crew to document the procedure. Alarmed by the reports, AKFI requested mayor Efren Tungol to stop Salibay from feeding the python with dogs since it is a clear violation of Republic Act No. 8485, otherwise known as the Animal Welfare Act. The mayor agreed. However, in order to preserve the python, which has become a tourist attraction, AKFI, represented by its director Charles Wartenberg, sealed a memorandum of support and cooperation with the municipality creating the site as an animal sanctuary. The memorandum, aside from manifesting full implementation of RA 8485, also reiterates the improvement of the cage based on animal welfare standards and introduction of alternative feeding. Creating an animal sanctuary would make Alburquerque the only Animal Welfare Friendly municipality in the country. AKFI is also associated with the International Wildlife Coalition Trust (IWCT), an internationally recognized organization founded in the United States dedicated to the protection of global wildlife and natural habitat protection. In March 2012, Prony was relocated to another sanctuary in brgy Laya, Baclayon, after the owner failed to secure the required permits and licenses from the Local Government of Alburquerque. =Heritage= Bongabong House Alburquerque 001.JPGBungabong House Manlangit House Alburquerque 002.JPGMalangit House Plaza House Alburquerque 002.JPGPlaza House Sinajon House Alburquerque 002.JPGSinajon House =Church and convent= Creation of the parish Some sources say the parish had its beginning as a visita in 1842 when a chapel was built under the direction of the parish priest of Baclayon. The parish advocated to Santa Monica was canonically established on 18 June 1869, following royal approval given on November 1868. During the Spanish colonial era, the Augustinian Recollect friars administered the parish. Creation of the church Parish convent Up to the 1880s, the parish church was more like a huge shed. Although it boasted three aisles, its walls were only of tabique. The present church of coral stone was commenced shortly afterwards, utilizing the same three-aisled plan. However, the upper portions, especially the tower over the fa√ßade, were completed during the first half of this century. On examination it becomes clear that the link between the church and the casa parroquial was planned along a grander scale, but never finished. The grotto at the back of the courtyard between the two structures hides a ruin which may be of another unfinished arcade. Ray Francia signed the church's interior ceiling painting on one side of the choir loft. Another section, now vanished, showed that the painting was carried out from 12 April to 3 August 1932. As regards the church bells, amongst them in the quadrangular tower are three bells, inscribed with the patron saints of the parish (Santa Monica, San Agustin, and \\"Calipay\\" or Joy). Dated 1866, two years before the ecclesiastical recognition of the parish, the bells are testimonies to the anxiety of the community in becoming an independent parish. As to the casa parroquial, the year 1876 is etched over the porta maior. However, in the center of the entrance arches to the steps, the year 1884 could be read until recently. The church was severely damaged in the 2013 earthquake. Infrastructure Municipal Hall, Alburquerque Alburquerque's road network is classified into: * national * provincial * municipal * barangay . It has one bridge, the 39 L.M. Bridge to brgy Tagbuane. The power supply is currently distributed by the Bohol Electric Cooperative I (BOHECO I) which served a total of 1,281 households in the 11 barangays. The main source of potable water supply is groundwater. The total potable water demand of per day. The municipality has one local port situated in Western Poblacion, which serves local fishermen as well as other fishing vessels and cargo vessels in transporting equipment and raw materials from other neighboring provinces. It is fitted with proper lighting and equipment. The municipal LGU as well as the barangay officials ensure the safety, peace and order situation and proper maintenance of the port. =Waterworks = One of the biggest projects of the present administration is to provide its constituents with a sufficient potable water supply. Almost 80% of the barangay in the municipality currently has water connections. Education Ensuring quality education to the people is also one of the top concerns of the local officials. The LGU assisted in determining and developing appropriate actions that would address the educational needs of the Alburanons in terms of budgetary allocations, maintenance of facilities and policies concerning education. Alburquerque has one public secondary school, San Roque High School. It has four elementary schools for intermediate level and three primary schools. It has also a total of 11 day care centers, one center in each barangay and one private pre- school. The number of teachers in the municipality is only 63 and the teacher student ratio in elementary is 1:24 and 1:43 in secondary level.

The town was where former followers of Dagohoy were given some land to till, but at the same time could be kept under the watchful eye of Spanish authorities. In 1829, the year the Dagohoy Rebellion ended, the town was the largest of five such settlements, with over 6000 inhabitants. In 1949, it became an independent municipality, which was renamed Alicia after Alicia Syquia, the wife of president Elpidio Quirino.

According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 16,462 people. In 2006, the Anda red hermatite print petroglyphs of Bohol were included in the tentative list of the Philippines for UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name of Petroglyphs and Petrographs of the Philippines, which also includes the Singnapan charcoal-drawn petrographs of southern Palawan, Angono Petroglyphs of Rizal province, Alab petroglyphs of Mountain province, and charcoal-drawn Penablanca petrographs of Cagayan. Etymology The decree on the separation of Quinale from Guindulman did not explain why the name \\"Anda\\" was chosen. It was presumed that the name referred to Governor General Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar who was Governor General of the Philippines from 1769-1770. Simon de Anda was a member of the Royal Audiencia in the Philippines who did not surrender to the British in 1762. But considering a century gap between de Anda and the time of the town's creation and also taking into account the poor literacy of the populace at that time, the naming of the town after him may not be the case. A more acceptable reason from oral history, is that \\"Anda\\" is a reference to the land that moves forward, as in Spanish \\"el lugar anda\\" ‚Äì the land walks or moves. This was a rough attempt to translate \\"Quinale\\" into Spanish. The word \\"quinale\\" or \\"gui kale\\", is a colloquial local term for a pile of sand dunes caused by the waves enhancing a new land mass. Hence, Anda, which means \\"it walks.\\" History The first inhabitants of the area were migrant Negritos, who were eventually replaced by Austronesians coming from Butuan. The new migrants established the red hematite petrographs in the Anda peninsula and would become a sacred site for ethnic communities. During the first half of the 16th century, the Sultanate of Ternate ransacked the area, along with the communities of western Bohol, specifically, the Kedatuan of Dapitan. When the Spanish arrived during the later half of the 16th century, the Anda communities were easily subjugated as they have already been ravaged by the Ternate people. The municipality of Anda was formerly known as Quinale and was a barrio of the municipality of Guindulman from the early part of its civilization up to the later decades of the 19th century. At the onset, Quinale was basically uninhabited with plenty of uncultivated lands and its shores were swampy with many mangroves and hardwood trees. Through the years the population of Quinale grew and the people sought independence from Guindulman. On 8 July 1856 they petitioned for independence and the petition was endorsed by the Assessor General of the government to the Governor General of the Philippines on 3 September 1856. Yet their petition was denied for the reason that they could not meet the required number of 500 tributes or taxpayers. Undaunted, they again petitioned to become an independent town on 30 December 1872. The petition was addressed to the Provincial Governor of Bohol and endorsed by him to the \\"Consejo de Administracion de Filipinas (Council for Administration of the Philippines), the Father Provincial of the Recollects and the Archbishop of Manila\\". The town has progressed at that time. Public buildings and their church were improved and roads created leading to Guindulman. But in spite of these developments, their petition was again denied on the grounds that their total taxpayers reached only 400. Still persistent, Quinale again filed their petition on 27 March 1874 which was subsequently declined because of the same reason, lack of taxpayers. A few months later, on 23 September 1874, the people again made another petition but now used a different approach and reasoning. They were denied for the same reasons yet they pointed out that births in the town of Quinale far exceeded the number of deaths but the people migrated to other places because of lack of supervision and opportunities. To answer this need, the officials wanted their barrio to be made into a town to have proper supervision and leadership. With these, the people would not leave and the number of taxpayers would surely reach 500. Provincial politico- military governor Don Joaquin Bengoechea (June 1872 ‚Äì 1878), was amenable to their line of reasoning and suggested that the people make a petition for separation of Quinale in the civil aspect only since the requirement of 500 taxpayers was for becoming a separate parish. So the 23 September 1874 petitioned for becoming a town in the civil aspect only. More than six months passed before the Consejo de Administration finally recommended that Quinale be separated in its civil aspect only. Delay was due to the religious authorities' reluctance to approve it. Finally on 12 March 1875, the governor general Don Jose de Malcampo y Monje issued the decree creating the new town of Anda and its being separated from the town of Guindulman in civil aspect only, consonant with the desire of the religious authorities. Confirmed by the archbishop of Manila, the order of the separation was published on 1 April 1875. With this approval, the local officials of the new town of Anda and the mother town of Guindulman gathered to discuss and determine the boundaries of the two towns on 3 May 1875. With the decree, the people were still given the opportunity to till their lands wherever they may be located, in Anda or Guindulman. Beach at Anda As the new town now being established with its defined boundaries, a practical concern of the local officials arose: they had no knowledge of running the local government. Hence they requested an educated person from the mother town of Guindulman to assist the local officials run the local government. That person was Pablo Juliano Castro an illegitimate son of a Spanish priest in Guindulman who had had a privileged education in Manila. He was given a prime lot in the center of the town, near the proposed Municipal Hall and the proposed school building. Pablo Castro not only acted as advisor of the local administration but also acted as the first Justice of Peace and Anda's first school teacher. He served some time later also as the town's \\"Capitan Municipal\\" or town's chief executive at the turn of the century. Subsequent years saw Anda's growth in terms of population. People did not migrate any more and eventually the number of taxpayers increased until they qualified to be a separate town in the religious aspect. On 18 July 1885, Anda became an independent parish from Guindulman and become a diocesan parish on 19 March 1885, dedicated to the Santo Ni√±o or the Holy Child. Royal approval was given on 6 January 1885 and finally implemented on 18 July 1885 with Fr. Julian Cisnero as the first Parish Priest. The line of Spanish priests serving the parish of Anda was not broken from 1885 up to 1937, even after the end of the Spanish regime and through the American era. At the end of the Spanish regime, many Spanish priests fled but not Fr. Hilario Lopez. Even after the American era, priests from the Order of the Augustinian Recollect continued to serve the people until 1937. The last Spanish priest was Fr. Luis Llorente. Barangays Anda comprises 16 barangays: Climate Demographics Anda public market Local government Municipal Hall of Anda During the Spanish period the town chief executive was called \\"Capitan Municipal\\", then some time during the American regime, the title was changed to \\"Presidente Municipal\\". It was only during wartime time that the town chief executive was called a \\"Municipal Mayor\\". In the earliest time, the town chief executive was chosen by drawing of lots among prominent persons of the town, those considered to have ample land properties and adequate education. The sequence or order of tenure of the early town executives could not easily be determined. It was only during the American regime that regular elections were held every three years, and then later reduced to four years. For a short period from 1986 to 1988, right after the EDSA Revolution, there were no elections for mayor but only officer-in-charge to act as mayor ad interim. =List of chief executives of Anda= Capitan Municipal (from 1885 to 1919): * Silverio Escobido * Gabriel Escobido * Perfecto Paguia * Benedicto Amper * Pablo Castro * Esteban Escobido * Esteban Escobal * Lucio Felisarta * Ramon Escobia * Victor Paguia * Hipolito Paguia * Cipriano Bernido * Eulogio Dagondon * Valentin Timaan * Bernabe Amper Presidente Municipal (from 1919 to 1934): * Victor Felicita1919‚Äì1921 * Diosdado Paguia1922‚Äì1925 * Victor Felicita1926‚Äì1931 * Alfonso Castillo1931‚Äì1934 * Diosdado Paguia1934‚Äì1937 Municipal Mayor (from 1938 up to the present): * Alfonso Castillo1938‚Äì1940 * Vicente de los Angeles1941‚Äì1945 * Aquilino Deligero1945‚Äì1955 * Alfonso Castillo1956‚Äì1959 * Simeon Escobia1960‚Äì1963 * Teodulfo Amora1964‚Äì1971 * Concordia Makinano1972‚Äì1980 * Teodulfo Amora1980‚Äì1986 * Gaudioso AmoraMar1986‚ÄìNov1987 * Edilberto Llido1‚Äì14Dec1987 * Aquilino Deligero15Dec1987‚Äì6Feb1988 * Paulino Amper7Feb1988‚ÄìMay 1996 * Angelina SimacioMay 1996‚ÄìMay 2000 * Paulino AmperMay 2000 ‚Äì 2010 * Angelina SimacioMay 2010‚ÄìMay 2013 * Metodio AmperMay 2013‚Äìpresent References External links * * Anda Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] *Bohol.gov.ph: Municipality of Anda *Dive Sites of Anda Category:Municipalities of Bohol Category:Beaches of the Philippines ","title":"Anda, Bohol"},{"id":"2086996","text":"', officially the ' (; ), is a in the province of , .

The Mag- Aso falls, whose cascading waters run into natural pools, were greatly altered by the 2013 Bohol earthquake and even more so by flash floods caused by Tropical Storm Seniang in December 2014. History The early inhabitants of the area were the Eskaya people, who lived in western Bohol, including the lowlands of Antequera at the present barangay of Viga, from the 7th century until the early 17th century. One legendary Eskaya leader was King Lomod or Tamblot, who raised a revolt against the Spanish conquistadors. Originally the town was a barangay of Maribojoc known as Agad. Migration from surrounding coastal areas increased the population and created many new sitios. On 17 March 1876, the Governor-General of the Philippines signed a decree that made Agad and all its sitios a new municipality. That same year, the governor of the district of Bohol, Joaquin Bengoechia, enacted the law that finalized the boundaries and appointed its first mayor, Simeon Villas. The new municipality was named after the home town in Spain of Bengoechia. In 1899, the town of Catigbian was abolished, and the barangays of Caimbang, San Isidro, and Causwagan were added to Antequera. But it lost these barangays, along with half of Cansague, when Catigbian was reestablished on 17 June 1949.

The town of Baclayon, Bohol celebrates its feast on December 10, to honor the town patron Immaculate Conception. History Baclayon was the first municipality to be established in Bohol by the Spaniards and included originally the areas now made up by the municipalities of Alburquerque, Balilihan, Corella, and Sikatuna. Its original name was Bacayan, from the root word bacay, meaning \\"detour\\" in reference to the fact that travellers used to make a detour there around a rocky cliff. In 1595, two Jesuit priests, Juan de Torres and Gabriel Sanchez, arrived in Bohol to convert the local populace to Catholicism. With native help, they built a stone church which is considered as one of the oldest stone churches in the Philippines, and marked the beginning of the town. In 1600, Moros raided the fledgling settlement, which prompted the Jesuits to relocate their residencia to Loboc. In 1717, Baclayon gained status of a parish. In 1742, Tagbilaran was separated from Baclayon, followed by Alburquerque in 1868, Balilihan in 1828, and Corella in 1884. Geography Baclayon is directly east of Tagbilaran, the provincial capital.

Its first structure was built in 1595, but the current building is from 1724 and is of Spanish Colonial architecture. The church includes a small museum, with relics dating back to the early 16th century, and adjoining high bell tower. Nearby are centuries-old stone buildings like the hermita, and elementary school, as well as the historic public marketplace, a Spanish-era building with giant stone columns supporting the roof. In 2013, the church and bell tower were severely damaged by the 2013 Bohol earthquake. There are 67 or more Spanish colonial ancestral houses in the municipality, many of them along the main road.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is located northeast of Tagbilaran through Cortes (via CPG North Avenue), or northeast through Corella (via J.A. Clarin Street). It has the fourth largest land area of the province, with 127.27 km2 (49.14 sq. mi) of land.  History  The place is a panorama of verdant hills, rugged mountains and green fields. It is said to have been so named because of the grass \\"balili\\" which grew in abundance. Before the beginning of the 19th century, Balilihan was a barrio of Baclayon and an old settlement. When the Dagohoy revolt was suppressed by the Spaniards, the authorities established a garrison in Datag (one of its barrios) to discourage and stamp out further uprisings on the part of the natives. When Balilihan was separated from its mother town on 29 September 1828, the Spanish government formally established a settlement or pueblo in the sitio \\"Bay sa Iring\\" (named so for the network of caves where cats hide) which was about from the Spanish garrison. Spanish Belfry in Poblacion, Balilihan - served as the watch tower during Spanish regime Later, due to the scarcity of water, the seat of government was transferred to its present site which is amply supplied with water from various springs. The elevated land also made a good viewing point to keep watch over all nearby towns. Thus the construction of a Spanish belfry similar to the watch towers of the shores atop the hill. This tower is made of adobe stones gathered from the rock deposits of Baclayon. It was erected in the year 1835. It was inaugurated in 1846 gobernadorcillo. In 1888, Friar Benito Grayoa, who at that time exercised control over local governments, ordered the transfer of the municipio to Cabad, a barrio west of the poblacion. The padre's plan met vigorous opposition from the people and through the able leadership of Capitan Bartolome Racho, they filed the protest before the Spanish Military Governor Linares who disapproved the proposal causing Friar Grayoa's ire who then plotted for the consequent punishment of the captain by dragging him with the friar's horse through the streets causing his death in jail. Fearing reprisals from the clergy, some of the people migrated to Surigao, Leyte and Misamis. Not long afterwards, Friar Grayoa was transferred to Siquijor. The Spanish era flourished with the construction of Spanish church at the foot of the Spanish watchtower where a large patio became the hall for social affairs and the friar's convent a school for the cartilla, with the municipio across. With the guidance of the local appointed leaders under the control of the Spanish friar, the town slowly progressed peacefully until the outbreak of the revolution in 1898. On 12 November 1900, American soldiers were known to be coming from Antequera. All officials of the town led by Capitan Antonio Racho came out to meet the soldiers with a brass band, but when the Americans arrived, they gathered all the officials in the municipal hall building and placed them under guard, for the Americans had heard that the town officials had been supporting the insurgents. The supplications of spokesman Segundo Racho not to burn the town was of no avail and the sounds of the welcoming brass band turned into volleys of gunshots. The officials were ordered to move towards Sevilla while the civilians ran for safety to the outskirts of the town. The town was razed to the ground. The Americans burned the church, the convent, the municipal building, the school building for boys and girls as well as private houses. The only structure that was spared was the belfry on the top of the hill. In 1904, there was a move to fuse Balilihan with Antequera in order to meet the requirements of a municipality under the American regime. The people objected to the plan, so the following year the Philippine Commission finally ruled in its Act. No. 350 abolishing the municipality of Catigbian and instead annexing it to Balilihan as one of its barrios. During World War II, the town residents went into hiding in their mountain hideouts for fear of the Japanese. Balilihan was a haven of refugees from other places who lived a life of privation in the mountains. Many innocent civilians were either tortured or put into death by the enemies on mere suspicions of guerilla activities. Ex-mayor Patricio Ibarra was put up by the people as war time mayor to defend them from their enemies. The Japanese atrocities gave rise to the organizations of the guerrillas into full combat force under the supreme command of Mayor Ismael Ingeniero. The people helped the guerilla movement by feeding the troops in the front lines as well as those in the headquarters in Behind the Clouds, in Maitum which was the famous concentration camp of the war. Enemy collaborators were tried here and those found guilty of high crimes were liquidated. Those with slight offenses were imprisoned for the duration of the war. Another concentration camp was at Hanopol where prisoners were kept. In 1948, Balilihan suffered a great loss of territory when the biggest barrio (Catigbian) was given its town charter in spite of the strong representation against the move by town mayor Balbino Chatto and Gerardo Racho who personally went to Malaca√±ang to see President Elpidio Quirino.

The town of Batuan, Bohol celebrates its fiesta on July 25, to honor the town patron Saint James.  History  This interior town used to be a barrio of Bilar during the Spanish regime and was called Lindugon. During the early years of American regime this barrio was made into a municipality by Act No. 968 dated Oct 31, 1903 that provided the following: ‚ÄúThe Municipality of Batuan shall consist of the territory of the barrio of Batuan in the present Municipality of Bilar, with the seat of the municipal government at the present barrio of Batuan.‚Äù (Acts of the Philippine Commission, Vol. XIV. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1904). Batuan became a separate municipality through the efforts of some local leaders, such as Manuel Decasa, Alejandro Barril, Victor Tiongson, among others, who were put behind bars for strongly advocating the movement to cede Batuan from its mother town Bilar, and its subsequent creation as a distinct and separate town. Notwithstanding, those leaders pursued their aspirations after release from prison. Municipality of Batuan was created, originally comprising only five barangays namely: Lindugon, Cambacay, Rosariohan, Janlud and Cantigdas; but today comprising fifteen.

With the exception of some species in Ellisochloa and Eleusine indica, most of the subfamily's species use the C4 photosynthetic pathway. The first evolutionary transition from C3 to C4 photosynthesis in the grasses probably occurred in this subfamily, around 32 to 25 million years ago in the Oligocene.

The Blue Army of Our Lady of F√°tima, now mostly known as the World Apostolate of F√°tima, is a public international association of the Christian faithful that has as its general purpose \\"the promotion of the authentic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church and the strict adherence to the tenets of the Gospel; the personal sanctification of adherents through faithful adherence to the Message of Our Lady of F√°tima and the promotion of the common good by the spreading of that Message of F√°tima\\". History The Blue Army was founded in 1946 by Rev. Fr. Harold V. Colgan, parish priest of St. Mary of Plainfield, New Jersey (USA).Peter Stravinskas, 2002, Catholic Dictionary, OSV Press page 141Bruno Becchio, 2006, Encyclopedia of World Religions Foreign Media Books page 127 Father Colgan had fallen seriously ill and was hospitalized. During his illness he prayed to Our Lady of F√°tima that if she should cure him he would spend the rest of his life spreading devotion to her. He attributed his recovery to his prayers and began preaching to his congregation on a regular basis about the Virgin Mary. He summed up the message of Our Lady's apparition as this: * Devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, * Daily recitation of the Rosary and * Righteous observance of the duties of one's state of life. His message was highly successful; however, he wanted to make more of a lasting impression upon his congregation, and so he added two further items of his own invention. The first was a signed promise that one would try to uphold these values and the second was to wear a blue ribbon or blue medal in order to remember the promise. This was also a success and the congregation all enrolled. It was then that Fr. Colgan began to think about extending this to other parishes and other nations. Thus was born the Blue Army, from Colgan's own words: \\"We will be the Blue army of Mary and Christ, against the red of the world and of Satan.\\" Fr. Colgan began preaching his message and gained success, especially with the assistance of writer John Haffert who began delivering conferences on the message of F√°tima and the Blue Army. Colgan then went to the Vatican in May 1947 to meet Pius XII in order to present his project for approval from the Pontiff. The foundation of the International Blue Army took place at the House of Pontevedra, Spain, where Mary is said to have appeared to request Communion of Reparation every First Saturday.\\"World Apostolate of F√°tima\\", Pontifical Council for the Laity Currently, there are over 20 million members. World Apostolate of F√°tima The World Apostolate of F√°tima has its world headquarters in the Domus Pacis (\\"House of Peace\\"), a pilgrim guest house in F√°tima, Portugal. While the Blue Army was founded in 1947, because of its rapid spread around the world, it became necessary to erect a new society. The Decree of Erection of the World Apostolate of Fatima was signed on 7 October (the Feast of the Holy Rosary), 2005. Then on 3 February 2006, the World Apostolate of F√°tima held an official ceremony for the consignment of the decree and the approval of its statutes at the Pontifical Council for the Laity in Rome. Organization The Apostolate is broken up into prayer cells which are found in parishes throughout the world. These cells fall under state and national Apostolate centers which in turn are subordinate to the International Secretariat based at F√°tima in the Domus Pacis. The International Secretariat exists in order to coordinate the activities of the organization throughout the world and to carry out the policy decisions of the Board of Trustees, an elected group of nine members of the Apostolate who represent various regional centers of the Apostolate. They meet once a year to discuss the internal affairs of the Apostolate. As of 2017, Donal Anthony Foley was the Secretary, World Apostolate of Fatima, England and Wales. Membership Membership in its most basic sense is through making a Pledge promising the following: * To offer up every day the sacrifices demanded by one's daily duty to the faithful observance of God's law * To say five decades of the Rosary daily while meditating on the mysteries * To wear the brown scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel as a sign and reminder of personal consecration to Our Lady and * On the first Saturday of five consecutive months, with the intention of making reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, confess and receive Holy Communion, recite five decades of the Rosary, and keep company with Our Lady for fifteen minutes while meditating on the mysteries of the Rosary. The official pledge of membership is: > I pledge myself to Our Lady and wish, thereby, to join the World Apostolate > of F√°tima. > > Dear Queen and Mother, who promised at F√°tima to convert Russia and bring > peace to all mankind, in reparation for my sins and the sins of the whole > world, I solemnly promise to Your Immaculate Heart: > > # To offer up every day the sacrifices demanded by my daily duty # To pray > at least five decades of the Rosary daily while meditating on the Mysteries > # To wear the Scapular of Mount Carmel as profession of this promise and as > an act of consecration to You, # To accomplish the devotion of the Five > First Saturdays of the month, including the fifteen-minute meditation on the > Mysteries of the Rosary. I shall renew this promise often, especially in > moments of temptation. The daily offering mentioned, is traditionally the following: > O my God in union with the Immaculate Heart of Mary (here kiss the brown > scapular). I offer Thee the Precious Blood of Jesus from all the altars > throughout the world, joining with it the offering of my every thought, word > and action of this day. > > O my Jesus, I desire today to gain every indulgence and merit I can and I > offer them, together with myself, to Mary Immaculate ‚Äì that She may best > apply them to the interests of Thy Most Sacred Heart. Precious Blood of > Jesus, save us! Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us! Sacred Heart of > Jesus, have mercy on us! Thus are delineated the primary devotions of the World Apostolate. These are the devotions mandated by the Blessed Virgin Mary during the Apparitions at F√°tima. Traditionally this pledge is printed, and signed by the person who desires membership. It is also traditional that this signed pledge is then sent to the international headquarters in F√°tima where it is then taken and buried near the shrine there. Aside from the daily offering, recitation of the rosary, the wearing of the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the five Saturdays in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Apostolate also recommends to its members the practices of nine first Fridays in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Home Enthronement of the Sacred Heart, and family consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. A further practice associated with the World Apostolate is the Pilgrim statue of Our Lady of F√°tima. There are several designated \\"pilgrim statues,\\" however the primary one is the international pilgrim statue which has traversed the globe several times since its sculpting in 1947 by Jos√© Ferreira Thedim. The purpose of the statue is to renew interest in Catholic parishes in the message of F√°tima, and to stir up affection to Our Lady. Blue Army Shrine The National Blue Army Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, in Washington Township (Warren County), New Jersey, is located on and rises over the Muscontecong Valley. It hosts more than 50,000 pilgrims annually.About the Blue Army Shrine (National Blue Army Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima) . The Apostolate Symbol The Symbol of the apostolate consists of a pair of doves forming an image of praying hands holding a rosary. These are then surrounded by an image of a brown scapular, containing the words in Latin Orbis Unus Orans, (One World Praying) the motto of the Apostolate. All of these surmounted on a blue disc, blue being the symbolic liturgical color of the Virgin Mary in the Catholic Church. Media * John Haffert on the Miracle of Fatima In 1996, John Haffert (co-founder of the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima) spoke about Fatima and his book Meet the Witnesses in which he personally interviewed nearly 200 witnesses to the Fatima Miracle, describing their detailed witness accounts. In 1985, the organization largely financed the film State of Emergency, originally advertised under the title Chain Reaction. Starring Martin Sheen, the film concerns a nuclear physicist who determines that nuclear fusion experiments may need to global destruction. The physicist travels to Portugal to investigate the Fatima prophecies, believing they may describe his fears. The film was produced by Richard Bennett and written by Ray Cunneff, based on an article on nuclear tests by Rand McNally Jr. Of the production, Martin Sheen said, ‚ÄúThe fact that it‚Äôs even being done is so extraordinary. A film about a man‚Äôs subtle transformation, about a spiritual journey he‚Äôs compelled to take‚Ä¶amazing! It‚Äôs hard to find anything where you can project your personal feelings.‚Äù The film‚Äôs budget was $6 million. It also starred Peter Firth and Tim Piggot-Smith.

The P-series pistols were designed for military, police, civilian and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface. Reviews have considered them rugged, reliable, and strong, though this strength comes at the price of bulk and a blocky appearance.Glenn Barnes \\"Ruger's P series: what's wrong with Ruger's P-series semiauto pistols? Not a darn thing, says the author\\". Guns Magazine. FindArticles.com.. Retrieved 2009-11-03. Design details The P-series pistols are short recoil‚Äìoperated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. They use a SIG P220 type locking system, and an M1911-style tilting barrel. The P series were made with a traditional double-action/single-action (DA/SA), or double-action-only (DAO) trigger mechanism. The standard models have an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.Ruger P series, Modern firearms.P85 instruction manual . Retrieved 2009-11-03. The pistols make extensive use of investment-cast parts and proprietary Ruger alloys. Nearly all internal parts, including the barrel, are stainless steel, while the slide and ejector are carbon steel. The P85 through P944 use an investment-cast aluminum frame, while the P95 and later models use a fiberglass-reinforced polyurethane frame. The 9 mm and .40 S&W; versions use double-column box magazines; the 9 mm has a 15-round capacity, and the .40 S&W; has a 10-round or 12-round capacity. The .45 ACP versions use single- column magazines holding seven or eight rounds (depending on the model). All P-series pistols of the same caliber use a similar magazine design, but slight modifications have been made to at least the 9 mm guns so that not all P-series magazines will function in all P-series frames. Ruger did not keep track of the magazine models so an older magazine may not secure in a newer frame. The Ruger Police Carbine also uses P-series magazines. The P-series pistols have an ambidextrous magazine release located behind the trigger guard; it can be pushed forward from either side to eject the magazine. The early-model P95s have fixed, three-dot sights; newer P95s, P97s, and P345s have three-dot sights adjustable for windage. Users The P85 was originally developed as a replacement alternative for the U.S. Military's 1984 Joint Service Small Arms Program, a venture to replace the aging M1911A1 to a higher-capacity, more reliable, NATO-compliant weapon. The P85 met all of the military's requirements, including a 20,000-round life expectancy. Despite this, the P85 was not completed in time for the first two trials. It was, however, able to compete in the later XM10 trials in 1988, for which Ruger supplied 30 P85s to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Despite performing well, the Beretta M9, which had succeeded at winning the previous two competitions, won once again and was awarded the contract. Nonetheless, the Ruger P85 did find success with some police departments and civilians, as its rugged design and military qualities did see it adopted by the San Diego Police Department and the Wisconsin State Patrol., Retrieved 2017-06-26. The P-85 was also adopted by the Turkish National Police. https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2012/2/2/ruger-p85/ Variants =P85/P85 MKII= The P85 was developed in 1985, but was not available until 1987. It was only available with a DA/SA trigger, decocker, and a manual safety. The P85 was affordable, initially retailing for just $295, about $100 cheaper than its nearest competitors. The Ruger P85 is a full-sized DA/SA alloy-framed service pistol originally designed to compete in the 1984 U.S. military pistol trials. Unfortunately the design wasn't finalized until after the trials. Luckily, the P85 found popularity on the civilian and law enforcement markets but many were recalled after one incident with the firing pin, resulting in a discharge. If the firing pin broke in front of the firing pin block, applying the safety, which dropped the hammer, could transfer enough energy to the broken firing pin to cause a discharge. The P85 was recalled, and a new safety was installed that prevented contact between firing pin and hammer during a decocking operation. This modification was done free of charge. This updated P85 was christened as the P85 MK II in 1989. Other updates included larger safety levers, and improved accuracy. The P85 MK II was produced for several more years, until 1992. By then the P89 was in production (having been introduced the previous year), which is essentially just a re-branded P85 MK II. After the P89 was introduced, there was no longer a need to produce the P85 and it was discontinued. Both variants are chambered in 9mm and have a magazine capacity of 15+1 rounds. =P89= Blued Ruger P89 The P89 is an upgraded P85 MKII that introduced a number of new features, including a DAO model. Like the P85, all P89s came with an investment cast aluminum alloy frame. In 1992, Ruger produced a limited-run P89X convertible model, which came with a second barrel and recoil spring assembly that allowed conversion between 9 mm and .30 Luger calibers. Ruger only made 5,750 with both barrels in 1994 only.https://www.northwestfirearms. com/threads/value-of- ruger-kp-89.10747/ The P89 was one of the most popular and plentiful P-series models. It was discontinued in late 2009.Ruger instruction manuals and product history. Retrieved 2009-11-03. It can be chambered in either 9mm or .45 ACP, with magazine capacities of 15+1 or 8+1 rounds, respectively. =P90 = Ruger P90DC (decocker) The P90 is a scaled-up version of the P89 chambered in .45 ACP with an investment cast aluminum alloy frame. It was introduced in 1991 as the company's first attempt at a .45 ACP pistol, and was in direct competition with SIG Sauer's P220, Smith & Wesson's 4500 series, and to a lesser extent Glock's G21 that came out the same year. The P90 is considered to have above- average accuracy for its price. The P90 was produced until 2010. It has a magazine capacity of 8+1 rounds. =P91= The Ruger P91 is essentially a Ruger P89 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson. Like its precursors, it also had an investment cast aluminum alloy frame. It was only produced for two years, from 1992 to 1994. It has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds. KP94DC, decock-only model =P93= The P93 was developed in 1993 but not released until 1994. The P93 was designed as a compact version of the Ruger P89 and, as such, still had the investment cast aluminum alloy frame, though the frame was slimmer than that of the P89 and it omitted some unnecessary parts. It was designed for shooters interested in lighter weight or easier concealability. The P93 lacks the flared nosepiece of the P89 and also features different grips with heavier checkering. Standard capacity was either 15 or 10 rounds. The P93 has a barrel that utilized a dropping link like the P89. A larger number of P93s than other variants were also double action-only without an external safety, due to its intended concealed carry market. The P93 was discontinued with the P94 in 2004. =P94= Original model KP95, without the Picatinny rail The Ruger P94 is a mid-sized, slightly larger variant of the P93. The P94 has a long barrel as opposed to a barrel and still has the investment cast aluminum alloy frame. Like the P93, the P94 was introduced in 1994. The P94 features different grips with heavier checkering. The P94 has a full length ‚Äústreamlined‚Äù slide configuration and is chambered for the 9mm Parabellum (9 mm x 19) cartridge, while the P944D is chambered for the .40 S&W; cartridge. The P94 was discontinued in 2004, ten years after its introduction. However the P944D variant was produced until 2009. It can be chambered in either 9mm or .40 S&W;, with magazine capacities of 15+1 or 12+1, respectively. =P95= Late model P95PR with Picatinny rail and a Hogue Handall grip installed Introduced in 1996, the P95 incorporated a number of changes from earlier P-series pistols, including a shorter barrel like the P93. The big change was switching the frame construction from an investment cast aluminum alloy to a new high- impact polymer frame made of fiberglass-reinforced polyurethane, based on Dow Chemical's \\"Isoplast\\". The P95 was also the first pistol in the series to omit the dropping link underneath the barrel. The first P95s came with a glossy black polymer frame with a hooked trigger guard and lacking an accessory rail and grip texture. Later model P95s featured a matte polymer frame with enhanced grip texturing, an accessory rail and a round trigger guard. The P95 was one of the last in the series to be fully discontinued. Most P95 designs were discontinued in 2004 and 2005, but certain types of the P95 were produced until 2009 and 2013. It is chambered in 9mm with a magazine capacity of 15+1 rounds. =P97= The P97 is essentially a P95 chambered in .45 ACP, similar to the P90. The P97 feeds from a single-stack 8+1 .45 ACP magazine, the same magazine used in the P90. It was only available in decocker only and double- action only versions. It featured an adjustable rear sight and retained the same glass-filled polymer frame of the P95. The front sight is pinned in, and the rear held in by a set screw. Unlike the P95, however, the P97 never got the improved frame with added grip texture and an accessory rail and retained the original smooth frame. The P97 was manufactured from 1999 to 2004. =P345= The P345, released in 2004, is a transition model between the P series and the SR series. The P345 is chambered in .45 ACP and accepts the same 8+1 single stack magazines as the P90 and the P97. The P345 features a radically different design (as it was intended to usher in Ruger's new pistol designs) and incorporates an integrated keyed lock that locks the safety in the safe position, a loaded chamber indicator, and a magazine disconnect that blocks the firing pin when the magazine is removed. It also has many ergonomic improvements, such as a new polymer frame design (narrower than the double column derived P95 and P97) and low-profile safety levers. It does not feature an ambidextrous slide release or magazine release. Both controls are designed for a right-handed shooter. The model P345PR adds a Picatinny rail to the frame, for mounting lights and other accessories. It was designed to be legal for sale in states that require elaborate safety measures. The P345 was discontinued in 2013 and replaced by the new SR45.

Erethism is characterized by behavioral changes such as irritability, low self-confidence, depression, apathy, shynessWHO (1976) Environmental Health Criteria 1: Mercury, Geneva, World Health Organization, 131 pp.WHO.

People with erethism often have difficulty with social interactions. Associated physical problems may include a decrease in physical strength, \\"headaches, general pain, and tremors after exposure to metallic mercury\\" as well as an irregular heartbeat. Mercury is an element that is found worldwide in soil, rocks, and water. People who get erethism are often exposed to mercury through their jobs. Higher risk jobs include construction, industrial work, and working in factories. Some elemental and chemical forms of mercury (vapor, methylmercury, inorganic mercury) are more toxic than other forms. The human fetus and medically compromised people (for example, patients with lung or kidney problems) are the most susceptible to the toxic effects of mercury.Medicine Health. \\"Mercury poisoning.\\" Emedicine Health. N.p., 23 Apr. 2010. Web. 23 Apr. 2012. . Mercury poisoning can also occur outside of occupational exposures including in the home. Inhalation of mercury vapor may stem from cultural and religious rituals where mercury is sprinkled on the floor of a home or car, burned in a candle, or mixed with perfume. Due to widespread use and popular concern, the risk of toxicity from dental amalgam has been exhaustively investigated. It has conclusively been shown to be safe. Historically, this was common among old England felt-hatmakers who had long- term exposure to vapors from the mercury they used to stabilize the wool in a process called felting, where hair was cut from a pelt of an animal such as a rabbit. The industrial workers were exposed to the mercury vapors, giving rise to the expression \\"mad as a hatter\\". Some believe that the character the Mad Hatter in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is an example of someone suffering from erethism, but the origin of this account is unclear. The character was almost certainly based on Theophilus Carter, an eccentric furniture dealer who was well known to Carroll. Signs and symptoms Acute mercury exposure has given rise to psychotic reactions such as delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in erethism, with irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia as the principal features of a broad-ranging functional disturbance. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops, initially involving the hands and later spreading to the eyelids, lips, and tongue, causing violent muscular spasms in the most severe cases. The tremor is reflected in the handwriting which has a characteristic appearance. In milder cases, erethism and tremor regress slowly over a period of years following removal from exposure. Decreased nerve conduction velocity in mercury-exposed workers has been demonstrated. Long-term, low-level exposure has been found to be associated with less pronounced symptoms of erethism, characterized by fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams, and depression (WHO, 1976). Effects of chronic occupational exposure to mercury, such as that commonly experienced by affected hatters, include mental confusion, emotional disturbances, and muscular weakness. Severe neurological damage and kidney damage can also occur. Neurological effects include Korsakoff's dementia and erethism (the set of neurological symptoms characteristically associated with mercury poisoning). Signs and symptoms can include red fingers, red toes, red cheeks, sweating, loss of hearing, bleeding from the ears and mouth, loss of appendages such as teeth, hair, and nails, lack of coordination, poor memory, shyness, insomnia, nervousness, tremors, and dizziness. A survey of exposed U.S. hatters revealed predominantly neurological symptomatology, including intention tremor. After chronic exposure to the mercury vapours, hatters tended to develop characteristic psychological traits, such as pathological shyness and marked irritability (box). Such manifestations among hatters prompted several popular names for erethism, including \\"mad hatter disease\\", \\"mad hatter syndrome\\", \\"hatter's shakes\\" and \\"Danbury shakes\\". History among hatters Some of the steps in the manufacture of felt hats are illustrated in this image from 1858. A man working in hat manufacture with no protective equipment, putting him at risk for mercury poisoning Especially in the 19th century, inorganic mercury in the form of mercuric nitrate was commonly used in the production of felt for hats. During a process called carroting, in which furs from small animals such as rabbits, hares or beavers were separated from their skins and matted together, an orange-colored solution containing mercuric nitrate was used as a smoothing agent. The resulting felt was then repeatedly shaped into large cones, shrunk in boiling water and dried. In treated felts, a slow reaction released volatile free mercury. Hatters (or milliners) who came into contact with vapours from the impregnated felt often worked in confined areas. Use of mercury in hatmaking is thought to have been adopted by the Huguenots in 17th-century France, at a time when the dangers of mercury exposure were already known. This process was initially kept a trade secret in France, where hatmaking rapidly became a hazardous occupation. At the end of the 17th century the Huguenots carried the secret to England, following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. During the Victorian era the hatters' malaise became proverbial, as reflected in popular expressions like \\"mad as a hatter\\" (see below) and \\"the hatters' shakes\\". The first description of symptoms of mercury poisoning among hatters appears to have been made in St Petersburg, Russia, in 1829. In the United States, a thorough occupational description of mercury poisoning among New Jersey hatters was published locally by Addison Freeman in 1860. Adolph Kussmaul's definitive clinical description of mercury poisoning published in 1861 contained only passing references to hatmakers, including a case originally reported in 1845 of a 15-year-old Parisian girl, the severity of whose tremors following two years of carroting prompted opium treatment. In Britain, the toxicologist Alfred Swaine Taylor reported the disease in a hatmaker in 1864. In 1869, the French Academy of Medicine demonstrated the health hazards posed to hatmakers. Alternatives to mercury use in hatmaking became available by 1874. In the United States, a hydrochloride-based process was patented in 1888 to obviate the use of mercury, but was ignored. In 1898, legislation was passed in France to protect hatmakers from the risks of mercury exposure. By the turn of the 20th century, mercury poisoning among British hatters had become a rarity. Picture postcard of a hat factory in Danbury (postmarked 1911) In the United States, the mercury-based process continued to be adopted until as late as 1941, when it was abandoned mainly due to the wartime need for the heavy metal in the manufacture of detonators. Thus, for much of the 20th century mercury poisoning remained common in the U.S. hatmaking industries, including those located in Danbury, Connecticut (giving rise to the expression the \\"Danbury shakes\\"). Another 20th-century cohort of affected hatmakers has been studied in Tuscany, Italy. =Hatters of New Jersey= The experience of hatmakers in New Jersey is well documented and has been reviewed by Richard Wedeen. In 1860, at a time when the hatmaking industry in towns such as Newark, Orange and Bloomfield was growing rapidly, a physician from Orange called J. Addison Freeman published an article titled \\"Mercurial Disease Among Hatters\\" in the Transactions of the Medical Society of New Jersey. This groundbreaking paper provided a clinical account of the effects of chronic mercury poisoning among the workforce, coupled with an occupational description of the use of mercuric nitrate during carroting and inhalation of mercury vapour later in the process (during finishing, forming and sizing). Freeman concluded that \\"A proper regard for the health of this class of citizens demands that mercury should not be used so extensively in the manufacture of hats, and that if its use is essential, that the hat finishers' room should be large, with a high ceiling, and well ventilated.\\" (Cited in Wedeen, 1989) Freeman's call for prevention went unheeded. In 1878, an inspection of 25 firms around Newark conducted by Dr L. Dennis on behalf of the Essex County Medical Society revealed \\"mercurial disease\\" in 25% of 1,589 hatters. Dennis recognized that this prevalence figure was probably an underestimate, given the workers' fear of being fired if they admitted to being diseased. Although Dennis did recommend the use of fans in the workplace he attributed most of the hatters' health problems to alcohol abuse (thus using the stigma of drunkenness in a mainly immigrant workforce to justify the unsanitary working conditions provided by employers). (Cited in Wedeen, 1989) Some voluntary reductions in mercury exposure were implemented after Lawrence T. Fell, a former journeyman hatter from Orange who had become a successful manufacturer, was appointed Inspector of Factories in 1883. In the late nineteenth century, a pressing health issue among hatters was tuberculosis. This deadly communicable disease was rife in the extremely unhygienic wet and steamy enclosed spaces in which the hatters were expected to work (in its annual report for 1889, the New Jersey Bureau of Labor and Industries expressed incredulity at the conditions‚Äîsee box). Two-thirds of the recorded deaths of hatters in Newark and Orange between 1873 and 1876 were caused by pulmonary disease, most often in men under 30 years of age, and elevated death rates from tuberculosis persisted into the twentieth century. Consequently, public health campaigns to prevent tuberculosis spreading from the hatters into the wider community tended to eclipse the issue of mercury poisoning. For instance, in 1886 J. W. Stickler, working on behalf of the New Jersey Board of Health, promoted prevention of tuberculosis among hatters, but deemed mercurialism \\"uncommon\\", despite having reported tremors in 15‚Äì50% of the workers he had surveyed. (Cited in Wedeen, 1989) (Cited in Wedeen, 1989) While hatters seemed to regard the shakes as an inevitable price to pay for their work rather than a readily preventable disease, their employers professed ignorance of the problem. In a 1901 survey of 11 employers of over a thousand hatters in Newark and Orange, the head of the Bureau of Statistics of New Jersey, William Stainsby, found a lack of awareness of any disease peculiar to hatters apart from tuberculosis and rheumatism (though one employer remarked that \\"work at the trade develops an inordinate craving for strong drink\\"). (Cited in Wedeen, 1989) By 1934 the U.S. Public Health Service estimated that 80% of American felt makers had mercurial tremors. Nevertheless, trade union campaigns (led by the United States Hat Finishers Association, originally formed in 1854) never addressed the issue and, unlike in France, no relevant legislation was ever adopted in the United States. Instead, it seems to have been the need for mercury in the war effort that eventually brought to an end the use of mercuric nitrate in U.S. hatmaking; in a meeting convened by the U.S. Public Health Service in 1941, the manufacturers voluntarily agreed to adopt a readily available alternative process using hydrogen peroxide. =\\"Mad as a hatter\\"= While the name of Lewis Carroll's Mad Hatter may contain an allusion to the hatters' syndrome, the character itself appears to have been based on an eccentric furniture dealer. Although the expression \\"mad as a hatter\\" was associated with the syndrome, the origin of the phrase is uncertain. Lewis Carroll's iconic Mad Hatter character in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland displays markedly eccentric behavior, which includes taking a bite out of a teacup. Carroll would have been familiar with the phenomenon of dementia among hatters, but the literary character is thought to be directly inspired by Theophilus Carter, an eccentric furniture dealer who did not show signs of mercury poisoning. The actor Johnny Depp has said of his portrayal of a carrot-orange haired Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's 2010 film, Alice in Wonderland that the character \\"was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes\\".

In this book, Parks describes his search for relief from chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). His urologist thinks surgery will be the only solution, but after several examinations, no clear cause is found for the pain. Parks wonders if the pain can be (partly) psychosomatic. In his search, he reads the book A Headache in the Pelvis - The Definitive Guide to Understanding and Treating Chronic Pelvic Pain () by psychologist (and long time CPPS-sufferer) David Wise and neurourologist Rodney Anderson (Stanford University), in which the authors describe methods of 'paradoxical relaxation' to prevent chronic tensing of the pelvic musculature. Parks starts doing the recommended relaxation-exercises daily, and later on, also practices Vipassana-meditation. He experiences his body and life in a new way, and the pain diminishes for the most part. *Italian Ways, 2013 *Where I‚Äôm Reading From: The Changing World of Books, 2014. *The Novel, a survival skill, 2015. *A Literary Tour of Italy, 2015. *Life and Work, Writers, Readers and the Conversations Between Them, 2016. *Out of My Head, On the Trail of Consciousness, 2018. * * =Translations of Italian works= *Alberto Moravia, Erotic Tales, Secker & Warburg, 1985.

It was similar to and a parallel development of the U.S. Army Air Corps‚Äô land-based P-39 Airacobra, differing mainly in the use of a tailwheel undercarriage in place of the P-39's tricycle gear. Only one prototype was manufactured. Design and development The XFL-1 (Bell Model 5) was powered by a single 1,150 hp (858 kW) Allison XV-1710-6 twelve cylinder, two bank Vee, liquid-cooled engine installed amidships behind the pilot and driving a three-bladed Curtiss Electric propeller in the nose through a 10.38 ft (3.16 m) extension shaft. The aircraft had provisions for a single 37 mm (1.46 in) Oldsmobile T9 cannon which could be replaced by a .50 in (12.7 mm) Browning M2/AN machine gun firing through the propeller shaft and two .30 in (7.62 mm) machine guns in the fuselage nose. It first flew on 13 May 1940.Bowers 1979, pp. 26‚Äì30. Although based on the P-39, the XFL-1 utilized a conventional tail-wheel undercarriage and the coolant radiators were housed externally in fairings under the wings instead of within the wing center section. The Allison engine was the first of its type to be tried out by the Navy, and lacked the turbosupercharger fitted to the XP-39. Operational history right The XFL-1 in flight In January 1938, the U.S. Navy issued a specification for a light carrier-based fighter to replace the obsolete biplanes then in use. On 11 April 1938, Bell, Brewster, Curtiss, Grumman, and Vought-Sikorksy submitted proposals but only three received contracts. Two of them were awarded contracts for one prototype each on 30 June 1938; these were for the Grumman XF5F-1 Skyrocket and the Vought XF4U-1 Corsair. The third contract, which was signed on 8 November, went to Bell Aircraft for one XFL-1 Airabonita. All three aircraft made their first flight in 1940: the XF5F-1 on 1 April, the XFL-1 on 13 May, and the XF4U-1 on 29 May. Subsequent tests were prolonged because of difficulties with the Allison engine and problems with the balance of the aircraft. Official evaluation began in July 1940 but the XFL-1 failed to be certified for carrier operations because of main landing gear problems. The prototype was returned to Bell for modifications in December 1940 and returned to the Navy on 27 February 1941 at Naval Air Station Anacostia, District of Columbia. Based on the test results, the Navy decided not to order production of the aircraft. In February 1942, the XFL-1 was transferred to the Aircraft Armament Unit at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. It was later grounded, used for armament tests, and later destroyed. For many years its remains were visible at the dump at NAS Patuxent River.Dorr and Scutts 2000, p. 20.Thomason 2008, p. 52. As a possible further reason for the rejection, it is often stated that the Navy's position during that era was that all its aircraft should use air-cooled engines (while the Allison was liquid-cooled). This appears unfounded speculation. The U.S. Navy \\"would consider a liquid-cooled engine installation provided a material increase in performance over air-cooled engine can be shown.\\"Thomason 2008, p. 1. In addition, the Allison engine had only a single-speed supercharger. Consequently, its altitude performance was much inferior to other naval fighters of the period, such as the Grumman F4F Wildcat. Lastly, the Airabonita had to compete against the faster though not \\"light\\" Vought F4U Corsair, which in the initial F4U-1 version was capable of 390 mph at 24,000 ft.

The town fiesta is held every 16 January in honor of the holy child Jesus, the Santo Ni√±o. History The history of Cortes dates back to pre-Hispanic times ‚Äì there already was a form of government way before the coming of the Spaniards. The town was known as \\"Malabago\\" after its chief, who was a contemporary of King Lomod, otherwise known as Tamblot ‚Äì the first Boholano to raise arms against the Spanish conquistadors. The Malabago settlement was situated in the upland territory of the present day Cortes near the Abatan River while that of Tamblot was at barangay Viga in the lowlands of Antequera which stretches to the riverside valleys opposite that of Malabago beyond the present day Abatan Bridge. The people of Malabago have a culture of their own and recorded their day-to-day activities in their own writing using unique characters which they carved out on a piece of bamboo using a knife called panggi or supok. Malabago then was a farming community that cultivated the land and made rice paddies in the north and east lowlands. Tamblot's reign started in early 1600 AD and the uprising in 1621 was triggered when a Spanish priest want to take back a silver church bell (Lingganayng Ugis) which he gave to Tamblot in order to put it up in a church he built at Malabago. Tamblot resented such a move; refused to give the bell back and so started the feud between him and the Spaniards. Supporting Tamblot during the uprising, the Malabago settlement was destroyed by the Spaniards in 1621. The settlement was transferred to Bahian which was also destroyed by the Spaniards. Again the people settled at Ylaya at the upper part of the river. Not accessible by boats, the people had to berth near the mouth of the river which they eventually called as \\"Dayhangan\\", meaning \\"berthing place\\". The people chose to live near the mouth of the river and along the swamps. Their main livelihood was to catch fish, so the new settlement was called \\"Pamingwitan\\" ('a place where one can catch fish using a fishing rod'). In 1793 or 94, an independent parish was established. \\"Pamingwitan\\" was renamed \\"Cortes\\". The town was probably established in 1862 during the construction of the Catholic church with the settlements of Malabago, Pamingwitan and Dayhangan jointed into one and called \\"Pueblo de Cortes\\". Toponymy suggests: The parish was dedicated to the Santo Ni√±o. The inhabitants of the town were baptized and given instructions in the Catholic faith. Although the church was built in 1880, the bell tower's upper register was completed only in the 20th century. A boys' school building was constructed in 1895. The town of Cortes played a prominent role during World War II. The inhabitants of the town formed a bolo battalion to fight the Japanese Invaders. Yet in 1942, the town was overwhelmed by the Japanese; houses were burned down and the school building was occupied and used as a garrison. Cortes was liberated from the Japanese a few days after the arrival of the Americans in Tagbilaran on 11 April 1945. In less than a month, the whole province of Bohol was officially declared liberated on 25 May 1945, by Major General William H. Arnold, Commander of the Americal Division. Geography It is about northeast of Tagbilaran. Its nearest neighbor along the national highway to the north is the town of Maribojoc. Located high up on a plateau, the town occupies a total land area of . =Barangays= Cortes comprises 14 barangays: =Climate= Demographics Medium of discourse is usual Visayan (Cebuano), but English is the medium of instruction in all schools in the town starting from the primary grades. People also understand Filipino. The people of Cortes in majority are Roman Catholics. Economy Main Health Station Cortes is the site of the southern Industrial Projects and its subsidiary, Rolling Mills, which produces colored and non-colored galvanized iron for roofing. Rolling Mills is situated high up on a plateau overlooking the Abatan River. The town is known for its handmade paper and papercrafts, similar to washi, but made with indigenous fibers.http://www.bohol-philippines.com/cortes-paper- product.html The town is also known for handmade paper products chosen now as the town's priority product under the Department of Trade and Industry's One Town, One Product (OTOP) Program. Aside from the manufacturing and handicraft industries, the people of Cortes are also into agribusiness. Sand taken from the Abatan River, and which usually finds its way to construction sites in Tagbilaran, is likewise another source of income for the people of Cortes. Flat-bottomed boats made of marine plywood carry the sand which has to be dug up from the river bed with waist-high waters ‚Äì back-breaking work for those involved. The Local Government Unit (LGU) of Cortes is also developing eco- tourism. One major project is the development of the docking port, envisaged to be the starting point for cruises on the Abatan River, which flows through five towns. Other projects include the establishment of daycare centers in each of the town's 14 barangays. Health stations will also be constructed.

Information revealed that the well was constructed through manual digging using bolos, crowbars, pulleys, and rope for digging into the soil stones, which contains limestone rock. The first bridge between Poblacion of Dauis and Mansasa, Tagbilaran was constructed by Spaniards during their reign, possibly in the 18th century. The bridge is still there and in place, used as a connection between the two islands. The other bridge was constructed near the old City Hall of Tagbilaran City, crossing towards Totolan.

The church is believed to have been built of light materials by the first Spanish missionaries in 1697. Since then, the church has gone through several changes. The image of the La Se√±ora de la Asuncion is famed to be miraculous. Faithfuls come from near and far to hike the distance from the city to the site to invoke special petitions or mainly to honor the Patroness. In addition, at the foot of the altar of the church is a well also believed to have healing power. The water tastes fresh, despite the well's proximity to the seashore. ;15 August''' The town and all devotees of the La Se√±ora de la Asuncion attend the Patroness' feast day every 15 August. Stories abound of the Patroness' sojourn and blessings. One of the stories tells of a man who found a camiseta (blouse) in his fishing boat after a lady passenger disembarked. On several occasions, devotees found the Patroness' camiseta full of amorseco. Many believe the Patroness must, on occasions, get down from her pedestal to visit them in their homes and farms. To this day, devotees continue to venerate and pay homage as manifestation of gratitude and appreciation after being healed of their ailments through the camiseta. ;Last Sunday of January Another fiesta is celebrated last Sunday of January, to commemorate a miracle that happened many years back. It is said that many young girls have seen the lady waving her hands as if bidding them to come near. Tourism Dauis's major tourist attractions are Our Lady of Assumption Church and Hinagdanan Cave. Our Lady of Assumption Church is locally known as Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n. The church was built by Boholanos under forced labor imposed by the Spanish. It is constructed of solid rocks or stones and has paintings on the walls. There is a tower with a bell, outside the church another tower and also a small well. The front face of the church collapsed during the earthquake of 2013.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town of Guindulman, Bohol celebrates its feast on the first Saturday of September, to honor the town patron Our Lady of Consolation. Etymology In the olden days, names of certain places were sometimes ascribed to some usual or common incidents or occurrences as is the case with the town of Guindulman. The place was originally called Guinduluman, from a vernacular expression which means \\"something or somebody who is overtaken by darkness\\". There is no official record to show how the town really got its name. However, folklore has it that during the early part of the Spanish era in the Philippines, there were only two formally organized towns along the southeastern and eastern coastal borders of Bohol, namely, Jagna and Batuanan (now known as Alicia). Because of the distances, travelers starting from either of these towns in the early morning were sure to be overtaken by nightfall before reaching the next place; hence the name \\"guinduluman\\". Folklore further says that the early condition of the area itself had something to contribute to the appropriateness of the term because the center of the town was once surrounded and almost entirely shaded by a dense forest which also made the town dark even during daytime. Travelers from other places passing through this thick forest could observe its surrounding darkness because the sunlight could hardly penetrate through the thick foliage, thus causing darkness in the area at any time of the day. Such actual condition of the particular place, therefore, gave added significance to the created name. History It is hard to fix a definite date when this town was established as official records were destroyed during the war. However, Francisca Libres Piezas cited in her compilation that the town of Guindulman was already established before the Tamblot Rebellion of 1622. So Guindulman may now be almost 400 years old. During the Philippine revolution against the Spanish government, there was no fighting in town reported. The people were submissive to the Spanish authorities. Guindulman was burned down during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Guerrilla warfare was already resorted to by the local insurgents known as \\"insurectos\\". A resistance movement was organized under the leadership of Colonel Pedro Samson whose headquarters was in Monte Verde in the upper part of the town. There was no battle fought in the poblacion of Guindulman, but a memorable encounter took place in the barrio of Cabantian wherein both sides suffer heavy casualties. The historical incident happened when American troops passed by the barrio of Cabantian, the \\"insurectos\\" ambushed the troops by jumping from the hilltops and killing many American soldiers with their bolos. However, because of the superiority of American weapons, the insurgents likewise suffered several casualties. On account of such incident, the furious American patrols then burned the houses of the particular village including the rice stocks in the fields. Still dissatisfied, they shot cows and carabaos on sight. During the Japanese occupation in 1944, another encounter occurred between the Japanese troops and members of the guerrilla unit which was organized by the Major Esteban Bernido, native of Guindulman who also became a representative of the 3rd Congressional district of Bohol, governor of the province, and who finally occupied one of the important cabinet positions of the country. The memorable incident started with an ambush made by the guerrillas under Major Bernido right on the boundary of Guindulman and Duero. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties while the guerrilla unit escaped unharmed. As a reprisal, the Japanese burned the entire poblacion, leaving only the convent and the church which were occupied by their garrison.

He was the son of the politician John Gamble and brother of John William Gamble, and was born in Kingston, Upper Canada. He started a store in Toronto before becoming a miller in Etobicoke. His business interests expanded to include a hotel, a distillery and shipping to transport his flour, as well as local crops, to Toronto. After 1835 he also became involved in developing Mimico. He was active in building new roads and bridges, opening up territory for development. Flood damage by the Humber River in 1850, and the repeal of the British Corn Laws in 1849 (bringing a dramatic fall in the price of his flour) caused his milling business to collapse, but his reputation as a business leader endured and he was active in the foundation of the Bank of Toronto in 1855. The last remnants of his milling business fell out of his hands in 1862 when his mortgage was foreclosed, leaving him on the cusp of bankruptcy. He also served on the York Board of Health (appointed 1833), as a director of the Bank of Upper Canada (appointed 1829 ‚Äì ironically it was this bank that foreclosed his mortgage in 1862) and the British America Fire and Life Assurance Company (appointed 1834), as a Justice of the Peace (from 1842), and as the warden of St George‚Äôs-on-the-Hill, an Anglican church in Islington for which he donated the land in 1846, in two spells, from 1846 to 1848 and from 1851 to 1852.

In addition to her own work, she included songs by Mary Chapin Carpenter and Janis Ian among others.

Also significant was her recording of the Mary Chapin Carpenter song, \\"Stones in the Road\\", for which Baez produced her first ever music video. The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Recording. For the making of this album, Baez worked in Nashville for the first time since recording 1972's Come from the Shadows.

It was promoted as a fact-based treatment of the events surrounding the apparitions of Our Lady of F√°tima, in Portugal, in 1917. It stars Susan Whitney as L√∫cia dos Santos, Sherry Jackson as Jacinta Marto and Sammy Ogg as Francisco Marto, with Gilbert Roland as a fictional character named Hugo, a kindly but agnostic friend of the three children, who rediscovered his faith in God through the miracle of the Sun. The musical score by Max Steiner received an Academy Award nomination. The film was released on DVD on April 4, 2006.  Plot  It is 1917. Portugal is feeling the after-effects of a storm of anti-religious sentiment and the violent overthrow of the monarchy and the government in the 5 October 1910 revolution. Churches in Lisbon and the rest of Portugal are boarded up. Many priests, nuns, monks and friars are shown being fingerprinted, photographed and registered as possible criminals before being jailed. The rural town of F√°tima is small enough to have escaped much of this persecution; their church remains open, and most of the people are reasonably devout. Watching their flocks and playing in a field outside town on May 15 (the actual date of the first apparition was May 13), L√∫cia Santos (Susan Whitney) and her cousins, Jacinta Marto (Sherry Jackson) and Francisco Marto (Sammy Ogg) decide to pray their version of the Rosary by yelling out, \\"Hail Mary!\\" but not finishing the prayer. In the midst of this activity they hear a clap of thunder and see a flash of lightning from a distance. Thinking it is about to rain, the children gather their sheep and head for their homes. Another flash of lightning causes them to run straight into an unusual \\"cloud of light\\" surrounding a little tree on which a mysterious lady stands. Speaking slowly and gently, the Lady asks them to return on the 13th of each month and to offer their sufferings to God for the salvation of sinners. She entreats them to say the Rosary for world peace. Later, they encounter their agnostic friend Hugo (Gilbert Roland) who tells them it is best not to reveal the vision to anyone else, but of course on returning home, Jacinta immediately divulges her sightings. Jacinta and Francisco's parents quickly believe the story, but L√∫cia's mother reacts with disgust and subjects her daughter to emotional and physical mistreatment. She forbids L√∫cia to return to the Cova da Iria, but L√∫cia does so anyway on the next month's appearance (June 13), and is told then that her cousins will die and go to heaven \\"soon\\", while she will live a long life in holy service. The parish priest suggests the visions might be from Satan. The local authorities close the F√°tima church until the priest can convince the parishioners that no visions have or will happen. The next month, on July 13, the Lady appears again, predicting \\"another and worse war\\" (World War II) will happen if the world doesn't stop sinning. She also predicts evil will come from Russia if that nation is unconverted. Kidnapped by provincial administrator Artur Santos (who is not related to L√∫cia Santos), the children are first offered bribes, then threatened with death if they don't change their story. Trying to frighten them, he has first Jacinta, then Francisco dragged into another room. Jacinta's terrified screams convince L√∫cia that her cousins are dead, but she refuses to deny what she's seen. Warning her that she's about to experience \\"the full treatment\\", Artur Santos reunites her with her cousins, who are very much alive, then throws them all in jail. There they find Hugo, who stands by them as they convince all the prisoners to join in the Rosary. Unable to find any prosecutable evidence, Artur (Frank Silvera) frees the children, who find that the entire population of F√°tima has been standing outside waiting for them. On October 13, when the Lady promised \\"a sign that will make them believe\\", about forty thousand people arrive, waiting through a torrential downpour. The Lady appears and says that the war (World War I) will be over soon and the soldiers will be returning to their homes. At precisely noon, as the Lady raises her hands, the clouds part and the sunlight shines brightly upon all the people‚Äîthen the Sun shifts through a rainbow of colours and appears to move closer, in what many have described as the miracle of the Sun. Many people panic, some pray or watch calmly, and a few sick and disabled people are healed. As the Sun returns to normal, we see Hugo standing in the middle of the kneeling crowd, his hat still on. Removing it, he says \\"Only the fool sayeth there is no God.\\" A short epilogue, circa 1951, shows the huge basilica where the tree once stood and a million people outside paying homage to Our Lady of F√°tima. At the end of the film, inside the new basilica (where the Cova da Iria once was), L√∫cia is now a nun praying before the tomb where her cousins are buried, with the converted Hugo at her side.

Early life  In his 1855 book Colored Patriots of the American Revolution, the nineteenth-century African-American author and abolitionist William Cooper Nell related some undocumented anecdotes about Whipple and his life: > Prince Whipple was born in Ambou , in Ghana, of comparatively wealthy > parents. When about ten years of age, he was sent by them, in company with a > cousin, to America to be educated. An elder brother had returned four years > before, and his parents were anxious that their child should receive the > same benefits. The captain who brought the two boys over proved to be a > treacherous villain, and carried them to Baltimore, where he exposed them > for sale, they were both purchased by Portsmouth, New Hampshire men, Prince > falling to General William Whipple. He was emancipated during the > [Revolutionary] War, was much esteemed, and was once entrusted by the > General with a large sum of money to carry from Salem to Portsmouth. He was > attacked on the road, near Newburyport, by two ruffians; one was struck with > a loaded whip, the other one he shot ... Prince was beloved by all who knew > him. He was also known as \\"Caleb Quotom\\" of Portsmouth, where he died > leaving a widow, Dinah, a freeperson and two children. According to the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Town Records,Portsmouth Town Records, Vol. III, p. 95, New Hampshire State Library at Concord, New Hampshire General Whipple granted Prince Whipple the rights of a freeman on February 22, 1781, Prince's wedding day. He was legally manumitted by Gen. William Whipple on February 26, 1784.  Legacy  Prince Whipple may be depicted near George Washington in the lower left corner, or the bow, of the boat. According to legend, Prince Whipple accompanied General Whipple and George Washington in the famous crossing of the Delaware Riverhttps://web.archive.org/web/20020818053717/http://whipple.org/prince/princewhipple.html and is the black man portrayed fending off ice with an oar at Washington's knee in the painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, painted 75 years after the event by German American artist Emanuel Leutze. Most historians doubt that there is any basis for this story. It is extremely unlikely that either General Whipple or Prince Whipple was present at the Battle of Trenton. At that time, General Whipple was serving in the Continental Congress, which had fled Philadelphia and reconvened in Baltimore, a distance of from Trenton. Moreover, Prince Whipple was not famous at the time the painting was commissioned, and it is unlikely that Leutze would have heard of him. His story of fighting to gain freedom was related as early as 1829 by C.A. Goodrich in his book Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence (p. 141). Notes  References  *Robinson, J.

It comprises some important agricultural crops, including sugarcane, maize (or corn), sorghum, and switchgrass. C4 photosynthesis evolved independently a number of times in the subfamily, which presumably had a C3 ancestor. Systematics and taxonomy Within the PACMAD clade of grasses, the Panicoideae are sister to a clade made of the four subfamilies Arundinoideae, Chloridoideae, Danthonioideae, and Micrairoideae. A modern phylogenetic classification divides the Panicoideae in twelve tribes corresponding to monophyletic clades; two genera, Chandrasekharania and Jansenella, are unplaced (incertae sedis) but probably belong to tribe Tristachyideae. The three largest tribes, Paniceae, Paspaleae, and Andropogoneae, together with the small Arundinelleae, form the core of the subfamily.

Biography Muir attended the Edinburgh College of Art during the 1960s, and began playing jazz on trombone. He soon lost interest and switched to percussion, stating that he preferred to be \\"in the wilds of uncertainty.\\" At that time, he listened to American jazz drummers such as Tony Williams, Kenny Clarke, and Milford Graves, and other musicians such as Pharoah Sanders, Albert Ayler, and the New York Art Quartet. Regarding his musical direction at the time, he stated \\"I just had to improvise. The first time it felt really dangerous, like the sort of thing you had to lock the doors and close the curtains on because if anybody saw you, God would strike you down with a thunderbolt. But I took to it like a duck to water.\\" After moving to London, Muir worked with choreographer Lindsay Kemp, and was active in free improvisation, recording, and performing with Derek Bailey and Evan Parker in The Music Improvisation Company from 1968‚Äì1971. During this time, Muir began using used various found objects as part of his percussion repertoire. Bailey enjoyed playing with Muir, recalling that he \\"seemed to be able to provide a different playing experience every time... He fitted into this idea of having no particular preconceptions... He was a highly reactive person, one of the things I really liked, there was the impression that he was slightly uncontrollable, on an edge.\\" After The Music Improvisation Company disbanded, Muir played in the band Boris with Don Weller and Jimmy Roche (both later of jazz-rock band Major Surgery) and put in a stint with Afro-rock band Assagai in which he met Canterbury scene keyboard player Alan Gowen. Muir and Gowen subsequently formed the experimental jazz- rock band Sunship with guitarist Allan Holdsworth and bass player Laurie Baker, although Muir has admitted that \\"we spent more time laughing than playing music\\" and suggests that the band played no gigs and got no further than rehearsals. In the summer of 1972, Muir received a call from Robert Fripp, and was invited to join what was to become a new incarnation of King Crimson, with a lineup that came to be, according to Muir, focused on \\"group potential and creating monstrous power in music.\\" During his tenure with the band, Muir occasionally played a standard drum kit, but more often he contributed an assortment of unusual sounds from a wide variety of percussion instruments, including chimes, bells, gongs, mbiras, a musical saw, shakers, rattles, found objects, and miscellaneous drums. Muir initially appeared on a single King Crimson album, 1973's Larks' Tongues In Aspic (the title of which was coined by Muir; when asked by Fripp what the music sounded like, Muir responded \\"why, larks' tongues in aspic... what else?\\"), on which he is listed as playing \\"Percussion and Allsorts.\\" Several live recordings featuring Muir were released later by DGM records; the 15-disc box set released in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the album includes every recording from that line-up, be it live or studio, documenting everything Muir has ever contributed. According to John Kelman, Muir \\"brought not just a visual 'X factor' to the group but a musical one as well, his not-to-be understated contributions during his brief tenure with Crimson still felt well after his departure, with the percussionist exerting a lasting influence on (drummer Bill) Bruford\\". Bruford called Muir \\"my biggest influence and the guy who turned my head totally around... God, did he open my eyes. Jamie saw above and beyond chops. He was into the color of the music, the tone, and being intuitive about it.\\" Bruford also wrote that Muir \\"...taught me to try to see life from the far side of the cymbals: drummers can be very myopic. He also pointed out - and I consider this my first and best drum lesson - that I exist to serve the music, the music does not exist to serve me.\\" Regarding his relationship with Robert Fripp, Muir wrote \\"Fripp was open and believed very much in getting disparate musical elements together... he seemed to me to be a very good band leader. I think I was a wee bit too much for him, simply because I was so involved in improvisation. He was very much concerned with logic and function, he always worked his solos out before playing them... For a person like him it was a very admirable creative decision to actually work with somebody like me.\\" Muir also recalled: \\"I always remember I had an urge to get Robert to let his hair down because he was very controlled in the way he played... I really tried and tried to provoke him.\\" In summing up his experience with the band, Muir stated \\"King Crimson was the ideal for me... I was extremely pleased and I felt completely at home with the Crimson.\\" In early March 1973, Muir attended Bruford's wedding reception, and had a long conversation with Yes's singer Jon Anderson during which he strongly recommended that Anderson read Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi. Anderson recalled: \\"He was an unbelievable stage performer... I wanted to know what made him do that, what had influenced him. He said to me, 'Here, read it,' and it started me off on the path of becoming aware that there was even a path... Jamie was like a messenger for me and came to me at the perfect time in my life... he changed my life.\\" Anderson's fascination with the book soon led to the creation of the Yes album Tales From Topographic Oceans. A little over a week after the release of Larks' Tongues, Muir abruptly left King Crimson and moved to Samye Ling Monastery near Eskdalemuir in southern Scotland in order to pursue a monastic lifestyle in accordance with the strict principles of Buddhism. The British Press at the time cited his departure as the result of \\"personal injury sustained onstage during performance\\", a phrase attributed to the band's management company, E.G. Records. Muir himself stated \\"[t]hat was nonsense about my having injured myself... When I heard about what they'd said, I wondered why would anybody do that ‚Äî what advantage could there be in not saying what actually happened?\\" He also stated: \\"There were experiences over a period of about six months which caused me to decide to give up music, so one morning I felt I had to go to E.G. management and tell them. It was difficult of course, a whole year of tours had just been lined up... I didn't feel too happy about letting people down, but this was something I had to do or else it would have been a source of deep regret for the rest of my life.\\" In 1980, Muir returned to the London music scene, recording with Bailey (Dart Drug), Parker (The Ayes Have It), and Company (Trios, Company 1981, and Company 1983). He also appeared on the soundtrack of the film Ghost Dance, a collaboration with another Crimson alumnus, drummer Michael Giles and David Cunningham recorded in 1983, and eventually released in 1996. Muir reported that he withdrew from the music business around 1990, to devote his energies to painting. Ideas about music Muir has stated: \\"I think group improvised music is one of the great forms of 20th Century music because it's so radical. It should be listened to live and not in an acute intellectual way. A lot of other music is quite absurdly intellectual.\\" Regarding his approach to percussion, he said: \\"I much prefer junk shops to antique shops. There's nothing to find in an antique shop - it's all been found already; whereas in a junk shop it's only been collected. But a rubbish dump - a rubbish dump has been neither found nor collected - in fact it's been completed rejected - the future if only you can see it.\\" He recommended that \\"[i]nstead of transmuting rubbish into music with a heavily predetermined qualitative bias... leave behind the biases and structures of selectivity (which is an enormous task), the 'found' attitudes you inherit, and approach the rubbish with a total respect for its nature as rubbish - the undiscovered/unidentified/unclaimed - transmuting that nature into the performing dimension. The way to discover the undiscovered in performing terms is to immediately reject all situations as you identify them (the cloud of unknowing) - which is to give music a future.\\" Discography With Derek Bailey, Evan Parker and Hugh Davies * The Music Improvisation Company (ECM, 1970) with Christine Jeffrey *The Music Improvisation Company 1968-1971 (Incus, 1968‚Äì70 [1976]) With King Crimson *Larks' Tongues in Aspic (Island, 1973) *Larks' Tongues in Aspic (box set) (DGM, 2012) With Derek Bailey *Dart Drug (Incus, 1981; reissued on CD in 1994) With Evan Parker and Paul Rogers *The Ayes Have It (Emanem, 1983) With Michael Giles and David Cunningham *Ghost Dance (Piano, 1996) With Company *Trios (Incus, 1986) *Company 1981 (Honest Jon's, 2019) *Company 1983 (Honest Jon's, 2020) With Laurie Scott Baker *Gracility (Musicnow, 2009) References Category:Free improvisation Category:King Crimson members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Avant-garde jazz percussionists Category:Alumni of the Edinburgh College of Art Category:Scottish drummers Category:British male drummers Category:Scottish percussionists Category:Converts to Buddhism Category:Scottish Buddhists Category:Scottish monks Category:Musicians from Edinburgh Category:British male jazz musicians Category:Assagai members Category:Buddhist artists Category:Incus Records artists ","title":"Jamie Muir"},{"id":"2087269","text":"This history of Las Vegas covers both the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Las Vegas Valley. The name Las Vegas was given to the city in 1829 by Rafael Rivera, a member of the Spanish explorer Antonio Armijo trading party that was traveling to Los Angeles, and stopped for water there on the Old Spanish Trail from New Mexico. At that time, several parts of the valley contained artesian wells surrounded by extensive green areas; Las Vegas means \\"the meadows\\" in Spanish. The flows from the wells fed the Las Vegas Wash, which runs to the Colorado River. The settlement of Las Vegas was founded in 1905 after opening of a railroad that linked Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. The stopover attracted some farmers (mostly from Utah) to the area, and fresh water was piped in to the settlement. In 1911, the town was incorporated as part of the newly founded Clark County. Urbanization took off in 1931 when work started on the Boulder Dam (now the Hoover Dam), bringing a huge influx of young male workers, for whom theaters and casinos were built, largely by the Mafia. Electricity from the dam also enabled the building of many new hotels along the Strip. The arrival of Howard Hughes in 1966 did much to offset mob influence, and helped turn Las Vegas into more of a family tourist center, now classified as a Mega resort. Prehistory The prehistoric landscape of the Las Vegas Valley and most of Southern Nevada was once a marsh with water and vegetation. The rivers that created the marsh eventually went underground, and the marsh receded. The valley then evolved into a parched, arid landscape that only supported the hardiest animals and plants. At some point in the valley's early geologic history, the water resurfaced and flowed into what is now the Colorado River. This created a luxurious plant life, forming a wetland oasis in the Mojave Desert landscape. Evidence of prehistoric life in Las Vegas Valley has been found at the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument. An abundance of Late Pleistocene fossils have been discovered from this locality, including Columbian mammoths and Camelops hesternus. Native American (Paiute) history Southern Paiutes at Moapa wearing traditional Paiute cradleboard and rabbit robe Native Americans lived in the Las Vegas Valley, beginning over 10,000 years ago. Archaeologists have discovered baskets, petroglyphs, pictographs and other evidence in diverse locations, including Gypsum Cave and Tule Springs. Paiutes moved into the area as early as AD 700, migrating between nearby mountains in the summer and spending winter in the valley, near Big Springs.Moehring, Eugene P.; & Green, Michael S. (2005).

University of Nevada Press. p. 2. 1829‚Äì1905: origins A trade caravan of 60 men led by the Spanish merchant Antonio Armijo was charged with establishing a trade route to Los Angeles.Robert D. McCracken. Las Vegas: the great American playground. University of Nevada Press. 1997. p. 7. By following the Pike and Smith routes through a tributary of Colorado River they came upon the Las Vegas Valley, described by Smith as the best point to re-supply before going onto California. The travelers named the area \\"Las Vegas\\" which is Spanish for \\"The Meadows\\".H2O University ‚Äì 6 through 12 or 'Fertile Plains.'Handy Spanish-English, English-Spanish Dictionary, G.H. Calvert, M.A., David McKay Company, 1958, p. 262, 'fertile plain,' related to 'vegetable,' 'veguero', -ra' or noun a farmer who cultivates a plain John C. Fr√©mont traveled into the Las Vegas Valley on May 3, 1844, while it was still part of Mexico. He was appointed by President John Tyler to lead a group of scientists, scouts, and spies for the United States Army Corps of Engineers who were preparing for a possible war with Mexico. Upon arriving in the valley they made camp at the Las Vegas Springs, establishing a clandestine fort there. A war with Mexico did occur, resulting in the region becoming United States territory. The fort was used in later years by travelers, mountain men, hunters, and traders seeking shelter, but was never permanently inhabited. In 1855, William Bringhurst led a group of 29 Mormon missionaries from Utah to the Las Vegas Valley. The missionaries built a adobe fort near a creek and used flood irrigation to water their crops, a process still used at the park. However, because of tensions rising between leaders of the small Mormon community, the summer heat and difficulty growing crops, the missionaries returned to Utah in 1857, abandoning the fort. For the next few years the area remained unoccupied by Americans except for travelers and traders. Then the U.S. Army, in an attempt to deceive Confederate spies active in southern California in 1864, falsely publicized that it reclaimed the fort and had renamed it Fort Baker, briefly recalling the area to national attention. After the end of the war in 1865, Octavius Gass, with a commission from the federal government, re-occupied the fort. The Paiute nation had declined in numbers and negotiated a new treaty with the United States, ceding the area around the fort to the United States in return for relocation and supplies of food and farming equipment. Consequently, Gass started irrigating the old fields and renamed the area 'Las Vegas Rancho.' Gass made wine at his ranch and Las Vegas became known as the best stop on the Old Spanish Trail. In 1881, because of mismanagement and intrigue with a Mormon syndicate, Gass lost his ranch to Archibald Stewart to pay off a lien Stewart had on the property. In 1884, Archibald's wife, Helen J. Stewart became the Las Vegas Postmaster. The property (increased to ), stayed with the family (despite Archibald Stewart's murder in July 1884) until it was purchased in 1902 by the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad, then being built across southern Nevada. The railroad was a project of Montana Senator William Andrews Clark. Clark enlisted Utah's U.S. Senator and mining magnate Thomas Kearns to ensure the line's completion through Utah to Las Vegas. The State Land Act of 1885 offered land at $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare). Clark and Kearns promoted the area to American farmers who quickly expanded the farming plots of the areas. Not until 1895 did the first large-scale migration of Mormons begin in the area, at long last fulfilling Brigham Young's early dream. Through wells and arid irrigation, agriculture became the primary industry for the next 20 years and in return for his development, the farmers named the area Clark County in honor of the railroad tycoon and Senator. 1905‚Äì1929: birth, growth and crisis St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church near 4th and Bridger in downtown was founded in 1910. By the early 20th century, wells piped water into the town, providing both a reliable source of fresh water and the means for additional growth. The increased availability of water in the area allowed Las Vegas to become a water stop, first for wagon trains and later railroads, on the trail between Los Angeles, California, and points east such as Albuquerque, New Mexico. The San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad was completed in 1905, linking Salt Lake City to southern California. U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark was the majority owner of the railroad, which was a corporation based in Utah. Among its original incorporators were Utah's U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns and his business partner David Keith. Kearns, one of the richest and most powerful men in Utah, and Keith were the owners of Utah's Silver King Coalition Mine, several mines in Nevada and The Salt Lake Tribune newspaper. Kearns and Keith helped Clark ensure the success of the new railroad across Utah and into Nevada to California. Curiously, for a time there were two towns named Las Vegas. The east-side of Las Vegas (which encompassed the modern Main Street and Las Vegas Boulevard) was owned by Clark, and the west-side Las Vegas (which encompassed the area north of modern-day Bonanza Road) was owned by J.T. McWilliams, who was hired by the Stewart family during the sale of the Las Vegas Rancho and bought available land west of the ranch. It was from their property that Las Vegas took form. Clark subsequently built another railroad branching off from Las Vegas to the boom town of Bullfrog called the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad. With the revenue coming down both railways that intersected there, the area of Las Vegas was quickly growing. On May 15, 1905, Las Vegas officially was founded as a city, when , in what would later become downtown, were auctioned to ready buyers. Las Vegas was the driving force in the creation of Clark County, Nevada in 1909 and the city was incorporated in 1911 as a part of the county. The first mayor of Las Vegas was Peter Buol who served from 1911 to 1913. Shortly after the city's incorporation, the State of Nevada reluctantly became the last western state to outlaw gaming. This occurred at midnight, October 1, 1910, when a strict anti-gambling law became effective in Nevada. It even forbade the western custom of flipping a coin for the price of a drink. Nonetheless, Las Vegas had a diversified economy and a stable and prosperous business community, and therefore continued to grow until 1917. In that year, a combination of economic influences and the redirection of resources by the federal government in support of the war effort forced the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad to declare bankruptcy. Although William Clark sold the remains of the company to the Union Pacific Railroad, a nationwide strike in 1922 left Las Vegas in a desperate state. 1930‚Äì1941: Hoover Dam and the first casinos Hoover Dam in 1942 On July 3, 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed the appropriation bill for the Boulder Dam. The dam was later renamed the Hoover Dam during the Truman administration. Work started on the dam in 1931 and Las Vegas' population swelled from around 5,000 citizens to 25,000, with most of the newcomers looking for a job building the dam. However, the demographic of the work force consisting of males from across the country with no attachment to the area created a market for large-scale entertainment. A combination of local Las Vegas business owners and Mafia crime lords helped develop the casinos and showgirl theaters to entertain the largely male dam construction workers.Las Vegas Made Safe, TIME Magazine, June 1, 1931 Despite the influx of known crime figures, the local business community tried to cast Las Vegas in a respectable light when the Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur visited in 1929 to inspect the dam site. However a subordinate was found with alcohol on his breath (this was during the time of Prohibition) after a visit to Block 16 in Las Vegas. The government ultimately decided that a federally controlled town, Boulder City, would be erected for the dam workers. Realizing that gambling would be profitable for local business, the Nevada state legislature legalized gambling at the local level in 1931. Las Vegas, with a small but already well-established illegal gambling industry, was poised to begin its rise as the gaming capital of the world. The county issued the first gambling license in 1931 to the Northern Club, and soon other casinos were licensed on Fremont Street like the Las Vegas Club and the Hotel Apache. Fremont Street became the first paved street in Las Vegas and received the city's first traffic light in 1931. In reply, the federal government restricted movement of the dam workers to Las Vegas. Smuggling and circuitous routes then were developed. In 1934, to curtail these activities and the resulting growth of criminal figures in the gambling industry, the city's leading figures purged gambling dens and started an effort to stem the flow of workers from the dam. This only emboldened some dam workers who still contrived to visit Las Vegas. A celebration of this era has become known as Helldorado Days. Although the suppression efforts resulted in declines at gambling venues and resulted in a business downturn, the city was recharged--both literally and figuratively-- when the dam was completed in 1935. In 1937, Southern Nevada Power became the first utility to supply power from the dam, and Las Vegas was its first customer. Electricity flowed into Las Vegas and Fremont Street became known as Glitter Gulch due to the many bright lights powered by electricity from Hoover Dam. Meanwhile, although the dam worker population disappeared, Hoover Dam and its reservoir, Lake Mead, turned into tourist attractions on their own and the need for additional higher-class hotels became clear. In 1940, U.S. Route 95 was finally extended south into Las Vegas, giving the city two major access roads. Also in 1940 Las Vegas's first permanent radio station, KENO, began broadcasting replacing the niche occupied earlier by transient broadcasters. 1941‚Äì1945 war years On January 25, 1941, the U.S. Army established a flexible gunnery school for the United States Army Air Corps in Las Vegas. Mayor John L. Russell signed over land to the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps for this development. The gunnery school later would become Nellis Air Force Base. The U.S. Army was not pleased with the legal prostitution in Las Vegas and in 1942 forced Las Vegas to outlaw the practice, putting Block 16, the local red light district, permanently out of business. On April 3, 1941, hotel owner Thomas Hull opened the El Rancho Vegas. It was the first resort on what would become the Las Vegas Strip. The hotel gained much of its fame from the gourmet buffet that it offered. On October 30, 1942, Texas cinema magnate R. E. Griffith rebuilt on the site of a nightclub called Pair-O-Dice, that first opened in 1930, and renamed it Hotel Last Frontier. A few more resorts were built on and around Fremont Street, but it was the next hotel on the Strip that publicly demonstrated the influence of organized crime on Las Vegas. Although ethnic organized crime figures had been involved in some of the operations at the hotels, the Mafia bosses never owned or controlled the hotels and clubs which remained monopolized by hard-bitten local Las Vegas families who were unwilling to cede ground to the crime bosses and proved strong enough to push back. This changed in post-war Las Vegas when Jewish gangster Bugsy Siegel, with help from friend and fellow mob boss Meyer Lansky, poured money through locally owned banks for cover of legitimacy and built The Flamingo in 1946. Siegel modeled his enterprises on the long-running gambling empire in Galveston, Texas, which had pioneered the high-class casino concepts that became mainstays on the Strip.  1946‚Äì1955: postwar boom  = Casinos backers get funding = The Flamingo initially lost money and Siegel died in a hail of gunfire in Beverly Hills, California in the summer of 1947. Additionally, local police and Clark County Sheriff deputies were notorious for their heavy-handed tactics toward mobsters who \\"grew too big for their pants.\\" However, many mobsters saw the potential that gambling offered in Las Vegas. After gambling was legalized, the Bank of Las Vegas, led by E. Parry Thomas, became the first bank to lend money to the casinos, which Thomas regarded as the most important businesses in Las Vegas. At the same time, Allen Dorfman, a close associate of longtime IBT President Jimmy Hoffa and a known associate of the Chicago Outfit, took over the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund which began lending money to Las Vegas casino owners and developers. They provided funding to build the Sahara, the Sands, the New Frontier, the Royal Nevada, the Showboat, The Riviera, The Fremont, Binion's Horseshoe (which was the Apache Hotel), and finally The Tropicana. Even with the general knowledge that some of the owners of these casino resorts had dubious backgrounds, by 1954, over 8 million people were visiting Las Vegas yearly pumping $200 million into casinos. Gambling was no longer the only attraction; the biggest stars of films and music like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Andy Williams, Liberace, Bing Crosby, Carol Channing, and others performed in intimate settings. After coming to see these stars, the tourists would resume gambling, and then eat at the gourmet buffets that have become a staple of the casino industry. On November 15, 1950, the United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce (known at the Kefauver Hearings) met in Las Vegas. It was the seventh of 14 hearings held by the commission. Moe Sedway, manager of the Flamingo Hotel and a friend of mobster Bugsy Siegel, Wilbur Clark representing the Desert Inn, and Nevada Lieutenant Governor Clifford Jones were all called to testify. The hearings established that Las Vegas interests were required to pay Siegel to get the race wire transmitting the results of horse and dog races, prizefight results and other sports action into their casinos. The hearing concluded that organized crime money was incontrovertibly tied to the Las Vegas casinos and was becoming the controlling interest in the city, earning the organized crime groups vast amounts of income, strengthening their influence in the country. This led to a proposal by the Senate to institute federal gambling control. Nevada's Senator Pat McCarran was instrumental in defeating the measure in committee. Along with their connections in Hollywood and New York City, these interests in Las Vegas were able to use publicity provided by these media capitals to steer the rapid growth of tourism into Las Vegas, thereby dooming Galveston, Texas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and other illegal gaming centers around the nation. Nevada's legal gaming as well as the paradoxical increased scrutiny by local and federal law enforcement in these other locales during the 1950s made their demise inevitable. = Atomic testing = mushroom cloud near Las Vegas Cloud at Nevada Test Site While the Strip was booming, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission on January 27, 1951 detonated the first of over a hundred atmospheric explosions at the Nevada Test Site. Despite the dangers and risks of radiation exposure from the fallout, which were greatly underestimated at the time, Las Vegas advertised the explosions as another tourist attraction and offered Atomic Cocktails in the Sky Room restaurant at the Desert Inn that provided the highest view of the mushroom clouds. During this time the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce successfully pushed for Vegas to become nicknamed the \\"Atomic City\\".< Several Miss Atomic pageants were also held to help display the city's modernity and to continue spinning messages on the nearby testing to tourists. The influx of government employees for the Atomic Energy Commission and from the Mormon-controlled Bank of Las Vegas spearheaded by E. Parry Thomas during those years funded the growing boom in casinos. But Las Vegas was doing more than growing casinos. In 1948, McCarran Field was established for commercial air traffic. In 1957 the University of Nevada, Las Vegas was first established, initially as a branch of the University of Nevada, Reno and becoming independent in 1969. In 1959 the Clark County Commission built the Las Vegas Convention Center, which would become a vital part of the area's economy. A new utility company, Southwest Gas expanded into Las Vegas in 1954. These atmospheric tests would continue until enactment of the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963 when the tests moved underground. The last test explosion was in 1992. 1956‚Äì1969: the beginning of modern Las Vegas =Howard Hughes= In 1966, Howard Hughes, the eccentric hero of the American aviation industry, and noted American entrepreneurial financier with vast connections to long established networks in the country, moved to Las Vegas. Initially staying in the Desert Inn, he refused to vacate his room and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million and using his considerable powers to take over many of the well- known hotels, especially the venues connected with organized crime, and he quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its Wild West roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city. =Hank Greenspun= The local newspaper Las Vegas Sun and its editor Hank Greenspun led a crusade in those days to expose all the criminal ties, activities, and government corruption in Las Vegas. His investigative reporting and editorials led to the exposure of Clark County Sheriff Glen Jones' ownership of a brothel and the resignation of Lieutenant Governor Clifford A. Jones as the state's national committeeman for the Democratic Party. Before his death in 1989, Hank Greenspun founded The Greenspun Corporation to manage his family's assets, and it remains a major influence in Las Vegas, with media holdings in print, television and the Internet; substantial real estate holdings; and ownership stakes in a number of casinos. =Local government= One problem for the City of Las Vegas was that the Strip did not reside in Las Vegas. Because of this, the city lost tax revenue. There was a push to annex the Strip by the City of Las Vegas, but The Syndicate used the Clark County Commissioners to pull a legal maneuver by organizing the Las Vegas Strip properties into an unincorporated township called Paradise. Under Nevada Law, an incorporated town, Las Vegas, cannot annex an unincorporated township. To this day, virtually all of the Strip remains outside the City of Las Vegas. =Desegregation= Much like in other American settled counties and towns throughout the United States, entertainment venues were segregated between black- and white-owned businesses. With almost all of the businesses owned and operated by whites, Black Americans were barred from entering the venues which remained focused, regardless of their legitimacy or criminality, on entertaining a white-only clientele. As a result of property deeds, businesses owned by or mainly serving non-whites were confined to clubs on the \\"west side\\" of the tracks. This also was enforced in many of the work positions. Thus, African Americans (except those who provided the labor for low-paying menial positions or entertainment) and Hispanics were limited in employment occupations at the white-owned clubs. However, because of employment deals with black worker groups, many clubs favored black workers, and the Hispanic population actually decreased ninety percent from 2,275 to just 236 by the mid-1950s. Organized crime-owned businesses saw an opportunity in not dividing their clientele by race and, despite property deeds and city and county codes barring such activities, made several attempts at desegregating their businesses in the hopes of putting out of operation the non-white owned clubs and expanding their own market share. An attempt was made at forming an all-integrated night-club modeled on the Harlem Clubs of New York City during the 1920s and 1930s, like those owned by German-Jewish gangster Dutch Schultz. On May 24, 1955, Jewish crime boss Will Max Schwartz, along with other investors, opened the Moulin Rouge. It was a very upscale and racially integrated casino that actually competed against the resorts on the Strip, especially the non-white owned strips on the west side. By the end of the year, the casino closed as Schwartz and his partners had a falling out, but the seeds for racial integration were sown. Many sources have credited Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack as a significant driving force behind desegregation in the casinos.Sammy Davis jr, \\"Hollywood in a suitcase\\", William Morrow and company, 1980 One famous story tells of Sinatra's refusal to perform at the Sands Hotel unless the hotel provided Sammy Davis Jr. with a room. The famed performing group made similar demands at other venues, forcing owners to amend their policies over time. However, it took political action for racial desegregation to occur. In 1960, the NAACP threatened a protest of the city's casinos for their policies. A meeting between the NAACP, the mayor and local businessmen resulted in citywide casino desegregation, starting with the employees. Many whites were attritioned from positions and their jobs given to the black unions. Along with the rest of the country, Las Vegas experienced the struggle for civil rights. Activists like James B. McMillan, Grant Sawyer, Bob Bailey, and Charles Keller dragged Las Vegas to racial integration. Aside from seeing no business advantage to excluding non-white customers from casinos and clubs, the organized crime groups themselves were composed of people of ethnicities (Jewish and Italian) that faced discrimination from WASP America and thus could understand the plight of blacks. This was also a driving force behind the integration advocated by ethnic performers such as Sinatra and Martin. Another big force for equality was Mayor Oran Gragson. Spurred into local politics by a vigilante ring of cops who repeatedly broke into his appliance store, he implemented infrastructure improvements for the minority neighborhoods in Las Vegas, backed the NAACP in its actions, and promoted black workers for jobs. He also championed the cause of the Paiute tribe that owned a small portion of Las Vegas. Gragson stopped the U.S. government from evicting the tribe and actually made infrastructure improvements for them. His work helped reverse the decrease of minority populations in Las Vegas. Local legislation kept up with the national legislation and integration was finally established. The only real violence came as a result of school integration, with violent riots and fights occurring in Clark High School when black gangs and youths began attacking the whites. Integration sparked white flight from the school district from 1965 to 1971. 1970‚Äì1988: Explosive growth On a percentage basis, Las Vegas and Clark County experienced incredibly high growth rates starting in the 1930s and lasting until the late 2000s recession. During that period, the population of the city more than doubled in most decades. The rate slowed down in the 1970s with the decrease of the white birth rate, but never dropped below 60% (1980‚Äì1990), and even accelerated after 1990 due to immigration. By 2000, Las Vegas was the largest city founded in the 20th century,City of Las Vegas History , retrieved 2012-06-20 and by 2006 it was the 28th largest city in the US, with a population of 552,000 in the city and nearly 1.8 million in Clark County. The explosive growth resulted in rapid development of commercial and residential areas throughout the Las Vegas Valley. The strong boom in the resort business led to many new condominium developments all along the Strip and downtown area. Also urban sprawl development of single-family homes continued across the valley, building the areas of Henderson, North Las Vegas, Centennial Hills, and Summerlin. The rapid development and population growth both halted abruptly in the late 2000s recession.Vegas Building Boom Goes Bust, retrieved 2012-06-20Downturn douses Nevada's population-growth streak, retrieved 2012-06-20 During this period of time, American author and journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote and published his seminal novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, detailing the experience of his 1971 trip to the city. On November 21, 1980 the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, suffered a devastating fire. A total of 85 people died and 785 were injured in what remains the worst disaster in Nevada history. The property was eventually sold and reopened as Bally's Las Vegas, while MGM moved south to Tropicana Avenue. Since 1989: the megaresort era The Strip resorts in late 2009 The \\"Mafia/Rat Pack\\" Las Vegas of the mid-20th century came to a gradual end in the 1980s with the aging out of the World War II generation, the decline of organized crime elements, and the rise of baby boomer entrepreneurs who began a new chapter in the city's history, the so-called megaresort era. Las Vegas began to become a more commercialized, family-oriented place with large corporations coming to own the hotels, casinos, and nightclubs in place of Mafia bosses. The megaresort era kicked off in 1989 with the construction of The Mirage. Built by developer Steve Wynn, it was the first resort built with money from Wall Street, selling $630 million in junk bonds. Its 3,044 rooms, each with gold tinted windows, set a new standard for Vegas luxury and attracted tourists in droves, leading to additional financing and rapid growth on the Las Vegas Strip. More landmark hotels and other structures were razed to make way for ever-larger and more opulent resorts including: * 1990: Rio and Excalibur * 1993: MGM Grand, Treasure Island, and Luxor, * 1996: Stratosphere Tower and Monte Carlo * 1997: New York-New York * 1998: Bellagio * 1999: Mandalay Bay, Venetian, and Paris * 2000: Planet Hollywood (Formerly Aladdin) * 2001: Palms * 2005: Wynn (opened in April by Wynn Resorts Limited opened its new flagship, the constructed at a cost of US$2.7 billion.) The Helldorado Days festival was resumed in 2005 for the City of Las Vegas' centennial celebration.  Since 2007: downturn and recovery  The home mortgage crisis (2007-2010) and the late 2000s recession affected Las Vegas' economic success. New home construction was stalled, and construction projects were either canceled, postponed, or continued with financial troubles. Some of these projects included the MGM Mirage property of CityCenter, Fontainebleau, Echelon, and The Plaza. The global financial situation also had a negative effect on gaming and tourism revenue, causing many of the companies to report net loss. Nevertheless, new landmark hotels and resorts were still to arise, including: * 2007: Palazzo * 2008: Encore * 2009: CityCenter (chain of hotels including Mandarin Oriental/Waldorf-Astoria, Vdara, Aria and shopping Crystals) * 2010: The Cosmopolitan * 2014: The Linq Many analysts agree that the Las Vegas economy is recovering, with improving conditions in tourism and the housing market for 2013. Prices are rising and there has been a large increase in the million dollar home market, with many new custom homes being built. January 2013 marks the 19th consecutive month with home sales higher than the same month in the previous year. In addition, Las Vegas was named America's Top Turn Around Market for 2012 by Trulia. In June 2017, a heat wave grounded more than 40 airline flights of small aircraft, with American Airlines reducing sales on certain flights to prevent the vehicles from being over the maximum weight permitted for safe takeoff and Las Vegas tying its record high at 117 degrees Fahrenheit. During the late evening of October 1, 2017, Las Vegas became the scene of the deadliest mass shooting committed by a single gunman in the history of the United States. A gunman opened fire on Route 91 Harvest festival-goers from the Mandalay Bay resort, killing 60 and injuring 867.

History East Lancs E Type bodied Dennis Dominator in Hull in May 1995 Fleet in original Stagecoach livery in 2001 Stagecoach in Hull's origins can be traced back to the Hull City Council owned Hull Corporation Transport, which in addition to buses, also operated trams and trolleybuses in the city. In the late 1970s/early 1980s, Hull Corporation Transport was renamed Kingston-upon-Hull City Transport (KHCT) and, as had been the case for decades, KHCT shared Hull's bus network with National Bus Company subsidiary East Yorkshire Motor Services (EYMS).

EYMS began to operate on much of KHCT's network of services and KHCT's position was compounded by smaller-sized competitors entering Hull's bus network, including City Traveller, Connor & Graham, Metro Citybus and Pride of the Road/North Bank Travel. These operators focused on the more profitable corridors of Hull's bus network, with elderly second-hand vehicles and in some, not all, cases a low-fare down-market image. These operators would eventually fade away, either going bankrupt or being taken over. in particular by EYMS. As a consequence KHCT was making losses and was itself subject to a hostile takeover bid from EYMS. The bid was rejected but, faced with escalating losses and increased competition, in December 1993 Hull City Council sold KHCT to Stockton-on-Tees based Cleveland Transit.Cleveland Transit Ltd 1991 - to date tomorrows-history.com This deal saw KHCT's employees a 49% stake in the business.

It consists of sedimentary rocks dating from the Mississippian period (354‚Äì323 million years ago) in Texas. The formation underlies the city of Fort Worth and underlies 5,000 mi¬≤ (13,000 km¬≤) and at least 17 counties. As of 2007, some experts suggested that the Barnett Shale might have the largest producible reserves of any onshore natural gas field in the United States.Barnett Shale Economic Impact Study, May 2007, p.16. The field is thought to have of recoverable natural gas, and of natural gas in place. Oil also has been found in lesser quantities, but sufficient (with high oil prices) to be commercially viable. The Barnett Shale is known as a \\"tight\\" gas reservoir, indicating that the gas is not easily extracted. The shale is very impermeable, and it was virtually impossible to produce gas in commercial quantities from this formation until oil and gas companies learned how to effectively use massive hydraulic fracturing in the formation. The use of horizontal drilling further improved the economics, and made it easier to extract gas from under developed areas. Future development of the field will be hampered in part by the fact that major portions of the field are in urban areas, including the rapidly growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.Marc Airhart Won't You Be My Neighbor?. Jackson School of Geosciences. January 2007 Some local governments are researching means by which they can drill on existing public land (e.g., parks) without disrupting other activities so they may obtain royalties on any minerals found, whereas others are seeking compensation from drilling companies for damage to roads caused by overweight vehicles (many of the roads are rural and not designed for use by heavy equipment). In addition, drilling and exploration have generated significant controversy because of environmental damage including contamination to the ground water sources. Name The formation is named after John W. Barnett, who settled in San Saba County during the late 19th century, where he named a local stream the Barnett Stream. In the early 20th century during a geological mapping expedition, scientists noted a thick black organic-rich shale in an outcrop close to the stream. The shale was consequently named the Barnett Shale. . Retiro Royalties. The Barnett shale has acted as a source and sealing cap rock for more conventional oil and gas reservoirs in the area. History of the Newark, East Gas Field Map of gas wells in the Barnett Shale, Texas Gas production from Barnett Shale Gas wells producing from the Barnett Shale of the Fort Worth basin are designated as the Newark, East Gas Field by the Texas Railroad Commission. From 2002 to 2010 the Barnett was the most productive source of shale gas in the US; it is now third, behind the Marcellus Formation and the Haynesville Shale. In January 2013, the Barnett produced 4.56 billion cubic feet per day, which made up 6.8% of all the natural gas produced in the US.US Energy Information Administration, What is shale gas and why is it important?, retrieved 14 Sept. 2013. =Discovery and Mitchell Energy years= The field was discovered in 1981 when Mitchell Energy drilled and completed the C. W. Slay #1 near Newark, Texas, in Wise County. The well was drilled vertically, completed with a nitrogen foam frac, and did not produce enough gas to cause any excitement.Texas Railroad Commission, Newark, East Field , accessed 5 August 2013. Despite the low production rate, Mitchell Energy owner George P. Mitchell was convinced that he could find a better way to produce gas from the Barnett. Mitchell persevered for years in the face of low production rates in his initial wells, low gas prices, and low profitability. Industry commentators have written that few, if any, other companies would have continued drilling well after well in the Barnett Shale. Mitchell is widely credited with personally making a success of the Barnett Shale, and thus creating the gas production boom in the Barnett, and, when other companies imitated his techniques, many other shale-gas and tight-oil successes in the US and other countries.The Economist, Schumpeter: The father of fracking, July 2013.David F. Martineau1, \\"History of the Newark East field and the Barnett Shale as a gas reservoir,\\" AAPG Bulletin, Apr. 2007. Incrementally, Mitchell Energy found ways to increase production. Early on, Mitchell abandoned the foam frac, which had been used with some success in Appalachian Basin shales, and found that gel fracs worked better in the Barnett. In 1986, Mitchell Energy applied the first massive hydraulic frac, a gel frac, to the Barnett Shale.Quicksilver, The Barnett Shale: a 25-year \\"overnight\\" success , Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, Barnett Shale Symposium, 2005. In 1991, Mitchell Energy, with a subsidy from the federal government, drilled the first horizontal well in the Barnett, but the experiment was not considered a success. It was not until 1998 that Mitchell drilled two more horizontal wells; they were technical successes, but economic failures. Mitchell's fourth and last horizontal attempt was made in 2000, but ran into drilling problems and was abandoned.Zhongmin Wang and Alan Krupnick, A Retrospective Review of Shale Gas Development in the United States , Resources for the Futures, Apr. 2013. The largest breakthrough in the Barnett came in 1997, when Mitchell Energy petroleum engineer Nick Steinsberger suggested that a slickwater frac, which was being successfully used by other companies in wells to the Cotton Valley Sandstone of east Texas, might work better in the Barnett Shale than the gel fracs.Michael Ennis, ‚ÄúRough guide to Frackistan, Texas Monthly, May 2014 By going against conventional wisdom and switching to the slickwater frac, Mitchell Energy not only lowered the cost of completing wells by $75,000 to $100,000, but also dramatically increased the recovery of gas. Mitchell tried to buy more leases in the area before word spread, but soon many other operators started buying leases and drilling Barnett wells, in what had been until then essentially a Mitchell Energy play.Diana Davids Hinton, \\"The seventeen-year overnight wonder: George Mitchell and unlocking the Barnett Shale,\\" Journal of American History, v.99 n.1 p.229-235. =Other operators join in= Mitchell Energy had a near-monopoly in drilling Barnett Shale wells in the early years of the field. In 1995, for instance, Mitchell completed 70 Barnett wells, while all other operators combined completed three. This was largely because the Barnett was marginal economically: according to a former CEO, Mitchell had invested about $250 million in the Barnett from 1981 to 1997, and had not recouped its costs. But after 1997, competitors realized that Mitchell had discovered how to extract gas profitably, they, too started buying leases and drilling Barnett wells, at a pace that Mitchell could not match. In 2001, for the first time, Mitchell completed fewer than half the Barnett Shale wells (258 wells, versus 260 by other operators). George Mitchell sold Mitchell Energy to Devon Energy in 2002. Helped by better drilling technology, the difficulties of drilling near populated areas, and higher gas prices in the 2000s, horizontal wells became more economic and practical, and in 2005 new horizontal wells outnumbered new vertical wells in the Barnett for the first time. In 2008, 2901 horizontal wells were completed in the Barnett, versus just 183 vertical wells. It was thought that only a few of the thicker sections close to Fort Worth would be able to support economic drilling, until new advances in horizontal drilling were developed in the 1980s. Techniques such as fracturing, or \\"fracking\\", wells, used by Mitchell Energy, opened the possibility of more large scale production.Marc Airhart The Father of the Barnett. Jackson School of Geosciences. January 2007 Even with new techniques, significant drilling did not begin until gas prices increased in the late 1990s. =Current status= As of 2012, the Newark, East Field extended into 24 counties, with permits issued for wells in a 25th county, Hamilton. The field had more than 16,000 producing wells. Gas production in 2011 was 2.0 trillion cubic feet. The field was the largest gas producer in Texas, and made up 31% of Texas gas production. Proved reserves as of the end of 2011 were 32.6 trillion cubic feet of gas and 118 million barrels of oil or condensate.US Energy Information Administration, U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Proved Reserves, August 2013. Well completion Barnett Shale gas drilling rig near Alvarado, Texas (2008) Two key developments in well design and completions have fostered development of the Barnett Shale. These are horizontal drilling, and hydraulic fracturing. =Horizontal drilling= Horizontal drilling has increased the potential of the Barnett Shale as a major source of natural gas. Horizontal drilling has changed the way oil and gas drilling is done by allowing producers access to reservoirs which were otherwise too thin to be economically viable through vertical drilling. Much of the gas in the Barnett Shale is beneath the City of Fort Worth. The new technology has attracted a number of gas-production companies. In addition to extended reach, horizontal drilling drastically increases production. In \\"tight\\" rock (low permeability) like the Barnett Shale, the gas uses fractures to move out of the rock and into the wellbore. The fractures may be natural or induced (see below). A horizontal well exposes more rock (and therefore more fractures) to the wellbore because it is usually designed with the horizontal portion of the well in the productive formation. In 2005‚Äì2007 horizontal drilling in the Barnett Shale extended south into Johnson, Hill, and Bosque counties, with a 100% success rate on completed wells. An experimental vertical well is being drilled in McLennan County (near Waco) to assess the potential for drilling along the Ouachita Fold, a geological barrier which defines the southern limit of the Barnett Shale. Although horizontal wells are now the norm, as of early 2013, some vertical wells were still being drilled in the Barnett.\\"Rig count rises to 36 in the Barnett,\\" Fort Worth Star- Telegram, 18 Jan. 2013, =Hydraulic fracturing= Hydraulic fracturing carried out in the Barnett Shale is done by pumping a mixture of water, sand, and various chemical additives (to affect viscosity, flow rates, etc.) into the well bore at a sufficient pressure to create and propagate a fracture in the surrounding rock formation down hole. This is crucial in low permeability rock as it exposes more of the formation to the well bore and greater volumes of gas can be produced by the increased surface area. Without hydraulic fracturing, the wells would not produce at an economically feasible rate. In 1997, Nick Steinsberger, an engineer of Mitchell Energy (now part of Devon Energy), applied the slickwater fracturing technique, using more water and higher pump pressure than previous fracturing techniques, which was used in East Texas in the Barnett Shale of north Texas. In 1998, the new technique proved to be successful when the first 90 days gas production from the well called S.H. Griffin No. 3 exceeded production of any of the company's previous wells. Scientists at the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin, who have worked closely with producing companies to develop the Barnett play, also see potential for conflict in some parts of the Barnett where water use for hydraulic fracturing could compete with other uses such as drinking and agriculture.Marc Airhart A Super-sized Thirst. Jackson School of Geosciences. January 2007 The process of hydraulic fracturing generates significant criticism. Opponents allege that it is inadequately monitored and poses significant threats to water and air quality in surrounding areas, and cite a growing number of incidents of methane in nearby water wells. Economic impact As of September 2008, gas producers said that bonuses paid to landowners in the southern counties ranged from $200 to $28,000 per acre ($500‚Äì69,000/ha), the higher prices being paid by Vantage Energy in the fall of 2008. Royalty payments in the 18‚Äì25% range. One lease in Johnson County now has 19 wells permitted. A Fort Worth Star-Telegram article reported more than 100,000 new leases were recorded in Tarrant County in 2007. Terms of recent leases have included and a 25% royalty for homeowners in Ryan Place, Mistletoe Heights, and Berkley on Fort Worth's south side, and $22,500 per acre and a 25% royalty for a group of homeowners in south Arlington. More recent articles in the Fort Worth Weekly report that many signed lease agreements have not been honored, with lessors alleging that they were paid significantly less than promised or were not paid at all. Oil industry advocates claim that by 2015 the Barnett Shale may be responsible for more than 108,000 jobs.Louise S. Durham, Hot Barnett play creating wealth, AAPG Explorer, Sept. 2007, p.46‚Äì47. Critics say that tax revenues may be offset by cleanup costs for toxic byproducts of gas drilling, such as benzene and naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). Environmental groups have pressured state regulators to begin forcing cleanups. The San Juan Citizens Alliance has sued to force the EPA to tighten regulations. Ed Ireland, of the Barnett Shale Energy Council (an industry advocacy group) has said that he believes regulation will increase under the Obama administration; as of 2012, this has not been the case. A 2011 study for the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce concluded that the Barnett Shale development was responsible for 119,000 jobs in Texas, 100,000 of them in the Fort Worth region.Perryman Group, A decade of development, Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, Aug. 2011. An expanded gas pipeline network for transporting the gas to market is being sought. The completion of a natural gas transmission pipeline through Hill County may open up new areas for drilling. =Proved reserves= * 2010, US Energy Information Administration: 31.0 trillion cubic feet of gas * 2011, US Energy Information Administration: 32.6 trillion cubic feet of gas, 118 million barrels of oilUS EIA, U.S. crude oil and natural gas proved reserves, 1 Aug. 2013. Operators in the Barnett According to the Texas Railroad Commission, as of 2012 there were 235 operators (companies which manage producing wells) in the Barnett Shale. In terms of gas volumes produced, the top ten operators, in order of decreasing gas production, were:Texas Railroad Commission, Newark, East (Barnett Shale) Field . * Devon Energy * Chesapeake Energy * XTO Energy * EOG Resources * Enervest Operating, L.L.C. * Quicksilver Resources * Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. * Legend Natural Gas IV * Premier Natural Resources II * Barnett Shale Operating Geography of Barnett Shale The Barnett Shale has been classified into \\"Core\\" and \\"Non-Core\\" areas of production. To date production has concentrated in the Core area where the shale is thicker and the uncertainty is reduced. This allows for the wells to be drilled at slightly lower gas prices than those in Non-core areas. =Core= *Denton (active) *Johnson (active) *Tarrant (active) *Wise (active) =Non-core= *Dallas County, Texas (active) *Bosque (potential) *Comanche (potential) *Cooke (active) *Ellis (potential) *Erath (active) *Hamilton (potential) *Hill (active) *Hood (active) *Jack (potential) *Montague (active) *Palo Pinto (active) *Parker (active) *Somervell (active) Operators, such as EOG Resources, Gulftex Operating, Inc, and Devon Energy, stated in public reports in mid-2005 that they estimate that one third to one half of the land in the counties that contain the Barnett Shale, including the most heavily prospected counties like Johnson and Tarrant, will get wells. There have been few dry holes drilled, because technology like 3D Seismic allows operators to identify potential hazards before they drill and avoid bad areas. Some of the hazards include faults and karst features (sinkholes). Faults may divert hydraulic fracturing, reducing its effectiveness, and karst features may contain abundant water that limits the production of gas. Controversy Several groups in communities in which gas wells have been located have complained of high risk of catastrophic accidents, and some allege that accidents have already occurred, including several resulting in fatalities. Some environmental groups and north Texas residents have expressed concern about the effects of drilling on air and water quality in the areas surrounding the wells and pipelines. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an emergency order against Range Resources, stating that the company's drilling activities in Parker County, Texas had contaminated at least two residential drinking water wells. The company denied the allegations, and said the presence of methane was a result of naturally occurring migration, and had shown up in nearby water wells long before Range drilled its gas wells.US EPA, Region 6, EPA Issues an Imminent and Substantial Endangerment Order to Protect Drinking Water in Southern Parker County, 7 Dec. 2010. However, after a January 2011 Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) hearing, TRRC staff concluded that, based on chemical composition, the gas in the water wells came from the shallow Strawn Formation, rather than the deeper Barnett Shale, in which the Range wells were completed. They also concluded that pressure tests by Range showed mechanical integrity of the casing. EPA and the two homeowners were invited to present evidence at the TRRC hearing, but did not.Texas Railroad Commission, , 22 Mar. 2011. In March 2012, the EPA dropped its order against Range.Fort Worth Star-Telegram, EPA drops action against Range Resources over Parker County water wells, 31 Mar. 2012. The mayor of Dish, Texas complained that air pollution from a natural gas compressor station was sickening his family. However, in May 2010, The Texas Department of State Health Services released air quality results for DISH, including tests of blood and urine samples from 28 DISH residents that were tested for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The agency concluded: ‚ÄúThe information obtained from this investigation did not indicate that community-wide exposures from gas wells or compressor stations were occurring in the sample population. This conclusion was based on the pattern of VOC values found in the samples.

Ca√±ihua is native to the Andean region, with more than 200 varieties, and it has been farmed in the Altiplano for millennia. As a crop, ca√±ihua has distinct characteristics, including tolerance of high mountain conditions, high content of protein and dietary fiber, and rich phenolic content. Botanical description Ca√±ihua is a herbaceous and annual plant. This species is diploid with a chromosome number of 2n = 18. There are two types of this species, which differ in their branching. The lasta type shows high branching, whereas the saguia type is characterized by few branching and its more erected growth.Hemandez, Esteban J. (1994). Neglected crops:1492 from a different perspective. Rome: FAO. . The plant grows to 20‚Äì60 cm high and is therefore shorter than its close relative quinoa. Ca√±ihua also vary from quinoa in its inflorescence and its flower traits. The inflorescences are situated on the terminal and axillar cimas. The flowers are small and without petals. There are three different types of flower. Hermaphrodite consists of both the stamen and the pistils. Another flower type are the pistillate flowers, which have pistils, but no stamens. The third type of flower are male sterile flowers. The fruits are small and dark, which contain brown or black seed with a diameter of 0.5 to 1.5 mm. The fruits are deciduous, which means that the seeds are lost spontaneously and are then dispersed. Once maturation is reached, the plant stem and leaves change in colour to yellow, red, green or purple. Uses Ca√±ihua can easily be milled to flour and can be prepared further as a toasted ca√±ihua flour called ca√±ihuaco. Ca√±ihuaco has a nutty taste and can be mixed with water and milk for a breakfast meal. Since it is rich in calories and proteins, local people take it on long travels. Additionally, ca√±ihua flour can be used for a lot of other purposes such as bread-making, pastry-making and noodle-making. Some varieties of ca√±ihua can even be included in sweets, snacks and weaning food mixtures. The cooking and extrusion technology tests have already shown successful results in several countries. This technology present numerous advantages such as low cost, simple operation, moderate production volume, minimum auxiliary equipment, versatility, good sanitary conditions and easy management. Results from a study demonstrated that the initial moisture content of 12% was optimal to obtain an extrudate with good physicochemical characteristics (e.g. degree of gelatinization, sectional expansion index, water absorption index, water solubility index and density). Additionally, roasting does not significantly affect the dialyzability of nutritionally valuable minerals in qa√±iwa. Boiling, however, was found to increase zinc, iron and calcium dialyzability. =Importance for food security= Ca√±ihua is an important crop for food security in the Andean region where there are nutritional problems. The most affected group are rural families having limited access to commodities due to poverty and droughts. Ca√±ihua is both easily accessible and drought-resistant, offering potential food and income for highland farmers. In order to alleviate problems of food security, new food-processing technologies and products are being developed to encourage companies to process native Andean crops and to increase their consumption as well as open market opportunities using ca√±ihua. Nutritional value The indigenous Andean food crops, quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), kiwicha (Amaranthus caudatus) and ca√±ihua have high nutritional value based mainly on their considerable protein content and dietary fiber value. Their protein, calcium, zinc and iron content is higher than that of more widely commercialized cereals. The protein content (15.3%) of ca√±ihua grain is higher than that of quinoa and kiwicha, and similar to wheat (12.6%) and oats (16.9%). The lipids consist mainly of unsaturated fatty acids. Unlike quinoa, ca√±ihua contains a lower amount of the bitter tasting saponins which affect taste and texture. Cultivation Ca√±ihua is a half-domesticated plant from the highlands of Bolivia and Peru,Tapia ME & Fries AM (2007). Gu√≠a de campo de los cultivos Andinos, Origen de las plantas cultivadas en los Andes, Chapt. I. Eds.: FAO & ANPE-PERU, Rome & Lima. . http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ai185s/ai185s01.pdf. cultivated as a pseudocereal crop for its seeds. Both seeds and leaves are edible.Plants For A Future (2007). Chenopodium pallidicaule. http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Chenopodium+pallidicaule. The plant was often cultivated in South America in the past. More than 200 varieties are known in Bolivia, but only twenty are still in use, with a majority of farmers cultivating just one.Bioversity International (2013). Creating markets for orphan crops, Bioversity International supports marketing link in food value chain. CGIAR. =Environmental requirements= Ca√±ihua is well-adapted to the Andean climate and therefore cold-resistant in all growth stages. Adult plants are also resistant to night frosts. In vegetative stage, the plant may survive until ‚Äì10 ¬∞C, flowers until ‚Äì3 ¬∞C FAO (2007). Ecocrop ‚Äì Chenopodium pallidicaule, Data sheet. http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=4494. and is growing until temperatures up to 28 ¬∞C at sufficient humidity.Global Facilitation Unit for Underutilized Species (n.d.). CA√ëIHUA (Chenopodium pallidicaule), Enabling deployment of underutilized species. CGIAR. http://www.underutilized- species.org/species/brochures/Canihua.pdf Ca√±ihua can be grown from 1500 m up to 4400 m, but is rarely cultivated below 3800 m. The plant has resistance to strong winds, heavy rainfalls, most pests and diseases, and even prolonged drought periods. Rainfall from 500 to 800 mm during the growing season makes irrigation unnecessary. The plant does not grow well in shade, maritime exposure or excess humidity. Ca√±ihua can be grown on any kind of moderately fertile soil, including shallow, acid, alkaline or saline soils. =Plant development= As an annual crop, ca√±ihua reaches maturity in 95 to 150 days, depending on variety. Germinating starts at soil temperatures of 5 ¬∞C. Flowering happens from July to October at temperatures around 10 ¬∞C and ripening from August to October at 15 ¬∞C. =Harvesting and post-harvesting= Ca√±ihua has to be harvested at colour change, before full maturation, to prevent high yield losses due to seed scattering. The crop has to be cut, dried and threshed by hand or using a wheat thresher. Papery husks enclose the seeds and have to be washed and rubbed away. Average seed yield is 400 ‚Äì 900 kg/ha in traditional cropping systems. In intensive systems, yields of 2‚Äì3 t can be obtained. 1000‚Äìkernel weight (weight in grams of 1,000 seeds) is only 480 mg, compared to 1900 mg - 4000 mg of quinoa.Simmonds NW (1965). The Grain Chenopods of the Tropical American Highlands. Vol. 19 (Iss. 3). pp. 223 ‚Äì 235, Economic Botany. Springer. =Potential and risks= Ca√±ihua is often considered as a forgotten crop once widely used in the Andes, but now replaced by other crops such as millet. Today, ca√±ihua has significance only at higher altitudes, where neither quinoa nor millet can grow.Lieberei R, Reisdorff C & Franke W (2012). Nutzpflanzen. pp. 89‚Äì99. Thieme, Stuttgart. . In analogy to the success of quinoa and the increasing demand for it in western countries, ca√±ihua has growing market potential. The crop was experimentally produced in Finland and showed good results. The risk of outcrossing is very small, as ca√±ihua is self-pollinating. The risk of becoming invasive remains.Lauber K, Wagner G, Gygax A & Eggenberg S (2014). Flora Helvetica. pp. 594‚Äì600. Haupt, Bern. . The most important breeding aims are the reduction of seed scattering and increased seed size.Becker H (2011). Pflanzenz√ºchtung. pp. 10‚Äì11. Ulmer, Stuttgart. .

The STG contains the somata of 26 neurons that belong to two central pattern generating neural circuits (gastric mill and pyloric circuit) This photo shows the pyloric dilator neuron, a pacemaker neuron in the STG that was stained via intracellular injection of a fluorescent dye. The inset shows a recording of the rhythmic oscillations of the PD membrane potential. The recordings were taken by Christopher Goldsmith in the lab of Wolfgang Stein at Illinois State University. The Stomatogastric Nervous System (STNS) is a commonly studied neural network composed of several ganglia in arthropods that controls the motion of the gut and foregut. The network of neurons acts as a central pattern generator. It is a model system for motor pattern generation because of the small number of cells, which are comparatively large and can be reliably identified. The system is composed of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG), oesophageal ganglion and the paired commissural ganglia. Because of the many similarities between vertebrate and invertebrate systems, especially with regards to basic principles of neuronal function, invertebrate model systems such as the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system continue to provide key insight into how neural circuits operate in the numerically larger and less accessible vertebrate CNS. Understanding how neuronal networks enable animals and humans to make coordinated movements is a continuing goal of neuroscience research. The stomatogastric nervous system of decapod crustaceans, which controls aspects of feeding, has contributed significantly to the general principles guiding our present understanding of how rhythmic motor circuits operate at the cellular level. Rhythmic behaviors include all motor acts that at their core involve a rhythmic repeating set of movements. The circuits underlying such rhythmic behaviors, central pattern generators (CPGs), all operate on the same general principles. These networks remain rhythmic in the completely isolated nervous system, even in the absence of all rhythmic neuronal input, including feedback from sensory systems. Although the details differ in each circuit, all CPGs use the same set of cellular-level mechanisms for circuit construction. More importantly, CPG circuits are usually not dedicated to producing a single neuronal activity pattern. This flexibility results largely from the ability of different neuromodulators to change the cellular and synaptic properties of individual circuit neurons. When the properties of circuit components are changed, the output of the circuit itself is modified. These aspects of CPG operation are often shared by other circuits, enabling a general understanding of neuronal circuit operation. The STNS contains a set of distinct but interacting motor circuits. The understanding of this multifunctional network contributed importantly to the general understanding of neural circuit operation. The value of this system has resulted from its accessibility, the use of several innovative techniques, and the combined research effort of around 15 laboratories over the past ~30 years.

The first Canadian store was opened in November 1960 in Scarborough, Toronto (at the corner of Lawrence Ave. East and Midland Ave.). After the chain went bankrupt in 1963, a group of Towers concessionaires, incorporated as Allied Towers Merchants Ltd., purchased the 13 Canadian stores and began operating as a Canada-only chain.http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic- cipo/trdmrks/srch/viewTrademark.html?id=316663‚ü®=eng Logo of Bonimart stores in Quebec In Quebec, the chain traded as Towers in the 1960s but the name was changed to Bonimart on April 20, 1971, starting with the stores in the Greater Montreal, as part of a program by owner Oshawa Group to promote the French character among its subsidiaries in the province. Each selling department within a Towers store was operated as a licensed concession. Some Towers/Bonimart stores offered services such as restaurants, photo labs, and pharmacies within the store. Some stores were also paired with an IGA or Food City grocery store. On October 22, 1990, Towers/Bonimart's 51 stores were purchased by Hudson's Bay Company which intended to merge them with its Zellers subsidiary. The transaction was met with strong opposition from the New York-based F. W. Woolworth Company (owner of the Woolco stores in Canada) which also wanted to purchase the chain. On April 15, 1991, 46 of the Towers/Bonimart stores were rebranded into the Zellers banner. The remaining stores held closeout sales under their original name, some of them lasting until the fall of 1991.

The XF8B was intended for operation against the Japanese home islands from aircraft carriers outside the range of Japanese land-based aircraft. Designed for various roles including interceptor, long- range escort fighter, dive-bomber, and torpedo bomber, the final design embodied a number of innovative features in order to accomplish the various roles. Despite its formidable capabilities, the XF8B-1 never entered series production. Design and development The XF8B-1 was, at the time, the largest and heaviest single-seat, single-engine fighter developed in the United States. Boeing called the XF8B-1 optimistically, the \\"five-in-one fighter\\" (fighter, interceptor, dive bomber, torpedo bomber, or level bomber). It was powered by a single 3,000 hp (2,200 kW) Pratt & Whitney XR-4360-10 four-row 28-cylinder radial engine, driving two three-bladed contra-rotating propellers. It would be the largest single-seat piston fighter to fly in the U.S. to date. The large wings featured outer sections which could fold vertically, while the fuselage incorporated an internal bomb bay and large fuel tanks; more fuel could be carried externally. The proposed armament included six 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns or six 20 mm wing-mounted cannons, and a 6,400 lb (2,900 kg) bomb load or two 2,000 lb (900 kg) torpedoes. The final configuration was a large but streamlined design, featuring a bubble canopy, sturdy main undercarriage that folded into the wings, and topped by a variation on the B-29 vertical tail. The contract for three prototypes (BuNos 57984‚Äì57986) was awarded 4 May 1943, although only one was completed before the war ended. It first flew in November 1944. The two remaining prototypes were completed after the war, with the third (BuNo 57986) evaluated at Eglin Air Force Base by the United States Army Air Forces. Operational history Drop tank arrangement on XF8B-1 To expedite testing and evaluation, a second cockpit was fitted to the first two prototypes to allow a flight engineer to help monitor the test flights. The second seat was easily accommodated in the roomy cockpit. Although testing of the promising XF8B concept continued into 1946 by the USAAF and 1947 by the US Navy, the end of the war in the Pacific and changing postwar strategy required that Boeing concentrate on building large land-based bombers and transports. The advent of jet fighters led to the cancellation of many wartime piston-engined projects; consequently, since the USAF lost interest in pursuing the project and the U.S. Navy was only prepared to offer a small contract, Boeing chose to wind down the XF8B program. Tests at Boeing Field were marred by an accident in which a test pilot accidentally retracted his landing gear on final approach. Investigation later found this to have been caused by a faulty micro switch. This occurred just as first shift was ending, and as many workers watched from the Plant 2 steps, the XF8B-1 bellied onto the concrete of Boeing Field. As the test program was concluded, the prototypes were scrapped one by one, with 57986 lingering on into 1950.

From November 15, 1835 to February 1, 1836 he was chief of state of the state of El Salvador within the Central American Federation. G√≥mez's parents were Jos√© Luis Gom√©z de Altamirano y Gazo, a Peninsular, and Bartola de Elizondo, a native of Cartago. He was sent to Metap√°n, El Salvador as a child. Later he studied law in Guatemala, becoming a licenciado. Having accumulated some money, he moved back to Metap√°n, where he married Catalina Rodr√≠guez. He also brought his father, now widowed, to live with him. He was part of the city council of Metap√°n in November 1811, when the first independence revolt broke out. He joined with the other council members in opposing this, although he was secretly a supporter of independence. He moved to San Salvador, where he also became a member of the city council. He edited the Instrucciones, in which he expressed very liberal ideas. Upon the proclamation of independence, he joined the patriot cause and fought in the war against Imperial Mexico (1822‚Äì23). He attained the rank of captain. He was elected a deputy in the Legislature in 1826. Later he returned to the army of the state, when El Salvador and Honduras withdrew recognition of the federal authorities. He served under General Francisco Moraz√°n, whose confidence he gained. He was promoted to colonel. On October 10, 1827 in Izalco he presented to federal President Manuel Jos√© Arce El Salvador's peace proposals. On November 15, 1835, Moraz√°n made him chief of state of El Salvador state, replacing Nicol√°s Espinoza. He served on an interim basis, until he was replaced by Diego Vigil on February 1, 1836. Francisco G√≥mez was assassinated in Guatemala on May 17, 1838. References *This article is a free translation of the article at the Spanish wikipedia.

It is sandwiched between the railroad, immediately to its north, and the interstate. As of 2005, its population was estimated at 60 residents, with three small businesses, a general store, a service station, and a post office, as well as ruins of a public school and other businesses that flourished until the 1960s. As of 2014, only the general store remained in operation; the nearest service station is in Plateau, 18 mi west along the interstate. It, therefore, has had no medical, pharmaceutical, public educational, legal, police, fire, or other governmental services beyond the post office within its boundaries; the nearest source of these is in Van Horn, 37 mi west. No motels, hotels, or trailer/RV parks, restaurants, or other tourist services are available, either. The surrounding county area it serves contains semidesert land supporting large cattle ranches.

C. ‚ÄúChuck‚Äù Adams, owner of Sew-Vac, Inc. and International Mail Order Co., died in Kent, Texas, when his private plane, a Cessna 172H Skyhawk, N2757L, crashed 7 mi north of Kent proper, within the Apache Mountain range. Adams was flying with his two older sons, Chuck Jr. and Charles Rodney, from Pecos to Van Horn that morning. Both sons survived the crash in the early morning hours of November 18, 1978. A man driving by found the crash about an hour later, around 8 am. Adams was found deceased, with Chuck Jr, co-pilot, still inside the plane with him, with near-fatal injuries. The younger son, Rodney, was found thrown outside the plane, with only minor injuries. Chuck Jr., due to the magnitude of his injuries from the crash, died on February 5, 1987, and is interred in the cemetery in Dawson, Texas, with his maternal grandparents. William Charles Adams, Sr., originally from Frost, Texas, is interred in Dallas, Texas, in the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Gardens.

Working without member Simon Raymonde, who had been enlisted to collaborate on This Mortal Coil's Filigree & Shadow album, vocalist Elizabeth Fraser and guitarist/producer Robin Guthrie produced a record almost completely devoid of percussion, drenching acoustic guitars in reverberant space to create a wide, expansive sound that bordered on ambient. Description The album title refers to the part of Antarctica known as Victoria Land, after Queen Victoria (and forming the British claim to the continent, currently dormant under international treaty). As is often the case with Fraser's vocals, the lyrics are indecipherable. Some of the track titles were borrowed from passages on the Arctic and Antarctic in David Attenborough's The Living Planet: A Portrait of the Earth, the accompanying book to his 1984 BBC nature documentary series The Living Planet, for example \\"Throughout the dark months of April and May, the birds display to one another and finally mate\\" on page 54. On its initial release in the UK, the vinyl edition was a 12\\" disc which played at 45 rpm, which would be normal for an EP rather than a full album, which would normally play at 33‚Öì rpm. This was due to difficulties in the mastering process in reproducing the minimal soundscapes. Some test pressings at 33‚Öì rpm are known to exist. An uncredited instrumental version of \\"Oomingmak\\" was used as a backing track for the credits at the end of the 4AD compilation video for Lonely Is an Eyesore. This instrumental version was later made available on the band's 1991 4AD singles box set.

The highest point on the island is at 166 m (545 feet). The vast wetland consists of many bogs and morainic hills, covered by vegetation characteristic of the tundra. Notably, a proposed subspecies of the Candle Larkspur, Delphinium elatum ssp. cryophilum, is only found on this island, but its distinctness from the mainland population is disputed. There is only one inhabited settlement on the island, Bugrino, located on the southeast coast.

Due to mechanical problems with the vessel and a misunderstanding, they were left stranded on the island for 12 weeks. He published his study of the natural history and topography of Kolguyev as: \\"Ice-bound on Kolguev\\" (Trevor-Battye 1895).

Its conceit is that mythic beings exist in the modern world. There have been several Aria miniseries written over the course of 1999‚Äì2003, which have been collected in trade paperbacks. Aria (1999) The story opens in a New York bookshop, specializing in the esoteric. The shopowner, a sardonic young woman named Kildare, over the course of a day deals with a woman who found a sword in her flat, two goths who want to drink absinthe, and a man looking for a bargain- basement love potion. After work, she goes back to her flat, where she is greeted by a talking mirror and a fishtank full of tiny merpeople... She goes to a club which caters to an unusual clientele, where it becomes apparent that the woman is a Fae noble. She meets a man named Pug, later revealed to be a dwarf, and the bartender Dion, who is none other than the Greek god Dionysus. On the way home, she is attacked by a group of shadowy creatures. Meanwhile, in an elven pub in Cottingly, a group of Fae are killed by further shadowy creatures. In New York, Pug has rescued Kildare, and they are both looking for some answers. We are also introduced to Childe Roland, a half-elf street artist. The death of the drinkers means that all of the Fae must return to their realm, temporarily for the funeral. We are introduced to 'Mad Ginny', the heroine's cousin, a touch insane, and the ultimate cause of the Cottingly Fairies fiasco. She, too, is being stalked by the shadowy creatures. Eventually, the villain becomes apparent: a dark spiritual creature, who fought the Fae in ages past, and survived up to the present day as a shrub. After gathering strength for many years, his spirit is able to directly touch the physical world, and influence it, causing such disasters as the Great Fire of London in 1666. Finally he is able to take the shape of a human, he finds Mad Ginny, rapes her, and sires a son, through which he can act against the world at any time. The son is gathering the forces of the father. In a final confrontation Kildare, Pug and a mortal wizard battle the son in a shadow realm. He is conducting a ceremony to transfer his soul to that of a human in our world which will allow him to act against mankind. The three defeat the son but not before he transfers his soul back to earth and the waiting recipient. Childe is waiting for him and quickly binds the man with magic. On the final page we see that Ginny has moved to New York to live with Kildaire, the two of them work in Kildaire's antique and magic shop where the two of them watch over an urn that houses the soul of the dark one they trapped. Aria/Angela (2000) This mini-series is a two issue crossover where Kildare meets Angela, the angel who appeared in Spawn. In London at the end of the 19th century, Kildare encounters a freak show exhibiting Angela and must rescue her. Aria: The Soul Market (2001) In this six issue mini-series, Kildare battles Goodfellow, otherwise known as Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream, who is involved in an underground market where human souls are traded. Aria: Summer's Spell (2002) In this two issue mini-series, Kildare encounters a lost love, True Thomas, in 1960s London. Aria: The Uses of Enchantment (2003) In this four issue mini-series, Kildare investigates the Kingdom of Enchantment, an abandoned theme park from the 1950s, which contains a true hidden magical kingdom.

He has been described by the philosopher Daniel Dennett as \\"probably the funniest writer on religion ever\\".Daniel Dennett's Darwinian Mind: An Interview with a 'Dangerous' Man in Science & Spirit Biography De Vries was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1910. He was educated in Dutch Christian Reformed Church schools, graduating from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1931. He also studied at Northwestern University. He supported himself with a number of different jobs, including those of vending machine operator, toffee-apple salesman, radio actor in the 1930s, and editor for Poetry magazine from 1938 to 1944. During World War II De Vries served in the U.S. Marines, attaining the rank of Captain and was seconded to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Very little is known about his time in the military or with that secret organization, the predecessor to the CIA. He joined the staff of The New Yorker magazine at the insistence of James Thurber and worked there from 1944 to 1987, writing stories and touching up cartoon captions. A prolific writer, De Vries wrote short stories, reviews, poetry, essays, a play, novellas, and twenty-three novels. Films made from De Vries's novels include The Tunnel of Love (1958), which also was a successful Broadway play; How Do I Love Thee? (1970, based on Let Me Count the Ways); Pete 'n' Tillie (1972, based on Witch‚Äôs Milk); and Reuben, Reuben (1983), which also inspired a Broadway play, Spofford. Earlier, in 1952, De Vries also contributed to the writing of the Broadway revue New Faces of 1952. Although he enjoyed success for five decades, all his novels were out of print by the time of his death. James Bratt describes De Vries as \\"a secular Jeremiah, a renegade CRC missionary to the smart set.\\" Personal life Peter De Vries met his future wife, poet and author Katinka Loeser, in 1943 when she won an award from Poetry magazine. The couple moved to Westport, Connecticut in 1948. They were the parents of four children: sons Derek and Jon, daughters Jan and Emily. Emily died in 1960 at age ten after a two-year fight with leukemia. This experience provided the inspiration for his 1961 work, The Blood of the Lamb. His son Jon is an actor who has appeared in movies such as American Gangster; Sarah, Plain and Tall; and Skylark; as well as episodic television in shows like Blue Bloods, Boardwalk Empire, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. His daughter Jan, an author, editor and psychic counselor whose interests and activities ranged from homeopathic medicine to shamanism, the occult and Native American lore, died in 1997 at age 52, of cancer. Katinka De Vries died in 1991. Peter De Vries died at age 83 on September 28, 1993 in a Norwalk, Connecticut hospital. He, his wife, and daughter are buried in Willowbrook Cemetery, Westport, Conn. Honors De Vries received an honorary degree in 1979 from Susquehanna University. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in May 1983. Works *But Who Wakes the Bugler?

Preschool programs, which are less formal and usually not mandated by law, are generally not considered part of primary education. The first year of primary education is commonly referred to as kindergarten and begins at or around age 5 or 6. Subsequent years are usually numbered being referred to as first grade, second grade, and so forth. Elementary schools normally continue through sixth grade, which the students normally complete when they are age 11 or 12. Some elementary schools graduate after the 4th or 5th grade and transition students into a middle school. In 2016, there were 88,665 elementary schools (66,758 public and 21,907 private) in the United States. Preschool Some private schools, and some public schools, are offering pre-kindergarten (also known as pre-K) as part of elementary school. The first three to five years of an individual‚Äôs life can be the most critical period of their education (nursery school). During this time period young minds work on several physical, intellectual, and emotional developments, including curiosity, formation of character, personality, cognition, language skills, and social skills.Bennett, William J.,Chester E. Finn, Jr., and John T. E. Crib, Jr., The Educated Child: A Parent‚Äôs Guide from Preschool Through Eighth Grade. New York: The Free Press, 1999 Since 1965, the federal government has promoted the growth of state-funded programs such as Head Start, a program under the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In 2007, it served over 22 million preschool-aged children and their families. Head Start works to educate the whole child in addition to providing health and nutrition services to low-income families. Elementary school (Kindergarten through grade 1/2/3/4/5) Students may attend either a 5-year, 6-year or 7-year public or private elementary school. Elementary school usually runs from kindergarten or 1st grade through either 5th or 6th, depending on the region. Upon successful completion of their elementary education students then proceed to middle school, also known as junior high school. Depending on the school district, some students attend separate middle schools, beginning at 6th grade and then completing at 8th grade before they transition to high school. Additionally, students may have the option of attending elementary schools that include all eight primary grades. In this case, the student will directly proceed to High School. In most U.S. elementary schools, students have all their core classes from one or two homeroom teachers (as opposed to middle and high schools that typically have students rotate from one specialized teacher to the next throughout the day). In some elementary schools, when funding and supplies are adequate, additional teachers are hired to instruct students in areas such as art and music.

He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal in 100 metres dash. In the same year he also won the first ever edition of the Hungarian Athletics Championships in 100 yards dash. Early life Szokolyi was born on 9 June 1871 in R√≥nicz, Kingdom of Hungary (now Hronec, Slovakia) as the first child J√≥zsef Szokoly, an engineer and Em√≠lia Holub. At the age of 3, he was adopted by his childless godparents, Alajos Sch≈ënn, a veteran of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and Am√°lia Szokoly, sister of Alajos' father. Szokolyi went to grammar school in Ipolys√°g (≈†ahy) , subsequently he absolved the high school in Selmecb√°nya (Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica) and L√©va (Levice). He excelled with his talent already in high school, having been nominated the \\"best gymnast of the school\\" while in fourth grade. He was also regularly awarded in the school-year ending gymnastic competitions. In 1887 Szokolyi with his family moved from Ipolys√°g to their new mansion in Bernece, lying just on the opposite side of the river Ipoly. Two years later he was enrolled at the medical faculty in Budapest. Career =Entering athletics and setback= In Budapest Szokolyi immediately joined the Magyar Athletikai Club (MAC). Founded in 1875, MAC was the first athletics club in continental Europe and played a pioneer role in developing sports in Hungary. Competing in the junior category ‚Äì athletes who did not participate in public competitions before were regarded as juniors ‚Äì, Szokolyi won his first race in the 100 metres dash at the 1890 autumn championships of MAC. (That time MAC organized a spring and a autumn championships every year.) Szokolyi participated in the seniors' race as well, finishing third in the 100 yards. At the spring championships in the following year Szokolyi came second behind Samu Sajtos in 100 yards, however, at the 1891 autumn championships he won the 100 yards event confidently with a new Hungarian record and also triumphed in the quarter miles race. After the initial successes his career suffered a minor setback as he joined the 3rd Imperial Tyrolian Rifle Regiment (Tiroler Kaiserj√§ger) and remained without training and competition opportunities for nearly two years. Szokolyi competed again in October 1893, but the long absence had obvious impact on his results ‚Äî in the 100 yards and the high jump he remained without any success, while in the 120 yards hurdles he came second behind Menotti R√©thy. The next two years passed without significant improvements, subsequently MAC contracted John Cash, an English coach. The combination of Cash's training methods and Szokolyi's tenacious work paid off in early 1896, when at the Olympic test race Szokoly won the 110 metres hurdles race, thus secured a place in the Hungarian Olympic Team. =1896 Summer Olympics= Before leaving to Athens, Szokolyi accidentally slit his sole. As it is known from N√°ndor D√°ni's travel diary, he suffered much from the injury, still, he became the joker of the team. The Hungarians gained a lot of popularity in Athens ‚Äî they were the first foreigners to arrive, and their little but friendly team, that on the proposal Szokolyi wore hats with blue and white ribbons, the colors of the Greeks, quickly became favorites among the Athenians. Szokolyi first competed in the 100 metres dash. He came in second in the heats, with a time of 12.75, and advanced to the final. There, Szokolyi was one of four athletes to come in at 12.6 seconds. The officials ruled that he and Francis Lane of the United States, who had beat Szokolyi in the heats, had finished in a dead heat for third place; Alexandros Khalkokondilis of Greece was ruled to have been slightly behind them. Szokolyi and Lane are currently considered to split the bronze medal for the event (no medals were awarded at the 1896 Olympics) by the International Olympic Committee. Szokolyi placed fourth in the triple jump, with a best effort of 11.26 metres. Szokolyi was expected to achieve his best result in the 110 metres hurdles since many considered it as his strongest event, however, under controversial circumstances, he was not allowed to run in the final. According to the official announcement and the morning newspaper Akropolis, four qualifying heats were to be held with the respective winners progressing to the final. However, due to the absence of some contestants the athletes were combined to form two heats only. Szokoly, racing in the first heat, was in lead until hitting the final hurdle and stumbling, allowing Grantley Goulding to pass him and win the race. Szokolyi eventually came second and together with the top two of the other heat was supposed to run the final. Prior to the final, Szokolyi and Hoyt, the second placed of the other heat were pulled out, referring not to the rules of the International Olympic Committee but those of the Amateur Athletic Association, causing some controversy and bitterness in the Hungarian team. The event was won by American Thomas Curtis, who finished just inches ahead Goulding. =Later career and retirement= After the Olympic Games, at the annual spring championships Szokolyi competed in so- called handicap races, not being able to catch his opponents. He peaked and achieved his best results in the autumn championships, winning in 100 yard dash, 110 yard hurdles, triple jump and the relay event as well. The Hungarian Athletics Association, created in 1897, declared two races of the 1896 championships ‚Äì the 100 yard and the 1 mile event ‚Äì as official competitions, making Szokolyi and Franti≈°ek Horn the first Hungarian Athletics Championships winners, respectively. The year 1896 not only marked the first modern Olympic Games, but also the millennium of the Hungarian landtaking. On this occasion many prestigious sports competitions, shows and exhibitions were organized; Szokolyi, a celebrated sportsman of his time, was depicted on the promotional materials. Additionally, he participated in the organization of the events as the secretary of the National Gymnastic and Sports Committee (Orsz√°gos Torna √©s Sportbizotts√°g). From 1896 onwards, Szokolyi concentrated less on competing and more on organizing and supervising sports events, and he eventually retired in 1900. Szokolyi raced over ten years; during this period he took part in 71 events in 29 competitions. He won 26 times, finished runner-up 16 times and came third 6 times. Additionally, he improved the Hungarian national record thirteen times in various events. Later life and death Memorial plaque on the Szokolyi mansion Following his retirement, Szokolyi moved back to his estate in Bernece and married to Charlotte Berchtold on 27 November 1900. By this marriage Szokolyi became related to the country's most distinguished families ‚Äì the Berchtolds, the K√°rolyis and the B√°nffys. The couple had 5 children. Alajos was ordained priest, J√≥zsef took the military path and served by the hussars while Ferenc became an agronomist and also followed his father example in sports and achieved several notable results. Their daughters were Erzs√©bet and M√°ria. Erzs√©bet married to Count Istv√°n R√©vay, founder-president of the Association of Physical Education of Hungarians in Czechoslovakia. In 1906 Szokolyi founded the Sports Association of Hont County (Hont v√°rmegyei Sport Egyes√ºlet), of which presidential position held until his resignation in 1912. In 1907 he was appointed as chief archivist of Hont County. In the 1910s he changed the spelling of his name to Szokolyi. During the World War I he organized the medical service of the county as the chief physician of the military hospital in Ipolys√°g. After the war Ipolys√°g fell under Czechoslovak administration, subsequently Szokolyi retired to the family mansion in Bernece. In 1928 he was diagnosed with atherosclerosis. He died of a heart attack in 1932.

At the time of the 1896 Summer Olympics Lane was in his junior year at Princeton University and was one of the four from the University that made up the American team of 14 competitors, the 16 day journey to Athens didn't help Lane, and he arrived in the poorest condition after suffering from sea sickness. Lane competed in the 100 metres, and when he won his heat in 12.2 seconds, he became the first American to compete at the Olympic Games and the first ever person to win a 100 metre race. In the final, he ran 12.6 seconds and tied for the third place with Alajos Szokolyi of Hungary, and both are considered as bronze medalists. At those games the champion was honored with a silver medal, an olive branch and a diploma, and the second athlete with a bronze medal, laurel branch and a diploma. Nothing was given to the third-best man. Lane's cousin Albert Tyler was also part of the 1896 United States Olympic team and won a silver medal in the pole vault. Lane was a member of the Franklin (Ohio) High School Class of 1891. In 1897 Lane graduated from Princeton University and went to the medical school at Washington University in St. Louis. He later became the head of ophthalmology departments at Rush Medical College and the Presbyterian and Illinois Central Hospitals in Chicago. Lane is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Rockford, IL.

On 3 September 2019, Chill was rebranded as Smooth Chill to extend the Smooth Radio brand. It is owned and operated by Global Originally, the station broadcast solely online and in Greater London as well as on Radioplayer and Global's own Global Player, but was made available nationally on Digital One on 9 April 2020. The station Originally, the station broadcast on DAB multiplexes across the UK and also through internet streaming services. The station's aim was to help listeners relax and put stress behind themselves. It broadcast 24 hours a day and until September 2019 featured no news bulletins or commercials with only some sponsored programming. Chill originally had no presenters, interspersing tracks with pre-recorded links featuring messages voiced by Davinia Palmer that reinforced the laidback atmosphere of the station. One of these memorably described the station as \\"T'ai chi for your ears\\". The station encourages interaction with its listeners, who suggest new songs and artists for the playlist, as well as relaxation techniques, via the Chill website and social media. Global announced on 2 September 2019 that Chill would be replaced with a new station, Smooth Chill. History The station was launched in early 2005 although it's argued Chill went live as early as December 2004, as a means of filling empty slots on DAB multiplexes owned by GWR prior to its merger with Capital Radio. Group Corporate Development Director Gregory Watson and Programme Director Bern Leckie devised a format for a relaxing, ambient station, aimed at 18- to 35-year-olds. On the station website, the founders claim, \\"We used to make compilation tapes for ourselves and friends to chill out to. That's where the idea for our station came from, and we make it the same way we made the tapes - listening to lots of music, swapping ideas, seeing what happens.\\" In June 2006, Chill bid for its first analogue licence, for Bristol, citing the city's record in producing trip-hop artists such as Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky in support of its application. However, in September 2006, Ofcom awarded the licence to Canwest and its Original 106 format. It is not currently known if Global Radio will bid for any more analogue licences with the Chill format. In August 2006, the station launched its first regular programmes on weekday evenings, \\"The Garden of Delights\\", presented by Pete Lawrence and \\"The Deep End\\", presented by Paul Noble, two of the organisers of The Big Chill festival. It also introduced a nightly programme made up of listener requests, and inherited the Chiller Cabinet sequence from its sister station Classic FM, which plays \\"ambient soundscapes, movie soundtracks and classically inspired chillout music\\". Late in 2006, Chill upgraded from a 32 kbit/s internet stream to a 128 kbit/s stream, offering internet listeners the same quality as the cable and satellite viewers. The station stopped being broadcast on Sky and Virgin Media on 3 July 2007, with other GCap stations Capital Disney, Core and Classic Gold Digital Network. It is speculated that this is connected with cost-cutting measures under previous owners GCap. In November 2008, Chill reappeared on Sky and Virgin Media, following the closure of jazz radio station TheJazz, using its old channel numbers on Sky and Virgin Media. In March 2009, Chill ceased to broadcast in Leicester, Nottingham and west Wiltshire due to competition regulator compliance following the takeover of GCapMedia by Global Radio. In July 2009, Global Radio announced that Chill would lose many of its DAB slots on numerous local DAB ensembles across the UK to allow for an expansion of the Galaxy network, but would still broadcast in London, some parts of the West Midlands and central Scotland. A spokesman indicated that this move was also financially led. It was announced on 28 August 2009 that Chill Radio would be replaced in Edinburgh and Glasgow by LBC Radio. On 20 October 2009, it was announced by Bern Leckie that Chill Radio has moved from stereo to mono output on DAB Radio in the London area. However the range in which Chill can be heard has slightly extended to an extra 20 miles or so from London. Rajar figures for the third quarter of 2009 showed an increase of weekly listeners by 9,000, bringing total listenership to 209,000. In March 2012 it attracted 229,000 listeners per week. On 15 July 2010, Chill ceased broadcasting on Virgin Media channel 961. On 8 June 2012, Chill ceased broadcasting on the Birmingham multiplex, leaving London as the only area where the station broadcasts on DAB Digital Radio. On 24 August 2012, Chill ceased broadcasting on Sky channel 0177. In September 2014, TuneIn Radio announced that Chill Radio had received the 100k 'follower' mark, one of the most listened-to UK and worldwide stations, via its various apps and websites. In September 2015, Global Radio confirmed that Chill would return to DAB in Nottingham and Leicester, replacing XFM. This is because XFM would be re-branding, and launching nationally on Digital One. Since its return to DAB in Nottingham and Leicester, Chill can also be heard on DAB in Derby. Global announced on 2 September 2019 the station would be replaced with a new station, Smooth Chill. The station re-launched nationally on 8 April 2020 on Digital One broadcasting in 32kbps DAB+. Music The Chill playlist was largely drawn from the mainstream end of chill out and ambient music, mixed with downtempo rock, vocal jazz and lounge tracks, film scores and the occasional classical piece.

Blanca married Sancho III of Castile, regent of Castile (subject to his father Alfonso VII) on February 4, 1151 in Carri√≥n de los Condes, Palencia, after travelling from Calahorra, Logro√±o, in January. The marriage was arranged to insure closer ties between Le√≥n-Castile and Navarre.Reilly, Bernard F. (1998), The Kingdom of Le√≥n-Castilla under King Alfonso VIII (1126-1157), Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 112. As was traditional, Blanca confirmed documents with her husband, so her activity may be traced until 1155. On November 11, 1155 she gave birth to the future king Alfonso VIII. There appears to be no record of her activities after December 1155, and she died on August 12, 1156. The cause of her death seems to have been complications of a new pregnancy, a child named Garc√≠a. In addition, she had other children buried in the church of San Pedro in Soria, although they are not identified. That her death was caused by a pregnancy is recorded in an epitaph engraved on her tomb, however, the engraving did not survive a sixteenth-century reconstruction of the royal tombs in N√°jera. Her sarcophagus lid was preserved, and it represents the queen's deathbed with members of the court, including her husband, mourning her passing. Blanca was buried in the pantheon of the Navarrese kings in the monastery called Santa Mar√≠a la Real of N√°jera, to which Sancho made donations on her behalf. The sarcophagus of the queen is regarded as a primary example of the ability to express human emotions in visual images in the 12th century. Blanca and Sancho had sons: *Alfonso VIII of Castile *Infante Garc√≠a, who died at birth in 1156, apparently also resulting in the death of Blanca.

Some cities have all their events during the celebration outside, but some cities have events that are hosted indoors by organizations in the city, such as churches and theaters. Since it happens on New Year's Eve, First Night celebrations are actually held on the last night of the old year. First Night celebrates a community's local culture, often featuring music, dance, comedy, art, fireworks and, in some cities, ice sculptures and parades.  Boston  The first First Night was in Boston on December 31, 1975. It was conceived by Clara Wainwright who organized a small group of artists seeking an alternative way of celebrating New Year's Eve, where Boston‚Äôs young, innovative artists and musicians could perform on both indoor and outdoor stages. They also wanted to avoid the emphasis on alcohol that is common at New Year's Eve parties. Soon other surrounding communities started their own First Night celebrations. By the 1990s, the First Night Boston event was attracting works by over a thousand artists.Nordheimer, Jon (1990-12-26). A New Year's Fete Of Art, Not Alcohol. The New York Times. Retrieved on 2009-04-06. In 2006, more than a million visitors attended First Night events, including free outdoor ice sculptures on Boston Common and in Copley Square, and waterfront fireworks.Ford, Rosemary (2006-12-28). Carving out First Night Boston; Local ice sculptor lends frozen art to annual celebration . The Eagle Tribune. Retrieved on 2009-04-06. Until 2015, live coverage of the final part of Boston's First Night, including the countdown to midnight and fireworks over Boston Harbor that begin at the stroke of midnight, was broadcast by WBZ-TV. CBS, the station's parent company, was an official sponsor. In 2013, the non-profit First Night Boston organization closed for financial reasons, though Mayor Menino of Boston (in office for only another year) pledged to find private or public funding the January 2014 celebration. On November 11, 2013, Mayor Menino announced he had acquired the necessary funding and that the 2013 First Night would be ‚Äúa bigger, brighter display than ever before.‚Äù The city of Boston took over the First Night festivities in 2015 and hired an event planning firm to manage the smaller and scaled back event. In 2016, television coverage of the festivities was transferred to NBCUniversal-owned properties including NECN, Telemundo owned station WNEU and newly acquired NBC owned station WBTS-LD; the latter used the event to help launch the station's NBC affiliation, which took effect on January 1, 2017.  Other cities  By 1999, First Night celebrations were being held in more than 200 cities. In 2000, more than 260 cities had such a celebration. However, in 2001, 20 cities dropped out of the First Night celebrations due to the effects of the September 11 attacks and/or money difficulties. During the Great Recession, which began in late 2007, many First Night celebrations faced financial difficulty, being scaled back or canceled. There are about 45 cities with First Night celebrations happening on New Year's Eve 2013/2014. This Google map contains known First Night celebrations in the United States as of the last edit date on the map.  National organization  First Night USA is the national offshoot of the original Boston organization. It works with the numerous First Night licensed events throughout the United States. Other celebrations on New Year's Eve, not labeled \\"First Night\\", have also sprung up. For example, in 2003, First Night Providence announced they planned to cancel future celebrations, which had been going on for 19 years. A group of local artists created Bright Night Providence, an artist-run New Year's Eve celebration based on the idea and spirit of First Night.

The 840-foot ship is the largest that can be accommodated in NASSCO's drydock. National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, commonly referred to as NASSCO, is an American shipbuilding company with three shipyards located in San Diego, Norfolk, and Mayport. It is a division of General Dynamics. The San Diego shipyard specializes in constructing commercial cargo ships and auxiliary vessels for the US Navy and Military Sealift Command; it is the only new- construction shipyard on the West Coast of the United States. The Virginia shipyard primarily performs ship repairs and conversions for the U.S. Navy.  History  The origin of NASSCO traces to 1905 and a small machine shop and foundry known as California Iron Works. \\"San Diego-based NASSCO's history to date\\" 29 Nov 2005 In 1922 California Iron Works was taken over by U.S. National Bank and renamed National Iron Works. In 1944 National Iron Works moved to its present location at 28th Street and Harbor Drive on San Diego Bay, and in 1949 the company was renamed National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. to reflect its expansion into ship construction. In 1959 the company was acquired by four corporations, including Henry J. Kaiser Company and Morrison Knudsen. In 1979 Morrison Knudsen bought out Kaiser's share, and in 1989 management acquired the company from Morrison Knudsen via an employee stock ownership plan. In 1940 the company's ironworkers organized into a union. By 1979 the company had 7,900 employees organized into six unions. There was a labor strike in 1988 in which employees demanded a minimal wage of $12 per hour. Another 25-day-long strike in 1992 resulted in workers returning to work without a contract. In 1996, another labor strike hit the company. Around 2,700 employees didn't show up at work while 50 marched in front of the company with picket signs. In 1998 General Dynamics bought NASSCO in a $415 million deal. On October 31, 2011 General Dynamics-NASSCO acquired Metro Machine Corp, a surface-ship repair company in Norfolk, Virginia, and renamed it NASSCO-Norfolk. The company had been conducting ship repairs and conversions for the U.S. Navy since 1972. The NASSCO-Norfolk shipyard had the newest dry dock in the country, with two auto-start generators, automated ballast control system and automated ship hauling and centering system. Work done USS Vandegrift (FFG-48) and USS Curts (FFG-38) conduct a double dry- docking at NASSCO NASSCO began building commercial cargo ships in 1959, eventually including large cargo ships and Alaska class oil tankers. Its most famous commercial ship was the Exxon Valdez tanker, which completed construction at NASSCO in 1986, and in 1989 returned to NASSCO for repairs after its accident and oil spill in Alaska. \\"Nassco Gets Contract to Fix Valdez's Hull\\", 13 Jun 1989 In December 2012 the company signed a contract to build two container ships powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). When completed they will be the largest LNG-powered ships of any kind in the world. Beginning in the 1990s the company won Navy contracts to build AOE-10 support ships, strategic sealift ships, and TOTE Orca-class trailerships. Additional Navy contracts awarded during the 2000s included maintenance of the San Diego- based USS Ticonderoga (CG-47) and USS Spruance (DD-963) warships. In 2001 the Navy awarded NASSCO its largest order in company history, to build the Lewis and Clark class dry cargo ship (T-AKE), a 14-ship program with a contract value of $3.7 billion. The company has a contract to build at least three Mobile Landing Platform ships, a new class of ship for the U.S. Navy. Construction on the first vessel began in July 2011 and the keel was laid for the second in December 2012. In 2016, Matson, Inc ordered two Kanaloa-class freighters, to be delivered near the end of the decade.

Olympic record He had the distinction of being the first British athlete to compete in Olympic competition when he finished third in the inaugural heat of the 100 metres. He did not advance to the final. As per the record he was the first man to win a medal for Great Britain at a modern Olympics. He was more successful in the 400 metres where he finished second behind Thomas Burke of the United States in his preliminary heat. This qualified him for the final, where he placed third behind the United States pairing of Burke and Herbert Jamison in a time of 55.6 seconds. For many years the German runner Fritz Hofmann was incorrectly listed as placing ahead of Gmelin. Although no awards were made for third place in the 1896 Summer Olympics he is usually credited as a bronze medal winner.

Biography Traun was born the son of a wealthy family from Hamburg in 1876. His father, Heinrich Traun (1838‚Äì1909), owned a natural rubber manufacturing company and later became senator at Hamburg from 1901 to 1908. In 1885, Fritz began studying chemistry at Dresden University of Technology. In autumn of the same year, he participated in a track and field competition between athletes from Berlin and Hamburg and won the race over a distance of half a mile. In 1896 Traun competed at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens. Traun placed third in his preliminary heat of the 800 metres and did not advance to the final. He also participated in the tennis tournament. In the singles competition, Traun was defeated in the first round by John Pius Boland of Great Britain and Ireland, the eventual gold medallist. This put Traun in a six-way tie for eighth place in the field of thirteen men. For the doubles tournament, Traun and Boland partnered. They defeated the Greek brothers Aristidis and Konstantinos Akratopoulos in the first round and had a bye for the semifinals. In the final, the pair defeated Dionysios Kasdaglis of Egypt and Demetrios Petrokokkinos of Greece to give Traun his own gold medal. In 1897, Traun took part in a track-and-field competition at Baden-Baden and was the first German to reach a length of over 6 meters in long jump. Traun at the 1896 Olympic Games at Athens In 1899, Traun finished his studies with the degree of a Doctor of Science. His thesis received the best possible mark, summa cum laude. After working as a scientist at the Sorbonne at Paris for two years, he decided to enter his father's company. In 1902, Traun made a business trip to the United States in order to visit the company's branch on Long Island. The following winter, he fell ill of tuberculosis. Upon recommendation of Carl Schurz, Traun spent the spring of 1903 in a hotel at Augusta, Georgia, before returning to Germany. As he did not fully recover from his illness, he mostly spent the following years at health spas in the Alps such as St. Moritz and Davos. In addition, he began to work as a sports journalist and tournament organizer. In 1906, he was the director of the German Tennis Championships at Hamburg, and its referee in 1907. In the same year, he met Friedel Preetorius (1884‚Äì1938), the daughter of the wealthy entrepreneur Wilhelm Preetorius from Mainz, during the Kiel Week. The following March, both married at Hamburg, and in their honeymoon they drove as far as Algiers in Friedrich's car. After their return, the couple lived at the exclusive Park H√¥tel Teufelsbr√ºcke at Hamburg. On the morning of 11 July 1908, a young lady entered the hotel and claimed that she was also married to Traun and would even have children with him. After meeting with Traun, he shot himself in the bathroom of his apartment. Neither the lady's identity nor the validity of her claim is known today. However, it seems very likely that she told the truth and Traun, facing a major social scandal at that time, was left with no other choice but to kill himself. Friedrich's father Heinrich Traun adopted Friedel Preetorius who was already pregnant and gave birth to her daughter Lieselotte in February 1909. She later married Ludwig Strecker, owner of B. Schott's S√∂hne (today Schott Music), Friedrich Traun was buried in the family's grave at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery.

The series takes place in the distant future, where human beings live among space colonies and a single, inhabitable planet called Zion. The plot follows Zero Enna and his fellow candidates as they try to prove themselves worthy of piloting the \\"Ingrids\\", also called \\"Goddesses\\". These gigantic, humanoid weapons are humanity's only significant defense against a hostile, alien threat known as \\"Victim\\". The Candidate for Goddess was serialized in the monthly Wani Books magazine Comic Gum. A total of 26 chapters were collected in five tank≈çbon (volumes) and released between 1997 and 2001. The manga was later translated into English and published in North America by Tokyopop and in Australian and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The Candidate for Goddess was adapted into a 12-episode anime series directed by Mitsuru Hongo and produced by Xebec, which was a subsidiary of Production I.G. The adaptation aired on Japan's NHK BS2 satellite channel in early 2000. The anime series, entitled Pilot Candidate for its North American release, was broadcast briefly on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block in 2002. An original video animation (OVA), serving as a thirteenth episode, was released in Japan in 2002, though it was not localized for North America. Since the debut of The Candidate for Goddess on Japanese television, a limited number of CDs and artbook illustrations for the series have been released. Overall reception for The Candidate for Goddess has been mediocre. Though its animation has been generally praised, its complex plot, compounded by its very short length, has been met with mixed criticism. Reviewers were dismayed by the lack of storyline closure at the end of the television episodes and even its OVA extension. Plot The Candidate for Goddess series takes place a millennium after Star Year 4084, when a cataclysmic event called the \\"Crisis of Systems\\" resulted in the annihilation of four planetary systems. With Zion being the one planet left with the ability to sustain human life, humanity must cling to life in space colonies. Now in Star Year 5030, Zion is under constant threat of invasion by extraterrestrial life forms dubbed . In order to combat their alien foes, humans have developed a quintet of giant, mechanized weapons called \\"Ingrids\\", or \\"Goddesses\\" due to their female, humanoid resemblance. A school called the \\"Goddess Operation Academy (G.O.A.)\\" is established to train the specific few which have the capability of piloting the Ingrids. They are typically young men and must meet several requirements: They must be in good health, must be 14 to 16 years of age, must have an EO blood type, and must possess the potential for \\"EX\\", superhuman abilities which secondarily link the pilot's nerves to the Ingrid's interface. As EX puts such a physical and mental strain on the pilot, replacements must be turned out by the G.O.A. within a reasonable amount of time. Each pilot is also partnered with a female repairer, who maintains the Ingrid and manually blocks painful feedback from the Ingrid to the pilot during missions. The plot of The Candidate for Goddess primarily focuses on Zero Enna, a brash trainee who has recently left colony homelife with his mother in order to pursue his dream of becoming an Ingrid pilot. Shortly after arriving at the G.O.A., Zero becomes lost and is subconsciously called to a hangar by a mysterious voice, suddenly finding himself within the cockpit of one of the Ingrids just before a Victim attack. As each Ingrid is specifically calibrated for their pilot, this would normally mean death. However, the Goddess instead links with Zero's nervous system and physically shows itself to him in a vision. After a few moments, the Ingrid ends the link with Zero, and he is pulled free by the Ingrid's pilot, who then takes it into battle with the Victim. Zero is rushed unconscious to the academy's sick bay. Production The original manga version of The Candidate for Goddess was written and illustrated by Yukiru Sugisaki. An anime television adaptation of The Candidate for Goddess was produced by Xebec, a subsidiary studio of Production I.G., and directed by Mitsuru Hongo. Shinichi Yamaoka was the show's character designer, having also worked on Martian Successor Nadesico. Shingo Takeba and Junya Ishigaki acted as its main mecha designers, respectively credited for the anime series Gasaraki and the video game Xenogears. The musical score for The Candidate for Goddess was created by Tomoyuki Asakawa, who previously composed for the television series The New Adventures of Kimba The White Lion and the film The Five Star Stories. Hongo attempted to adapt the manga closely while integrating interesting story elements and 3D CGI animation, used in the battles between the Ingrids and Victim alongside the traditional cel animation. Hongo felt the possibilities with the CGI were limitless; 3D director Tokumitsu Kifune did not think these portions of the show would not have been possible with 2D animation. The manga series was still ongoing at the time of the anime's creation. With only 12 television episodes produced, Xebec ended the series abruptly without giving the storyline closure. Although a thirteenth episode in the form of an OVA continues where the television series left off, it still fails to conclude the narrative. Hongo has expressed regret over the short length of the series. Media =Manga= The Candidate for Goddess was originally serialized in Comic Gum, a monthly Japanese manga magazine published by Wani Books. The 26 chapters that comprise the series were compiled into five tank≈çbon (volumes) and released between August 1997 and November 2001. All five volumes of the series were re-published in 2005 as part of the \\"Gum Comics Plus\\" imprint. Tokyopop acquired the series in early 2003 for an English distribution in North America. All five volumes were published between April 14 and December 7, 2004. The series was translated by Alethea and Athena Nibley and adapted by comic book writer Marv Wolfman. The series has also been published in South Korea by Samyang Publishing, in France by Ki-oon, in Germany by Carlsen Comics and in Spain by Editorial Ivr√©a. =Anime and OVA= Twelve episodes of The Candidate for Goddess, beginning with \\"Curriculum 00\\" and ending with \\"Curriculum 11\\", were aired on Japan's NHK BS2 satellite channel from January 10 to March 27, 2000. Bandai released the series on four DVD volumes from April 25 to July 25, 2000. The thirteenth episode was released straight to DVD as an OVA in Japan on May 25, 2002 as Special Curriculum: The Candidate for Goddess. A DVD box set titled Emotion the Best: The Candidate for Goddess was released by Bandai Visual in Japan on April 22, 2011 and includes all 12 episodes of the broadcast plus the OVA. By early 2001, Bandai Entertainment acquired the North American distribution rights to The Candidate for Goddess with plans to air the series on Cartoon Network. An English dubtitle was completed by Mix Magic, Inc. in Hollywood, CA. According to Bandai's Jerry Chu, the series was renamed Pilot Candidate because the company wanted to veer away from the term \\"goddess\\" for Cartoon Network's sake and because they believed the new title was more descriptive of the series. The channel had originally intended to air the series on its popular afternoon anime block Toonami that fall, and had considered including a reversible cover or an alternate angle intro animation with the original title if fans requested it. However, the anime was delayed and ultimately premiered on its late night Saturday Adult Swim block on February 23, 2002. Despite being broadcast on the more mature list of programming, Pilot Candidate was censored, including the removal of nudity, violence, tobacco use, and religious references. This was likely due in part that it was originally intended for Toonami and the episodes were already completed with the intention of the demographic being children. Four DVDs containing the series were released in North American stores between November 1, 2001 and May 21, 2002. All twelve episodes of the series were released on the Pilot Candidate Complete Collection box set on October 11, 2005. On March 8, 2016, Discotek Media had announced their license to the series and the unreleased OVA to be released on June 28, 2016. =CDs= A 29-song soundtrack CD of the background and vocal music for The Candidate for Goddess was released by Victor Entertainment in Japan on March 23, 2000. A CD Single for \\"Chance\\" was also published on February 2, 2000. , a CD single by the artist Universe Form, was released by Victor on January 21, 2000, shortly after the anime's debut. This CD also contains a preliminary drama track titled . The Candidate for Goddess Original Drama Album, released on July 26, 2000, features the Japanese voice actors portraying their respective characters in a drama. =Other merchandise= In April 2000, Wani Books published a Japanese paperback guidebook to the anime series titled , which contains promotional material, artwork cels, and staff interviews. In February 2002, Wani Books published , a collector's set containing an artbook, an illustrations CD-ROM, and other collectables. Sugisaki's artbook, Neutral, showcases her illustrations for The Candidate for Goddess as well from her other manga works Brain Powerd and D.N.Angel. Bandai produced a single action figure set of Pilot Candidate as part of a toy line for its licensed properties. The set contains the characters Zero and Kizna and the Ingrid Ernn-Laties. Reception Overall critical reception for The Candidate for Goddess has been average. Its primary high point for many reviewers has been the anime version's animation quality. Protoculture Addicts staff contributor Miyako Matsuda enjoyed both the traditional cel animation and the 3D CGI, stating that the two styles blended nicely together. Jeremy A. Beard of THEM Anime Reviews and Anime News Network (ANN) reviewer Daniel DeLorme were equally pleased by the character designs and hand-drawn portions of the show. However, Delorme felt the \\"primitive\\" look of the 3D mecha battles to be the biggest flaw of the series. Beard, who appreciated the Ingrid designs themselves, did not think the CGI conformed with the rest of the animation and that the space combat sequences were not \\"particularly fluid\\". Beard further enjoyed the background music and ending theme of the anime, but that its opening theme did not fit with the visuals or feeling of the series. Opinions for the plot of The Candidate for Goddess have varied. DeLorme and Animerica columnist Benjamin Wright commented favorably on the show's pacing. Both writers proclaimed that although the anime initially seemed \\"formaliac\\", it contained a generous amount of intricate mystery and character development. Wright summarized, \\"Zero's trials and tribulations, his friendships and rivalries, and the mysteries of the G.O.A., the Ingrids, EX, and Zero's own past all worm their way into the viewer's mind and heart.\\" Adversely, Beard did not feel the anime adaptation well-utilized the anime storyline template of mysterious aliens, an academic setting, a last line of defense, and other related devices. Liann Cooper of ANN similarly found the manga version of The Candidate for Goddess to suffer from \\"a bad case of the 'been there done that' syndrome\\" with regard to its plot and characters. Cooper additionally noted sloppy artwork, messy action scenes, and confusion when the narrative switches between the past and present. Beard admitted some \\"irritation regarding unnecessary internal plot inconsistencies\\", such as the characters constantly voicing the importance of having only male pilots despite the most elite pilot being female, or having no explanation for Kizna being the only catgirl among all the humans. A common complaint by the press is that the anime adaptation of The Candidate for Goddess ends on a cliffhanger. Wright and DeLorme were anxious for more of the television series after the build-up of several intriguing and unresolved plot elements and a \\"to be continued\\" message at its conclusion. \\"Effective though Pilot Candidate is,\\" Wright stated, \\"there's little satisfaction to be had in the end.\\" Having criticized the incomplete storyline of the television episodes itself, Beard was heavily disappointed in the apparent continuation in the form of the single OVA episode, which he found did little to tie up the numerous, loose plot ends present at its close. The Candidate for Goddess has yet to recommence. AnimeNation journalist John Oppliger has attributed the deficient interest in continuing the anime, beyond its delayed OVA, to the mediocre ratings it received during its original Japanese broadcast.

Category:June in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"June 24 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"2087676","text":"Heaton Park is a municipal park in Manchester, England, covering an area of over . The park includes the grounds of a Grade I listed, neoclassical 18th century country house, Heaton Hall. The hall, remodelled by James Wyatt in 1772, is now only open to the public on an occasional basis as a museum and events venue. Heaton Park was sold to Manchester City Council in 1902 by the Earl of Wilton. It has one of the United Kingdom's few concrete towers, the Heaton Park BT Tower. The park was renovated as part of a millennium project partnership between the Heritage Lottery Fund and Manchester City Council at a cost of over ¬£10 million. It contains an 18-hole golf course, a boating lake, an animal farm, a pitch and putt course, a golf driving range, woodlands, ornamental gardens, an observatory, an adventure playground, a Papal monument and a volunteer-run tram system and museum, and is listed Grade II by Historic England. It has the only flat green bowling greens in Manchester, built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Toponymy The park takes its name from the local area of Great Heaton. Heaton is derived from Old English heah ‚Äòhigh‚Äô + tun ‚Äòenclosure‚Äô or ‚Äòsettlement‚Äô. History Manchester Old Town Hall, King Street Old Town Hall Colonnade Heaton Hall had been owned by the Holland family since the Middle Ages. In 1684, when Sir John Egerton, 3rd Baronet of Wilton, married Elizabeth Holland, the hall came to the Egerton family. In 1772, Sir Thomas Egerton, 7th Baronet (later the 1st Earl of Wilton), commissioned the fashionable architect James Wyatt to design a new home for his young family. Although Wyatt had already established a reputation for himself as an innovative architect, he was only 26 years old and Heaton Hall was his first country house commission. Wyatt's neo-classical masterpiece was built in phases and was mostly completed by 1789. The park was originally laid out by William Emes in the style of Capability Brown. It has long been used for public events such as Heaton Park races, which were established by the second Earl in 1827. The races were run on a course around the park which included the site of the present day boating lake until 1839 when they moved to Aintree near Liverpool, now the venue for the Grand National. During the 19th century when the railway to Bury was being laid, it stopped short of Heaton Park, as Lord Wilton was not prepared to see his estate disfigured by a railway. As a compromise the line was run under the estate in a tunnel and a railway station opened adjacent to the Whittaker Lane/Bury Old Road entrance in 1879 (now Heaton Park Metrolink station). Consequently, the decision by Lord Wilton to put the hall and park up for sale was greeted with dismay, especially when it became known that the site was being eyed by a property developer. A pressure group was formed to persuade Manchester City Council to purchase it as a museum and municipal park. Alderman Fletcher Moss, a prominent antiquarian was a notable influence in this movement. The park was purchased and opened to the public in 1902. Unfortunately, the council was not prepared to purchase the contents of the hall, so the furniture and paintings were sold by auction. The hall was considered by the council to be of little architectural or historical significance and the saloon was initially used as a tea-room. During the First World War, the park was used as a training camp for the Pals battalion of the Manchester Regiment, whilst Heaton Hall became a military hospital. In the Second World War, the park was a camp for the Royal Air Force, where 133,516 aircrew were trained. The park was home to a barrage balloon anchorage and an ackack emplacement. Two \\"prefab\\" housing estates and an infants school were built in the south of the park, the houses providing much-needed homes until they were demolished in the 1960s. The school building was used by Manchester City Council until 2012, when it was demolished. Heaton Hall Heaton Hall Statue of a lion at the south entrance The hall, has been a Grade I Listed Building since 1952 and has been called \\"the finest house of its period in Lancashire\\". It is built of sandstone and stuccoed brick, in a traditional Palladian design with the entrance on the north side and the facade on the south. The landscaping was designed to make the most of the uninterrupted views of the rolling hills across to the Pennines. A feature of this was the ha-ha, used to keep the grazing animals, so important to the landscaping, away from the formal lawns, with a barrier that was all-but invisible from the house. The state rooms include the Library, the Music Room, Dining Room and upstairs, a rather rare Etruscan Room. The rooms of the hall were exquisitely finished by the finest artists and craftsmen of the period, with most of the furnishings and mahogany doors being made by Gillow's of Lancashire. Most of the decorative paintings, the Pompeiian Cupola Room and the case for the 18th century chamber organ built by Samuel Green in 1790,Pevsner, N. (1969) Lancashire; 1. Penguin Books; pp. 328‚Äì30 were the work of Italian artist, Biagio Rebecca. The organ fills one wall of the Music Room. The ornate plasterwork was created by the firm of Joseph Rose II of York. There are 13 rooms occasionally open to the public in the central core and east wing. Manchester City Galleries restored the decorative detail in the 1980s and early 1990s. The ground floor rooms on the north east front have been converted to an expansive space that houses temporary exhibitions. The first floor rooms include the Cupola which was originally Lady Egerton's dressing-room. The room was styled in the 1770s \\"Pompeiian\\" style with mirrored walls and a domed ceiling ‚Äî there are only three such rooms left in Britain. The library was remodelled by Lewis Wyatt in the 1820s. Heaton Hall's collections are managed by Manchester Galleries. The hall is currently (February 2017) listed on Historic England's Heritage at Risk register. Landmarks and features =Temple= Temple Designed by James Wyatt in 1800 for the First Earl, the ornamental temple is a simple, small rotunda of Tuscan columns with a domed roof and lantern. This Grade II listed building stands on the highest point of the city of Manchester giving views across the golf course, which was originally the deer park. It has its own fireplace and is thought to have been used as an observatory by the Earl who is known to have owned a telescope bought from Dollond's of London. The cost of the telescope was ¬£18.5s.0d (¬£18.25) ‚Äì the same amount earned in a year by the Earl's under- butler. The temple has recently been enclosed by a stone balustrade and gravelled path and is used as a summer studio for artists, and for astronomy sessions. =Dower House= Dower House and ha-ha The Dower House was a plain brick building that was transformed with a decorative columned facade in 1803. The ha-ha in front of the house stopped the cattle from grazing on the formal lawns, making a barrier which cannot be seen from the house. In 2004 the house became the home of the Manchester and District Beekeepers Association and is furnished with an observation hive, equipment and displays with an apiary in the garden behind the house. =Smithy Lodge= Smithy Lodge This \\"pepperpot\\" building located at the east entrance to the park, now on Middleton Road, was designed by Lewis Wyatt for the 1st Earl of Wilton in 1806. It was built in an unusual octagonal shape as a cottage to be viewed from the house in a romantic, rural setting, as well as being a home for the lodge keeper. The name comes from a blacksmith's forge which was located nearby on Middleton Road. The lodge was fully restored with a grant from the Lottery Heritage fund in the late 1990s and is now rented out to the public as short stay accommodation. =Grand Lodge= Grand Lodge Commissioned in 1807 by Sir Thomas Egerton, the Grand Lodge was designed by Lewis Wyatt as an impressive main entrance to the park from the south. The lodge is built of ashlar sandstone as a large triumphal arch and originally led onto one of the longest carriage drives to the house. It has two floors of accommodation, cellars under the west wing and an attic over the arch. The construction of the lodge completed the enclosure of the park by a high boundary wall. It was refurbished as part of the millennium project and is now rented out to the public as short stay accommodation. There is a memorial plaque here dedicated to the memory of the Manchester Pals who trained in the park in 1914. =Western pleasure grounds= The tunnel These ornamental gardens were probably laid out in the early 19th century as a peaceful retreat for the family. The gardens have recently been returned to their original design with pools, summerhouses and plants appropriate to the period. A tunnel leads from the flowergarden to the dell and carries a causeway at high level across the gardens to allow the cattle, from the fields to the south of the garden, to be taken to the farm for milking without entering the gardens. The tunnel entrance is faced with large stones to give it the appearance of a natural cave. =Orangery= Orangery Orangery and gardens The orangery was added to the house by the 2nd Earl of Wilton around 1823. It was probably designed by Lewis Wyatt as it is similar to his orangeries at Tatton Park and Belton House. It was probably built for the wife of the 2nd Earl, Lady Mary Stanley, who was a keen botanist. It was designed with a domed, glazed roof, fronted by a formal garden with two large copies of the Borghese Vase. The ornate glass roof was removed, to be replaced with a flat roof after Manchester City Council purchased the park in 1902. The orangery is now a function and conference venue, run by Manchester City Council's Hospitality and Trading Service. =Boating lake= The boating lake The boating lake was constructed between 1908 and 1912 by previously unemployed men using only shovels and hand-pulled trucks. The lake, which is overlooked by the Lakeside Cafe, has three islands and is home to large numbers of ornamental birds and wildfowl including geese, ducks, swans and fantail doves. There are rowing boats for hire during the summer months. The lake is noted for its excellent carp fishing and is also stocked with roach, rudd, bream, tench and chub. Fishing rights to all the waters in the park are held by the King William IV Angling Society. =Colonnade= An interesting structure in the park is the Colonnade, which once formed the front of Manchester Town Hall in King Street. When that building was scheduled for demolition a successful campaign to save the facade resulted in the colonnade being re-assembled in the park at the end of the boating lake. =Walled Garden and Horticultural Centre= The 18th century Walled Garden was the Earl of Wilton's kitchen garden supplying fruit and vegetables for the estate. The walls provide a warm microclimate for crop cultivation and support for climbing plants. The Horticultural Centre staff now grow plants for the city's displays and for sale to the public. There are also demonstration gardens open to the public during the summer and a sensory garden. \\"The Friends of Heaton Park\\", a group formed in 1992 to promote an interest in the care of the park and to act as a communication link between the park users and the Heaton Park management team, are based at the centre. =Farm Centre, Stables Cafe and Animal Centre= Hazlitt Wood Pond The farm centre was originally built as a stable block for Sir Thomas Egerton. It was designed by Samuel Wyatt and built between 1777 and 1789. It now houses the Stables Cafe and is also the administrative centre for the park. The Animal Centre is housed behind the stables in the area that was Home Farm, on the site of the 19th century glasshouse range where exotic foods and flowers were grown for the family. The Animal Centre was built in 2003‚Äì04 to replace the old Pets' Corner and houses goats, cattle, pigs, donkeys, Hebridean sheep, alpacas and Kune Kune pigs plus small pets. =Hazlitt Wood Pond= Hazlitt Wood Pond, also known as the \\"Golly Pond\\", is located in Hazlitt Wood to the far north of the park. This area of the park can only be reached on foot and hence remains quiet and secluded. Former landmarks =The Runner= A bronze statue of an athlete, called The Runner, was installed in the park in 1960. It was created by John Longden, and modelled on himself. It was presented to the people of Manchester in 1959 by Longden's brother, Edward, who had previously served as the President of the Institute of British Foundrymen. Manchester City Council decided to place the statue in Heaton Park. It remained in the park until its theft in October 1968. Heaton Park Tramway Tram number 765 in Heaton Park Horse-drawn tram in Heaton Park Shortly after the Heaton Park was bought by Manchester Corporation the tramway was extended into the park and the first tram arrived on 31 May 1903, bringing visitors from Manchester. By 1934 buses were taking over from trams and the tramway was disconnected from the main system and covered in tarmac for use by buses. The initial idea, to construct a new tramway from Grand Lodge to Heaton Hall, was considered too expensive, as it would require remedial works to carry it across the railway tunnel. Therefore, a new scheme was proposed to open up the old Manchester Corporation Tramways spur from Middleton Road to the old tram shelter some 300 yards (270 m) inside the park. The work was completed in 1979 and the Heaton Park Tramway was officially opened on 28 March 1980. The tramway currently has an operating fleet of 3 electric trams and one horse tram. One of these, tramcar, No 765, was to be seen in the museum at Crich in Derbyshire,Bett, W. H. & Gillham, J. C. (1975?) The Tramways of South East Lancashire;p. 73 before moving to Heaton Park. Heaton Park Golf Course The municipal golf course is a championship standard golf course, built on the former deer park to the south of the hall with views across to the Pennines. Designed by five times Open Champion John Henry Taylor, it was opened to the public in 1912 and has been the venue for a number of professional and amateur events. The golf centre, which has its own private driving range used for teaching purposes, is located at the Smithy Lodge, entrance to Heaton Park. The 11th hole is played across water to a plateau green and was rated by Open Champion Henry Cotton as \\"the toughest par-3 in England\\". The course was voted the best municipal golf course in England in 2005. Events in the park On 31 May 1982 Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in the park for over 100,000 people and ordained 12 new priests. This event is commemorated by the papal monument in the south-west of the park. =Music= In 1909, the great Italian tenor, Enrico Caruso, performed at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. The concert was attended by William Grimshaw, a gramophone salesman from Prestwich and a few days later, he took his gramophone to Heaton Park and played recordings of the songs performed by Caruso to an assembled crowd of 40,000 people who, according to the Prestwich and Heaton Park Guardian, \\"remained as if spellbound from the moment of arrival to the close of the programme, which, it is hardly necessary to say, was intensely enjoyed.\\" Caruso later wrote to Mr. Grimshaw to thank him for the way his voice had been reproduced, sending him a signed cartoon of himself. Grimshaw was the first person in Britain to give gramophone concerts in the open, an idea which soon spread across the country. The concerts were carried on for several seasons and as they grew in popularity, Grimshaw became known across Lancashire as the \\"Gramophone King\\" Since the 1980s a number of open air pop concerts have been held in the park, headlined by popular bands of the day such as Travis and Supergrass. The park has been the venue for the BBC's \\"Proms in the Park\\" on a number of occasions. Manchester band, Oasis, performed to a total audience of 210,000 over three nights in June 2009. In June 2012, Manchester band The Stone Roses played three sold-out shows at Heaton Park as part of their Reunion Tour. It was announced in February 2013 that Manchester's annual Parklife Weekender music festival will be held at Heaton Park for the foreseeable future. Manchester band Courteeners played their biggest headline show to date at the park on 5 June 2015. On 1 July 2016, the park hosted a concert and exhibition as part of the National Commemoration of the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme, which was centred on Manchester. An act of Remembrance at the Cenotaph in St Peter's Square, Manchester was followed by the National Commemorative Service in Manchester Cathedral. People were invited to make a commemorative tile, with the results laid as a path through the park. An evening concert at Heaton Park featured a national children's choir, archive film, dance, spoken word and Manchester's Hall√© Orchestra. The Experience Field (where visitors could learn more about life on the home and western fronts in 1916) was located in and around Heaton Hall. On 27 November 2019, Liam Gallagher announced he would be playing a show in the park on 12 June 2020 The Manchester-born's show sold out within 3 hours after being put on sale at 9:00 am on 29 November 2019. =Theatre= In recent years the park has hosted some open-air theatre productions. From 1998 Feelgood Theatre Productions performed open-air promenade productions many of which received Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards and the Horniman Award for outstanding service to theatre. Productions include: Blue Remembered Hills (Potter), The Wizard of Oz, The Wind in the Willows, The Three Musketeers, Arthur - King of the Britons, Dracula - The Blood Count,' Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth. In 2016 Feelgood returned and performed the world premier of Whispers of Heaton (May and Nov) and Ghost Story of Heaton (October). Feelgood is now (2016) the official theatre partner for Heaton Park and hall and is planning a programme of theatre and music events. In 2005 there was a screening of Pulp Fiction with a film inspired set from the Fun Lovin' Criminals. =Sport= A 5 km run against the clock is organised by parkrun on Saturday mornings. There are often charity run events such as the 'Race for Life' and seasonal fairs are located near the Papal monument. There is a large bonfire and firework display held on 5 November (Guy Fawkes Night) each year. The Shakespeare's Globe Theatre performs open- air theatre annually with performances of Shakespeare's greatest works in 2008, 2009 and A Midsummer Night's Dream in June 2010.

It lies some 20 km east of Munich, Bavaria‚Äôs capital. Geography =Neighbouring communities= In the northwest, Zorneding borders on the community of Vaterstetten, in the northeast on the unincorporated area of the Ebersberg Forest (Ebersberger Forst), in the east on Kirchseeon, in the south on Oberpframmern and in the southwest on Munich district. History Zorneding had its first documentary mention on 4 September 813. A further documentary mention comes from the year 1156 when Zorneding was mentioned in the Falkensteiner Codex under the name Ingoltesperch (‚ÄúSettlement at Ingolt‚Äôs Mountain‚Äù). Ludwig V, Duke of Upper Bavaria, Margrave of Tyrol and Brandenburg died in Zorneding in 1361 while hunting. Over the centuries, Zorneding grew ever more into a typical road-based town. The ancient Salt Road (nowadays Bundesstra√üe 304) gained more and more importance after Munich was founded. P√∂ring, with its centres of Ingelsberg and Wolfesing is a clearing settlement from the 6th and 7th centuries. In 885, ‚ÄúPeringan‚Äù had its first documentary mention. In 1156, ‚ÄúIngoltesperch‚Äù was mentioned, and in 1269 so was ‚ÄúWolfizzingen‚Äù. In 1750, Wolfesing was amalgamated with P√∂ring, and in 1815 so was Ingelsberg. In 1978, on the occasion of municipal reform, P√∂ring and Zorneding were merged into one community. At the same time, the centre of Baldham was transferred to Vaterstetten. =Coats of arms= Zorneding Zorneding‚Äôs municipal arms show the Brandenburg eagle holding two charred boughs, one in each talon. The eagle goes back to Ludwig V who died in 1361 in Zorneding. To commemorate this event, the community took up the eagle as a charge in its arms, since Ludwig was from Brandenburg. The burnt boughs refer to the clearing. P√∂ring‚Äôs arms show two silver points and a yellow partridge on a blue background. It symbolizes the holder of the P√∂ring noble seat. Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= *St. Martin (parish church), late Baroque, built 1719 to 1723, late Gothic Madonna at the choir arch, Gothic baptismal font, richly stuccoed. *St. Georg in P√∂ring, Baroque, building begun 1696, consecration 1707. =Parks= There are many hiking and cycling paths in the Ebersberg Forest. =Transport= The constituent community of Zorneding lies on Bundesstra√üe 304. On 7 June 2005, the sod was turned to begin construction on a community bypass running south of town. The 4.2 km- long roadway opened to traffic on 3 July 2007. After the opening, traffic through the community was greatly reduced from a former 20,000 vehicles a day to roughly 2,000 now. The railway station in Zorneding lies on the Munich‚ÄìRosenheim line, but is not a stop for regional trains. Zorneding is connected to Munich by Munich S-Bahn‚Äôs lines S4 and S6 and to the district capital of Ebersberg by the S4 line. There is also a bus connection to Glonn by way of Oberpframmern. =Educational institutions= The community is home to the Grundschule Zorneding with its two buildings in Zorneding and P√∂ring. This school recently celebrated its 350th birthday.

As such, it was a part of a group of classical music stations in the northeastern United States, the Concert Network, programmed from WBCN in Boston and carried by affiliates including WXCN in Providence, Rhode Island and WHCN in Hartford, Connecticut. Later, WNCN was acquired by medical ad agency owner Ludwig Wolfgang Frohlich, the founder of the National Science Network,\\"L. W. FROHLICH; LED AD AGENCY\\" The New York Times, September 29, 1971, P. 36. Retrieved April 22, 2019 and added daily medical news reports to the schedule, since it was believed that classical music was the choice of the medical and dental professions. It also moved the antenna from the Hotel Pierre to the Empire State Building, increasing the station's coverage. National Science sold the station to Starr Broadcast Group in 1974. The station would retain a classical music format for many years, except for a short period during 1974-1975 when it took up a rock format with the call letters WQIV. During the brief run of WQIV, the station's progressive album- oriented rock appealed to long-time WNEW-FM listeners and included some veteran 70s FM rock DJs including Rosko and Carol Miller. This brief period also saw deployment of a short-lived technology as unintentionally brief as the format change itself: WQIV broadcast in Quadraphonic sound (a precursor to \\"Surround Sound\\") as indicated by the new call letters \\"Q\\" (quadraphonic) \\"IV\\" (Roman numeral 4). This choice of call letters was a constant reminder to audiences of this technical innovation, although history shows that the free market quickly abandoned quad. The WQIV era was during ownership by Starr Broadcast Group, of which William F. Buckley Jr. was chairman. The GM was Alan Eisenberg, and the program director was Larry Miller (WKTU). The announcement that the station was changing to rock music was read by Mr. Buckley himself and repeated frequently on the air. Two groups, the WNCN Listeners Guild and Classical Radio for Connecticut, were formed, and petitioned the FCC to forbid the change. A last minute stay by a Supreme Court Justice delayed the scheduled changeover, but that was lifted and WNCN became WQIV. The first selection played on the air by program and music director Larry Miller after the changeover was Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\".WNCN, WQIV, F.C.C.

In 1976, he hosted a regular program of comparative performances titled A Musical Offering, and more than a hundred of these programs have been archived at YouTube. WNCN's influence continues at WQXR-FM where Dubal, Annie Bergen, Paul Cavalconte, Clayelle Dalferes, and Elliott Forrest host. The station was owned by GAF until 1996, when Viacom purchased it for $100 million. = WAXQ (1993‚Äìpresent)= On December 18, 1993, at Midnight, WNCN signed off for good with Joseph Hadyn's Symphony No. 45 (also known as the \\"Farewell Symphony\\") as the station adopted a current-based album-oriented rock (AOR) format, along with new call letters WAXQ and the branding \\"Q104.3\\". The first on-air staff was Trent Tyler and Christine Nagy in morning drive; Heidi Hess in middays; Ida Hakkila and Mark Razz in afternoon drive; Candy Martin (Candice Agree) in nights and Lark Logan, overnights. The station's first PD was Bob Elliot, who was replaced by Ron Valeri. The APD/MD for Q104.3's entire existence as a hard rock station was Vinny Marino. The playlist was split into 5-song blocks that focused on current hard rock favorites, but also mixed in classic rock tunes and cuts from bands not typically thought of as radio friendly (Type O Negative, Anthrax). However, ratings were low, as this format was not ideal during a time in which more people were listening to alternative rock than to heavy metal. Also, during the mid-1990s, other New York City radio stations were playing alternative rock music, as WXRK went from classic rock to alternative rock, and WNEW-FM was trying to go after a younger audience. In 1996, thanks to a deal involving a swapping of various broadcast stations, Viacom would acquire WAXQ. After initial consideration was given for the station to turn to a country format, management decided that there was a need for a full-time classic rock station in New York City. As a result, the station went to its current format on July 1, 1996, at 5 AM. Research indicated that if WNEW were to revert to an all-classic rock format, listeners would not return there due to the distrust for that station. As it turned out, WNEW would unsuccessfully go back to a classic rock format in January 1997. That same year, Viacom sold off its entire radio division (before its merger with CBS and Infinity) to Chancellor Media. Chancellor in turn merged with Capstar Broadcasting to form AM/FM, and that company was then purchased by Clear Channel Communications. The Sopranos often featured the station as the radio station Tony Soprano would set on his alarm clock. In sharp contrast to their respective tenures on other NYC area radio stations, the DJs now have little creative input into what music gets played, as is common nowadays at most major-market radio stations. The playlist is narrower than that of classic rock radio stations of the past, due to results from audience research, and songs that were once staples of classic rock radio, such as \\"Eight Miles High\\" by The Byrds, are now only played during infrequent segments devoted to \\"Deep Classics\\". WAXQ is also known to go outside the genre of strictly classic rock, sometimes playing more modern rock, such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stone Temple Pilots, as well as some classic pop music such as by Elton John and Phil Collins and even some newer heavy metal such as Queensr√øche and Metallica, that are not normally found on classic rock stations.  HD operations  Like other Clear Channel stations, Q104.3 began multicasting in late winter 2006. On WAXQ HD1, the Classic Rock format could be heard on the original analog station while WAXQ HD2 played a blend of Deep Classic Rock Hits including some more hard rock and current releases by Classic Rock artists. HD stations can only be received with an HD Radio. HD Radios receive both the primary analog station, the duplicate HD Feed and the multicasting feeds. Stations can put as many as three sets of HD programming on one dial position plus their original analog broadcast. With the demise of 92.3 K-Rock (WXRK), the HD2 Channel began airing \\"Rock Nation\\" to satisfy the fans of K-Rock's active rock format. On July 16, 2011, one day after alternative station 101.9 RXP stopped running, the HD2 channel became \\"The Alternative Project\\" to somewhat fill the gap of alternative rock. As of August 2011, the HD2 Channel played a mix of mostly active rock, mixed with 90's alternative hard rock. Although the station ID at the top of the hour stated \\"The Alternative Project\\", it was neither airing \\"Rock Nation\\" nor \\"The Alternative Project\\". Two weeks later (mid August 2011), \\"The Alternative Project\\" feed returned. On October 1, 2015, HD2 became \\"iHeart Country\\" with a country music format. However, sometime in 2017, the HD2 country format was replaced by a simulcast of sister station WOR. \\"The Alternative Project\\" would later return in 2018, but this time on the new HD3 subchannel, despite having competition from rival alternative station Alt 92.3 (WNYL).

R. R. Tolkien in 1930 and published in Welsh Review in December 1945. Aotrou and Itroun are Breton words for \\"lord\\" and \\"lady\\". The poem is modelled on the genre of the \\"Breton lay\\" popular in Middle English literature of the 12th century, and it explores the conflict of heroic or chivalric values and Christianity, and their relation to the institution of marriage. Sources A major source for the poem has been identified as the Breton song 'An Aotrou Nann hag ar Gorigann' (Lord Nann and the Fairy), which Tolkien probably knew through Wimberly's Folklore in the English and Scottish Ballads (1928).Tom Shippey, The Road to Middle-Earth (1992) pp. 245-246, 320 Tolkien adds to his source a stern moral - repudiation of all traffic with the supernatural.Tom Shippey, J. R. R. Tolkien: Author of the Century (2001) pp. 293-294 Thematics In the poem, Aotrou and Itroun are a couple of Breton nobility. They are childless, and Aotrou seeks the help of a witch. When Itroun is with child, the witch reappears, revealing herself as the Corrigan, and asks for Aotrou's love as payment. Aotrou sacrifices his knightly honour to Christian values, and breaks his word. :\\"I gave no love. My love is wed; :my wife now lieth in child-bed, :and I curse the beast that cheated me :and drew me to this dell to thee.\\" Cursed by the Corrigan to die in three days, Aotrou takes the consequences and places his trust in Providence: :In three days I shall live at ease :and die but when it God doth please :in eld, or in some time to come :in the brave wars of Christendom. Aotrou died after three days, followed by his wife with a broken heart. They are buried together, and they do not live to see their offspring grow up - something that has been interpreted as a judgement on Aotrou for excessive family pride.Jane Chance, Tolkien's Art (2001) pp. 122-124 Publication The lay was originally published in The Welsh Review in 1945 but had been unavailable for decades.

After his professional hockey career was over, he became a successful businessman working in the investment industry. In 1954, he founded one of Canada's first hockey schools, Future Aces, and through his work in training young hockey players, became a member of both the Order of Ontario and the country's highest civilian award, the Order of Canada. His hockey career was recognized when he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2014. He died in Toronto in March 2012 at age 92. Playing career Carnegie's hockey career began in 1938 with the Toronto Young Rangers and continued in the early 1950 with the Buffalo Ankerites, a team in a mines league that played in mining towns in northern Ontario and Quebec. From 1944-45 to 1947-48, he played for Shawinigan and Sherbrooke of the semi- professional Quebec Provincial League and was named most valuable player in 1946, 1947 and 1949. In 1948, Carnegie was given a tryout with the New York Rangers and offered a contract to play in the Rangers' minor league system. However, he was offered less money than he was earning in the Quebec league and turned down all three offers made by the Rangers organization during his tryout. Returning to Canada to play in the Quebec Senior Hockey League, he played for Sherbrooke St. Francis and the Quebec Aces before moving to Ontario to play a single season with the Owen Sound Mercuries of the Ontario Senior Hockey Association. During his years in the Quebec Senior League, Carnegie played with future Montreal Canadiens star Jean Beliveau and was coached by Punch Imlach. =Facing racism= As a black man playing hockey in the 1940s and 1950s, Carnegie endured his share of racism. In one famous 1938 incident, Conn Smythe, the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, watched Carnegie play as a member of the Toronto Young Rangers. He is alleged to have said either that he would accept Carnegie on the team if he were white or that he would pay $10,000 to anyone who could turn Carnegie white. In Breaking the Ice: The Black Experience in Professional Hockey, author Cecil Harris noted that \\"some doubt has arisen\\" as to whether Smythe did indeed utter this remark. According to Harris, Carnegie and others believe that racism played an important part in keeping him out of the NHL. Others interviewed point to his decision to refuse the New York Rangers' offer to play in their organization. Retirement After retiring from the game of hockey in 1953, Carnegie started the Future Aces Hockey School, one of the first hockey schools in Canada. In 1954, he wrote the \\"Future Aces Creed\\" in an attempt to foster respect, tolerance, diversity and sportsmanship among young people. Carnegie also continued his athletic career as a golfer, winning the Canadian Seniors Golf Championship in 1977 and 1978, and the Ontario Senior Golf Championship in 1975, 1976 and 1982. In 1987, he established the Herbert H. Carnegie Future Aces Foundation to provide bursaries for college and university. Carnegie also had a successful business career as a financial planner with the Investors Group. In 1996, he published his biography, A Fly in a Pail of Milk: The Herb Carnegie Story (Mosaic Press, 1996). Carnegie was named to the Order of Ontario in 1996 and the Order of Canada in 2003. On May 2, 2005, the North York Centennial Centre was renamed the Herbert H. Carnegie Centennial Centre in his honour. On June 12, 2006, he received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from York University. A public school in York Region is named in his honour. He also received the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, the Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship in 1988, the Metropolitan Toronto Canada Day Medal in 1990, the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal in 1992, and the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002. Carnegie became legally blind. He died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he lived in an assisted living home. Family life Carnegie last resided in Toronto. He was married to Audrey May Carnegie for 60 years, from 1940 until her death in 2003. They had four children, nine grandchildren and six great grandchildren. His grandson, Rane Carnegie, is also a hockey player. Rane had a successful juniors career with several teams, and has played professional hockey since joining the Milwaukee Admirals as part of their post-season roster during the 2005-06 AHL season. Appearances in media In the early 1990s, Carnegie and his Future Aces hockey program were featured in two special issues of The Amazing Spider-Man, helping Spider-Man bring down Electro and his hockey puck/drug smuggling operation (issue 1, Skating on Thin Ice)Atop the Fourth Wall: Amazing Spider- Man: Skating on Thin Ice #1 and foil the Chameleon's plan to steal a valuable chemical formula (issue 2).

Hogan and Beefcake would once again team up after being attacked in the locker rooms during the closing moments of the 1989 Survivor Series by Savage and Zeus.

Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake were successful in the cage, after which Zeus was not seen in the WWF. After the steel cage match, Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake both went back to working singles matches. =1993= In 1990, Brutus Beefcake suffered a devastating face injury during a parasailing accident that forced him to retire from in-ring competition. After an aborted comeback attempt in late 1991/early 1992, Brutus Beefcake finally felt he was ready to get back inside the squared circle in 1993. On February 1, 1993 (shown on Television February 15), Brutus Beefcake faced off against \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase with his Money Inc. partner I.R.S. and manager Jimmy Hart at ringside. I.R.S. would interfere in the match with Money, Inc. double teaming Beefcake, even going so far as to hitting him in his surgically reconstructed face with a metal briefcase. The actions of Money Inc. were so horrible, that even longtime heel manager Jimmy Hart took objection to it and tried to protect Beefcake from further harm. At this point in time, Hulk Hogan was not active in the WWF, having gone into semi-retirement a year earlier, but the attack on his lifelong friend brought the Hulkster back to the WWF. With newly turned babyface manager Jimmy Hart at their side, Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake joined forces, swore vengeance on Money, Inc. and then officially named themselves \\"The Mega-Maniacs.\\" Due to the attack by Money, Inc, Beefcake took to wearing a red and yellow protective facemask when competing in the ring and Brutus's entire outfit changed to red and yellow as a show of unity with Hulk Hogan. Leading up to WrestleMania IX, the Mega-Maniacs took on the Beverly Brothers during house shows to get ready for their shot at the WWF World Tag-Team titles at WrestleMania. The Mega-Maniacs were not successful in their challenge as they lost to Money Inc. via disqualification when Hogan attacked the champions with Beefcake's steel face plate. Later in the night, Hogan would win the WWF World Heavyweight Title in an impromptu match against Yokozuna, when Yokozuna challenged Hogan to a match immediately after winning the title from Bret Hart the same night. The Mega-Maniacs would team up and take on Money, Inc. several times during the months of April and May on the house show circuit with the World Champion not defending his title once. Hogan would eventually lose the title to Yokozuna at June's King of the Ring pay- per-view, and both he and Beefcake would leave the WWF soon after. =WCW, 1994-1998= Hogan and Beefcake, now known as \\"Brother Bruti,\\" came to WCW together in June 1994. Bruti would eventually turn on Hogan at Halloween Havoc 1994, and the two feuded on and off for the next year and a half, with Bruti becoming \\"The Butcher\\" and \\"Zodiac.\\" Hogan would be aided by Savage, while Butcher/Zodiac would be aligned with Kevin Sullivan and Avalanche, as well as being a member of Sullivan's Dungeon of Doom stable. Zodiac would turn face in 1996, revealing himself to be a mole that Hogan and Savage had injected into the Dungeon of Doom a year earlier, becoming The Booty Man. Hogan, Savage, and Booty Man would continue to team against members of the Dungeon. =nWo= In July 1996, Hogan shocked the fans by turning heel and starting a new faction known as the New World Order. Booty Man attempted to join the group until Hogan ordered his fellow nWo members Scott Hall and Kevin Nash to attack him. Less than a year later, Booty Man, now known as The Disciple, would join the group and always accompany Hogan to the ring and aide him in winning matches. In 1998, The Ultimate Warrior came to WCW to feud with Hogan and turned the Disciple against Hogan, joining the One Warrior Nation (or oWn, a play on the nWo acronym). Hogan and Leslie never teamed again after this.

More significantly, it led to his interest in natural history, which culminated in his taking part in the second voyage of the Beagle and the eventual inception of his theory of natural selection. Although Darwin changed his field of interest several times in these formative years, many of his later discoveries and beliefs were foreshadowed by the influences he had as a youth. Background and influences Erasmus Darwin, Charles Darwin's paternal grandfather, helped influence Darwin's later religious views. Born in 1809, Charles Darwin grew up in a conservative era when repression of revolutionary Radicalism had displaced the 18th century Enlightenment. The Church of England dominated the English scientific establishment. The Church saw natural history as revealing God's underlying plan and as supporting the existing social hierarchy. It rejected Enlightenment philosophers such as David Hume who had argued for naturalism and against belief in God. The discovery of fossils of extinct species was explained by theories such as catastrophism. Catastrophism claimed that animals and plants were periodically annihilated as a result of natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ex nihilo (out of nothing). The extinct organisms could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be immutable. Darwin's extended family of Darwins and Wedgwoods was strongly Unitarian. One of his grandfathers, Erasmus Darwin, was a successful physician, and was followed in this by his sons Charles Darwin, who died while still a promising medical student at the University of Edinburgh in 1778, and Doctor Robert Darwin, Darwin's father, who named his son after his deceased brother. Erasmus was a freethinker who hypothesized that all warm-blooded animals sprang from a single living \\"filament\\" long, long ago. He further proposed evolution by acquired characteristics, anticipating the theory later developed by Jean- Baptiste Lamarck. Although Charles was born after his grandfather Erasmus died, his father Robert found the texts an invaluable medical guide and Charles read them as a student. Doctor Robert also followed Erasmus in being a freethinker, but as a wealthy society physician was more discreet and attended the Church of England patronised by his clients. Childhood The seven-year- old Charles Darwin in 1816, a year before the sudden loss of his mother. Charles Robert Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England on 12 February 1809 at his family home, the Mount, He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin, and Susannah Darwin (n√©e Wedgwood). Both families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised on 15 November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. From Charles Darwin: a life in pictures at Darwin Online, the parish register of St. Chad's gives Darwin's date of baptism as 15 November 1809, a date supported by \\"England, Births and Christenings, 1538‚Äì1975,\\" index, FamilySearch, accessed 18 July 2012), Charles Robt. Darwin, 1809. The date is given as 17 November in Freeman (2007) p. 106, and Desmond & Moore p. 12. As a young child at The Mount, Darwin avidly collected animal shells, postal franks, bird's eggs, pebbles and minerals. He was very fond of gardening, an interest his father shared and encouraged, and would follow the family gardener around. Early in 1817, soon after becoming eight years old, he started at the small local school run by a Unitarian minister, the Reverend George Case. At home, Charles learned to ride ponies, shoot and fish. Influenced by his father's fashionable interest in natural history, he tried to make out the names of plants, and was given by his father two elementary natural history books. Childhood games included inventing and writing out complex secret codes. Charles would tell elaborate stories to his family and friends \\"for the pure pleasure of attracting attention & surprise\\", including hoaxes such as pretending to find apples he'd hidden earlier, and what he later called the \\"monstrous fable\\" which persuaded his schoolfriend that the colour of primula flowers could be changed by dosing them with special water. However, his father benignly ignored these passing games, and Charles later recounted that he stopped them because no-one paid any attention. In July 1817 his mother died after the sudden onset of violent stomach pains and amidst the grief his older sisters had to take charge, with their father continuing to dominate the household whenever he returned from his doctor's rounds. To the -year-old Charles this situation was not a great change, as his mother had frequently been ill and her available time taken up by social duties, so his upbringing had largely been in the hands of his three older sisters who were nearly adults by then. In later years he had difficulty in remembering his mother, and his only memory of her death and funeral was of the children being sent for and going into her room, and his \\"Father meeting us crying afterwards\\". As had been planned previously, in September 1818 Charles joined his older brother Erasmus Alvey Darwin (nicknamed \\"Eras\\") in staying as a boarder at the Shrewsbury School, where he loathed the required rote learning, and would try to visit home when he could. He continued collecting minerals and insects, and family holidays in Wales brought Charles new opportunities, but an older sister ruled that \\"it was not right to kill insects\\" for his collections, and he had to find dead ones. He read Gilbert White's The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne and took up birdwatching. Eras took an interest in chemistry and Charles became his assistant, with the two using a garden shed at their home fitted out as a laboratory and extending their interests to crystallography. When Eras went on to a medical course at the University of Cambridge, Charles continued to rush home to the shed on weekends, and for this received the nickname \\"Gas\\". The headmaster was not amused at this diversion from studying the classics, calling him a poco curante (trifler) in front of the boys. At fifteen, his interest shifted to hunting and bird-shooting at local estates, particularly at Maer in Staffordshire, the home of his relatives, the Wedgwoods. His exasperated father once told him off, saying \\"You care for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.\\" His father decided that he should leave school earlier than usual, and in 1825 at the age of sixteen Charles was to go along with his brother who was to attend the University of Edinburgh for a year to obtain medical qualifications. Charles spent the summer as an apprentice doctor, helping his father with treating the poor of Shropshire. He had half a dozen patients of his own, and would note their symptoms for his father to make up the prescriptions. University of Edinburgh Darwin attended the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, at a time when the new buildings it occupied (the Old College) were still under construction. South College Street, to the left of the picture, connects to Lothian Street. Plaque in Lothian Street, indicating where Darwin lived while studying at Edinburgh Darwin went to Edinburgh University in October 1825 to study medicine, accompanied by Eras doing his external hospital study. The brothers took lodgings at 11 Lothian Street, near the University. The city was in an uproar over political and religious controversies, and the competitive system where professors were dependent on attracting student fees for income meant that the university was riven with argumentative feuds and conflicts. The monopoly held by established medical professors was challenged by private independent schools, with new ideas of teaching by dissecting corpses giving clandestine trade to bodysnatchers (just shortly before the Burke and Hare scandal). He attended the official university lectures, but complained that most were stupid and boring, and found himself too sensitive to the sight of blood. He was disgusted by the dull and outdated anatomy lectures of professor Alexander Monro tertius, and later regretted his failure to persevere and learn dissection. Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to George Combe's daringly materialist ideas of phrenology. As the exception to the general dullness, the spectacular chemistry lectures of Thomas Charles Hope were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend surgical operations twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before anaesthetics. He was long haunted by the memory, particularly of an operation on a child. The brothers kept each other company, and made extensive use of the library. Darwin's reading included novels and Boswell's Life of Johnson. He had brought natural history books with him, including a copy of A Naturalist's Companion by George Graves, bought in August in anticipation of seeing the seaside, and he borrowed similar books from the library. The brothers went for regular Sunday walks on the shores of the Firth of Forth and Darwin kept a diary recording their finds, which included a sea mouse and a cuttlefish. Darwin wrote home that \\"I am going to learn to stuff birds, from a blackamoor... he only charges one guinea, for an hour every day for two months\\". These lessons in taxidermy were with the freed black slave John Edmonstone, who also lived in Lothian Street. Darwin often sat with him to hear tales of the South American rain-forest of Guyana, and later remembered him as \\"a very pleasant and intelligent man.\\" During his summer holiday Charles read Zo√∂nomia by his grandfather Erasmus Darwin, which his father valued for medical guidance but which also proposed evolution by acquired characteristics. In June he went on a walking tour in North Wales. =Lamarckian anatomy= In his second year Charles became active in student societies for naturalists. The 21-year-old radical demagogue William A. F. Browne and the 19-year-old John Coldstream both proposed Darwin for membership of the Plinian Society on 21 November 1826. John Coldstream came from an evangelical background and shared Darwin's fascination with sea life. Darwin was elected to its Council on 5 December, and at the same meeting Browne presented an attack on Charles Bell's Anatomy and Physiology of Expression (which in 1872 Darwin would target in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals). Darwin became a keen student of Robert Edmond Grant, a Lamarckian anatomist. Grant had cited Erasmus Darwin in his doctoral thesis and shared the evolutionist ideas of √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire on evolution by acquired characteristics. Charles joined Grant in pioneering investigations of the life cycle of marine invertebrates on the shores of the Firth of Forth. Darwin and Grant collected tiny animals from the rock pools and walked along the rocky shore at Prestonpans, where Grant lived during the winter at Walford House. Grant began taking Darwin as a guest to professor Robert Jameson's Wernerian Natural History Society. There Charles saw John James Audubon lecturing on the habits of North American birds. In the April‚ÄìOctober 1826 edition of the quarterly Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal edited by Jameson, an anonymous paper praised \\"Mr. Lamarck, one of the most sagacious naturalists of our day\\" for having \\"expressed himself in the most unambiguous manner. He admits, on the one hand, the existence of the simplest infusory animals; on the other, the existence of the simplest worms, by means of spontaneous generation, that is, by an aggregation process of animal elements; and maintains, that all other animals, by the operation of external circumstances, are evolved from these in a double series, and in a gradual manner.\\"Jameson, Robert ed. (1826) Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, A. and C. Black, Edinburgh, pp. 296‚Äì297 ‚Äì this was the first use of the word \\"evolved\\" in a modern sense. Though some have attributed authorship to Jameson, this is hotly contested and others see Grant as having written it, as the first significant statement to relate Lamarck's concepts to the geological record of living organisms of the past. Darwin made a discovery new to science when he observed cilia moving the microscopic larvae of a species of the bryozoan Flustra. He rushed to tell Grant, confirming Grant's belief that the larvae of these marine animals were free swimming, but was upset when Grant claimed rights to the work. Darwin also made the discovery that black spores often found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech, and was disappointed when Grant announced both finds to the Wernerian on 24 March 1827 without giving Darwin credit, though Grant in his publication about the leech eggs in the Edinburgh Journal of Science later that year acknowledged \\"The merit of having first ascertained them to belong to that animal is due to my zealous young friend Mr Charles Darwin of Shrewsbury\\", the first time Darwin's name appeared in print. Darwin made a presentation of both discoveries to the Plinian Society on 27 March, his first public presentation. Later in the meeting Browne argued that mind and consciousness were simply aspects of brain activity, not \\"souls\\" or spiritual entities separate from the body. A furious debate ensued, and later someone deleted all mention of this materialist heresy from the minutes. This was Darwin's first exposure to militant freethought and the storm it stirred up. During their walks Grant expounded his ideas to Darwin, and on one occasion dropped his guard and praised Lamarck's views on evolution. He explained his radical theory of homology, an extension of the idea of unity of plan in vogue in Paris at the time. He argued that all animals had similar organs differing only in complexity and, controversially, that this showed their common descent. Grant had announced to the Wernerian his identification of the pancreas in a pinned-out sea-slug, showing an organ molluscs shared with mammals. He assumed that as the earth cooled, changing conditions drove life towards higher, hotter blooded forms, as shown by a progressive sequence of fossils, and that study of eggs of the simplest creatures would help reveal monads, elementary living particles. While this showed that naturalists could try to \\"lift the veil that hangs over the origin and progress of the organic world\\", Darwin was troubled by Grant's atheism and could see that transmutation was far from respectable. Darwin later recalled \\"I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as I can judge, without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the Zo√∂nomia of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but without producing any effect on me.\\" Shortly afterwards Coldstream graduated and went to Paris for his hospital study, where he suffered a mental breakdown, struggling with \\"the foul mass of corruption within my own bosom\\", held captive to his body by \\"corroding desires\\" and \\"lustful imaginations\\". The doctor's report was that though Coldstream had led \\"a blameless life\\", he was \\"more or less in the dark on the vital question of religion, and was troubled with doubts arising from certain Materialist views, which are, alas!, too common among medical students\\". =Geology and Origin of the Species= Darwin also took the popular natural history course of Professor Robert Jameson, learning about stratigraphic geology. Jameson was a Neptunian geologist who taught that strata had precipitated from a universal ocean: he held debates with chemistry professor Thomas Charles Hope who held that granites had crystallised from molten crust, ideas influenced by the Plutonism of James Hutton who had been Hope's friend. Jameson's view was that \\"It would be a misfortune if we all had the same way of thinking... Dr Hope is decidedly opposed to me, and I am opposed to Dr Hope, and between us we make the subject interesting.\\" Darwin liked Hope and found Jameson a boring speaker. It is not known what he made of Jameson's closing lectures on the \\"Origin of the Species of Animals\\". Darwin enjoyed practicals in the Museum and course field trips, learning the sequence of strata. The Museum of Edinburgh University was Jameson's preserve and was then one of the largest in Europe. Darwin assisted and made full use of the collections, spending hours studying, taking notes and stuffing animal specimens. Even medical lectures proved of some use. In January 1826 Darwin had written home complaining of \\"a long stupid lecture\\" from Dr. Andrew Duncan secundus about medicine, but the lectures introduced him to Augustin de Candolle's natural system of classification and emphasis on the \\"war\\" between competing species. However, he loathed medicine and left in April 1827 without a degree. He toured Scotland, went on to Belfast and Dublin and in May made his first trip to London to visit his sister Caroline. They joined his uncle Josiah Wedgwood II on a trip to France. There Charles fended for himself for a few weeks in Paris with Browne and Coldstream who was recovering having \\"found joy and peace in believing\\". Charles rejoined his relations and then returned to his home at Shrewsbury, Shropshire by July. University of Cambridge The coat of arms of Christ's College, Cambridge, a college of the University of Cambridge where Darwin was enrolled to become a clergyman. His father was unhappy that his younger son would not become a physician and \\"was very properly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which then seemed my probable destination.\\" He therefore enrolled Charles at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1827 for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the qualification required before taking a specialised divinity course and becoming an Anglican parson. He enrolled for an ordinary degree, as at that time only capable mathematicians would take the Tripos. At that time the only way to get an honours degree was the mathematical Tripos examination, or the classical Tripos created in 1822, which was only open to those who already had high honours in mathematics, or those who were the sons of peers. This was a respectable career for a gentleman at a time when most naturalists in England were clergymen in the tradition of Gilbert White, who saw it as part of their duties to \\"explore the wonders of God's creation\\". Charles had concerns about being able to declare his belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England, so as well as hunting and fishing, he studied divinity books. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. John Bird Sumner's Evidences of Christianity. John Bird Summer wrote that Jesus's religion was \\"wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world\\" and there was \\"no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability.\\" His Classics had lapsed since school, and he spent the autumn term at home studying Greek with a tutor. Darwin was accepted as a \\"pensioner\\", having paid his fees, on 15 October 1827, but did not attend Cambridge until the Lent Term which began on 13 January 1828. Eras returned from Edinburgh ready to sit his Bachelor of Medicine exam, and in the new year he and Charles set out together for Cambridge. Darwin came into residence in Cambridge on 26 January 1828, and matriculated at the University's Senate House on 26 February. His tutors at Christ's College, Cambridge were to include Joseph Shaw in 1828, John Graham (in 1829 ‚Äì 1830) and Edward John Ash in 1830 ‚Äì 1831. One of his university friends was Frederick Watkins, (1808‚Äì1888). =Beetle collecting= Arriving at the University of Cambridge in January 1828, Darwin found this elite theological training institution governed by complex rules much more congenial than his experiences at Edinburgh. No rooms were available at Christ's College, so he took lodgings above a tobacconists in Sidney Street, across the road. Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of beetles. Trainee clergymen scoured Cambridgeshire for specimens, referring to An Introduction to Entomology by William Kirby and William Spence. Charles joined his older cousin William Darwin Fox who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable. They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about natural history from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a ground beetle in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix Ground Beetle, Panagaeus cruxmajor. With the habits of an egg-collector, he popped one ground beetle in his mouth to free his hand, but it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt his tongue and Darwin was forced to spit it out. He lost all three. describes the incident and states that the insect Darwin popped into his mouth was a bombardier beetle. *They cite Darwin's correspondence and his Autobiography () * quotes the Autobiography, and while its illustration shows a bombardier beetle, it says \\"Many beetles, including the Brachinus crepitans and the Stenaptinus insignis, release irritating chemicals as a defense.\\" *Letter 1009 ‚Äì Darwin, C. R. to Jenyns, Leonard, 17 Oct (1846) describes the two beetles as unidentified carabi, or ground beetles. * The specimens he did not lose had to be mounted and identified, and his knowledge from Edinburgh of Lamarck proved useful. Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the Revd. John Stevens Henslow, professor of botany, and Darwin began attending his soir√©es, a club for budding naturalists. Here he could meet other professors including the geologist the Revd. Adam Sedgwick and the new mineralogist the Revd. William Whewell. In the summer Darwin paid visits to Squire Owen, and romance seemed to be blossoming with the squire's daughter Fanny. Darwin joined other Cambridge friends on a three-month \\"reading party\\" at Barmouth on the coast of Wales to revise their studies with private tutors. For Charles it was an \\"Entomo-Mathematical expedition\\". Though he badly needed to catch up with his mathematics, the insect collecting predominated along with pleasant diversions such as hillwalking, boating and fly fishing. He went on daily walks with his close friend, the older student John Maurice Herbert who he dubbed \\"Cherbury\\" after Herbert of Cherbury, the father of English Deism. Herbert assisted with the insect collecting, but the usual outcome was that Darwin would examine Herbert's collecting bottle and say \\"Well, old Cherbury, none of these will do.\\" In September Darwin wrote to tell \\"My dear old Cherbury\\" that his own catches had included \\"some of the rarest of the British Insects, & their being found near Barmouth is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall write & inform some of the crack Entomologists.\\" He described these \\"extremely rare\\" insects and asked Herbert to oblige him by collecting some more of them. =Second year doldrums= At the start of his second year Charles became the tenant of the rooms at Christ's College which traditionally had been occupied by the theologian William Paley. He now had breakfast every day with his older cousin William Darwin Fox. This was Fox's last term before his BA exam, and he now had to cram desperately to make up for lost time. At the Christmas holiday Charles visited London with Eras, toured the scientific institutions \\"where Naturalists are gregarious\\" and through his friend the Revd. Frederick William Hope met other insect collectors. These included James Stephens, author of Illustrations of British Entomology\\". The January term brought miserable weather and a struggle to keep up with his studies. Around this time, he had an earnest conversation with John Herbert about going into Holy Orders, and asked him whether he could answer yes to the question that the Bishop would put in the ordination service, \\"Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit\\". When Herbert said that he could not, Darwin replied \\"Neither can I, and therefore I cannot take orders\\" to become an ordained priest. Even his interest in insect collecting waned. He fell out with one of the two locals he employed to catch beetles when he found that the local was giving first choice to a rival collector. In the doldrums, he joined a crowd of drinking pals in a frequent \\"debauch\\". He put in some hard riding. On one night he and three friends saw the sky lit up and \\"rode like incarnate devils\\" eleven miles to see the blaze. They arrived back at two in the morning and violated curfew. He was risking \\"rustication\\", temporary expulsion. Such behaviour would be noticed by the Proctors, university officials appointed from the colleges who patrolled the town in plain gowns to police the students. Student resentment against two unpopular Proctors built up, and on 9 April 1829 a tumult broke out. Charles described how the Senior Proctor was \\"most gloriously hissed.. & pelted with mud\\", being \\"driven so furious\\" that his servant \\"dared not go near him for an hour.\\" The Proctors had noted some faces in the mob, and four were rusticated and one fined for being out-of-gown and shouting abuse. Outraged by this leniency, the Proctors quit en masse and printed their resignation to post up around the colleges. Though the unpopular Proctors were gone, Charles was jolted into thinking of the consequences of law-breaking. In the Spring, Darwin enrolled for John Stevens Henslow's lectures on botany. Professor Henslow's first \\"public herborizing expedition\\" of the year took place in May, an outing on which students assisted with collection of plants. However, Darwin made no mention of Henslow in his letters to Fox. On 18 May Darwin wrote to Fox enthusing about his success with beetle collecting, \\"I think I beat Jenyns in Colymbetes\\", contrasted with his lack of application to studies: \\"my time is solely occupied in riding & Entomologizing\\". Cambridge was briefly visited on 21 May by the Radicals Richard Carlile and the Revd. Robert Taylor, both recently jailed for blasphemy, on an \\"infidel home missionary tour\\" which caused several days of controversy. Taylor was later nicknamed \\"the Devil's Chaplain\\", a phrase remembered by Darwin. Charles had been sending records of the insects he had caught to the entomologist James Francis Stephens, and was thrilled when Stevens published about thirty of these records in Illustrations of British entomology; or, a synopsis of indigenous insects etc. which was printed in parts, with the first description under Darwin's name appearing in an appendix dated 15 June 1829. That summer, amongst horse riding and beetle collecting, Charles visited his cousin Fox, and this time Charles was teaching entomology to his older cousin. Home at Shrewsbury, Shropshire, he saw his brother Erasmus whose \\"delicate frame\\" led to him now giving up medicine and retiring at the age of 26. The brothers visited the Birmingham Music Festival for what Charles described as the \\"most glorious\\" experience. =Third year, theology and natural history= Back at Cambridge, Charles studied hard for his Little Go preliminary exam, as a fail would mean a re-sit the following year. He dropped his drinking companions and resumed attending Henslow's Friday evening soir√©es. For the exam he slogged away at Greek and Latin, and studied William Paley's Evidences of Christianity, becoming so delighted with Paley's logic that he learnt it well. This was a text he also had to study for his finals, and he was \\"convinced that I could have written out the whole of the Evidences with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley.\\" Later, on the Beagle expedition, he saw evidence which challenged Paley's rose-tinted view, but at this time he was convinced that the Christian revelation established \\"a future state of reward and punishment\\" which \\"gives order for confusion: makes the moral world of a piece with the natural\\". As with Cambridge University, God gave authority and assigned stations in life, misconduct was penalised and excellence bountifully rewarded. Charles took the one-day verbal examination on 24 March 1830. There were three hours in the morning on the classics and three in the afternoon on the New Testament and Paley. The next day he was delighted to be informed that he had passed. Several of his friends celebrated their examination successes by dining in each other's rooms in rotation in a weekly club commonly known as the Glutton Club. This name was proposed to ridicule another group whose Greek title meant \\"fond of dainties\\", but who dined out on \\"Mutton Chops, or Beans & Bacon\\". The Glutton Club attempted to live up to their title by experimentally dining on \\"birds and beasts which were before unknown to human palate\\" and tried hawk and bittern, but gave up after eating an old brown owl, \\"which was indescribable\\". They had more amusement from concluding each meeting with \\"a game of mild vingt-et-un\\". Over Easter Charles stayed at Cambridge, mounting and cataloguing his beetle collection. He then became an enthusiastic member of the botany course which the \\"good natured & agreeable\\" professor Henslow taught five days a week in the Botanic Gardens and on field trips. Henslow's outings were attended by 78 men including professor Whewell. Charles became the \\"favourite pupil\\", known as \\"the man who walks with Henslow\\", helping to find specimens and to set up \\"practicals\\" dissecting plants. He became interested in pollen. One day he watched through a microscope and saw \\"transparent cones\\" emerge from the side of a geranium pollen grain. Then one burst spraying out \\"numberless granules\\". Henslow explained that the granules were indeed the constituent atoms of pollen, but they had no intrinsic vital power ‚Äì life was endowed from outside and ultimately derived its power from God, whatever more \\"speculative\\" naturalists argued regarding self-activating power. Darwin had been taught otherwise by Grant, and reflected quietly on this, biding his time. For the summer holidays Darwin arranged to meet Fox at The Mount, but Darwin's father had been ill and family tensions led to a row. Charles went off with the Revd. Hope and other friends for three weeks \\"entomologizing\\" in North Wales, hunting for beetles and trout fishing. He went partridge shooting at Maer before returning home. =Fourth year finals and later attitude towards mathematics = Back at Cambridge, his final exams loomed. A \\"desperate\\" Charles focused on his studies and got private tuition from Henslow whose subjects were mathematics and theology. This term he had to study Euclid and learn Paley's Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy, though this old text was becoming outdated. It opposed arguments for increased democracy, but saw no divine right of rule for the sovereign or the state, only \\"expediency\\". Government could be opposed if grievances outweighed the danger and expense to society. The judgement was \\"Every man for himself\\". These ideas had suited the conditions of reasonable rule prevailing when the text was published in 1785, but in 1830 they were dangerous ideas. At this time the French king was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the Tory government. In response, radical street protests demanded suffrage, equality and freedom of religion. Then in November the Tory administration collapsed and the Whigs took over. Paley's text even supported abolition of the Thirty- nine Articles of the Anglican faith which every student at Cambridge (and Oxford University) was required to sign. Henslow insisted that \\"he should be grieved if a single word... was altered\\" and emphasised the need to respect authority. This happened even as campaigns of civil disobedience spread to starving agricultural labourers and villages close to Cambridge suffered riots and arson attacks. In the third week of January 1831 Charles sat his final exam. There were three days of written papers covering the Classics, the two Paley texts and John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, then mathematics and physics. At the end of the week when the results were posted he was dazed and proud to have come 10th out of a pass list of 178 doing the ordinary degree. Charles shone in theology and scraped through in the other subjects. He was also exhausted and depressed, writing to Fox \\"I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable.\\" In later life he recalled Paley and Euclid being the only part of the course which was useful to him, and \\"By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the Œø·º± œÄŒøŒªŒªŒøŒØ, or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.\\" On the specific issue of his mathematical education, Darwin came to regret his lack of ability and application: \\"I attempted mathematics, and even went during the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense\\".Darwin Correspondence Cambridge 1828‚Äì1831 =Natural theology and geology= Anthony Smith, the statue features some of the books Darwin was reading at this time; Humboldt's Personal Narrative, Paley's Natural Theology, Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on Natural Philosophy and James Stephens' Illustrations of British Entomology. Residence requirements kept Darwin in Cambridge till June. He resumed his beetle collecting, took career advice from Henslow, and read William Paley's Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity which set out to refute David Hume's argument that \\"design\\" by a Creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect adaptation to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of Erasmus Darwin as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence. Paley's benevolent God acted in nature though uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a theodicy explaining the problem of evil by separating nature from direct divine action. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science. He later wrote \\"I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\\" He read John Herschel's new Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy, learning that nature was governed by laws, and the highest aim of natural philosophy was to understand them through an orderly process of induction, balancing observation and theorising. This was part of the liberal Christianity of Darwin's tutors, who saw no disharmony between honest inductive science and religion. Such science was religion, and could not be heretical., Darwin also read Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative, and the two books were immensely influential, stirring up in him \\"a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science.\\" As a young graduate, Henslow had geologised on the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Man, and he too had longed to visit Africa. Marriage and his position at the university now made the prospect remote, but he still had an unfulfilled ambition to \\"explore regions but little known, and enrich science with new species.\\". At home for Easter in early April, Darwin told his cousin Fox of \\"a scheme I have almost hatched\\" to visit the Canary Islands and see Tenerife as recommended by Humboldt. On returning to Cambridge, he wrote to his sister that \\"my head is running about the Tropics: in the morning I go and gaze at Palm trees in the hot-house and come home and read Humboldt: my enthusiasm is so great that I cannot hardly sit still on my chair. Henslow & other Dons give us great credit for our plan: Henslow promises to cram me in geology\\". He was studying Spanish language, and was in \\"a Tropical glow\\". Henslow introduced Darwin to the great geologist the Revd. Adam Sedgwick who had been his own tutor, and shared views on religion, politics and morals. Darwin was fired up by Sedgwick's Spring course of \\"equestrian outings\\" with its vistas of the grandeur of God's creation, so much of which was yet unexplored. He exclaimed, \\"What a capital hand is Sedgewick for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!\\". When Sedgwick mentioned the effects of a local spring from a chalk hill depositing lime on twigs, Charles rode out to find the spring and threw a bush in, then later brought back the white coated spray which Sedgwick exhibited in class, inspiring others to do the same. Darwin continued plotting his \\"Canary scheme\\", and on 11 May he told Fox \\"My other friends most sincerely wish me there I plague them so with talking about tropical scenery &c; &c.;\\". His father gave him \\"a 200¬£ note\\" to pay his college debts. In addition, \\"Some goodnatured Cambridge man has made me a most magnificent anonymous present of a Microscope: did ever hear of such a delightful piece of luck? one would like to know who it was, just to feel obliged to him.\\" Darwin later found that the gift was from his friend John Herbert. In mid June Darwin returned home to Shrewsbury, and continued \\"working like a tiger\\" for the Canary scheme, \\"at present Spanish & Geology, the former I find as intensely stupid, as the latter most interesting\\". By then his most likely companion on the trip was the tutor Marmaduke Ramsay. Darwin was \\"trying to make a map\\" of Shropshire, \\"but dont find it so easy as I expected.\\" He ordered a clinometer, and on 11 July wrote to tell Henslow that it had arrived and he had tried it out in his bedroom. \\"As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses; but they are such powerful ones, that I suppose, if they were put into action but for one day, the world would come to an end.\\" In efforts to learn the basics of geology he extended his mapping of strata as far away as Llanymynech, some from Shrewsbury, using the terminology he had learnt in Edinburgh from Robert Jameson. Already he was anxious that he had not heard from Sedgwick, and when he investigated ship sailings he found that they were only available in certain months. For this reason, the trip to Teneriffe had to be postponed to the following June, and it looked increasingly unlikely that Henslow would come on the trip. Darwin wrote to one of his student friends that he was \\"at present mad about Geology\\" and had plans to ride through Wales then meet with other students at Barmouth. On 4 August 1831 Sedgwick arrived in his gig at The Mount, Shrewsbury, to take Charles as his assistant on a short geological expedition mapping strata in Wales. That evening Charles told of a tropical shell found in a nearby gravel pit and was impressed when Sedgwick responded that it must have been thrown away there, as it contradicted the known geology of the area. This made him realise \\"that science consists in grouping facts so that general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.\\" Sedgwick aimed to investigate and correct possible errors in George Greenough's geological map of 1820, and to trace the fossil record to the earliest times to rebut the uniformitarian ideas just published by Charles Lyell. On the morning of 5 August they went from Shrewsbury to Llangollen, and on 11 August reached Penrhyn Quarry. After less than a week of doing hard practical work Charles had learnt how to identify specimens, interpret strata and generalise from his observations. Then he went off on his own to collect samples and investigate the Vale of Clwyd, looking in vain for the Old Red Sandstone shown by Greenough. They met up in Colwyn, and Sedgwick's pleasure at the confirmation that the map was incorrect made Darwin \\"exceedingly proud\\". They went on to Capel Curig where Charles struck out on his own across 30 miles (50 km) of \\"some strange wild places\\" to Barmouth. He had parted from Sedgwick by 20 August, and travelled via Ffestiniog. Voyage on the Beagle Arriving at Barmouth on the evening of 23 August, Charles met up with a \\"reading party\\" of Cambridge friends for a time before he left on the morning of 29 August, to go back to Shrewsbury and on to partridge shooting with his Wedgwood relatives at Maer Hall. He was grieved to have received a message that Ramsay had died. This upset Darwin's plans for a visit in the following year to Tenerife. He arrived home at The Mount, Shrewsbury, on 29 August, and found a letter from Henslow. The Cambridge Fellow George Peacock had heard from Francis Beaufort of plans for the second survey voyage of HMS Beagle, and had written to Henslow proposing Leonard Jenyns as \\"a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition\\", or if he was unavailable seeking recommendations for an alternative to take up this \\"glorious opportunity\\". When Jenyns decided not to leave his parish, he and Henslow thought of Darwin. Henslow's letter, read by Peacock and forwarded to Darwin, expected him to eagerly catch at the likely offer of a two-year trip to Terra del Fuego & home by the East Indies, not as \\"a finished Naturalist\\", but as a gentleman \\"amply qualified for collecting, observing, & noting any thing worthy to be noted in Natural History\\". The appointment was more as a companion to Captain Robert FitzRoy, than as a mere collector. Henslow wrote \\"I assure you I think you are the very man they are in search of\\". His father thought the voyage a waste of his son's time and strongly objected. Dejected, Charles declined the offer, and went to Maer for the partridge shooting with a note from his father to \\"Uncle Jos\\" Wedgwood. This contained a prescription for a bowel ailment and a note saying that Charles had quite given up the proposed \\"voyage of discovery\\", but \\"if you think differently from me I shall wish him to follow your advice.\\" Charles' hopes were revived by this unexpected news, and his relatives came out in favour of the voyage. He outlined his father's objections, and sat up that night drafting a reply with his uncle. Jos wrote suggesting that Charles would be likely to \\"acquire and strengthen, habits of application\\", and \\"Natural History... is very suitable to a Clergyman.\\" Though \\"useless as regards his profession\\", for \\"a man of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an opportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few\\". The Admiralty would look after him well, but \\"you & Charles... must decide.\\" Charles begged \\"one favour... a decided answer, yes or no.\\" This reply was sent post-haste early on the morning of 1 September and Charles went shooting. About 10 o'clock he received word from his uncle that they should go to The Mount at once. When they arrived a few hours later, Charles' father had decided that he would give \\"all the assistance in my power\\".

Created by France Herron and Dick Sprang, he made his debut in Detective Comics #184 (June 1952). Initially portrayed as a criminal who utilized lighting effects to commit robberies, Firefly was later re-imagined as a sociopathic pyromaniac with an obsessive compulsion to start fires following Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot of the DC Universe in the 1980s. This darker depiction of the character has since endured as one of the superhero Batman's most recurring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his central rogues gallery. Firefly has been featured in various forms of media, including several shows set within the DC animated universe, The Batman cartoon series, The CW's live-action television series Arrow, and the Batman: Arkham video game franchise. Firefly also appeared as original character Bridgit Pike in the television series Gotham, played by Michelle Veintimilla and Camila Perez. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Garfield Lynns was a down-and-out film special effects expert whose plan to rob a theater by faking a fire was foiled by Batman and Robin. As Lynns fled the scene, Batman mistook a distant firefly for Lynns' lit cigarette and gave chase in the wrong direction. Lynns saw this as a sign of fate and became the Firefly, a costumed criminal who utilized various lighting effects and optical illusions during heists. =Post-Crisis= Following Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot of the DC Universe, Firefly was re-imagined as a much darker and more violent character. After being taken away from their abusive parents, Garfield Lynns and his sister, Amanda, grew up at the St. Evangelina Home for Orphans. Unlike his relatively normal sister, Garfield was a problematic child whom nobody wanted to adopt. As an adult, Lynns became a pyrotechnics and special effects expert in the film industry, but eventually fell victim to Gotham City's severe poverty issues and turned to a life of crime as a result. While he initially only committed arson during his robberies as a hobby, Lynns' compulsion to start fires soon turned into a pyromaniacal obsession as a result of his abusive and troubled childhood; he believed that he could see visions in the flames he created. Lynns then becomes a professional arsonist known as the \\"Firefly\\", and allies himself with fellow supervillain Killer Moth in an attempt to kill Batman and Robin. Their alliance falls apart, however, when Killer Moth realizes the full extent of Firefly's madness and feared for his own well-being. The two villains are then taken into custody. During the Batman: Knightfall storyline, Firefly escapes from Arkham Asylum and attempts to burn all of the places that he lacked the privilege to go to as a child. After successfully destroying a pier and a theater, Firefly is stopped by Batman as he tries to scorch the Gotham Zoo. In his next attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly is horribly scarred when an uncontrollable fire that he starts at a chemical factory causes it to explode; over 90 percent of his body is burned, so he designs a fireproof battle suit to protect himself from his own flames from this point on. During the No Man's Land story arc, Firefly is one of the inmates at Blackgate Penitentiary when it is taken over by Lock-Up. When Nightwing is captured after trying to retake the prison from Lock-Up, Firefly attempts to kill him and wear his skin over his burned body.Nightwing #35‚Äì39 During the DC One Million crisis, Firefly nearly burns down Gotham while infected with the Hourman virus, requiring Nightwing and Robin to work with the future Batman to stop him. Firefly makes a short appearance in the Justice League of America story arc \\"Crisis of Conscience\\"JLA #115‚Äì119 fighting Catwoman in Gotham City over a diamond before Batman arrives. Although an epic battle between the Secret Society and the Justice League ensues, Firefly is knocked unconscious and remains that way during the entire battle. He makes another short appearance in the 2005 miniseries Villains United when the Secret Six attempts to escape the Society's grasp. Firefly is among the numerous heroes and villains apparently murdered by the OMACs in the pages of DC's The OMAC Project, although he later appears alive in Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special and Gotham Underground. Firefly appears with Mr. Freeze facing Batman (though Firefly is wearing the same uniform as the Firefly design of The Batman).Superman/Batman Annual #3 He and Mr. Freeze are again shown as having worked together a month after the events of the Crisis, Batman working with the currently-redeemed Harvey Dent to take them down before he takes his year of absence while leaving Dent to guard Gotham. Following the Final Crisis, Firefly was with Cheetah's Secret Society of Super Villains at the time when Genocide was created. He was defeated by Wonder Woman alongside Shrapnel, Phobia, and T. O. Morrow. Firefly is recruited by a new Black Mask to be a part of a group of villains that are aiming to take over Gotham, but he follows his own agenda. Inspired by the chemicals that Black Mask used on him, Firefly inserts chips into Gothamites in order to make them burn.Batman ‚Äî Streets of Gotham #1 Not long after the identity of the new Black Mask was revealed to be Jeremiah Arkham, Firefly was arrested and put into Arkham Asylum. A short time later Firefly is broken out of Arkham Asylum by Dick Grayson, who has assumed the mantle of Batman, to assist him in gaining access to Sebastian Blackspell's closest friends. Batman (Dick) desires to know what Blackspell's true intentions are in regards to killing the Riddler. Powers and abilities Following Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot of the DC Universe, Firefly's depiction was drastically altered from that of a mere criminal who utilized colored lights and optical illusions to that of a violent sociopath with intense pyromania. Even prior to becoming Firefly, Garfield Lynns was already an expert in pyrotechnics and explosives with a thorough knowledge of flammable agents. After he is horribly scarred by a blaze at a chemical factory, Lynns mechanically engineered an insulated, fireproof battle suit to protect himself. This specialized outfit is equipped with an extensive arsenal of fire-creating weapons, including a military-grade flamethrower, various incendiary devices (such as grenades, napalm, and smoke bombs), and a sword- like blade of superheated plasma for close-ranged hand-to-hand combat. A high- tech, winged jet pack is also mounted on the back of the armor to allow for high-speed flight. Other versions =Smallville Season Eleven= Firefly appears in the Smallville Season Eleven comic. A yellow ring of Parallax finds its way to Lynns and attaches itself to him, transforming him into a powerful Yellow Lantern. However, Firefly's ring is ultimately confiscated by Batman and he is returned to Arkham Asylum. =Flashpoint= In the alternate reality created during Flashpoint, Firefly is seen as a member of Canterbury Cricket's Ambush Bugs, and is killed in battle against the Amazons.Flashpoint: The Canterbury Cricket #1 =Batman: The Brave and the Bold= Firefly appears as one of the villains attacking Batman and Wonder Woman's wedding, during which Lynns battles the Martian Manhunter. =Batman v Superman= Firefly is introduced to the DC Extended Universe via the tie-in prequel comic to the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. When Lynns attempts to bomb a warehouse full of valuables, the vigilante Batman appears and subdues him before leaving him to be apprehended by the police. Lex Luthor ominously watches all this unfold through security footage. Other characters named Firefly =Ted Carson= A man named Ted Carson becomes the second character to adopt the identity of the \\"Firefly\\". Created by Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff, he first appeared in Batman #126. Carson was an ostentatiously wealthy gold mine heir who gambled his family fortune away and subsequently turned to a life of crime as the second Firefly. Carson then goes on a robbery spree before being apprehended by Batman and Batwoman.Batman #126 In The New 52 reboot, Carson is a former high school teacher who tries to incinerate everything that will separate him from his ex-girlfriend Cindy Cooke, though he is ultimately defeated by Nightwing and Batgirl.Nightwing Annual #1 In the DC Rebirth relaunch, Ted Carson and Killer Moth attempt to kill Batman to collect Two-Face's multi-million dollar bounty.All-Star Batman #1 Carson is later seen as one of the many villains that Bane pummels in his quest to reach Batman at Arkham Asylum.Batman (vol. 3) #19 During the gang war between the Joker and the Riddler, Carson is shown siding with the Riddler's faction.Batman Vol. 3 #26 =Bridgit Pike= Ted Carson's prot√©g√© Bridgit Pike (a character introduced in the TV series Gotham) adopts the identity of \\"Lady Firefly\\". She first appeared in Detective Comics #988 (September 2018), and was created by James Robinson and Stephen Segovia. She and Carson are hired by Kobra to kill Batman while he investigates a murder.Detective Comics #988 In other media =Television= Live-action * Andrew Dunbar portrays Garfield Lynns on the television series Arrow, set within The CW's live-action Arrowverse. This version is a former member of the Starling City firefighting unit \\"The Fireflies\\" who was presumably killed during a massive building fire. In the season one episode \\"Burned\\", a disfigured Lynns is revealed to have survived the blaze and lived as a vengeful recluse. After his wife leaves him and takes their children, Lynns dons a firefighter outfit and begins killing the members of his old crew for leaving him to burn. This attracts the attention of hooded vigilante Green Arrow. Despite being defeated by Green Arrow, Firefly commits suicide by walking towards the fires that he started.New Arrow Promo & Villain Confirmed (October 16th, 2012). * A female version of Firefly named Bridgit Pike appears on the Fox crime series Gotham, portrayed by Michelle Veintimilla in season two and the second half of season four, and by Camila Perez in season three and the first half of season four with this appearance predating her debut in the comics. She is the quasi \\"stepsister\\" of arsonists Joe, Cale, and Evan Pike, who have abused her and had her work around their apartment in the Narrows. After Evan was killed by James Gordon and Nathaniel Barnes while buying supplies at the Merc, Bridgit is forced to help Joe and Cale burn down buildings owned by Wayne Enterprises at the behest of Oswald Cobblepot and secretly Theo Galavan. She goes to her old friend Selina Kyle for help and the two rob a brothel so that Bridgit can leave Gotham City. When Joe and Cale kidnap her and threaten her for the last time, Bridgit burns them to death with a flamethrower. During a confrontation with Police Detective James Gordon, a gas leak results in Bridgit accidentally setting herself on fire. After she is brought to Arkham Asylum's Indian Hill facility, where Professor Hugo Strange heals her and gives her a new fireproof suit, Bridgit becomes the show's iteration of Firefly. She later shows up when Selina breaks into Arkham after being told by Bruce Wayne that she was transported to Indian Hill, but Bridget has lost her memories and believes she's the \\"Goddess of Fire.\\" Selina though convinces her to let her become her servant and the 2 plan to escape from Indian Hill but are stopped by Mr. Freeze, resulting in a showdown between Firefly and Freeze, which ends when Strange gets caught in the crossfire. Bridget then escapes the facility before it explodes. She then appears in Season 3, with her memories restored and working at a metal refinery before Penguin and Ivy Pepper convince her and Freeze to join them in taking back Penguin's empire from Riddler. She and Penguin later thwart the Court of Owls' attempt to blow up the First Bank of Gotham. In Season 4, she and Freeze remain working for Penguin, acting as his enforcers to enforce his new licensing system. When Penguin finds out that Riddler is performing a clown show about him, he sends the Sirens down to Cherry's fight club to bring him in and sends Bridget to watch over them, but she was knocked out by Lee Thompkins. She later shows up as a member of Jerome Valeska's team, the \\"Legion of Horribles,\\" along with Penguin, Freeze, Jervis Tetch, Jonathan Crane and Butch Gilzean to carry out Jerome's plan of unleashing Scarecrow's fear toxin over Gotham. She later helped Jerome track down the proxy of Xander Wilde before she, along with the rest of the Legion, then helped Jerome kidnap the Mayor and his staff as hostages. Lucius Fox though manages to defuse the bombs on the Mayor and his staff, allowing Bruce to take down Bridget. In the season finale, after Jeremiah blows up all of the city's bridges and Gotham is declared a \\"no man's land,\\" Bridget and her gang claim the Bowery. In Season 5, it's mentioned that her gang is at war with Freeze's gang, which occupies Burnley.

The word Wiener is German for Viennese. In Austria the term \\"Wiener\\" is uncommon for this food item, which instead is usually called Frankfurter W√ºrstl. The ingredients, preparation, size and taste can vary widely by both manufacturer and region of sale. Europe In some European countries, cooked and often smoked wiener sausages bought fresh from supermarkets, delicatessens and butcher shops may be called by a name (such as in German or French) which translates in English as \\"Vienna sausage\\". Traditionally, they are made from spiced ham, but in Eastern and Southern Europe chicken and/or turkey filled frankfurters are more common. Wieners sold as Vienna sausage in Europe have a taste and texture very much like North American \\"hot dogs\\" or \\"frankfurters\\", but are usually longer and somewhat thinner, with a very light, edible casing. European Vienna sausage served hot in a long bun (kipfel) with condiments is often called a \\"hot dog\\", referring not to the wiener itself, but to the long sandwich as a whole. In Norway wiener sausages are typically served in a lefse lompe. North America After having been brought to North America by European immigrants, \\"Vienna sausage\\" came to mean only smaller and much shorter smoked and canned wieners, rather than link sausage, beginning about 1903. However, they have no federal standard of identity. North American vienna sausages are made similarly to pork wieners, finely ground to a paste consistency and mixed with salt and various spices, such as cloves, coriander, nutmeg, garlic powder, onion powder and finely ground, dry red pepper. The sausages are stuffed into a long casing, sometimes smoked, always thoroughly cooked and beginning in the 1950s, the casings were removed. The sausages are then cut into short segments for canning and further cooking. They are available plain (in a gelatin, similar to aspic) or with a variety of flavorings, such as smoke, mustard, chili or barbecue sauces. Consumption of Vienna sausages peaked in the 1940s to 1970s, but has declined since then.

He did not run in the final anyway, as he was busy assisting Albin Lermusiaux in conducting the marathon race. At those Games, besides running, Reichel also worked as a journalist for the French magazine V√©lo. At the 1900 Olympics Reichel competed in rugby and won a gold medal with the French team. He was later selected as the captain of the French rugby team in an international match in 1906. Reichel was a highly respected rugby player in France, and after his death a championship for young rugby players, Championnat Reichel, was established in his honour. Later in life Reichel became a sports administrator and the secretary general of the USFSA. He also founded the French Boxing Federation and the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Hockey (FIH), serving as its president from 1926 to 1932. He was also a member of the French National Olympic and Sports Committee and headed the organizing committee of the 1924 Paris Olympics. Reichel remained active as a journalist, and became the first European journalist to fly an airplane, assisting Wilbur Wright in his distance record for flights with a passenger. He co-founded the Association Internationale de la Presse Sportive (International Sports Press Association) and served as its first president from 1924 until his death in 1932.

Hatch Memorial Shell (commonly referred to as the \\"Hatch Shell\\") is an outdoor concert venue on the Charles River Esplanade in the Back Bay section of Boston, Massachusetts. Built in 1939-40, it is one of the city's prominent examples of Art Deco architecture. The Hatch Shell is best known for hosting the Boston Pops Orchestra annually for the Boston Fourth of July celebration, but is also used for free concerts most weekends and many weeknights during the summer months. The grass pavilion in front of the stage has no permanent seating. There is a memorial nearby to Arthur Fiedler, first permanent conductor of the Pops. Name The Hatch Shell is named in memory of Edward Hatch, the descendant of a family with deep roots in colonial Massachusetts and a fortune made in foreign trade. Hatch died in 1910, and his sister Maria died without issue in 1926, leaving a substantial portion of her estate in a trust which was to be used for \\"a park, playground or memorial\\" in or near Boston that would be \\"open to the public at such times and under such circumstances as may from time to time best minister to the public need for a beauty spot.\\" The executor of Maria Hatch's estate died before the terms of the trust could be executed, and it remained undiscovered until 1936, when Massachusetts Attorney General Paul A. Dever discovered it and instituted probate action to complete its terms. New trustees, selected by the court, determined that a permanent concert shell on the Charles River Esplanade would satisfy the terms of the trust. History The original, wooden shell was built in 1928 as a temporary venue for the Pops with expectations of construction of a permanent structure in the near future. It was first used for a concert on July 4, 1929, with Arthur Fiedler conducting the Boston Pops Orchestra. A second, temporary shell, made of metal, was built in 1934. The permanent shell was designed by architect Richard J. Shaw, and was dedicated on July 2, 1940. In preparation for its 50th anniversary in 1991, it underwent significant renovation and repair along with modernization of its acoustics by Boston architecture firm Finegold Alexander. Bostonian Howard Brickman, a master craftsman specializing in wood floors, re-created the intricate interior paneling of the shell by hand. An bronze statue of George S. Patton, by James Earle Fraser, commemorates the general's June 7, 1945 address at the site before a crowd of 20,000 persons.Blumenson, Martin (1974), The Patton Papers: 1940‚Äì1945, Boston, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin, Uses of the Hatch Shell include concerts, movie showings and speeches, and as a meeting place for large events, such as AIDS Walk Boston and the Larry Kessler 5K Run. The grass pavilion is used for picnics, casual sports and sunbathing, in a manner typical of urban parks. The Hatch Shell underwent a $2.4 million renovation in 2018, the first since 1989. The exterior panels of the shell were replaced, which required a laser scan of the shell and fabrication of 673 separate panels in 93 different shapes. Architecture The Hatch Shell is a wood frame structure with a semicircular arched opening that is high and wide. It is fronted by a stone platform with stairs that extend the structure's width to . On the front of this platform are engraved the names of famous (at least through the period of its construction) composers. The exterior of the shell is finished in terrazzo tile, and the interior is finished in wood. The interior floor consists of stepped tiers in semicircular form. The outside of the shell is ringed by a single-story flat-roof structure housing dressing rooms and storage facilities for performers. :Front ::Half left :::PUCCINI SULLIVAN STRAUSS SCHUMANN LOEFFLER MACDOWELL FOSTER DEBUSSY BEACH HERBERT GLUCK CHOPIN RAVEL WAGNER WEBER RIMSKY-KORSAKOV VERDI HAYDN MONTEVERDI DVORAK LISZT BEETHOVEN ::Half right :::BACH PALESTRINA MUSSORGSKY FOOTE HANDEL MENDELSSOHN GRIEG GERSCHWIN MOZART TCHAIKOVSKY BIZET CHADWICK WILLIAMS BRAHMS FRANCK SAINT-SAENS ROSSINI SCHUBERT BERLIOZ OFFENBACH GOUNOD :Rear :::COUPERIN DINDY ELGAR DELIBES WOLF BUXTEHUDE BYRD CORELLI LASSO SCARLATTI VIVALDI BOCCHERINI CHERUBINI GRETRY LULLY BORODIN BRUCKNER CHABRIER SMETANA DUKAS FAURE GLAZUNOV RESPIGHI ROUSSEL SCRIABIN BELLINI DONIZETTI HUMPERDINCK LEONCAVALLO MASSENET MEYERBEER GILBERT GRIFFES HADLEY MASON ALBENIZ AUBER RUBINSTEIN STRAVINSKY SIBELIUS RAMEAU PURCELL MAHLER SOUSA PAINE References * Martha Burnham Humphrey, The Edward Hatch Memorial Shell: Richard Shaw, architect, William R.

It provides opportunities for children and young people across Wales to take part in a range of experiences through the medium of Welsh. Urdd Gobaith Cymru also has 5 residential centres for children and young people across Wales. The main aim is to ensure that all young people in Wales are given the opportunity, through the medium of Welsh, to play a constructive role in the community, developing personal and social skills'. Up till 2019, 4 million children and young people have engaged with the Urdd in one form or another. The Urdd National Eisteddfod (Welsh: Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Urdd Gobaith Cymru or Eisteddfod Genedlaethol yr Urdd) is an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts organised by Urdd Gobaith Cymru. Arguably Europe's largest youth festival, it is usually held during the last week of May, coinciding with schools' half term holiday. History Urdd Gobaith Cymru was established by Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards in 1922. His aim was to protect the Welsh language in a world where the English language dominated every aspect of life outside the home. In an issue of the magazine ‚ÄòCymru‚Äôr Plant‚Äô in 1922 Sir Ifan said, \\"These days, in many villages, and in most towns in Wales, children play and read in English. They forget that they are Welsh.\\" He appealed to the children of Wales to join a new organization that offered opportunities through the medium of Welsh, and as a result, Urdd Gobaith Cymru was established. Nearly a century later, Urdd Gobaith Cymru, the main youth organization in Wales, has over 56,000 members, belonging to over 900 branches who take part in a wide range of activities. The work is carried out with the help of 260 staff and 10,000 volunteers. The Chief Executive appointed in 2015 to take the movement forward to the 2022 centenary left in 2017 after Trustees took action following the expression of a lack of faith in her ability by staff. The current Chief Executive of Urdd Gobaith Cymru is Sian Lewis.  Eisteddfod yr Urdd  The Urdd National Eisteddfod (Welsh: Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Urdd Gobaith Cymru or Eisteddfod Genedlaethol yr Urdd) is an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts organised by Urdd Gobaith Cymru. Arguably Europe's largest youth festival, it is usually held during the last week of May, coinciding with schools' half term holiday. Locations alternate between north and south Wales. The Eisteddfod consists of competitive singing, recitation, art, composition, dance and instrumental events for contestants aged between 7 and 24 years. Regional qualifying heats are held in advance around Wales, as occurs for the National Eisteddfod. In 2019, the Eisteddfod yr Urdd was held in Cardiff Bay. In 2020, it was planned to be held in Denbigh but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sports Mistar Urdd (Mr Urdd) is the personification of the triangular red, white and green logo of Urdd Gobaith Cymru. The Urdd's Sports Department hosts a wide range of community sports clubs and national sporting events for children and young people through the medium of Welsh. In 2019 boys were banned at short notice from participating in netball at the Urdd National Sports Festival. The Sports Department, supported by Sport Wales, now employs 20 staff and trains over 1,000 volunteers annually. This has enabled the organisation to offer regular activities for children and young people, with 150 sports clubs held weekly across the country, and over 11,000 children attending.  Residential Centres  They have said that 47,000 people have visited the Urdd Camps annually. In 2018, over 2 million young people have attending one or more of the Urdd residential Centres. The aim of the centres is to create spaces that offer opportunities for children, young people and adults to live, teach and socialize in a safe and welcoming Welsh environment. In 2019 ¬£5.5 million was allocated to Glan-Llyn and Llangrannog by the Welsh Government to develop the centres. The Urdd offers residential experiences through its 5 residential centres: * Gwersyll Llangrannog, Ceredigion, providing recreational activities, including horse riding and skiing * Gwersyll Glan-llyn, near Bala, Gwynedd, offering water sports; * Gwersyll Caerdydd located in Cardiff Bay * Pentre Ifan, Pembrokeshire, a centre for environmental and wellbeing experiences; * T≈∑ Kisbodak H√°z in Hungary offers young people of Wales an international experience.

Products based on this setting include novels, graphic novels, a role-playing game (RPG), board game, and video games. The setting was active from 1988 until 1995. History Buck Rogers is a fictional character created in 1928 by Philip Francis Nowlan. A Buck Rogers comic strip written by Nowlan was syndicated by John F. Dille (who may have contributed the nickname \\"Buck\\" to the character). Ownership of Buck Rogers and other works passed into the hands of the Dille Family Trust. In the 1980s, John Dille's granddaughter, Lorraine Williams, was the president of TSR. In that decade, business for TSR was booming, mainly as a result of their popular RPG, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. Lorraine Williams decided to merge Buck Rogers and D&D; to make the XXVc game setting. First, a board game came out in 1988, later followed by a role-playing game in 1990. The latter was based on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Second Edition rules, but there are some small differences. It was a new incarnation of the Buck Rogers world created by Williams' brother, Flint Dille. Its universe was limited to the solar system, and revolved heavily around interplanetary travel and terraforming. A few dozen expansion modules were published, as well as a line of novels and graphic novels. The company TSR owned Advanced Dungeons and Dragons at the time and had worked with SSI on a computerized version of the rules. SSI developed their \\"Gold Box\\" game engine for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, so it was natural for them to use the engine for the XXVc rules. Setting =History= The setting of XXVC is a possible future of the real universe that we live in. In the year 1999, the Soviet Union and the United States are involved in the \\"Last Gasp War.\\" This is the world's first nuclear war. This war causes many governments of Earth to abandon conventional warfare and embrace large alliances. Three of these alliances that grow to be superpowers are the Russo-American Mercantile (\\"RAM\\"), the Indo-Asian Consortium (\\"IAC\\"), and the Euro-Bloc Faction (\\"EBF\\"). In the latter half of the 21st century, these three alliances jointly form the System States Alliance (\\"SSA\\") for the purposes of exploring and colonizing the solar system. Slowly, the SSA begins to terraform the inner planets. Mars is colonized by RAM, Luna is colonized by EBF, and Venus is controlled by IAC. The main method of interplanetary travel from this time onward is the rocket ship. These vessels use fusion reactions to power the ship throughout its entire voyage. Rocket ships usually can range from 5 to 500 tons. In the year 2275, RAM revolts against Earth and gains independence. Furthermore, because of Earth's dependence on the other planets for resources, RAM begins to dominate Earth. In 2310, refugees from Earth begin to colonize Mercury. In the next century, the asteroid belt and Jupiter begin to be settled. Human DNA is modified with genes from various animals, resulting in genetically modified humans commonly known as \\"gennies.\\" These play a role in the settlement of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and also of many asteroids and moons. In the first half of the 25th century, certain Terrans (inhabitants of Earth) form the New Earth Organization (\\"NEO\\"). This society plans to rebel against the rule of RAM and restore Earth to its former glory. After the revival of Buck Rogers, NEO is strengthened by alliances with other governments and space pirates. NEO is able to repel the occupation by RAM and fend off the ensuing large-scale attack by RAM. Most of the XXVC material takes place in the time from 2430 until 2460. =Buck Rogers= Like all other versions of the Buck Rogers universe, one central story is that of Anthony \\"Buck\\" Rogers. In this case, Buck is the pilot of an experimental spacecraft for the American government in 1999. Buck is sent into space to destroy \\"MasterLink\\" - a heavily defended satellite that acts as the hub of the Soviet war machine. The MasterLink satellite is primarily controlled by an eponymous artificial intelligence, but as an experimental system, it is supplemented by a Soviet cosmonaut named \\"Karkov\\" - who coincidentally murdered Rogers' parents years before while they were flying in a commercial jet the Soviet Union declared a spy craft. The battle ends badly for both combatants; the Masterlink satellite is neutralized (but not destroyed), and Karkov dies from space exposure. Masterlink integrates Karkov's mind into its program before he dies. Rogers survives the battle, but his own ship has taken too much damage to make atmospheric reentry. Instead, he utilizes an experimental cryogenic system to await recovery. However, the \\"Last Gasp War\\" begins before a rescue can be attempted, and his preserved form is left drifting in space for the next five centuries. In the year 2456, Rogers's spacecraft is discovered, and a number of factions race to recover it for various unrelated reasons. He is ultimately recovered by a civilian researcher who brings him out of cryogenic stasis, resurrecting the 20th century hero. Rogers, upon discovering what Earth has suffered in his absence, joins NEO, a resistance movement fighting to liberate Earth from its absentee landlord, RAM. His expertise, dedication and symbolic value ultimately prove to be the key to NEO's defeat of RAM. =Planets and other bodies= *Mercury was colonized by refugees from Earth after the revolt of RAM. There are three main groups of people on Mercury. The \\"Sun Kings\\" build giant mariposas to harvest light from the Sun. They then resell this energy to other planets and deliver the energy by RF beams. Miners occupy underground warrens where they excavate metals from the planet. Others occupy \\"track cities,\\" large vehicles that travel the surface of the planet and stay precisely on the terminator to keep the temperature bearable. *Venus was settled early on by the IAC. There are a few factions of Venusians on the planet. Its dominant faction, the Ishtarians, is of Asian descent and formed a religious society. The people of Aphrodite are organised in merchant clans. Both live on major plateaus rising above the planet's surface, where regular human life is impossible due to environmental extremes and acid rains. This is where the Lowlanders dwell, humanoids with reptilian features. For a major portion of its history, Venus had a peace treaty with Mars. This was a major reason that RAM was able to conquer Earth. *Earth is populated by the Terrans, or natives of Earth. The condition of Earth is very bad compared to the other inner planets. Due to centuries of exploitation by RAM, many natural resources are spent, cities are demolished, and hopes are crushed. Advanced technology is confined to independent arcologies, but also several communities try to reestablish a more civilized order as well - the so-called \\"orgs\\" like Los Angelorg, Chicagorg, etc. In orbit around Earth are many satellites, especially at the Lagrange points of Luna's orbit; these L-5 colonies are teeming slums. *Luna, or Earth's moon, was settled by the EBF. They deal extensively with interplanetary banking and trade. The Lunarians are staunchly neutral. They defend this position with large mass drivers mounted on the surface of the moon. *Mars was settled by RAM as the first colonization of another planet by humans. Mars is a center of trade and industry for the entire solar system. RAM has such tight control over the workings of the planet that the names \\"RAM\\" and \\"Mars\\" are used almost interchangeably. RAM wields power throughout the whole solar system, as demonstrated by their financial investments, military presence, and political clout on almost all the other planets and bodies. *The Asteroid Belt is a loosely organized collection of settlements. Their inhabitants are commonly known as \\"Belters.\\" The belt contains space ports and cities that deal in mining, trade, and certain illegal business. The asteroid belt is the home of the Black Brotherhood. *Jupiter is already a remote location in the outer solar system. Since it is a gas giant, it is unable to be terraformed by existing methods. A race of extremely genetically modified humanoids, the Stormriders, inhabit its outer atmosphere in floating cities. The large number of Jovian moons make it a good site for industry, crime, and secret bases of all sorts. *Saturn is similar to Jupiter in all respects, except that its outer atmosphere is uninhabited. All activity in the Saturnian system is focused on its moons, and also somewhat on the rings. *Uranus hosts a remote outpost. *Pluto and Charon are uninhabited in the conventional sense. Existing there, however, is a colony of nanotechnical organisms evolved from an early Earth-based experiment. These organisms eventually invade the inner planets but are stopped through cooperation of the normally opposed forces of the inner planets. =Organizations= *The Russo-American Mercantile, or \\"RAM\\", occupies Mars, and is the largest superpower in the solar system. In the 25th century, RAM is headed by Simund Holzerhein, a very wealthy Martian who was rich enough to afford the process of downloading his consciousness into a computer, turning him into a \\"digital personality.\\" From within the central computers of RAM, Holzerhein can rule with the benefits of the information around him. Those within RAM are either born into a high position or have worked up from the bottom to no higher than middle management. Though most RAM employees consider themselves to be good, much of the solar system considers the organization to be corrupt and evil. Notable members of RAM are the above- mentioned Simund Holzerhein, his niece Ardala Valmar, and 'Killer' Kane. *The New Earth Organization, or \\"NEO\\", seeks to rebuild Earth and return order and prosperity to it. Until it was conquered by RAM, Earth was the dominant planet in the solar system. It is this former glory that drives NEO. Most NEO members use nicknames recalling the former glory of Earth, such as Beowulf or Washington. NEO uses as its headquarters a secret base, Salvation III Station. Salvation is hidden inside a junkyard satellite in a Lagrange point in orbit around Earth. Some notable members of NEO are Buck Rogers, Beowulf (the leader of NEO), Wilma Deering, Elias Huer, now an AI called HuerDOS (cf. McCoy Pauley from Neuromancer), and Carlton Turabian (who runs Salvation Station). *The Black Brotherhood is a band of space pirates that raids vessels throughout the solar system. They call the asteroid belt their home. During the 25th century, Black Barney is the Brotherhood's leader. =Computer Games= These two games were developed and published by SSI for various platforms and are entirely unrelated to Sega's 1982 Buck Rogers video game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. * Buck Rogers XXVc SF Computer RPG, Volume I: Countdown to Doomsday (Sep 1990, 16685-04135; Amiga, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, Sega Genesis.) * Buck Rogers XXVc SF Computer RPG, Volume II: Matrix Cubed (Jan 1992, 16685-04154; MS-DOS.) =Board Games= The Buck Rogers Battle for the XXVth Century board game (TSR, Jun 1988, ) was a strategy game, designed by Jeff Grub, similar to Axis and Allies or Risk. Players maneuvered soldiers, ships, and gennies on a board representing the solar system. During the game, the planets moved, changing the relative distances of the various planets and their moons. In the advanced game, each player's leader character, based on a personage from the setting, had a unique special ability, and the gennies could be assigned special abilities based on their home planet. Following lackluster response, TSR decided to try again with a more conventional table-top RPG, this time based on the original 1928 Philip Francis Nowlan novel Armageddon, 2419 A.D. (Ace, Aug 1978, ) and subsequent 1929 comic strip continuity, in which resurgent tribal Americans overthrow their Red Mongol conquerors. The basic game was called the High Adventure Cliffhangers Buck Rogers Adventure Game (Sep 1993, ) and was co-designed by Jeff Grubb and Steven Schend. The High Adventure Cliffhangers Buck Rogers War Against The Han Campaign Supplement (Dec 1993, ) was designed by Steven Schend alone. Although published by TSR as a licensed Buck Rogers property, this game is unconnected with the XXVC universe.

The town is an architectural reserve and 96 of its buildings are cultural monuments. With a population of 385, it is the smallest town in Bulgaria, retaining its town status today for historical reasons. It is situated on the foothills of the Pirin mountain range and is overlooked by the Melnik Earth Pyramids. History According to archaeological evidence, the first to settle in the area were the Thracian tribe Medi to which the famous rebel Spartacus belonged. Centuries later, the presence of the Romans left the town one of its landmarks ‚Äî the Ancient Roman bridge, which is still preserved. The Slavs who later came in these parts named the settlement Melnik after the sand formations surrounding it on all sides (the Bulgarian word –º–µ–ª mel means \\"white clay, chalk\\"). Melnik became a part of the First Bulgarian Empire under the rule of Khan Presian I (836-852) and prospered greatly in the period. Melnik became the capital of an independent feudal principality ruled by Despot Alexius Slav, a descendant of the Asen dynasty, in 1209, and passed through an economic and cultural upsurge during his reign. The town continued to flourish under Tsar Ivan Asen II because of the duty-free trade with Venetian-ruled Dubrovnik. Plan of the medieval fortress The Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 14th-15th century resulted in a long period of decline, but Melnik was once again a thriving town in the 17th and 18th century, the time of the Bulgarian National Revival, due to the tobacco and wine production, with wine being exported abroad, mainly to England and Austria. In that time Melnik was also a centre of craftsmanship, particularly church decoration and woodcarving. Many Bulgarian schools and churches were built in Melnik in that period. A Greek school of Melnik Melnik was taken by the Imperial Russian Army during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, but was given back to the Ottoman Empire according to the Treaty of Berlin. The town was the centre of a kaza in the Sanjak of Siroz as Menlik (or , Meleniko) until 1912. During the First Balkan War, Melnik was ultimately liberated and became once again part of Bulgaria. In the late 18th century, the town had 1300 houses, seventy churches and a population of some 20,000 people, but a fire largely destroyed it. Since then it has been restored and rebuilt, and still, the current population of 400 is nowhere near the one from the beginning of the 20th century, when it primarily consisted of Greeks, but also of Bulgarians, Turks, Vlachs and Romani.Editors Maria Couroucli, Tchavdar Marinov, Balkan Heritages: Negotiating History and Culture, Volume 1 of British School at Athens - Modern Greek and Byzantine Studies, Taylor & Francis, 2017, , p. 83. Melnik is the subject of Yuri Trifonov's short story \\"The Smallest Town on Earth\\" (1967). According to the statistics of Vasil Kanchov (\\"Macedonia, Ethnography and Statistics\\"), Melnik used to have 2.650 Greek Christian, 950 Turkish, 500 Bulgarian Christian, 200 Romani and 30 Vlach inhabitants in 1900.Kanchov, Vasil, , Sofia, 1900, book 2, p. 18. Written as \\"–ú–µ–ª–Ω–∏–∫—ä\\". (in Bulgarian) At the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913, the Greeks left Melnik and moved to Greece by the express orders of the Greek government; the order being given when it was known that Melnik was to be ceded to Bulgaria., pp. 202-204 According to Bulgarian claims submitted to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, some Bulgarian shops and houses were looted by retreating Greeks. The Greek population moved primarily to Sidirokastro and fewer settled in Serres and Thessaloniki. Climate Melnik has a Mediterranean climate with hot summers and cool winters. Climate table: Sights and winemaking The unique architecture of Melnik and the nearby Rozhen Monastery (located 6 km northeast of Melnik) make it a popular tourist destination. In addition, the town has been famous for producing strong wine since at least 1346. The local wine from the varietal Broad Leave Melnik Vine was reportedly a favourite of Winston Churchill's. Lately, the area of Melnik is enjoying a revival of vine growing and wine making. Several new, modern wineries have been built and operate (Villa Melnik Winery, Sintica Winery, Orbelus, etc.), producing high quality wine from local and international varieties. Interesting architectural landmarks include the Byzantine House, one of the oldest civilian buildings in the Balkans (built probably in the 12th or 13th century as a Bulgarian fortress), the Kordopulov House (named after the merchant Manolis Kordopulou to whom it once belonged), which also has one of the largest wine cellars in Melnik, the Pashov House (1815), which houses the Historical Museum of Melnik and the Pasha's House, built by Ibrahim Bey, one of the richest beys in the region, during Ottoman rule. Some of the old churches in the town worth visiting are St Nicholas (built in the 13th century), SS Peter and Paul (1840), St Nicholas the Thaumaturge (1756) and St Anthony. The area around Melnik is strikingly eroded, particularly the enormous area of cliff that serves as a backdrop to the town. This area, covering some 17 km¬≤ near Melnik, Kurlanovo and Rozhen, has been called the Melnik Earth Pyramids or Melnik Badlands. The hills in this area can rise up to high. The unique formations, which can resemble giant mushrooms, ancient towers, and obelisks, were formed when heavy rain eroded the sand and clay the hills are composed of.

McGovern was a CIA analyst from 1963 to 1990, and in the 1980s chaired National Intelligence Estimates and prepared the President's Daily Brief. He received the Intelligence Commendation Medal at his retirement, returning it in 2006 to protest the CIA's involvement in torture. McGovern's post-retirement work includes commenting for Consortium News, RT, and Sputnik News, among other outlets, on intelligence and foreign policy issues. In 2003 he co-founded Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS). Personal life Ray McGovern was born and grew up in the Bronx, New York City. With a scholarship he earned a M.A. with honours in Russian Language, Literature and History at Fordham University, and in the early 1960s served as a U.S. Army infantry intelligence officer in the analysis division on Soviet foreign policy, especially with respect to China and Indochina. McGovern is married to Rita Kennedy; the couple have five children and eight grandchildren.  Career  McGovern was a CIA analyst for 27 years (April 1963 to August 1990), serving seven U.S. presidents.Dan Chapman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 7 December 2003, Q & A / Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst: 'We're trying to spread a little truth' His CIA career began under President John F. Kennedy, and lasted through the presidency of George H. W. Bush.Die Tageszeitung, 30 October 2013, ‚ÄûObamas Angst vor Geheimdiensten‚Äú McGovern chaired National Intelligence Estimates and prepared the President's Daily Brief, and in the mid-1980s was a senior analyst conducting early-morning briefings one-on-one with the Vice President, the Secretaries of State and Defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the assistant to the president for national security.Donald P. Russo, The Morning Call, 13 May 2006, No shortage of evidence that Bush is slipping At his retirement in 1990, McGovern received the CIA's Intelligence Commendation Medal. He returned the medal in 2006. Activism =Intelligence activism= McGovern, 2008 After retiring from the CIA, McGovern became a commentator on intelligence-related issues from the late 1990s onwards.Ray McGovern, \\"How lies replaced intelligence at the CIA,\\" Boston Globe (7 October 1999) p. A 27; Ray McGovern, \\"Protecting the homeland: Don't jeopardize intelligence links,\\" Christian Science Monitor (15 July 2002) p.9. He was heavily critical of the government's handling of the Wen Ho Lee case in 2000.Ray McGovern, \\"Unequal in the eyes of justice?,\\" Christian Science Monitor (18 September 2000) p. 11. In 2002, he was publicly critical of President George W. Bush's use of government intelligence in the lead-up to the war in Iraq.Ray McGovern, \\"The best intelligence? CIA.\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (22 November 2002) p. 19A; Ray McGovern, \\"How Intelligence Now Serves the Defense Department,\\" Boston Globe (29 September 2002) p. D11. In 2003, together with other former CIA employees, McGovern founded the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS). The organization is dedicated to analyzing and criticizing the use of intelligence, at first concerning the Iraq War. In the same year, McGovern confronted Donald Rumsfeld openly and live-broadcast by CNN interrogating him about his lies concerning weapons of mass destruction, a dispute later called the \\"vivisection of Donald Rumsfeld\\" by Keith Olbermann. In January 2006, McGovern began speaking out on behalf of the anti-war group Not in Our Name. According to the group's press release, McGovern served symbolic \\"war crimes indictments\\" on the Bush White House from a \\"people's tribunal.\\" In 2006, McGovern returned his Intelligence Commendation Medal in protest at the CIA's involvement in torture.Ambika Behal, United Press International, 10 March 2006, The U.S. has run amok; former CIA analyst He commented, corruption had run amok in intelligence circles and the president should be impeached. On October 9, 2013, McGovern, along with three former winners, gave the Sam Adams Award for integrity in intelligence to Edward Snowden in a Moscow ceremony. In September 2015, McGovern and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to president Barack Obama challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the CIA's use of torture. = Arrests = During a 2011 speech at George Washington University (GW) by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, McGovern stood with his back turned during her remarks, blocking the view of some of the audience and media for about five minutes in \\"silent protest\\" of Clinton's foreign policy. McGovern refused to cooperate when asked to leave by security, which led to his arrest for disorderly conduct. The incident led to his inclusion on the State Department's \\"be on the lookout\\" (BOLO) list, which authorizes law enforcement to stop and question him on sight. The charges were subsequently dropped two weeks later. In 2014, McGovern's lawyer filed a lawsuit against the GW police department for allegedly using excessive force and also against the university and State Department for allegedly violating his right to peacefully protest. In 2014, McGovern was arrested by the New York City police department at an event where former CIA director and retired Army General David Petraeus was giving a speech. McGovern said he wanted to ask Petraeus about his involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but security told him he was not welcome. He claimed he had a ticket to the event, but was charged for resisting arrest and criminal trespassing. On May 9, 2018, McGovern was one of several protesters who disrupted the Senate confirmation hearing of Gina Haspel to become CIA director. After he began yelling about waterboarding, McGovern was forcibly removed by Capitol Police and charged with disruption and resisting arrest.  Views  = Vietnam War = The CIA knew about the flimsy evidence of a second attack in the Gulf of Tonkin incident. The CIA was ordered by a deputy director not to inform the congress, and McGeorge Bundy, by his own admission, was obliged to sign the official declaration of the LBJ administration. According to Ray McGovern the CIA advised LBJ strongly against the proposals of Air Force generals to bomb the Ho Chi Minh trail which the CIA knew was not suitable for block transport of weapons and movement of troops on the 160 trails into South Vietnam and not able to weaken the North Vietnamese communists' resistance. = Pope John Paul II = A Catholic from birth, McGovern was highly critical of Pope John Paul II conservative stance on women's rights in church. He saw the former Pope as a repressive force. McGovern had been teaching Sunday school and earned a certificate in theology from Georgetown University. He participated in Cursillo, and was district president of Bread for the City, but by standing during mass for several weeks he protested against the teaching on sex roles and sexual ethics which to him seemed oppressive. = Iraq War = In a television interview with Tucker Carlson on MSNBC in 2006, McGovern said: \\"I've been using the acronym O.I.L. for many‚Äîfor two years now: O for oil; I for Israel; and L for logistics, logistics being the permanent‚Äînow we say \\"enduring\\"‚Äîmilitary bases that the U.S. wants to keep in Iraq.\\" McGovern testified at a Democratic National Headquarters forum in 2005 that had been convened by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) of the House Judiciary Committee on the Downing Street memo. The Washington Post reported in 2005 that, in his testimony, McGovern \\"declared that the United States went to war in Iraq for oil, Israel and military bases craved by administration neocons so 'the United States and Israel could dominate that part of the world.'\\" He said that Israel should not be considered an ally and that Bush was doing the bidding of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 'Israel is not allowed to be brought up in polite conversation,' McGovern said. Genuine criticism of official Israeli policy is often portrayed as if it were anti-semitism: 'The last time I did this, the previous director of Central Intelligence called me anti-semitic.'\\" =Julian Assange and WikiLeaks= When asked on TVNZ whether Julian Assange was a hero or villain, he replied \\"hero,\\" and has co-written an open letter of support for WikiLeaks and Assange. When asked whether Julian Assange was a journalist, he replied \\"Yeah, actually, with all due respect, I think you should be following his example,\\" to the CNN reporter. = Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election = McGovern holds a position that the theft of the DNC emails was an inside job, and not the work of Russian agents (contrary to the findings published by the US intelligence community). In his view, the metadata in the files released by Guccifer 2.0 (whom the US intelligence community identifies as a Russian military intelligence operation) has been manipulated to show that the documents came from Russia, where in fact according to this theory they originated from a computer in the Eastern United States. McGovern subsequently released a VIPS report in support of his theory. Many of the VIPS members however, did not sign the report and expressed a view that the inside job theory itself is a disinformation campaign run by a pro-Kremlin hacker Tim Leonard who lives in the UK. The theory expressed by McGovern and others was contrary to official findings from the CIA. =Russia related activities= The Conservative Review in March 2018 described McGovern, as \\"an anti-war activist except when it comes to any kinetic activity that Russia engages in. For someone who claims to be a peace activist, McGovern remains entirely committed to promoting a pro-Moscow foreign policy narrative in Europe, the Middle East, and in U.S.-Russia relations\\".

Her father, Joseph Perelman, was a textile official; her mother, Dorothy Shapiro Perelman, was a public schoolteacher. Rossner wanted to be a writer, even before she could read or write, and dictated poems and stories to her \\"warmly supportive\\" mother.

Ross; two of his titles are Requiem for a School Girl (1960) and Teacher's Blood (1964). The couple had two children, Jean (born 1960) and Daniel (born 1965). Robert Rossner taught Creative Writing at the Bronx High School of Science.

She gave up a job at Scientific American because her interest in the work interfered with her writing. She went to work instead in a real estate office (where she was \\"bored out of [her] mind\\" and finished her first novel, To the Precipice.

Rossner went to work as a secretary in a methadone clinic to support herself and her children. Looking for Mr. Goodbar, 1973‚Äì1977 By the mid-1970s, Rossner was a writer of \\"impeccable literary credentials,\\" but her three novels had not sold well. Following Any Minute I Can Split, Rossner began a novel about two women who marry conjoined twins. In the meantime, Nora Ephron, who was editing a women's issue of Esquire, invited Rossner to participate. Rossner, who had been recovering from a car accident, had become interested in the true story of Roseann Quinn, a 28-year-old schoolteacher who had been brutally murdered in January 1973 by a man she had reportedly picked up in a singles bar. Rossner wrote an article about Quinn, but Esquire declined to publish it, fearing legal ramifications. Rossner, who considered herself a \\"lousy journalist,\\" decided to write the story as a novel. On June 2, 1975, Simon & Schuster published Looking for Mr. Goodbar, the graphic story of Theresa Dunn, a damaged young woman who teaches children by day and cruises singles bars by night. After picking up a man at Mr. Goodbar, she is brutally murdered in her own bed. The book was an enormous critical and commercial success, selling some 4 million copies. It spent 36 weeks on the New York Times best seller list (three of which were at #1), becoming the fourth- highest selling novel of the year.

The tombs include the famous tomb of Harkhuf. Others belong to Sabni, Ishemai or Heqaib. There are also some later tombs, from the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom. Among the most important tombs are those of the expedition leaders (like Harkhuf) despatched to distant lands to negotiate the acquisition of foreign goods for the Egyptian court. During the Middle Kingdom, a minor sanctuary for one (or more) of these leaders (designated with the appelation \\"Heqa-jb\\") was prominent in the town at Elephantine. Excavation work continues.  Archaeology  According to the Ahram Online, in January 2020, six mastaba graves, two shaft graves and one rock-cut tomb with several burials dating back to the Old Kingdom were uncovered by Qubbet El-Hawa Research Project led by Martin Bommas. Mostafa Vaziri said that one of the tombs was very well preserved, he also added that some of the graves were 190x285cm, while others were 352x635cm. Though entrance of one of the tombs with a wall of carefully laid mud bricks had blocked by the tomb constructors, that specific grave had been looted by thieves who broke into the tomb through the back wall in ancient times. Coptic site The hill is also the site of a Coptic monastery of Saint Anthony and some of the tombs were reused as a Coptic church.  Bibliography  * Elmar Edel (edited by Karl-J.

Because of its virulence, the Ames strain is used by the United States as somewhat of a gold standard for development of vaccines and testing their effectiveness, starting in the 1980s, after work on weaponizing the Vollum 1B strain ended and all weaponized stocks were destroyed after the end of the U.S. biological warfare program in 1969.

Adler was a staff writer-reporter for The New Yorker, and in 1968‚Äì69, she served as chief film critic for The New York Times. She is also a writer of fiction. Early life Adler was born in Milan, Italy, and grew up in Danbury, Connecticut. (Her parents had fled Nazi Germany in 1933.) After earning her B.A. (summa cum laude) in philosophy and German literature from Bryn Mawr College, where she studied under Jos√© Ferrater Mora, Adler studied for an M.A. in comparative literature at Harvard under I. A. Richards and Roman Jakobson. She then pursued her interest in philosophy, linguistics and structuralism at the Sorbonne, where she gained a DES under the tutelage of Jean Wahl and Claude L√©vi-Strauss, and later received a J.D. from Yale Law School, and an honorary doctorate of laws from Georgetown University. Career =Journalism= In 1962, Adler became a staff writer-reporter for The New Yorker, and in 1968‚Äì69, she served as chief film critic for The New York Times. Her film reviews were collected in her book, A Year in the Dark. She then rejoined the staff of The New Yorker, where she remained for four decades. Her reporting and essays for The New Yorker on politics, war, and civil rights were reprinted in Toward a Radical Middle. Her introduction to that volume provided an early definition of radical centrism as a political philosophy.Adler, Renata (1969). Toward a Radical Middle: Fourteen Pieces of Reporting and Criticism. Random House, pp. xiii‚Äìxxiv. . Her \\"Letter from the Palmer House\\" was included in the collection The Best Magazine Articles of the Seventies. In 1980, upon the publication of her New Yorker colleague Pauline Kael's collection When the Lights Go Down, she published an 8,000-word review in The New York Review of Books that dismissed the book as \\"jarringly, piece by piece, line by line, and without interruption, worthless\\", arguing that Kael's post-1960s work contained \\"nothing certainly of intelligence or sensibility\\", and faulting her \\"quirks [and] mannerisms\\", including Kael's repeated use of the \\"bullying\\" imperative and rhetorical question. The piece, which stunned Kael and quickly became infamous in literary circles, was described by Time magazine as \\"the New York literary Mafia['s] bloodiest case of assault and battery in years.\\" Adler taught for three years in both the University Professors Honors Program and the Journalism Department of Boston University. She also held Trumbull and Branford Fellowships at Yale, and visiting fellowships at the Hoover Institute of Stanford University. =Books= Fiction In 1974, Adler's short story \\"Brownstone\\" won first prize in the O. Henry Awards. She has published two novels, Speedboat (1976) and Pitch Dark (1983). In 2010, members of the National Book Critics Circle called for Speedboat to be returned to print, and it was re-published by New York Review Books in 2013, along with Pitch Dark. Both were greeted with new critical acclaim. Non-fiction Adler's book, Reckless Disregard: Westmoreland v. CBS et al., Sharon v. Time (1986), an account of two libel trials and the First Amendment, was also praised: \\"This book should be under the Christmas tree of every lawyer and journalist\\", wrote William B. Shannon in The Washington Post. The journalist Edwin M. Yoder wrote, also in The Washington Post, \\"Reckless Disregard is the best book about American journalism of our time.\\" Her book Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker (1999) described what she saw as the magazine's decline in the 1980s and 1990s. The New York Times called it an \\"irritable little book\\" and criticized Adler for claiming that famed Watergate judge John Sirica was a \\"corrupt, incompetent, and dishonest figure, with a close connection to Senator Joseph McCarthy and clear ties to organized crime\\", without offering any proof. Adler rebutted this accusation in a detailed article, \\"A Court of No Appeal\\", published in Harper's in August 2000.Renata Adler, \\"A Court of No Appeal: How One Obscure Sentence Upset The New York Times\\" Harper's (August 2000), accessed 2013-03-22. In 2001, Adler published Canaries in the Mineshaft: Essays on Politics and the Media, a collection of pieces from The New Yorker, the Atlantic, Harper's, The New Republic, The Los Angeles Times, Vanity Fair, and The New York Review of Books. Some of these, on the National Guard, Biafra, Pauline Kael, soap operas, the impeachment inquiries (of both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton), and the press, had received awards. In 2008, Adler contributed an essay to the Corcoran Gallery of Art exhibition catalog Richard Avedon: Portraits of Power. Her introduction, a memoir of her close friendship and work with the photographer, includes details of her work as editor of Avedon's photo-essay for Rolling Stone magazine, \\"The Family\\" (1976). In 2015, New York Review Classics published a collection of Adler's essays and reporting pieces as After the Tall Timber: Collected Non-Fiction.

The school's student body has been well-recognized for its high level of racial and cultural diversity since at least the 1980s. Students derive from over 90 countries and speak more than 50 languages. The school's diverse student body has been noted by multiple US presidential administrations. In 1998, AHS was chosen by then-President Bill Clinton's Race Initiative Advisory Board as the site and focus of round-table discussions on race and education. In 2006, Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings visited Annandale to commend the school's diverse language programs, and to announce a $188,000 grant for Fairfax County Public Schools to expand Arabic and Chinese programs. And in October 2011, AHS was visited by First Lady Michelle Obama and First Lady of South Korea Kim Yoon-ok, who spoke at a school ceremony celebrating education and the school's diverse ethnic composition. AHS is the publishing site and focus of The A-Blast Newspaper, a YJDP paper of The Washington PostYJDP that was consistently honored as one of the top-ten high school newspapers in the country from the late 1990s to 2009 by the National Scholastic Press Association and the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. Historically AHS has also had a competitive football program. The Atoms have won six state championships since 1965, and were ranked as the best high school football team in the country by the National Sports Service after completing an undefeated season in 1978. The team has seen district-wide and sporadic statewide success since the mid-1990s. Recent history and programs =Recognition of diversity= Annandale was chosen in 1998 as the site and focus of the Race Initiative Advisory Board's round-table discussions on race and education. The event was hosted by members of the board, including Thomas Kean and William Winter, and chaired by historian John Hope Franklin. The discussions were held as part of President Bill Clinton's One America Initiative. Annandale High School in 2019 In 2006, then-Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings visited Annandale to announce that a $188,000 grant would be given to Fairfax County Public Schools to expand Arabic and Chinese programs, as part of the National Security Language Initiative. At the time, Annandale students taking Arabic were among \\"the less than 1 per cent of high school students studying languages deemed critical.\\" In October 2011, AHS was again noted by the White House for its cultural diversity, hosting a visit by First Lady Michelle Obama and First Lady of South Korea Kim Yoon-ok, both of whom praised the school's widespread ethnic make-up in speeches to the student body. During her address, Obama said of AHS, ‚ÄúThis is the perfect place for you to find out who you are and what you want to become, and that‚Äôs really what education is all about.‚Äù The visits were accompanied by a ceremony featuring Grammy-nominated violinist Jennifer Koh. At the time, Madame Kim was traveling on a state visit to the US with her husband, Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who were invited as guests of honor to a White House dinner that week after Congress approved the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement. During the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, Korean and other Asian-Americans represented 22 percent of the AHS student body. =Demographics= In 2011‚Äì2012, Annandale's student body was 32.28% Hispanic, 24.97% Asian, 23.97% White, 16.37% Black and 2.41% other. During the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, 51.89% of the student body received free or reduced price lunch. 74.79% of the school was proficient in English. No single racial group formed the majority. AHS is considered one of the most diverse schools among FCPS, itself one of the most diverse school districts in the country. The 2009‚Äì2010 school year marked the first year that Hispanic students represented a plurality of Annandale students, and the first year in the school's history that any racial group other than White students represented a plurality within the student body. In fact, White students represent the only group not to see consistent growth in percentage student body representation over the last three years. =The A-Blast= The A-Blast is Annandale High School's student-run, student-sponsored newspaper. It was consistently recognized as one of the top-10, +17-page high school newspapers in the country from the late 1990s to 2009, during which the paper won a number of National Scholastic Press Association Pacemaker Awards, placed among the Best-in-Show at a variety of NSPA national conventions, and won the Columbia Scholastic Press Association Gold Crown Award (in 2009). The A-Blast has also been a national fore-runner among high school papers for publishing online content, being one of the first fourteen newspapers in the country to be awarded the NSPA's Pacemaker Award for an Online Edition. The A-Blast, in 2009, had adopted a new multimedia program which trains journalism students to create projects pertaining to the news around Annandale High School, and is currently in its fourth production year. The A-Blast is a The Washington Post Young Journalists Development Program Paper. The paper's writers and editors receive publishing and content-related guidance from Post professional staff, and periodically visit The Washington Post headquarters in Washington, D.C., for collaborative workshops. A-Blast editors regularly participate in Post programs for high school students, including the High School Writing Seminar and the High School Journalism Workshop. The A-Blast is printed on The Washington Post press in Springfield, VA. The A-Blast uses WordPress as its technology platform and is hosted by School Newspapers Online. =Football program= In 50 years, Annandale has won six football state championships (1965, 1967, 1972, 1978, 1993, and 1994) and numerous district titles as a member of both the Potomac District (Pre-resdistricting) and the Patriot District (Post redistricting). They are now in the Gunston District. After an undefeated season in 1978, Annandale ended the year ranked #1 in the nation by the National Sports Service. Annandale won Patriot District titles in 2005, 2006,2007, and 2009 (shared with West Springfield High School), but the Atoms fell to their first round opponents each year. =Additional history= Opening its doors in 1954, Annandale High School had 1,000 students, ranging in grades eight-eleven. During this time, the students voted to call themselves \\"Atoms\\" after the influence from president Dwight D. Eisenhower's speech called \\"Atoms for Peace.\\" In the late 1980s, Annandale High School was involved in the creation of the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), ranked as the best high school in the country in 2010 by US News and World Report. TJHSST is one of 18 Virginia Governor's Schools. The former Thomas Jefferson High School (Jefferson, TJHS), originally occupied the FCPS building of the current TJHSST. Over a two-year period, from 1985 to 1987, the Jefferson students were merged into Annandale. The former TJHS students, now Annandale seniors, were appropriately given the one-time special distinction to use a dual name, TJHS/AHS, for school year 1987‚Äì88. No students from Jefferson or TJHSST graduated in 1988. Academics =Rankings= Annandale High School was ranked #122, with a score of 1.391, in The Washington Post's 2010 Challenge Index, an annual ranking of public high schools in the Washington Metropolitan Area.2010 Washington Post ranking Each school's score, and rank, was based on a simple formula: \\"divide the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or other college-level tests a school gave in 2009 by the number of graduating seniors.\\" 172 schools were ranked in 2010. In 2008 Annandale placed #105 (out of 166) in the Challenge Index, with a score of 1.542,2008 Washington Post ranking and in 2007 it was ranked #107 (out of 190), with a score of 1.425.2007 Washington Post ranking =Annandale/Fairfax County Public Schools realignment= In early 2010, the Annandale Border Control Force was established by local parent and community groups. Their goal was to realign the school borders by sending residents of Annandale to adjacent county schools such as Falls Church High School and sending Springfield residents to Lake Braddock Secondary School in an effort to address the overcrowding at Annandale High School. The issue has been long and contentious with some residents and students loyal to Annandale. Several options for preventing the realigning and reassigning of students of certain housing developments to different middle and high schools were suggested to the county school board. A major concern to the Annandale parent and community groups included losing sections of the Annandale community which would change the diverse demographics of the school. =Enrollment= Enrollment at AHS during the 2009‚Äì2010 school year was 2,257 students. Enrollment at the school reached over 2,000 students for the first time during the 1995‚Äì1996 school year. After that year, enrollment grew each year for a decade before reaching 2,568 students during the 2003‚Äì2004 school year. Since then, enrollment has experienced non-streaking growth and decline, though has remained at over 2,000 students. During the 2007‚Äì2008 school year, enrollment reached a ten- year low of 2,045 students. =Academic programs= AHS has the following FCPS Programs: *Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) *Early Identification Program (EIP) *English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) *International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program (IBMYP) *International Baccalaureate Program (IB) *Transitional High School Program * Special Education- servicing Learning Disabilities, Emotional Disabilities, MR/DD Autism and MOD. * In addition to standard foreign languages (Latin, French, Spanish), Arabic is offered, making Annandale one of the few high schools in the country to offer such a program.

The British siege of Fort Niagara in July 1759 was part of a campaign to remove French control of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions, making possible a western invasion of the French province of Canada in conjunction with General James Wolfe's invasion to the east.  Background  British General Jeffery Amherst made plans for the 1759 military campaigns of the Seven Years' War that included an expedition to capture Fort Niagara, a major French military and supply point between the French province of Canada and their forts in the Ohio Valley. Amherst chose Brigadier General John Prideaux to lead the expedition, which also included Sir William Johnson, the British Indian agent who led the expedition's Iroquois forces. Fort Niagara had been largely constructed under the direction of Captain Pierre Pouchot of the French Army. In early 1759, General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and New France's Governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, sent him with about 2,500 men to fortify Niagara beyond the 500 men that had wintered there. Pouchot, under orders from Vaudreuil, sent many of those men south to Fort Machault in mid-June as part of a plan to reinforce the French forts of the Ohio Country and attack the British at Fort Pitt. The forces left to defend Niagara consisted of about 200 men from the regiments of Royal Roussillon, Languedoc, La Sarre, and B√©arn, 20 artillerymen, and about 300 provincial troops and militia.Severance, p. 266 Prideaux's British Army troops consisted of the 44th and 46th Regiments, and two companies from the 60th, numbering about 2,200 men. He also commanded 2500 provincial militia from New York and 700 from Rhode Island. Delayed by high water on the Mohawk River and the late arrival of some of the provincial companies, the expedition did not begin leaving Schenectady until mid-May. On 27 June the army arrived at Fort Oswego, where they were joined by Johnson and about 600 Iroquois. Leaving men behind to garrison Oswego, Prideaux departed on 1 July for Niagara with about 20,500 men. While the French had ships patrolling Lake Ontario for British movements, inattention on the part of one the crews allowed the British flotilla to avoid discovery. They arrived at Fort Niagara on 6 July, landed near a marsh out of sight of the fort, and immediately began siege operations.  Siege  The French had about one hundred Iroquois allies at the Fort who deserted when the British arrived. Captain Pouchot directed a vigorous defense. Prideaux was killed when a shell fragment from one of his own guns hit him, and command of the British forces fell to Sir William Johnson. Johnson was a provincial officer and not in the regular army, and thus there was some question of his right to take command. But Sir William held a royal colonel's commission in his role as commander of the Iroquois auxiliaries, and so he insisted on remaining in command after a lower-ranking regular army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Haldimand, arrived on the scene.Milton W. Hamilton, 'Sir William Johnson: Colonial American, 1715‚Äì1763 (Port Washington, New York: Kennikat Press, 1976; ), pp. 251‚Äì53. The French capitulated on 26 July after a French relief force was defeated at the Battle of La Belle-Famille two miles south of the fort.  Aftermath  The capitulation of Fort Niagara occurred on the same day that French troops abandoned Fort Carillon to an overwhelming British army under General Amherst. Following the surrender of Fort Niagara, the French abandoned other forts in the frontier, recalling garrisons to defend the populated areas of Canada. Forts abandoned by the French includes Fort St. Fr√©d√©ric (in present day Crown Point) and Fort Rouill√© (in present day Toronto). Fort St. Fr√©d√©ric was destroyed as French troops abandoned Lake Champlain to protect the Canadian heartland. The garrison at Fort Rouill√© was instructed to evacuate the area, and burn the fort should Fort Niagara fall. After the British captured Fort Niagara, the French garrison burned Fort Rouill√©, and withdrew to Montreal. The remaining French forts in the Ohio and Illinois Country were eventually turned over to British forces. In the same month, Montcalm led the defences against British General James Wolfe in the three-month siege of Quebec City. The colonial capital was taken in September 1759 at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. During the next year, attempts were made by the French to recapture Quebec City, although their attempts were rebuffed with the arrival of British reinforcements. A year later after a two month campaign, Montreal was conquered by the British in September 1760, the administration of New France signed the Articles of Capitulation surrendering the colony of Canada to the British. The signing of the Articles of Capitulation saw the end of major combat operations in the North American theater of the Seven Years' War.

Because such blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles, a higher concentration in the blood can improve an athlete's aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and endurance. Blood doping can be achieved by making the body produce more red blood cells itself using drugs, giving blood transfusions either from another person or back to the same individual, or by using blood substitutes. Many methods of blood doping are illegal, particularly in professional sports where it is considered to give an artificial advantage to the competitor. Anti-doping agencies use tests to try to identify individuals who have been blood doping using a number of methods, typically by analysing blood samples from the competitors. Background Fig. 1 Achieving Maximum Aerobic Capacity Blood doping is defined as the use of illicit products (e.g. erythropoietin (EPO), darbepoetin-alfa, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizers) and methods (e.g. increase aerobic capacity by maximizing the uptake of O2) in order to enhance the O2 transport of the body to the muscles. The body undergoes aerobic respiration in order to provide sufficient delivery of O2 to the exercising skeletal muscles and the main determining factors are shown in figure 1. The rate of maximum O2 uptake (O2max) depends on cardiac output, O2 extraction and hemoglobin mass. The cardiac output of an athlete is difficult to manipulate during competitions and the distribution of cardiac output is at the maximum rate (i.e. 80%) during competitions. In addition, the O2 extraction is approximately 90% at maximal exercise. Therefore, the only method to enhance the physical performance left is to increase the O2 content in the artery by enhancing the hemoglobin mass. In other words, hemoglobin concentration and blood volume contribute to hemoglobin mass. Methods =Drug treatments= Many forms of blood doping stem from the misuse of pharmaceuticals. These drug treatments have been created for clinical use to increase the oxygen delivery when the human body is not able to do so naturally. Erythropoietin Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney that signal for erythropoiesis in bone marrow. The increased activity of a hemocytoblast (RBC stem cell) allows the blood to have a greater carrying capacity for oxygen. EPO was first developed to counteract the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer patients. EPO also stimulates increased wound healing. Because of its physiological side effects, particularly increased hematocrit, EPO has become a drug with abuse potential by professional and amateur cyclists. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizer Hypoxia- inducible factor stabilizer (HIF stabilizer) is a pharmaceutical used to treat chronic kidney disease. Like most transcription factors, the HIF transcription factor is responsible for the expression of a protein. The HIF stabilizer activates the activity of EPO due to anemia induced hypoxia, metabolic stress, and vasculogenesis‚Äîthe creation of new blood vessels. HIF stabilizers as used by cyclists in combination with cobalt chloride/desferrioxamine stimulate and de-regulate the natural production of erythropoietin hormone. At physiologically low PaO2 around 40 mmHg, EPO is released from the kidneys to increase hemoglobin transportation. The combination of drugs consistently releases EPO due to increased transcription at the cellular level. The effect wears off when the HIF stabilizers, cobalt chloride/desferrioxamine is excreted and/or decayed by the body. Myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) Myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), also known as compound number OXY111A, is an allosteric effector of hemoglobin which causes a rightward shift in the oxygen‚Äìhemoglobin dissociation curve, increasing the amount of oxygen released from red blood cells into surrounding tissue during each passage through the cardiovascular system. ITPP has been a subject of anti-doping research in both humans and racehorses. =Blood transfusion= Blood transfusions can be traditionally classified as autologous, where the blood donor and transfusion recipient are the same, or as allogeneic/homologous, where the blood is transfused into someone other than the donor. Blood transfusion begins by the withdrawal of 1 to 4 units of blood (1 unit = 450 ml of blood) several weeks before competition. The blood is centrifuged, the plasma components are immediately reinfused, and the corpuscular elements, principally red blood cells (RBCs), are stored refrigerated at 4 ¬∞C or frozen at ‚àí80 ¬∞C.McArdle WD, Katch FI, Katch VL. \\"Exercise Physiology\\". In McArdle WD, Katch FI, Katch VL, Eds. Energy, Nutrition, and Human Performance. 2nd Ed. pp. 409‚Äì411. Philadelphia: Lea and Febiger, 1986. As blood stored by refrigeration displays a steady decline in the number of RBCs, a substantial percentage, up to 40%, of the stored RBCs may not be viable. The freezing process, conversely, limits the aging of the cells, allowing the storage of the blood for up to 10 years with a 10% to 15% loss of RBCs. Stored RBCs are then reinfused, usually 1 to 7 days before a high-endurance event. As a significant amount of iron is removed by each autologous transfusion, an adequate time for recovery of not less than 3 days from the last donation, and appropriate iron supplements, are usually required for patients undergoing autologous donations. Nearly 50% of autologous donations are not used by the donor and are discarded, as current standards do not allow transfusion of these units to another patient for safety reasons. =Blood substitutes= Biochemical and biotechnological development has allowed novel approaches to this issue, in the form of engineered O2 carriers, widely known as \\"blood substitutes\\". The blood substitutes currently available are chiefly polymerized haemoglobin solutions or haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are intra/ inter- molecularly engineered human or animal hemoglobins, only optimized for oxygen delivery and longer intravascular circulation. The presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate within erythrocytes maintains the normal affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. HBOCs do not contain erythrocytes and lose this interaction, thus, unmodified human HBOC solutions have a very high oxygen affinity which compromises their function. Chemical methods developed to overcome this problem have resulted in carriers that effectively release oxygen at the physiological pO2 of peripheral tissues. A common feature of all HBOCs is their resistance to dissociate when dissolved in media, which contrasts hemoglobin of natural dissociation under non-physiological conditions. HBOCs may hypothetically supply greater benefits to athletes than those provided by the equivalent hemoglobin in traditional RBC infusion. Recent developments have shown that HBOCs are not only simple RBC substitutes, but highly effective O2 donors in terms of tissue oxygenation. Additional effects include increases in blood serum iron, ferritin, and Epo;184Hughes GS Jr, Francome SF, Antal EJ, Adams WJ, Locker PK, Yancey EP, Jacobs EE Jr. \\"Hematologic effects of a novel hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier in normal male and female subjects. J Lab Clin Med 1995; 126: 444‚Äì451. up to 20% increased diffusion of oxygen and improved exercise capacity; increased CO2 production; and lower lactic acid generation in anaerobic activity. HBOCs have been shown in trials to be extremely dangerous in humans. Because HBOCs increase both the risk of death and risk of myocardial infarction clinical trials were ended. They are not commercially available in the US or Europe and there is no approved use for them. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) PFCs, also known as fluorocarbons, are inert, water-insoluble, synthetic compounds, consisting primarily of carbon and fluorine atoms bonded together in strong C‚ÄìF bonds. PFCs are substantially clear and colorless liquid emulsions that are heterogeneous in molecular weight, surface area, electronic charge, and viscosity; their high content of electron-dense fluorine atoms results in little intramolecular interaction and low surface tension, making such substances excellent solvents for gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide. Some of these molecules can dissolve 100 times more oxygen than plasma. PFCs are naturally hydrophobic and need to be emulsified to be injected intravenously. Since PFCs dissolve rather than bind oxygen, their capacity to serve as a blood substitute is determined principally by the pO2 gradients in the lung and at the target tissue. Therefore, their oxygen transport properties differ substantially from those of whole blood and, especially, from those of RBCs. At a conventional ambient pO2 of 135 mmHg, the oxygen content of 900 ml/l perfluorocarbon is less than 50 ml/l, whereas an optimal oxygen content of 160 ml/l, which is still lower than that of whole blood in normal conditions, can be achieved only by a pO2 greater than 500 mmHg. In practice, at a conventional alveolar pO2 of 135 mmHg, PFCs will not be able to provide sufficient oxygenation to peripheral tissues. Due to their small size, PFCs are able to permeate circulation where erythrocytes may not flow. In tiny capillaries, PFCs produce the greatest benefit, as they increase local oxygen delivery much more efficiently than would be expected from the increase in oxygen content in larger arteries. In addition, as gases are in the dissolved state within PFCs, it pO2 promotes efficient oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. Since the mid-1980s, improvements in both oxygen capacity and emulsion properties of PFCs have led to the development of second-generation PFC-based oxygen carriers; two PFC products are currently being tested in phase III clinical trials.Hill SE. \\"Oxygen therapeutics. Current concepts. Can J Anaesth 2001; 48 (4 Suppl): S32‚ÄìS40 =Cobalt chloride administration= Transition metal complexes are widely known to play important roles in erythropoiesis; as such, inorganic supplementation is proving to be an emerging technique in blood doping. Particularly of note is the cobalt complex, cobalamin (Vitamin B12) commonly used as a dietary supplement. Cobalamin is an important complex used in the manufacture of red blood cells and thus was of interest for potential use in blood doping. Experimental evidence, however, has shown that cobalamin has no effect on erythropoiesis in the absence of a red blood cell/oxygen deficiency. These results seem to confirm much of what is already known about the functioning of cobalamin. The signaling pathway that induces erythropoietin secretion and subsequently red blood cell manufacture using cobalamin is O2 dependent. Erythropoietin is only secreted in the kidneys when there is an O2 deficiency, as such, RBC manufacture is independent of the amount of cobalamin administered when there is no O2 deficiency. Accordingly, cobalamin is of little to no value in blood doping. More potent for use in blood doping is Co2+ (administered as Cobalt(II) chloride, CoCl2). Cobalt chloride has been known to be useful in treating anemic patients. Recent experimental evidence has proved the efficacy of cobalt chloride in blood doping. Studies into the action of this species have shown that Co2+ induces hypoxia like responses, the most relevant response being erythropoiesis. Co2+ induces this response by binding to the N-terminus (loop helix loop domain) of the Hypoxia inducing transcription factors HIF-1Œ± and HIF-2Œ±, and thus stabilizes these protein complexes. Under normal O2 conditions, HIFs are destabilized as proline and asparagine residues are hydroxylated by HIF-Œ± hydroxylases, these unstable HIFs are subsequently degraded following a ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, as such, they cannot then bind and activate transcription of genes encoding Erythropoietin (EPO). With Co2+ stabilization, degradation is prevented and genes encoding EPO can then be activated. The mechanism for this Co2+ N terminus stabilization is not yet fully understood. In addition to N-terminus binding, it has also been hypothesized that replacement of Fe2+ by Co2+ in the hydroxylase active site could be a contributing factor to the stabilizing action of Co2+. It is understood however, is that Co2+ binding permits Ubiquitin binding but prevents proteosomal degradation. Detection of blood doping  =Detection for homologous blood doping= In 2004, a test for detection allogeneic/homologous blood transfusion doping was implemented. Flow cytometry is the method of choice. By examining markers on the surface of blood cells, the method can determine whether blood from more than one person is present in an athlete's circulation. The test utilizes 12 antisera directed against the blood group antigens, obtained from donor plasma. The antigens are labeled with secondary antibodies, which are conjugated with phycoerythrin to label IgG or IgM-coated RBCs and enhance the detection by flow cytometry The flow cytometry is able to detect minor variance in blood group antigens. The assessment was able to distinguish the blood of subjects who had earlier received at least one unit of allogeneic blood. This technique is able to detect small (<5%) populations of cells that are antigenically distinct from an individual's own RBCs. =Detection for autologous blood doping= Autologous blood doping detection is done indirectly via CO rebreathing technique to measure the nonphysiologic increases in Hb mass. The principle of CO rebreathing method used currently requires an O2-CO gas mixture inhalation for about 10-15mins. By measuring the difference in carboxyhemoglobin concentration (HbCO) before and after rebreathing, the volume of CO and the binding capacity of Hb for CO ( 1.39ml g-1), total Hb mass can be calculated. This detection method is problematic for an athlete as it is not desirable to breathe in CO shortly before a competition, which may potentially affect their performances. =Detection of blood hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier= Detection method for hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (i.e. Oxyglobulin) is done in four separate steps. Step one involves the elimination of abundance proteins in the blood samples by immunodepletion (i.e. Proteo Prep 20 plasma immunodepletion kit). This process ensures that other proteins (i.e. albumin and immunoglobulin) do not interfere with capillary electrophoresis (CE) separation by changing the ionization. Second step, CE separation is done under certain condition, in this case background electrolyte consisting of ammonium formate (75mM at pH 9.5) in order to provide sufficient resolution between HBOC and Hb. Third step, UV/Vis detection was performed at 415 nm to selectively detect HBOC and HB. Fourth step, time-of-flight or mass spectrometer allowed increased accuracy in selectivity between hemoproteins and other proteins and definite determination of HBOC uptake. The detection limits for CE-UV/Vis at 415 nm and CE-ESI-TOF/MS results to be 0.20 and 0.45g/dL for plasma respectively. =Detection of cobalt concentration by utilizing the biokinetic model= Cobalt can be detected by laboratory blood analysis if the intake amount is greater than 400 Œºg per day. As the whole blood concentration is greater than 1 Œºg/L and the urinary concentration is greater than 10 Œºg/L after at least 10 days of administration. The dose, which increases the red blood cell production to approximately 16%-21%, is about 68 mg Co per day for at least 10 days of oral administration. The predicted whole blood concentration of cobalt exceeds 200 Œºg/L two hours after the last intake and the average urine concentrations of cobalt exceed 3000 Œºg/L within 24 hours of intake. A study was carried out where 23 subjects were to take 900 Œºg per day in the form of CoCl2 for 10 days. The model predictions were then compared to the study. The result shows that the model prediction for blood and urine are between the median concentration of the male and female groups, which indicate the model predictions sufficiently represent the test population as a whole. Military use As early as 1947, military research scientists were studying ways to increase fighter pilots‚Äô tolerance for hypoxia at high altitude. In one such study, red blood cells were transfused into ten males at the US Naval Research facility, resulting in increased oxygen capacity. In 1993, U.S. Special Forces commanders at Fort Bragg started experimenting with blood doping, also known as blood loading. Special Forces operators would provide two units of whole blood, from which red blood cells would be extracted, concentrated, and stored under cold temperatures. 24 hours before a mission or battle, a small amount of red blood cells would be infused back into the soldier. Military scientists believe that the procedure increases the soldiers‚Äôs endurance and alertness because of the increase in the blood's capability to carry oxygen. In 1998, the Australian Defence Forces approved this technique for the Special Air Service Regiment. Senior nutritionist at the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation Chris Forbes-Ewan is quoted as saying that, unlike in sport, \\"all's fair in love and war.\\" \\"What we are trying to gain is an advantage over any potential adversary,\\" Forbes-Ewan said.Russell, Ken (1998-09-18). Australia: Troops Get The All-Clear To Dose Up On Energy Drugs. Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved on 2011-06-01. In this study, over 50 performance-enhancing drugs and techniques were rejected. The six that were approved are caffeine, ephedrine, energy drinks, modafinil, creatine, and blood-loading. Notable blood doping cases Kaarlo Maaninka (208), the subject of the first known blood doping case, in the 1980 Summer Olympics 5,000 m race. Blood doping started in the late 1960s but was not outlawed until 1986. While it was still legal, it was commonly used by middle and long-distance runners. The first known case of blood doping occurred at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow as Kaarlo Maaninka was transfused with two pints of blood before winning medals in the 5 and 10 kilometer track races, though this was not against the rules at the time. Cyclist Joop Zoetemelk admitted to receiving blood transfusions during the 1976 Tour de France, where he finished second, although he claimed that these were intended to treat his anaemia rather than enhance his performance. In the same year cyclist Francesco Moser used blood transfusions to prepare for his successful attempt to break the hour record. \\"Blood doping\\" was banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1985, though no test existed for it at the time. The Swedish cyclist Niklas Axelsson tested positive for EPO in 2000. The American cyclist Tyler Hamilton failed a fluorescent-activated cell sorting test for detecting homologous blood transfusions during the 2004 Olympics. He was allowed to keep his gold medal because the processing of his sample precluded conducting a second, confirmatory test. He appealed a second positive test for homologous transfusion from the 2004 Vuelta a Espa√±a to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport but his appeal was denied. Hamilton's lawyers proposed Hamilton may be a genetic chimera or have had a 'vanishing twin' to explain the presence of red blood cells from more than one person. While theoretically possible, these explanations were ruled to be of \\"negligible probability\\". The Spanish-based Operaci√≥n Puerto case in 2006 involved allegations of doping and blood doping of hundreds of athletes from Spain, Germany, Italy, Colombia, Australia, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and The USA. Tour de France rider Alexander Vinokourov, of the Astana Team, tested positive for two different blood cell populations and thus for homologous transfusion, according to various news reports on July 24, 2007. Vinokourov was tested after his victory in the 13th stage time trial of the Tour on July 21, 2007. A doping test is not considered to be positive until a second sample is tested to confirm the first. Vinokourov's B sample has now tested positive, and he faces a possible suspension of two years and a fine equal to one year's salary. He also tested positive after stage 15.\\"Vinokourov Fails Tour Doping Test.\\" BBC News. BBC, 24 July 2007. Web. 07 Oct. 2015. . Vinokourov's teammate Andrej Kashechkin also tested positive for homologous blood doping on August 1, 2007, just a few days after the conclusion of the 2007 Tour de France (a race that had been dominated by doping scandals). His team withdrew after the revelation that Vinokourov had doped. According to Russian investigators, 19-year-old New York Rangers prospect and Russian hockey player Alexei Cherepanov was engaged in blood doping for several months before he died on October 13, 2008, after collapsing on the bench during a game in Russia. He also had myocarditis. The German speed skater and five-fold Olympic gold medalist Claudia Pechstein was banned for two years in 2009 for alleged blood doping, based on irregular levels of reticulocytes in her blood and the assumption that these levels were always highest during competitions. Her mean reticulocyte count over the ten years from 2000 to 2009 was 2.1% during top events like Olympic Games and during world championships. At world cup races the mean reticulocyte was 1.9% and during training phases 2.0%. The Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed the ban in November 2009 in stating: \\"...once the possibility of a blood disease has been safely excluded...\\". In September 2010, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court rejected the athlete's appeal, stating that Pechstein's inherited blood anomaly had been known before (\\"die vererbte Blutanomalie bekannt gewesen sei\\").\\"Bundesgericht weist Revisionsgesuch der Eisschnelll√§uferin Claudia Pechstein ab\\", Medienmitteilung des Bundesgerichts, 1 October 2010. (German) On May 20, 2011, Tyler Hamilton turned in his 2004 Olympic Gold Medal to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after admitting to doping in a 60 Minutes interview. On August 23, 2012, Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life by cycling's governing body following a report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that accused him of leading a doping program during his cycling career. He later admitted to using banned substances including blood doping with transfusions and EPO in an interview with Oprah Winfrey on January 17, 2013.Karlinsky, Neal. \\"Lance Armstrong Stripped of 7 Tour De France Titles, Banned for Life After Doping Scandal.\\" ABC News. ABC News Network, 22 Oct. 2012. Web. 06 Oct. 2015. . In June 2014, UFC fighter Chael Sonnen tested positive for EPO. One month later, another UFC fighter, Ali Bagautinov also tested positive for EPO. Adverse effects The simple act of increasing the number of red blood cells in blood may be associated with hyperviscosity syndrome which is characterized by increased blood viscosity and decreased cardiac output and blood flow velocity which results in the reduction of peripheral oxygen delivery. For instance, an overdose of EPO can thicken blood into a highly viscous and artery-clogging sludge. This increases the chances of heart attack, stroke, phlebitis, and pulmonary embolism, which has been seen in cases where there is too much blood reintroduced into the blood stream. Because blood doping increases the volume of red blood cells, it effectively introduces a condition called polycythemia, a blood disorder that has known adverse outcomes such as heart attacks or strokes. Blood contamination during preparation or storage is another issue. Contamination was seen in 1 in every 500,000 transfusions of red blood cells in 2002. Blood contamination can lead to sepsis or an infection that affects the whole body. Certain medications used to increase red blood cells can reduce liver function and lead to liver failure, pituitary problems, and increases in cholesterol levels.

According to Art. 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Community The EU also funds educational, vocational and citizenship-building programmes which encourage EU citizens to take advantage of opportunities which the EU offers its citizens to live, study and work in other countries. The best known of these is the Erasmus programme, under which more than 3,000,000 students have taken part in inter-university exchange and mobility over the last 20 years. Since 2000, conscious of the importance of Education and Training for their economic and social objectives, EU Member States have begun working together to achieve specific goals in the field of Education. By sharing examples of good policy practice, by taking part in Peer Learning activities, by setting benchmarks and by tracking progress against key indicators, the 27 Member States aim to respond coherently to common challenges, whilst retaining their individual sovereignty in the field of Education policy. This strategy is referred to as the Education and Training 2020 programme (ET2020), which is an update of the Education and Training 2010 programme. The European Union is also a partner in various inter-governmental projects, including the Bologna Process whose purpose is to create a European higher education area by harmonising academic degree structures and standards as well as academic quality assurance standards throughout EU Member States and in other European countries. Building a Europe of knowledge The European Union adopted its first education programme (the COMETT programme, designed to stimulate contacts and exchanges between universities and industry) in July 1987. This programme was rapidly followed by the ERASMUS programme, which promoted inter- university contacts and cooperation, as well as substantial student mobility (as, in 1989, did the \\"Youth for Europe\\" programme, the EU's first youth exchange support scheme). These programmes were adopted by the EU countries but with considerable support from the European Parliament which made budgets available even before the legal instruments had been adopted. The European Union has two different types of instrument to increase the quality and openness of the education and training systems of the EU's Member States: a set of policy instruments through which EU countries are encouraged to develop their own education systems and to learn from each other's successes; and a substantial programme to support exchanges, networks and mutual learning between schools, universities or training centres as well as between the political authorities responsible for these areas in the different Member States. Education and training policy The European Union's interest in Education policy (as opposed to Education programmes) developed after the Lisbon summit in March 2000, at which the EU's Heads of State and Government asked the Education Ministers of the EU to reflect on the \\"concrete objectives\\" of education systems with a view to improving them.Presidency Conclusions Lisbon European Council 23 and 24 March 2000;cf paragraphs 24-27 The European Commission and the European Union's Member States worked together on a report for the Spring 2001 European Council, and in 2002 the Spring Summit approved their joint work programme showing how they proposed to take the report's recommendations forward. Since then they have published a series of \\"Joint Reports\\" every other year. The Commission seeks to encourage Member States to improve the quality of their education and training systems in two main ways: through a process of setting targets and publishing the position of Member States in achieving them and by stimulating debate on subjects of common interest. This is done using the process known as the Open Method of Coordination. =Target setting= As regards target setting, the Member States agreed in the Council on 5 May 2003 on five benchmarks on : early school leavers; number of graduates and decrease of gender imbalance in maths, science and technology; upper secondary education completion; low achievers in reading literacy; lifelong learning. Under the current policy framework in Education and Policy (ET2020), the seven benchmarks require that by 2020: 1 - Early School Leavers : less than 10% of school pupils should leave school before the end of compulsory schooling 2 - Tertiary education attainment : at least 40% of the population aged 30‚Äì34 years should have completed tertiary education 3 - Early childhood education and care : 95% of children aged 4 to the age when primary education starts should participate in early education 4 - Low achievement in Reading, Maths and Science : no more than 15% of 15-year- olds should be low-achievers in reading, maths and science as measured at level 2 in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment 5 - Employment rate of recent graduates : 82% of the population aged 20‚Äì34, who are no longer in education or training and have successfully completed upper secondary or tertiary education, should be employed 6 - Adult participation in life-long learning : participation of the 25-64 age group in lifelong learning (i.e. formal or non-formal continuing education or training including in- company skills development) should be not less than 15% per annum 7 - Mobility between countries : at least 20% of higher education graduates and 6% of 18- to 34-year-olds with an initial vocational qualification should have spent some time studying or training abroad Since 2012, progress against benchmarks and core indicators is yearly assessed in the Education and Training Monitor, published every autumn by the Directorate-General for Education and Culture in replacement of the Progress Report. The benchmark on Early school leavers and the benchmark on Tertiary education attainment are also Europe 2020 targets. =Policy discussions= In addition to the measurement of progress, the Commission also publishes policy papers designed to encourage the EU's Member States to look more closely at particular areas of their education and training policy. The Commission has published such papers over many years, but until the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, few were widely followed. Since then, however, Member States have become more open to mutual exchange and learning, and a number of Commission papers have had significant impact. A recent example (late 2006) may be found in the Communication on \\"Efficiency and equity in European education and training systems\\". This paper was generally welcomed by Member States but it drew criticism from some (in particular Germany and Austria) who felt that it commented negatively on their education and training systems.see, for example, the article of 14 November 2006 in Der Spiegel Online at or similar articles in Financial Times Deutschland and Tageszeitung on 15 November 2006. =Networking= Finally, the Commission has supported a variety of networking systems between Ministers (and Ministries) in the EU's Member States, in addition to the thrice yearly meetings of the \\"Education Council\\" within the EU's own institutional system. These range from biennial meetings of Ministers responsible for Vocational Education and Training (the \\"Copenhagen Process\\"), through regular meetings of Director Generals for Higher Education or for Vocational Education and Training to more specialised networks or \\"clusters\\" within the \\"Education and Training 2010 programme\\" in areas such as key competences, foreign language learning or the recognition of informal and non-formal qualifications. Education and training programmes =Inside the EU= The first European Union exchange programmes were the COMETT Programme for Industry-University links and exchanges, launched in 1987 (and discontinued in 1995); the Erasmus university exchange programme was launched in the same year. Similar programmes have been running ever since, and as from 2007 all the education and training programmes were brought together in one single programme; the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013. The Lifelong Learning programme comprises separate sub-programmes for schools; universities and higher education; vocational education and training; adult education; teaching about the EU in universities; and a 'horizontal' programme for policy development. The schools exchange programme, named after the 15th century Czech teacher, scientist and educator John Amos Comenius, has helped over 2.5 million school students take part in joint projects across boundaries. The Erasmus programme (named after Desiderius Erasmus, the 16th century Dutch humanist and theologian), has been the icon of university exchange programmes since its launch in 1987. Some two million students have so far spent a fully accredited period of between 3 months and an academic year in another EU university under the programme, which has become a symbol of Europe in universities. The vocational education and training programme is named after the renaissance inventor and all-rounder Leonardo da Vinci. It currently helps around 75,000 young people each year to do an apprenticeship or internship in another EU country. The adult education programme, named after Pastor N. F. S. Grundtvig, the 19th century Danish theologian, poet, philosopher and thinker, helps those involved in adult education to have access to similar international experience. The sub- programme which supports teaching about Europe in higher education is named after the French politician and architect of European Unity, Jean Monnet. The programme entered into force on 1 January 2007, and will continue until projects launched in its final year 2013 are closed - probably in 2016. =Outside the EU= The first EU programme to promote educational exchange and cooperation between educational institutions inside the EU and those outside it was the TEMPUS programme, adopted on 7 May 1990 by the Council as part of the assistance provided by the European Community of the day to the countries breaking free of Soviet rule. The idea behind TEMPUS was that individual universities in the European Community could contribute to the process of rebuilding free and effective university systems in partner countries; and that a bottom-up process through partnerships with individual universities in these countries would provide a counterweight to the influence of the much less trusted Ministries, few of which had by then undergone serious change since Soviet domination. The programme was an immediate success; and by 1993 the number of participating countries had grown from five at the start to eleven. The programme was subsequently enlarged to include the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union; again to include the countries of the Western Balkans;Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia. and finally to cover the Mediterranean countries. The TEMPUS programme currently supports projects run by consortia of universities in the EU and in partner countries which aim to update curricula and teaching methods; to improve academic management (e.g., strategic development plans, systems of quality assessment and assurance); and to promote the higher education priorities of its partner countries. It also provides Individual Mobility Grants to enable individuals to travel to or from Europe in connection with these themes. The TEMPUS programme is still running, but will be renewed and revised as from 2007. TEMPUS was followed by a series of smaller programmes built more round the mobility of academics towards the EU. These included the ALFA/ALBAN programmes with Latin American universities; the Asia-Link programme; and others, sometimes time-limited. A number of these appear to have been set up as a means of development assistance rather than with the development of universities as such, an impression strengthened by the fact that they were managed by the European Commission's development assistance service EuropeAid rather than (like TEMPUS or Erasmus Mundus programme) by its Education and Culture department. Finally, in 2003 the European Union launched the Erasmus Mundus programme, a project to ensure the place of European Universities as centres of excellence across the world; to attract the best students from around the world to Europe; and to enable partnerships between European universities and those in other countries. The programme had strong support both from the Council of Ministers and from the European Parliament.see the enthusiastic report on the draft Erasmus Mundus programme by Mme Marielle de Sarnez MEP for the European Parliament: The first phase of Erasmus Mundus will finish in 2008. The Commission has announced its intention to propose a further period. Europe Study Centre (ESC) has lately come up as a reputed and dependable company in Indian providing end to end services in the European overseas education field helping Indian students to avail the Erasmus Mundus benefits.

It closely resembles the usual form of a . The appears in many designs with various uses. The simplest, most common patterns of the device contain from one to four , and are reminiscent of similar designs that have been found in wide distribution around the world. When circumscribed in a circle, it often appears in a set of three, with this design known as the . Etymology The character Â∑¥ (Chinese pronunciation bƒÅ) has several meanings, ranging from a Sichuan toponym to a crust formed by dryness, parts of the body such as hands or cheeks, and, as a verb, bearing the sense of \\"to hope\\", \\"expect\\" or \\"be anxious over\\". The Chinese character used to depict, according to Bernhard Karlgren's interpretation of the small seal script graph, a python. The Japanese word itself may be of Altaic origin, since it bears comparison with Middle Mongolian (twisted horse headdress, from the verb (plait, twist)) and Ordos t'omok ('a little bag hung on a horse's head'). In this latter connection Tang ceramic figures of horses show small sacks tethered to the lower neck, perhaps to stop the horse from throwing its head back. One view is that the word refers to a picture of a , or drawings on the latter, the in question, in archaic Japanese , being a round leather arm protector, like the bracer or gauntlet tab of European archery. Roy Andrew Miller describes it as \\"a small hollow sack or bulb of sewn leather with leather tie straps, sometimes embossed with a comma like decorative device () of continental origin\\". It was worn on the left elbow or wrist of an archer either to prevent chafing from the bowstring (: Âº¶) twanging back to position on the release of an arrow, or to strike fear into the enemy from the sharp sound caused by the bowstring hitting the wrist guard. The 'tomo picture' () can therefore be interpreted either as a visual pun on the tomo represented, or, otherwise, as taking its name from that object. Several such examples are conserved in Nara at the Sh≈çs≈çin. An alternative interpretation takes it to be a stylized magatama. Theories of its origin The origin of the design is uncertain. A pattern resembling the two-comma () has been found in ancient cultures on all inhabited continents. A stylized design on a Yangshao bowl dates back to 2,000 BCE. The motif of two encircling dolphins biting each other's tails has been found on Cretan ceramics dating from the Minoan period (1700-1400 BCE), and the two fish biting each other in circular fashion recurs in both Chinese and Central Mexican ware. It is frequently seen on prehistoric Celtic remains, and one mirror from Balmaclellan is almost identical to the . In China, the double comma form came to be assimilated to the Yin-Yang philosophy of opposing male/female principles, formalized in the design of the late Song Dynasty period. This in turn recurs in the 7th century in Korea, where it was known as Taegeuk. and replicated in the Japanese and patterns, the former in association with divinatory rites, the latter frequently linked to temple drums with apotropaic functions. According to Jean Herbert in these contexts, the embodied three spirits, the yin-yang dyad being represented by an (rough kami) and a (gentle kami), while the third comma denoted the , or lucky spirit. N. Gordon Munro argued that the basis for the pattern, a motif found also among the Ainu, was the eastern European and western Asian figure of the triskelion, which he believed lay behind the Chinese three-legged crow design, and, in his view, its reflex in the mythical Japanese crow, the (ÂÖ´Âí´ÁÉè). =Tomoe emblem history in Japan= A design on a taiko drum As a leather wrist protector appear to have been employed at least as early as the Kofun period, where they are frequently attested on haniwa terracotta figurines depicting archers, and may even have had, aside from their military function, a ritual or fetish value, perhaps related to their testicular shape. The tomoe emblem established itself as a common emblem during the Fujiwara ascendency of the late Heian period, around the 10th-11th centuries, and proliferated through to Kamakura times. It is thought that a resemblance between the tomoe and the Emperor ≈åjin found in the Nihongi may also account for its rising popularity among samurai, since ≈åjin was apotheosized as a god in Hachiman shrines. In the Nihongi account, when ≈åjin was born, inspection of his body revealed a fleshy growth on his arm similar to a warrior's wrist or elbow pad, and for this reason he was called (Ë™âÁî∞: lit.(Lord) Armguard) (OJ: ), an old word for a . =Sh≈ç clan's family crest= The second Sh≈ç clan, who ruled the Ryukyu Kingdom on Okinawa Island from 1470 to 1879, adopted the mitsudomoe as its family crest. Since it was the royal family crest, its usage was once severely restricted. Okinawans who visited mainland Japan shortly after the abolishment of the polity in 1879 were surprised that mitsudomoe banners were flown everywhere. During the American military occupation of Okinawa, the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands (USCAR) made a failed attempt to create the \\"flag of Ry≈´ky≈´\\" based on the mitsudomoe, only to find the occupied's apathy toward the former royal family's symbol. Symbolism and uses The is closely associated with Shinto shrines, in particular those dedicated to Hachiman, the god of war and archery. Hachiman in Shinto cosmology and ritual, as for example at Hakozaki Shrine, is repeatedly connected with the number three. In Shintoist thinking, this number is taken to represent the three aspects of the four mitama or 'souls' (the other, the being considered far rarer). It is also commonly displayed on banners and lanterns used in festivals and rituals related to Amaterasu-≈çmikami, who in the Kojiki confronts her brother Susanoo when he usurps her terrain on earth by dressing as an archer, adorned with magatama beads and 'an awesome high arm-guard' (). A third element of its symbolic panorama concerns water, an association engendered by its swirling pattern. For this reason, it is said to be located on roofs and gables as a charm against fire. Since Hachiman was worshipped as the guardian of warriors, it was adopted as a common design element in by various samurai clans such as Kobayakawa and Utsunomiya. Among aristocrats, the Saionji family used it as its family emblem. The Koyasan Shingon sect of Buddhism uses the mitsudomoe as a visual representation of the cycle of life. Tomoe also is a personal name, dating at least back to Tomoe Gozen (Â∑¥Âæ°Ââç), a famous female warrior celebrated in The Tale of the Heike account of the Genpei War. In Kyoto's Jidai Matsuri festival, she appears in the Heian period section of the procession in samurai costume, and parades as a symbol of feminine gallantry. The tomoe has also been adopted as a corporate logo in Japan. Similar designs The two-fold is almost identical in its design elements to the Chinese symbol known as a taijitu, while the three-fold is very similar to the Korean tricolored taegeuk. Also note that the negative space in between the swirls of a fourfold forms a swastika-like shape, which is fairly prominent in many Indian religions such as Hinduism and Jainism and Buddhism. A similar design can also be found in the some forms of the Celtic spiral triskele as well as with the Basque lauburu and the Sicilian Trinacria.

The point loss that the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered on this day currently ranks as the 18th biggest percentage loss since the Dow's creation in 1896. This crash is considered a \\"mini-crash\\" because the percentage loss was relatively small compared to some other notable crashes. After the crash, the markets still remained positive for 1997, but the \\"mini-crash\\" may be considered as the beginning of the end of the 1990s economic boom in the United States and Canada, as both consumer confidence and economic growth were mildly reduced during the winter of 1997‚Äì98 (with neither being strongly affected, compared to the rest of the world), and when both returned to pre-October levels, they began to grow at an even slower pace than before the crash. The crash The crash started overnight in Asia as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 6%, although the most widely watched Asian market, Japan's Nikkei 225, only fell 2% on the day. The losses spread to the European markets, where London's FTSE 100 Index fell 98.90 points, or just about 2%, to 4,871.30. The Frankfurt DAX index fell sharply as well. The U.S. markets were widely expected to open lower for the day. The Dow, NASDAQ Composite and S&P; 500 all declined for the entire session. At 2:36 pm, after falling 350 points, the Dow hit its first trading curb halt, which lasted 30 minutes. After that, stocks continued their immense slide, eventually hitting the second trading curb at 550 points, and trading ended at 3:35 pm. The second trading curb usually halts trading for one hour, but since there were only 25 minutes left in the session, the New York Stock Exchange simply ended trading early. Nasdaq trading continued until 4:00 p.m. By the numbers =Controversial halts= The decision of the NYSE to end trading early was controversial. Since the Dow hit the first trading curb at 350 points, its loss was only 4.54%. This was not nearly enough to justify halting trading, given that the Dow had fallen more than 4.5% in 11 different sessions between 1945 and 1997. Currently, the New York Stock Exchange sets the curbs at 10%, 20% and 30%, and determines how much these percentages are in point terms by where the Dow finishes at the end of the quarter. =Closing time= By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 554.26 points, or 7.18%, to 7,161.15. Back then, this was the 12th biggest percentage loss and 3rd biggest point loss on record. The Nasdaq Composite fell 7%, or 115.41, to 1,535.51. The S&P; 500 fell 64.63, or 6.86%, to 877.01. Several stock market analysts saw this crash as a \\"correction\\" to the overheated markets, which had doubled in value in 30 months. This crash put the Dow down 12% from its then-record high of 8,259 on August 6, but it still gained for the year. Volume also hit a record high. New York Stock Exchange volume topped 695 million shares, breaking the previous record of 684 million shares traded on January 23, 1997. Today, this volume is considered to be very low. $663 billion in market capitalization was wiped out. October 28 U.S. stock markets were widely expected to open lower for October 28 because the Asian markets fell even more than they had on the 27th. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined a staggering 14%. The Nikkei fell 4.26%. The U.S. stock markets initially continued their drop from the 27th but abruptly stabilized and began to climb. The Dow fell as many as 186 points by 10:06 am, and soon thereafter a rally started. By 10:20 am, the Dow was down only 25 points. Five minutes later, the Dow jumped back into positive territory and was up 50 points. Nine minutes later, at 10:34 am, the Dow made a triple-digit gain of 137.27 points. Stock prices continued to soar in choppy trading throughout the rest of the day At the close of trading at 4:00 pm, the Dow finished with a then-record 337.17 point gain (recovering 61% of the previous day's loss) to close at 7,498.32. The market restored $384 billion of the $663 billion in market capitalization lost the previous day, and 1 billion shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time ever, with a volume of 1.21 billion shares. Currently, the volume is considered very low. The Nasdaq Composite also made a record gain on record volume by gaining 67.93 points to 1,603.02 and saw its first-ever 1-billion share day, with a volume of 1.23 billion shares. Other massive losses and sharp rebounds This was not the first time the market had large losses followed by a sharp recovery. Here are a few other instances: *Stock Market Crash of 1929: The Dow falls a total of 23% for October 28 and 29; then makes a sharp 12.84% rebound on the October 30.

This structure is very similar to ice, and ammonium fluoride is the only substance which can form mixed crystals with water. Reactions On passing hydrogen fluoride gas (in excess) through the salt, ammonium fluoride absorbs the gas to form the addition compound ammonium bifluoride. The reaction occurring is: :NH4F + HF ‚Üí NH4HF2 It sublimes when heated‚Äîa property common among ammonium salts. In the sublimation, the salt decomposes to ammonia and hydrogen fluoride, and the two gases can recombine to give ammonium fluoride, i.e. the reaction is reversible: :[NH4]F ‚áå NH3 \\\\+ HF Uses This substance is commonly called \\"commercial ammonium fluoride\\". The word \\"neutral\\" is sometimes added to \\"ammonium fluoride\\" to represent the neutral salt‚Äî[NH4]F vs. the \\"acid salt\\" (NH4HF2). The acid salt is usually used in preference to the neutral salt in the etching of glass and related silicates. This property is shared among all soluble fluorides. For this reason it cannot be handled in glass test tubes or apparatus during laboratory work. It is also used for preserving wood, as a mothproofing agent, in printing and dying textiles, and as an antiseptic in breweries.

He was one of many monarchs who gained the epithet King of White Elephants (). He was the first Thai king to possess a \\"noble\\" or white elephant, which, according to Hindu belief, was a \\"glorious and happy sign\\". His reign was also known for a massive reforms of Thai bureaucracy and a successful campaign against Lan Na. He was also revered as one of the greatest monarchs of Thailand. King of Sukhothai Prince Ramesuan (not to be confused with King Ramesuan r. 1369‚Äì1370) was born in 1431 to King Borommarachathirat II or Chao Sam Phraya. Some authors claim that his mother was a princess of the Sukhothai Kingdom, daughter of Sai Lue Thai. According to historian Michael Vickery, however, this is not verifiable in historic sources and may be due to a misreading or misinterpretation of a chronicle. Be that as it may, Ramesuan was born at a time when the Kingdom of Sukhothai was increasingly tied to Ayutthaya, being under its suzerainty since 1412. When King Maha Thammaracha IV (Borommapan) of Sukhothai died in 1438, Borommaracha II of Ayutthaya annexed Sukhothai and installed his own son, then seven year old Prince Ramesuan, as viceroy (uparaja) of Sukhothai. When Ramesuan was 15 years old, the king sent him to Phitsanulok (which had replaced the city of Sukhothai as capital around 1430) to rule the former territories of Sukhothai which were now known as the \\"northern cities\\" (Mueang Nuea) and increase the control of the ruling family over them. Borommaracha II died in 1448, Prince Ramesuan was then crowned King Borommatrailokkanat of Ayutthaya, making a personal union between Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. Reforms = Bureaucracy = Borommatrailokkanat reformed the Thai bureaucracy ‚Äì the system lasted well into the 20th century. He separated civil and military officials, giving them titular ranks and feudal ranks to create the hierarchy of nobility, or life- nobles. He also established the mandalas: Inner Cities, Outer Cities, and Tributaries. He also stopped the tradition of appointing royal princes to govern cities, as they had always clashed with each other in times of succession. Borommatrailokkanat promulgated Ayutthayan Law in 1458. The traditional ministries of Thailand‚Äîthe Kalahom (predecessor of today's ministry of defence) and the Mahatthai (precursor of the ministry of interior)‚Äîwere introduced by Borommatrailokkanat. Originally they were meant to serve as simultaneous military and civil Greater Officers of State for the north and south, respectively. = Feudal rank = Also in his reign in 1454, the Thai royal and noble titles were first codified under the hierarchy system called sakdina. Each subject was given a numerical ranking corresponding to the number of rai of land he was entitled to. = Royal rank = Borommatrailokkanat adopted the position of Uparaja, translated as \\"Deputy- King\\", \\"viceroy\\" or \\"underking\\", usually held by the king's senior son, or full brother, or the sons of their queens, in an attempt to regularize the succession to the throne ‚Äî a particularly difficult feat for a polygamous dynasty. In practice, there was inherent conflict between king and uparaja and frequent disputed successions. He appointed his eldest son Uparaja of Ayutthaya while he lived in Phitsanulok for twenty-five years, keeping Chiang Mai under control. Eventually, a younger son was made the Uparaja of Phitsanulok, junior to the Uparaja of Ayutthaya. = Tributary relationships of Cities = In 1468, Borommatrailokkanat adopted a mandala tributary system, and ranked the cities recognizing him as overlord. Phitsanulok and Nakhon Sri Thamarat were listed among the eight great first-rank cities (Phraya maha nakhon). The mueangs Sing, In and Phrom were downgraded to be the level of four cities () under Lopburi. Governors of first class towns were chao phraya, second class were phraya, third class were phra, fourth class were luang, fifth class were khun, and sixth class were muen.  Foreign relations  In 1455, Borommatrailokkanat sent envoys to the Malacca Sultanate. The Thai had been suspicious of the sultanate since its conversion to Islam. The expedition was mentioned in Portuguese chronicles, written several years later, as not of great significance.http://www.bloggang.com/mainblog.php?id=rattanakosin225&month;=17-03-2007&group;=2&gblog;=16 Wars with Lan Na Yutthitthira, a Sukhothai royal and Boromtrailokkanat‚Äôs relative, was the king's close childhood friend. He himself had promised Yuttittira the title of uparaja. However, after Borommatrailokkanat‚Äôs reforms, Yuttittira ended up with the title of the Governor of Phichit. Yutthitthira then claimed to be the rightful king of Sukhothai. Lan Na under Tilokkarat was so powerful that he led armies down south to subjugate Ayutthaya. In 1456, Yutthitthira sought Tilokkarat‚Äôs support and led the Lan Na armies to capture Sukhothai and proceeded further towards Ayutthaya. Borommatrailokkanat, however, led armies to successfully defeat Lan Na. Tilokarat of mueang Chiang Mai, and Yutthitthira, governor of mueang Sawankhalok led the Lan Na armies to invade Ayutthaya but without achieving fruitful results and retreated. Trailokkanat then took this opportunity to retake Sukhothai. Borommatrailokkanat, upon seeing the seriousness of the wars, made Phitsanulok his base, moving the capital from Ayutthaya.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co. Ltd., Borommatrailokkanat, accompanied by more than 2000 followers, was the first Thai king to be ordained as a Buddhist monk. The ordination took place at Wat Chulamani, Phitsanulok, in 1461. In 1463, Lan Na invaded again. Borommatrailokkanat sent his son, Prince Intharacha, to crush the invading armies. Indraracha defeated Yutthitthira but was killed during battles against Nagara, Tilokkarat‚Äôs uncle. However, Lan Na was plunged by her own internal princely conflicts. In 1474, Borommatrailokkanat finally expelled Lan Na out of Ayutthaya territories. The next year, Tilokarat sought peace settlements. In Phitsanulok, Borommatrailokkanat ordered the establishment of new temples as well as the restoration of existing older ones. He ordered the construction of a cetiya and other buildings at Wat Ratchaburana, Phitsanulok, for example. Legacy In 1485, Borommatrailokkanat appointed his son Prince Chaiyachettha (later Ramathibodi II) as the Uparaja and King of Sukhothai. The title \\"King of Sukhothai\\" then became a title for Ayutthayan Crown Prince. However, upon Borommatrailokkanat's death in 1488, his two sons inherited the two kingdoms, thus separating the union once again. Among the institutions named for Borommatrailokkanat include: *Fort Borommatrailokkanat (Royal Thai Army Base) in Samo Khae, Phitsanulok Province.

Ushery co-anchors the 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. newscasts. An integral member of the NBC 4 New York News team, Ushery has covered many of the largest and most visible breaking news stories across the Tri-State region and around the world - including the terror attacks in Manchester, England, Orlando Florida and Paris France. Early life Ushery was born and raised in Bloomfield, Connecticut, the only child of Solomon Ushery and Winifred Ushery. The journalism bug bit early. At age 11, Ushery was selected from a statewide search to host the local edition of ‚ÄúKidsworld,‚Äù a nationally syndicated television show. One of his early interviews was with the late Walter Cronkite, the former CBS News anchor once ranked as the most trusted man in America. In what could be considered a prescient scene from that interview, young Ushery sits at the anchor desk. He asked Cronkite, ‚ÄúWhat kind of person should be a newscaster?‚Äù Cronkite responded that a person should have a sense of curiosity. Ushery has said of the interview: ‚ÄúMany have asked if I think that's when the seed was planted for me to become a television reporter and anchor. I say, YES.‚Äù Connecticut audiences would see Ushery grow up on television. He hosted ‚ÄúKidsworld‚Äù until he was 18. Ushery graduated from the University of Connecticut with a double major in political science and journalism. While at the university he was a staff writer for the Hartford Courant newspaper, where he honed his skills for covering local politics and events. He also reported for the Los Angeles Times.WNBC The CBS affiliate in Hartford, WFSB-TV, hired Ushery right after his graduation for its training program. But recognizing his talent, the station offered him a full-time general assignment reporting position within just a matter of months. Career As the lead reporter for WFSB‚Äôs 11pm broadcast, Ushery covered many stories impacting the everyday lives of the citizens of Connecticut‚Äôs capital city. But one of these stories made an indelible impression on Ushery: the night he and his photographer spent with residents of New Britain who were being terrorized by arsonists. Within two years of starting at the station, Ushery traveled to Moscow after the fall of the Soviet Union for a story on policing. The overseas trip would become the first of many in Ushery‚Äôs career, as news directors recognized his talent for covering international stories. In 1993, at the age of 25, Ushery was recruited by WABC-TV in New York City to join its staff as a general assignment reporter, covering news for the number one station in the top market in the nation. Since then, Ushery has been a familiar face to New York City viewers reporting on the city‚Äôs tragedies and triumphs. He was part of the station‚Äôs coverage of the police investigations into the shooting death of Amadou Diallo and the torture of Abner Louima, the deaths of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and John F. Kennedy, Jr. and September 11th terrorist attacks. He was on the team of reporters for WABC‚Äôs extended coverage of the celebrations for the Yankees World Series wins and the installation of Edward Cardinal Egan to lead New York City‚Äôs Archdiocese. WABC also sent Ushery on the road to cover world events including multiple reports from Haiti on the island‚Äôs political unrest, Pope John Paul II‚Äôs visits to Africa and Toronto, and the United Nation‚Äôs conference on racism in South Africa. Three years after arriving at WABC, Ushery was named anchor of a new weekend show, ‚ÄúEyewitness News This Morning.‚Äù He also anchored the weekday morning newscasts and the news at noon. Ushery was later named primary fill-in for the legendary anchor, the late Bill Beutel. Ushery spent 10 years at WABC. In 2003, he joined WNBC-TV to become the anchor of its highly rated morning newscast, \\"Weekend Today in New York.\\" The show's format of hard news and features, interviews and sports, allowed Ushery to display his versatility as a newsman. One year later, Ushery was also named anchor of WNBC's weekend 6pm and 11pm newscasts. These simultaneous appointments made Ushery in effect \\"the face\\" of WNBC during the weekend, anchoring all the station's morning and evening newscasts on Saturday and Sunday. In 2006, Ushery was named co-anchor of WNBC's iconic \\"Live at 5\\" program, alongside legendary anchor Sue Simmons. After a change of programming, Ushery returned to anchor the weekend broadcasts for \\"News 4 New York.\\" As an anchor at WNBC, he has steered coverage of some of the most memorable events in recent memory. In 2018, Ushery traveled to Houston, Texas to deliver live updates following the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush. Earlier that year, Ushery traveled to Jerusalem where he took Tri-State viewers to the opening of the new United States Embassy. He also took viewers to the front lines in Gaza and the West Bank, where massive protests led to confrontations with police. One year earlier, Ushery traveled to Israel to cover President Trump's visit to the Holy Land before quickly shifting his live reports to England, following the tragic bombing outside the Manchester sports arena. In June, 2016, Ushery traveled to Orlando to cover the tragic Pulse Nightclub shooting. One year prior, he reported from Paris following the city's deadly terrorist attacks. He also provided live coverage following the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, the miraculous emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in 2009 as well as multiple presidential elections. He made also made several trips to Rome to cover the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI; the 2013 papal conclave electing Pope Francis, the current Pope of the Catholic Church and the canonizations of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII. Ushery has also represented NBC Universal in national initiatives. He hosted the network's special program on its switch to digital in 2009, as well as \\"Going Green at Any Age,\\" which examined ways to help the environment. In 2009, Ushery conceived and launched ‚ÄúThe Debrief with David Ushery,‚Äù which has been called a must-watch program that was nominated for a 2011 Emmy Award. The weekly, half-hour broadcast gives viewers a unique perspective on important current events. According to the show's opening lines, ‚ÄúEight million stories in the naked city. And chances are you can only keep up with a fraction of them during your hectic day. Give us just a few minutes then to bring you up to speed on What New Yorkers are talking about.‚Äù Ushery takes a high-energy, unscripted approach for his interviews with reporters and newsmakers. Viewers are meant to feel part of the conversation about major stories. The show has garnered attention and praise for breaking boundaries and challenging long-held tenets of being an anchor. In ‚ÄúThe Debrief,‚Äù Ushery doesn't sit behind an anchor desk but rather moves freely around the News 4 newsroom, giving viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the operation. He also often goes tie-less, an informal look he sometimes wears when he anchors the more traditional evening newscasts.http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/the-anchor-drops-the- tie Ushery was noted for boldly venturing into uncharted territory for not wearing a tie. The no tie-look also caught the attention of other media, including the New York Times and NBC ‚ÄúNightly News‚Äù Anchor Brian Williams, who during a holiday television appearance with Ushery joked that viewers should consider giving Ushery a necktie. Even then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, at the annual Gracie Mansion holiday party for the press, called Ushery to the podium saying he ‚Äúwas really excited by ‚ÄòThe Debrief,‚Äô your new show about New York.‚Äù The Mayor also remarked that Ushery seemed a ‚Äúlittle underdressed.‚Äù Bloomberg whipped off his own tie and presented it to Ushery as a gift. In 2010, after a ‚ÄúDebrief‚Äù segment featuring blogging New York City mothers, Ushery developed and launched a spin-off program. ‚ÄúMoms and the City and a Dad named David,‚Äù features Ushery and three mothers offering a straightforward look at life in the city from a parent's point of view. Ushery has said the fourth mother on the program is New York City. The program airs on WNBC's New York Nonstop cable channel. NBCUniversal announced Ushery as the anchor of WNBC's 4 and 11 p.m. newscasts beginning in October 2020, as incumbent Stefan Holt returns to the company's Chicago station. Awards & Honors During his long career in New York City, Ushery has been recognized for his contributions to the community. In 1993, he won an award from the National Association of Black Journalists for his series of reports on children and violence. In 1999, The Network Journal, the Black Professionals and Small Business Magazine, named Ushery as one of its ‚Äú40 Under-Forty‚Äù for his significant accomplishments. In 2000, the Israeli Consulate in New York City honored Ushery for his dedicated reporting. And in 2010, Ushery was honored as a recipient of McDonald's Faces of Black History Award.http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/new-york-amsterdam- news/mi_8153/is_20091210/follow-star-holiday-season/ai_n50998920/ Life Ushery is married to TV producer Isabel Rivera.

Its name was taken from a bumper sticker reading \\"Visualize World Peace\\", which they twisted into \\"Visualize Whirled Peas\\". This led to bumper stickers with this phrase on it instead. The band released two albums in the mid-1990s, and played the Austin music scene before breaking up in 1996.  History  Members of the band first met at an Austin apartment complex in summer 1992. Robert Hembrook had just finished his service in the Army and was moving into Sandstone Apartments east of the University of Texas campus. George Pestana was living in the apartment complex and offered to help Hembrook move in. Part of Hembrook's belongings included a bass guitar and amplifier. Pestana mentioned that he was a drummer and that he knew a guitarist, Christoph Borst. Pestana suggested they all meet up to play and start a band. Hembrook had access to the Geology 100 Lecture hall on the ampus, so that became their rehearsal space through late 1992. The style favored more metal, led by Borst. These early efforts, along with attempts to add a second guitarist, did not gel, so Borst suggested the rhythm section continue with another guitarist, Ted James, who might fit better stylistically. James started his first band, Rattletrap, in 1992, playing bass guitar. He moved to Austin in October 1992 from Huntsville, Alabama. He was a huge fan of surf music, a style made popular in the 1960-1965 time frame by artists such as Duane Eddy, The Ventures and Dick Dale and the Deltones. James brought several arrangements to the band, and they began working on such tunes as Dick Dale's \\"Misirlou\\". Coincidentally, that tune was used to open Quentin Tarantino's movie Pulp Fiction. The band hoped that releasing it as a single would lead to some local success, but initial cassette and vinyl releases were met with little fanfare. James was the songwriting force behind the band, bringing in the basic chord sheets and working out leads. Hembrook and Pestana arranged their own parts. Hembrook took on the role of frontman, introducing the songs and providing chatter between songs, while changing instruments or tuning, etc. Studio work began on the first recording. This was released on cassette in 1993 as \\"Visualize Me Baby!\\". The recording was done by Hembrook, using rented equipment in a spacious North Austin practice space. The initial run of cassettes was sold at local gigs and attempts were made to sell them through local indie record stores. In 1994, the band went to Snooty Fox Studios in South Austin to record ten songs for what became War and Peas. War and Peas was recorded on 16 track ADAT, with 4 tracks for drums, one each for bass guitar and guitar (dry) with additional tracks open for guitar effects and vocals. Jennifer Summers was featured on a vocal arrangement of the Daniel Johnston song \\"Walking the Cow\\". This song, along with the REM cover \\"White Tornado\\" and Whirled Peas original \\"Loungitude\\", appeared on a compilation album mainly of songs originally by The Replacements called The Fans Hit Back in 1994. Reviews of the Whirled Peas portions of the tape were favorable. Mark Timmins, in The Skyway e-zine, wrote, \\"Ted feels that since his band Whirled Peas performs primarily sans vocalist, and that since every band covers an REM song at least once during their career, they thought they should record \\"White Tornado.\\" Whirled Peas' rendition of this instrumental by the band from Georgia is included. \\"Driver 8\\" without vocals just wouldn't cut it, I guess.... Their proclivity toward instrumentals notwithstanding, the band also offer up a rendition of the Daniel Johnston classic \\"Walking the Cow,\\" featuring Jenifer Sanders on vocals. A Whirled Peas original, \\"Loungitude,\\" rounds out the roster of their songs included on this tape. I get nightclub jitters just listening to it.Mark Timmins, Peas\\", The Skyway e-zine, 20 June 2004 War & Peas did not sell well in the blues-dominated Austin music scene. Whirled Peas continued to gig in Austin, supporting various members of the instrumental/surf/ska-punk scene. They had showcases at an out of the way venue during SXSW, and had opening gigs for a number of similar instrumental and rockabilly bands. James and Hembrook also played with the short-lived Austin \\"supergroup\\" called Selma, which made a recording of the Uncle Tupelo song \\"New Madrid\\". In March 1995, Pestana moved to Dallas. James and Hembrook decided to give up. James went on to found instrumental bands such as Squid Vicious, Johnny Vortex and The Nematoads. Hembrook and Pestana reunited in 1998 to form the rhythm section of Id, Ego, Superego which played South By Southwest in 1998 and broke up soon after. Pestana later played on and off with James, and currently drums with The Nematoads.

It is obtained by neutralizing chloric acid with either ammonia or ammonium carbonate, or by precipitating barium, strontium or calcium chlorates with ammonium carbonate or ammonium sulfate, producing the respective carbonate or sulfate precipitate and an ammonium chlorate solution. Ammonium chlorate crystallizes in small needles, readily soluble in water. The bitartrate method is a candidate for production and can be used if exotic chlorates are currently inaccessible or need to be synthesized. Warm solutions of potassium chlorate and ammonium bitartrate are needed in warm solutions. The latter can be synthesized by adding aqueous ammonia to an excess of tartaric acid. Then, a double displacement reaction will result in precipitation of potassium bitartrate. On heating, ammonium chlorate decomposes at about 102 ¬∞C, with liberation of nitrogen, chlorine and oxygen. It is soluble in dilute aqueous alcohol, but insoluble in strong alcohol. This compound is a powerful oxidizer and should never be stored with flammable materials, as it can easily form sensitive explosive compositions. Ammonium chlorate is a very unstable oxidizer and will decompose independently, sometimes violently, at room temperature. This results from the mixture of the reducing ammonium cation and the oxidizing chlorate anion. Even solutions are known to be unstable. Because of the dangerous nature of this salt it should only be kept in solution when needed, and never be allowed to crystallize.

He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education from the College of Education in 1935, at the height of the Great Depression.  Career  He briefly worked for his father's employer, Scranton Lace Company, then freighthopped to Chicago without telling his parents. Rodham found work there selling drapery fabrics around the Midwest, sending the money he made back home. In World War II Rodham served in the United States Navy. He became a Chief Petty Officer stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Station, performing training duties for sailors headed for the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. After the war, he established a successful career in the textile supply industry, starting with Rodrik Fabrics, a drapery fabric business located in Chicago's famous Merchandise Mart building. His company made draperies and window shades; customers included offices, hotels, airlines, and theaters. He later opened a fabric print plant building on the North Side. The couple lived in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago. Rodham entered politics once. Hoping to work his way into favor with the Cook County Democratic Party political machine in order to capitalize on a downtown investment he had made, he ran for Chicago alderman as a Democratic-leaning independent in 1947. The contest, held in Chicago's 49th Ward, was won by Frank Keenan, a Democratic ward committeeman running on the regular Democratic line, with 17,073 votes; a Republican, Joseph Reubens, finished second with 5,509 votes. Rodham finished fifth out of eight candidates with only 382 votes, or 1.5 percent of the total votes cast.

The presidential memorial includes the four blocks surrounding the home and a visitor center. Historic site In 1837, Lincoln moved to Springfield from New Salem at the start of his law career. He met his wife, Mary Todd, at her sister's home in Springfield and married there in 1842. The historic-site house at 413 South Eighth Street at the corner of Jackson Street, bought by Lincoln and his wife in 1844, was the only home that Lincoln ever owned. Three of their children were born there and one, Eddie, died there. The house contains twelve rooms spread over two floors. During the time he lived here, Lincoln was elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, and elected President in 1860. Lincoln's son, Robert Todd Lincoln donated the family home to the State of Illinois in 1887 under the condition that it would forever be well maintained and open to the public at no charge. This came as a result of tenants who would charge those who wanted to visit Lincoln's home and that many tenants tended to leave the home in disrepair. The home and Lincoln Tomb, also in Springfield, were designated National Historic Landmarks on December 19, 1960, and automatically listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The home and adjacent district became a National Historic Site on August 18, 1971 The National Parks: Index 2001‚Äì2003. Washington: U.S. Department of the Interior.

In order for a gift to be legally effective, three requirements must be met: # Intention of donor to give the gift to the donee (donative intent) # Delivery of gift to donee. # Acceptance of gift by donee. Elements =Intention= The donor of the gift must have a present intent to make a gift of the property to the donee. A promise to make a gift in the future is unenforceable, and legally meaningless, even if the promise is accompanied by a present transfer of the physical property in question. Suppose, for example, that a man gives a woman a ring and tells her that it is for her next birthday and to hold on to it until then. The man has not made a gift, and could legally demand the ring back at any time before the woman's birthday. In contrast, suppose a man gives a woman a deed and tells her it will be in her best interest if the deed stays in his safe-deposit box. The man has made a gift and would be unable to legally reclaim it. =Delivery= The gift must be delivered to the donee.For effective delivery of gift in Australia see: . If the gift is of a type that cannot be delivered in the conventional sense - a house, or a bank account - the delivery can be effected by a constructive delivery, wherein a tangible item allowing access to the gift - a deed or key to the house, a passbook for the bank account - is delivered instead. Symbolic delivery is also sometimes permissible where manual delivery is impractical, such as the delivery of a key that does not open anything, but is intended to symbolize the transfer of ownership. Certain forms of property must be transferred following particular formalities described by statute law. In England, real property must be transferred by a written deed. s.52 The transfer of equitable interests must be performed in writing by the owner or their agent. A gift is assumed when property owner deeds real estate as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. Regardless of contribution to purchase price, such a deed guarantees each tenant equal shares upon sale or partition of the property. =Acceptance= The donee must accept the gift in order for the property transfer to take place. However, because people generally accept gifts, acceptance will be presumed, so long as the donee does not expressly reject the gift. A rejection of the gift destroys the gift, so that a donee cannot revive a once-rejected gift by later accepting it. In order for such an acceptance to be effective, the donor would have to extend the offer of the gift again. Types Gifts can be either: =inter vivos= * lifetime gifts (inter vivos gift, donatio inter vivos) - a gift of a present or future interest made and delivered in the donor's lifetime; or =causa mortis= * deathbed gifts (gift causa mortis, donatio mortis causa) - a future gift made in expectation of the donor's imminent death. A gift causa mortis is not effective unless the donor dies of the impending peril that he or she had contemplated when making the gift, i.e. these gifts can only be made when the donor is in a terminal condition. Gifts can also be: =outright= * outright - made free of any restrictions, such as being subject to a trust; =onerous= * onerous - made with a burden or obligation imposed on the donee; or =remunerative= * remunerative - made to compensate for services rendered Revocation Conditional gifts can be revoked based on (1) donee not fulfilling the conditions (2) breach of contract by donor such as an engagement ring and in this case, the donee keeps the gift. Taxation = In India= In India, previously there was Gift Tax Act under which donor had to pay the gift tax on the amount of gift. However, the said Act has been abolished and from FY 2004-05, a new provision was inserted in the Income Tax Act (1961) under section 56 (2) which provides that if the gift is received by an individual or Hindu undivided family from any relatives or blood relatives or at the time of marriage or as inheritance or in contemplation of death, it will not be taxable. In all other cases if the aggregagte of gifts received exceeds Rs 50,000 in a year, the gift will be taxable as income from other source. =United Kingdom= Gifts into a trust above a certain value (known as the nil rate band which is currently ¬£325,000 but this limit may be reduced by certain gifts made in the last 7 years) are generally subject to inheritance tax in the United Kingdom though at the reduced rate of inheritance tax of 20% rather than the full rate of 40%. There are certain reliefs that may apply to reduce or eliminate the IHT due including business property relief and agricultural property relief. Gifts to individuals are generally not subject to inheritance tax unless the donor dies within 7 years of the date of the gift. There is anti-avoidance legislation to prevent assets being gifted but with the donor retaining a benefit from the asset (for example the gift of the main residence while continuing to live in it will be ineffective from an IHT perspective unless market value rent is charged). Gifts in life may be a way to circumvent inheritance tax on death. =In the United States= See also * Re Cole. * * Knapp v Knapp * Gift tax References Category:Property law Category:Giving ","title":"Gift (law)"},{"id":"2088074","text":"The 12903 / 12904 Golden Temple Mail is a superfast express train belonging to Indian Railways that runs daily between Mumbai Central (MMCT) in Maharashtra and Amritsar Junction (ASR) in Punjab. It is named after the famous Golden Temple at Amritsar. The train will run with modern LHB coaches from 29th September 2020. The train ran as the Frontier Mail between 1928 and 1996, ferrying passengers arriving by Steamer from Europe directly from Ballard Pier in Bombay to the city of Peshawar on India's North-West Frontier before the Partition of India.http://www.irfca.org/~shankie/famoustrains/famtrainfrontier.htm It operates as train number 12903 from Mumbai Central to Amritsar Junction and as train number 12904 in the reverse direction.

Prior the Partition of India, it would run up to Peshawar on British India's frontier with Afghanistan from which it derived its name. During the autumn months between September and December, the train used to depart from the Ballard Pier Mole station. This was for the convenience of the British who arrived in India by steamer. The Frontier Mail also finds a place in romanticised biographies of film actor Prithviraj Kapoor who is believed to have travelled to Bombay from his hometown of Peshawar by the Frontier Mail in 1928 to act in films. Hunterwali, probably India's first action heroine, has acted in the film Miss Frontier Mail. The Frontier Mail was the first air conditioned train in the Indian Peninsula, when it got an air-conditioned compartment in 1934. The radio facility was provided for the first time in the Golden Temple Mail. Coaches The 12903/04 Golden Temple Mail has 1 AC First Cum AC 2 Tier, 2 AC 2 tier, 5 AC 3 tier, 1 Sleeper Class, 2 General unreserved coaches, 2 General cum baggage coaches.

The fifth coach remained on the line but was slightly damaged, and the remaining 8 coaches remained on the line undamaged. The engines of the two trains and goods wagons are reported to have suffered hardly any damage. One, Shri Shiv Charan Singh, retired Principal oi Government College, Rupar, a II class passenger in the third coach, unfortunately died, and thirty-four other passengers holding different classes of tickets received minor injuries. https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55981/1/lsd_01_09_22-03-1955.pdf Page no. 50 Traction Earlier Dual traction WCAM 2/2P locos would haul the train between Mumbai Central and Vadodara after which a Vadodara based WAP 4 would take over until Amritsar.

He was made a cardinal in 1965. Early life He was born on 11 October 1905 in Saint-Amant-Tallende, Puy-de-D√¥me, to Joseph and Marie (n√©e Laville) Villot; he was an only child. Before serving in the military until 2 August 1924, he studied for the priesthood in Riom, Clermont, and Lyon. He became a Marist novice on 7 September 1925, but left the order three months later. He then studied at the Catholic Institute of Paris and the Pontifical Athenaeum Angelicum in Rome, where he earned a licentiate in canon law and a doctorate in sacred theology in 1934 with a thesis entitled Le pape Nicolas II et le d√©cret de 1059 sur l'√©lection pontificale.\\"The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church\\". Biographical Dictionary (1903-2011). Ch. V. fiu.edu Priesthood He was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Paris on 19 April 1930 by Archbishop Alfred-Henri-Marie Baudrillart, rector of the Institut Catholique. From 1931 to 1934, he served as secretary to Pierre-Marie Gerlier, Bishop of Tarbes-et-Lourdes. He taught at the Clermont seminary and the Catholic University in Lyon, serving as vice-rector of the latter from 1942 to 1950. At the start of 1950 he was incardinated into the Archdiocese of Lyon. Bishop Coat of arms of Cardinal Villot during the vacancies of the papacy in 1978 Pope Pius XII appointed Villot auxiliary bishop of Paris and titular bishop of Vinda on 2 September 1954. He received his episcopal consecration on 12 October from Cardinal Maurice Feltin, with Archbishop Emile Guerry of Cambrai and Bishop Pierre de la Chanonie of Clermont as co- consecrators. On 17 December 1959, he was named Coadjutor Archbishop of Lyon and titular archbishop of Bosporus. He succeeded Cardinal Gerlier as Archbishop of Lyon on 17 January 1965. During the Second Vatican Council, he served as one of several of the Council's undersecretaries, where his performance impressed Pope Paul. Cardinal On 22 February 1965, he was created Cardinal-Priest of SS. Trinit√† al Monte Pincio by Pope Paul VI. He was named Prefect of the Congregation of the Council (later renamed the Congregation for the Clergy) on 7 April 1967. Two years later, on 2 May 1969, he was named Cardinal Secretary of State as part of Pope Paul's program to internationalize the Roman Curia. Though Villot told reporters \\"I have long been a Roman at heart\\", his appointment was resented by the Italians though without public conflict. Pope Paul underscored his stance by adding to Villot's portfolio in May 1969, naming him head of the Section if the Secretariat of State responsible for foreign affairs, expanding his control over broader curia by making him President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See. Villot was named Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church on 16 October 1970, the first non-Italian to hold the office in half a millennium, a further testament of Pope Paul's insistence on expanding the role of non-Italians at the highest levels of the Vatican bureaucracy. On 15 July 1971, he was appointed President of the newly formed Pontifical Council Cor Unum, a position he resigned on 4 September 1978, during the brief pontificate of Pope John Paul I. Pope Paul elevated him to Cardinal Bishop of Frascati on 12 December 1974. Villot was present at the death of Paul VI in Castel Gandolfo on 6 August 1978. Pope John Paul I retained Villot as Secretary of State. When Pope John Paul II announced he would retain Villot as Secretary of State, he made clear the appointment was short-term but also confirmed Villot in his other positions. He noted that Villot himself had suggested that the first non-Italian pope in centuries might want an Italian as his Secretary of State. He was replaced as Secretary of State nine months later on 1 July 1979. Villot participated as a cardinal elector in both the August and October conclaves of 1978, which elected John Paul I and John Paul II respectively, and presided at the conclaves because he was the senior cardinal bishop in attendance. As Camerlengo he acted as the interim administrator of the Holy See in the interregnums of 1978.

The test identifies signifiers as well as their signifieds, value and significance. The commutation test This test is a metalingual subjective system for analysing textual or other material. It has evolved from a limited method for investigating the structure of individual signs (per Roman Jakobson). Its primary uses are to: *identify distinctive signifiers, *define their significance, and *divide material into paradigmatic classes and identify the codes to which the signifiers belong (Roland Barthes). The initial assumption is that the communication to be analysed represents both a cognitive use of the sign system and a statement that refers to the values of the addresser. The purpose of the test is therefore to illuminate the addresser's intention in using the code in this particular way. It works through a process of substitution, assessing the extent to which a change in the signifier leads to a change in the signified. The first step, therefore, is to exclude one signifier from the material to be analysed. This is a test of redundancy: to identify what meaning is lost (if any) by omitting that sign. It will be relatively unusual to find that one sign is completely superfluous, but more common to find that the contribution of the one sign to the whole meaning is relatively weak. The weakness or strength of its contribution can be calibrated more exactly by placing alternate (synonymous and antonymous) signs in the context. This will enable the analyst to make a judgment on the distinctiveness of the particular signifier chosen by the author/artist and of its value to the meaning, i.e. as more or less necessary for maintaining the meaning and/or rule structure in different occurrences. By changing the collocation between two of the existing signifiers, and so changing their original relationship, the relative significance of each signifier can be considered. Further, by also placing the original sign into different contexts, it can be seen whether the sign becomes more or less distinctive. The process The nature of the process will be determined by the form of the media to be analysed. In textual or pictorial media where individuals are the theme of the content, this might involve a substitution of words that are synonymous, or of imagery parallel in classes representing age, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc. to assess the extent to which overall meaning is affected. In visual media generally, substituting different mise en sc√®nes or backgrounds may change the significance of objects or people in the foreground. Colour selections may affect the perceived attractiveness of the scene or of individuals whose clothing is changed. The presence or absence of branded or generic goods, of stylish or outmoded clothing, etc. may help to suggest the contribution of the original signifier. According to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm: *Paradigmatic transformations **substitution; **transposition *Syntagmatic transformations **addition; **deletion. An example Take the phrase: :the man hit the boy. Now substitute \\"boy\\" with \\"baby\\", \\"girl\\", \\"child\\", \\"pansy\\", \\"thief\\". Each of these alternatives affects the implication of the phrase. A \\"man\\" rather than a father or parent randomly striking a baby or girl might be considered sexist and a crime. If the boy was a thief, this would explain but not excuse the man's behaviour as retaliation or revenge. If the boy is a pansy which has pejorative connotations of cowardice or homosexuality, the man may be intolerant or overly judgemental but the victim is also presented in a less sympathetic way. The use of child not differentiated by gender is a more common usage in the context of paedophilia. When the signifiers of boy and man are transposed, the relative inequality in strength is also reversed and the interpretation shifts to more playful and less threatening images. Hence, the subjective view may be that the phrase as originally conceived was the most neutral of the possible formulations given the original form. If we now contextualise the image in a school, seminary, prison, training gym or home environment different sets of meanings emerge depending on the presence or absence of other signifiers demonstrating the relationship between the protagonists, the time the image was created (a Victorian image of corporal punishment in a school would have a different significance from a more recent image of judicial caning in Britain, Canada or Singapore), the nature of the activity (e.g. a boxing training session or a game of tennis in which the blow is struck accidentally, etc.), the presence or absence of other people, etc.. The values are therefore added or subtracted according to the presence or absence of other signifiers. Discussion The first stage of development in semiotics related to the spoken and/or written form of language. Later, it was expanded to cover all sign systems that have an informational content. As Umberto Eco says, \\"A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else.\\" (1976) Semiotics studies the relationship between the form of the sign (the signifier) and the meaning expressed (the signified), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating understanding. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common code, Hence, language evolves dynamically. The community will identify a lexical thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a signal) will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that it can be used to convey, one or more will be selected and encoded, i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be denoted or associated with the sign within the broader framework of syntactic and semantic systems available within the community. When the audience is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As Roman Jakobson adds, there will also be an emotional element or value which represents the addresser's attitude towards the thing. This will either become a connotative meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser. In lexicography, the fact that a neologism is used marks its acceptance into the language. This will not be a difficult process so long as each sign has a limited and immediately useful meaning. The problem arises when several possible meanings or shades of meaning become associated with the sign. This is a shift from denotational to connotational meanings. Rules of interpretation are required to resolve uncertainty. Within the community, such rules are, for the most part, experiential and applied without conscious control. Members of a community have a shared memory of language patterns and norms which, for the most part, are stable over long periods of time. Individuals are therefore able to build up a cognitive framework which identifies the possible meanings from any grouping of signs and selects one considered the most appropriate from the context. This intuitive system is continuously tested through the audience's responses. If the responses are satisfying, intuition prevails. If the responses are obviously inappropriate, the audience will consciously review the thought process and decide whether to modify the framework. Semiotics has developed a more precise methodology for this interpretive process, seeking to expose the unstated habitual practices for interpreting signifiers. References *Barthes, Roland.

He was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1973. Savon shared the Ukrainian Chess Championship in 1969 and won the USSR Championship in 1971. He competed in the 1972 Chess Olympiad.  Biography  Born in Chernigov, he learned how to play at the age of 13. Savon competed in the Soviet championship eleven times, from 1961 (at age 21) to the last championship in 1991. His best result was his first place in the 1971 championship with an undefeated 15/21. Only an international master, he finished 1.5 points ahead of former world champions Mikhail Tal and Vasily Smyslov. Future world champion Anatoly Karpov finished another half point back.Cafferty and Taimanov, p. 154. Taimanov and Bernard Cafferty, in their book on the Soviet championships, described Savon's win \\"the least plausible result for decades\\". One possible factor was the distraction of Fischer's Candidates matches. It was claimed that Fischer's 6‚Äì0 wins against Larsen and Taimanov had hypnotised the top Soviet players, who were now following Petrosian's similar demise in the Candidates match that was to finish only days after this tournament. Savon's next-best result in the Soviet championship came the following year, when he tied for 3rd‚Äì5th and qualified for the Interzonal.Cafferty and Taimanov, pp. 157‚Äì58. He did, however, achieve other good results in international competition; at Debrecen in 1970 (1st= with Bilek), at Sukhumi 1972 (2nd after Tal), at Vilnius 1975 (1st=), at Portoro≈æ 1977 (2nd= with Hort, after Larsen) and at Kiev 1978 (2nd=). FIDE awarded Savon the International Master title in 1967, and the International Grandmaster title in 1973. In the latter year, he finished eighth out of 18 at the Petropolis Interzonal. He shared the title of Ukrainian Champion with Gennady Kuzmin in 1969. He died in Kharkiv at the age of 65.

Canessa (born 1980) was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, representing the 12th Bristol District. He resigned to accept the position of executive director for government affairs at Southcoast Health Systems. He is a member of the United States Democratic Party. Rep. Canessa's district includes East Freetown, Lakeville, Middleborough, East Taunton, and New Bedford, Massachusetts. He is a graduate of Apponequet Regional High School and Bridgewater State College, and completed his MBA at Suffolk University. Prior to being elected to the house in 2004, he was a member of the Lakeville School Committee from 2001 - 2004. Legislation and Positions =Anti-Gang Bill= In January 2006, in response to gang violence and witness intimidation in his district and across the state, Rep. Canessa co-sponsored a bill with Senator Jarrett Barrios, entitled \\"An Act to Reduce Gang Violence in the Commonwealth,\\" that would establish a witness protection program to encourage witnesses to come forward and to testify accurately. It passed unanimously in the Senate, was approved in the House with 151 yeas to 2 nays and was signed into law by Gov. Mitt Romney shortly thereafter. Provisions The bill, publicized mainly for the establishment of a witness protection program, included the following provisions: *Establishes a statewide witness protection program, *Increases punishment for illegal firearm possession, and for the possession of a loaded firearm by individuals who violate certain aspects of the bill *Allows judges to prevent the defense from obtaining grand jury witness statements, providing that \\"there is a reason to believe...that the defendant poses a threat to a witness or victim\\" *Allows restrictions on communication with witnesses by the accused *Increases punishment for witness intimidation *Lessens the requirements for a perjury conviction Support Proponents tout the bill as a welcome and needed step toward reducing witness intimidation, especially by gang members awaiting trial. Family members of gang violence victims praised the bill, and many were present at the Massachusetts State House for its passage into law. Opposition The ACLU and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers opposed sections of the bill that allow judges to bar defendants from seeing grand jury witness statements, and that reduce the requirements for a perjury conviction. Specifically, they point to a possible conflict with the 6th Amendment, which states in part: > In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right...to be > confronted with the witnesses against him... It is the subject of continuing debate whether sections of the bill violate this Amendment. =Southcoast Commuter Rail= Rep. Canessa has expressed support for the expansion of the MBTA Commuter Rail into the Southcoast area including New Bedford, which is part of the district he represents. The federal Transportation Equity Act of 2005 set aside $20 million for the project, and in August of that year, Canessa joined area senators and representatives in urging Governor Romney to \\"make this project a legitimate, top priority.\\" =Invasive Weeds= Long Pond and other water supplies in towns across Canessa's district have recently been noted as being overrun by invasive weeds such as milfoil. In 2005, acknowledging that these weeds can pose a risk to the environment and to the towns' drinking water, he supported studies into the weeds and their impact.

It formed a primary defensive position for the Union Army during the battle, roughly the center of what is popularly known as the \\"fish-hook\\" line. The Confederate States Army launched attacks on the Union positions on the second and third days of the battle, but were driven back both times. Description The ridge rises only about above the surrounding terrain and is under long. The northern end rises to become Cemetery Hill, the southern descends to low, wooded, and sometimes marshy ground just north of Little Round Top. At the northern end of Cemetery Ridge is a copse of trees and a low stone wall that makes two 90-degree turns; the latter has been nicknamed The Angle and is also referred to as the High Water Mark of the Confederacy. This area, and the nearby Codori Farm on Emmitsburg Road, were prominent features in the progress of Pickett's Charge during the third day of battle, as well as Major General Richard H. Anderson's division assault on the second.Imhof, pp. 8-9. American Civil War Overview map of the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 3, 1863. Cemetery Ridge is located slightly left of center. On the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Cemetery Ridge was unoccupied for much of the day until the Union army retreated from its positions north of town, when the divisions of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson and Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday from the I Corps were placed on the northern end of the ridge, protecting the left flank of the XI Corps on Cemetery Hill. After the XII Corps arrived, Maj. Gen. John W. Geary's Second Division was sent to the southern end of the ridge near Little Round Top; Brig. Gen. John Buford's cavalry division formed a skirmish line in the fields between Cemetery Ridge and Seminary Ridge. The III Corps arrived about 8 p.m. and replaced Geary's division (which was sent to Culp's Hill); the II Corps arrived about 10:30 p.m. and camped immediately behind the III Corps.Martin, p. 546, 551; Pfanz, p. 39. During the morning of the battle's 2nd day (July 2), Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade shifted units to receive an expected Confederate attack on his positions. The II Corps was placed in the center of Cemetery Ridge, with Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays's division on the corps' right, John Gibbon's division in the center around the Angle, and John C. Caldwell's division on the left, adjacent to the III Corps; Robinson's division of the I Corps was placed in reserve behind the XI Corps. The V Corps was formed in reserve behind the II Corps.Pfanz, p. 63, 68, 72. In the late afternoon, the end of the Confederate Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's assault drove portions of Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps line back to the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, and Brig. Gen. Ambrose Wright's Confederate brigade temporarily captured the southern end of the Angle before being driven back to Seminary Ridge by the Philadelphia Brigade.Imhof, pp. 40, 162, 200, 217. The Confederate artillery bombardment preceding Pickett's Charge on July 3 battered Cemetery Ridge, and Union artillery on the ridge counterfired to Seminary Ridge. Thirty-four Union cannons were disabled, but the three Confederate divisions of the subsequent infantry assault (Pickett's of the First Corps and Pettigrew's and Trimble's of the Third Corps), attacked the Union II Corps at the \\"stone fence\\" at the Angle.Haskell, p. 83 Heavy rifle and artillery fire prevented all but about 250 Confederates led by Lewis Armistead from penetrating the Union line to the high water mark of the Confederacy. Armistead was mortally wounded. Two brigades of Anderson's Division, assigned to protect Pickett's right flank during the charge, reached a more southern portion of the Union line at Cemetery Ridge soon after the repulse of Pickett's Division, but were driven back with 40% casualties by the 2nd Vermont Brigade.Wertz, pp. 239-42. Postbellum history The Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association purchased rights-of-way for an avenue and monuments along the ridge, and the 1884 Round Top Branch steam railroad was built across the southern end of Cemetery Ridge. The 1893 Gettysburg Electric Railway was built across the north end of the ridge, and several Gettysburg Battlefield camps after the American Civil War used the ridge's west slope at the Angle (e.g., for Eisenhower's 1918 Camp Colt and during the 1938 Gettysburg reunion). The 1962 Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg with observation deck replaced the 1896 observation tower at the ridge's Zeigler's Grove, but was closed in 2008.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers, Miami Marlins, and Detroit Tigers. Wolf graduated from El Camino Real in Woodland Hills, California. He was drafted by the Dodgers in 1994, but he did not sign. He played college baseball for Pepperdine University and then was drafted by the Phillies in 1997. He made his MLB debut in 1999. In 2003, Wolf was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Early life Wolf was born on August 22, 1976 in Canoga Park, California. He played PONY League Baseball in West Hills, California. He played high school baseball at El Camino Real in Woodland Hills, California, where he was named High School \\"Pitcher of the Year\\" by the Los Angeles Times in 1993, and \\"Player of the Year\\" in 1994. Wolf continued his amateur career at Pepperdine University where he was a freshman first-team All-America, West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year, second-team college All-American, and a West Coast Conference All-Star. Draft and minor leagues Wolf was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 25th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign. He was then drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the second round of the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft. He rose through the minor leagues quickly, including stops with Single-A Batavia (1997, 4‚Äì0, 1.58, 7 starts), Double-A Reading (1998, 2‚Äì0, 1.44, 4 starts), and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre (1998, 9‚Äì7, 4.62, 23 starts & 1999, 4‚Äì5, 3.61, 12 starts). Major league career Wolf pitching for the Dodgers in Spring 2007. =Philadelphia Phillies= Wolf made his major-league debut on June 11, 1999, against the Toronto Blue Jays, pitching 5 innings, giving up one run, and recording his first career victory in the Phillies 8‚Äì4 win over Toronto. He finished his first season with a 6-9 record and a 5.55 ERA. In his second season, Wolf was embedded in the rotation and was a mainstay the entire season, going 11-9 in 32 starts. He followed the next couple of seasons winning 10 and 11 games respectively in the years 2001 and 2002. In 2003, Wolf was selected to the National League All-Star team and finished the year with a career-high 16 wins. On August 11, 2004, Wolf hit two home runs while pitching the Phillies to a 15‚Äì4 win against the Colorado Rockies. On July 1, 2005, Wolf underwent Tommy John surgery, missing the remainder of the season and the first half of the 2006 season. He made his return to the Phillies' rotation on July 30, 2006. He finished the 2006 season with a 4‚Äì0 record, pitching only 55 innings. During his time with the Phillies, Wolf was supported at every home start by a fan group, ‚ÄúThe Wolf Pack,‚Äù founded by eight brothers and their four cousins. The group, sporting wolf masks, assembled in the typically empty upper deck of Veterans Stadium and celebrated Wolf strikeouts by howling and dancing. Wolf befriended members of the group and kept in contact even after leaving the Phillies in 2006. The Wolf Pack returned to Citizens Bank Park in 2016 for Wolf‚Äôs retirement ceremony and performed a dance on top of the Phillies dugout with the Phillie Phanatic. After the 2006 season Wolf's contract with the Phillies expired and he became a free agent. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Wolf signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Wolf started 18 games, going 9-6. On July 4, 2007, Wolf went on the 15-day disabled list due to left shoulder soreness. He underwent shoulder surgery and missed the rest of the season. On November 1, the Dodgers bought out his 2008 option and allowed Wolf to become a free agent. =San Diego Padres= On December 1, 2007, Wolf signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Padres. On April 15, 2008, Wolf had a no-hitter through 6 innings against the Colorado Rockies at Petco Park before Brad Hawpe hit a single. =Houston Astros= On July 22, 2008, Wolf was traded to the Houston Astros for Chad Reineke. =Second stint with the Los Angeles Dodgers= On February 6, 2009, Wolf signed a one-year, $5 million contract to return to the Dodgers. He turned in one of his best seasons, finishing 11‚Äì7 with a 3.23 ERA in 34 starts for the team. =Milwaukee Brewers= On December 14, 2009, Wolf agreed to a three-year, $29.75 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. In 2010, Wolf finished 13‚Äì12 in 34 starts. In 2011, he started 33 games (4th in the National League) and was 13‚Äì10, with a 3.69 ERA. Through 2011, his 9 career shutouts were 6th-most of all active pitchers. On October 13 in the 2011 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, Randy Wolf won his first career postseason start. With this victory, Wolf is no longer the active leader in career games started without a postseason win. The Brewers lost the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals in 6 games.

In his debut, he pitched seven innings, allowing four runs, three earned, on nine hits, with five strikeouts and no walks. Eight of Texas' first 14 batters singled against him, before retiring 14 of the final 15 batters he faced. Wolf appeared in a total of 8 games with the Tigers, pitching to an 0-5 record with a 6.23 ERA. Wolf retired during the offseason, following a 16-year career. Scouting report Wolf threw a four-seam fastball and a two-seam fastball clocked at 87‚Äì90 mph. He also threw a cut fastball in the mid-80s, a late breaking slider in the upper 70s, a sweeping curveball in the upper 60s to lower 70s, and occasionally mixed in a changeup in the upper 70s. Wolf primarily pitched to contact for fly balls, though he was capable of racking up strikeouts in his starts. Personal life Wolf's older brother, Jim, is a Major League umpire.Jim Wolf's official MLB.com profile MLB.com To avoid potential conflicts of interest, Jim did not work behind the plate during his brother's starts. Eventually Jim would not officiate in any capacity in games Randy's team were playing. If his crew was involved in games that included Randy's team, he was removed from those games and switched with another umpire. Wolf's cousin, Sid Akins, is a retired professional baseball player who appeared in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 2007, Wolf purchased a house in Los Angeles' Hollywood Hills from rocker Slash.

Lawrie was educated in Edinburgh, and came to Canada in 1893. He worked as an implement dealer and insurance broker, also served as a police magistrate and commissioner. In 1907, he married May Clegg. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1936 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal-Progressive candidate John Muirhead by 82 votes in the constituency of Norfolk. The Conservatives were the primary opposition party in Manitoba during this period, and Lawrie sat with his party on the opposition benches. In 1940, the Liberal-Progressives and Conservatives joined together in a wartime coalition government. This arrangement did not prevent the parties from fielding candidates against one another in the 1941 election, however; Lawrie again faced John Muirhead, and won by only 44 votes. He served as a government backbencher for the remainder of his tenure in the legislature. In the 1945 election, he defeated a candidate of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation.

The system provides increased communications capabilities to newer, smaller terminals while still supporting interoperability with legacy terminals. MUOS is designed to support users who require greater mobility, higher bit rates and improved operational availability. Overview Installing a MUOS satellite dish in Hawaii The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) is an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) (300 MHz to 3 GHz frequency range) SATCOM system, primarily serving the United States Department of Defense (DoD). International allies use is under consideration. The MUOS will replace the legacy UHF Follow-On (UFO) system before that system reaches its end of life to provide users with new capabilities and enhanced mobility, access, capacity, and quality of service. Intended primarily for mobile users (e.g. aerial and maritime platforms, ground vehicles, and dismounted soldiers), MUOS will extend users' voice, data, and video communications beyond their lines-of-sight.Military Communications Satellite System Multiplies UHF Channel Capacity for Mobile Users , a Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) design study. MUOS is an array of geosynchronousGeosynchronous Satellites for MUOS Samuel J. MacMullan, Christopher J. Karpinsky, Reuben E. Eaves, Andre R. Dion; M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory, 1999. satellites that will provide global satellite communications (SATCOM) narrowband connectivity for communications use by the United States at data rates up to 384kbit/s. The program will deliver five satellites, four ground stations, and a terrestrial transport network at a cost of US$7.34 billion. The Navy's Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW 146)Fact Sheet, Navy Communications Satellite Programs. of the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Space Systems in San Diego is lead developer for the MUOS Program. Lockheed Martin is the Prime System Contractor and satellite designer for MUOS under U.S Navy Contract N00039-04-C-2009,SPAWAR N0003904C2009 Contract Award Announcement .DoD Contract Awards for September 24, 2004. which was announced September 24, 2004. Key subcontractors include General Dynamics Mission Systems (Ground Transport architecture), Boeing (Legacy UFO and portions of the WCDMA payload) and Harris (deployable mesh reflectors). Full on-orbit capability is expected by 2015. =WCDMA system= The MUOS operates as a global cellular service provider to support the war fighter with modern cell phone-like capabilities, such as multimedia. It converts a commercial third generation (3G) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) cellular phone system to a military UHF SATCOM radio system using geosynchronous satellites in place of cell towers. By operating in the UHF frequency band, a lower frequency band than that used by conventional terrestrial cellular networks, the MUOS provides warfighters with the tactical ability to communicate in \\"disadvantaged\\" environments, such as heavily forested regions where higher frequency signals would be unacceptably attenuated by the forest canopy. The MUOS constellation will consist of four operational satellites and one on- orbit spare. MUOS will provide military point-to-point and netted communication users with precedence-based and pre-emptive access to voice, data, video, or a mixture of voice and data services that span the globe. Connections may be set up on demand by users in the field, within seconds, and then released just as easily, freeing resources for other users. In alignment with more traditional military communications methods, pre-planned networks can also be established either permanently or per specific schedule using the MUOS' ground-based Network Management Center. =Legacy payload= In addition to the cellular MUOS WCDMA payload, a fully capable and separate UFO legacy payload is incorporated into each satellite. The \\"Legacy\\" payload extends the useful life of legacy UHF SATCOM terminals and enables a smoother transition to MUOS. Launches After several range weather delays, the first MUOS satellite, MUOS-1, launched into space successfully on February 24, 2012, carried by an Atlas V rocket flying in its 551 configuration. MUOS-2 launched on schedule on July 19, 2013, at 13:00 UTC aboard an Atlas V 551 (AV-040). MUOS-3 was launched on board a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket on January 20, 2015, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. MUOS-4 arrived at Cape Canaveral July 31, 2015. Weather conditions pushed back the launch, which was originally scheduled for August 31, 2015, at 10:07 UTC. The launch took place September 2, 2015, at 10:18 UTC. MUOS-5 arrived at Cape Canaveral on March 9, 2016. Launch was originally scheduled for May 5, 2016, but due to an internal investigation into an Atlas V fuel system problem during the Cygnus OA-6 launch on March 22, the scheduled date was pushed back. The launch took place on June 24, 2016, at 14:30 UTC. An \\"anomaly\\" aboard the satellite occurred a few days later, however, when it was still in a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO), leaving it \\"Reconfigured into Safe Intermediate Orbit\\", or stranded in GTO. Amateur observers tracked it in an orbit of approximately since July 3, 2016. On November 3, 2016 the Navy announced that the satellite has finally reached operational orbit. MUOS operational positions The four currently operational MUOS satellites are stationed at longitude 177¬∞ W (MUOS 1); 100¬∞ W (MUOS 2); 15.5¬∞ W (MUOS 3); and 75¬∞ E (MUOS 4). MUOS 5 was intended for longitude 72¬∞ E. They have a 5¬∞ orbital inclination. In the first few months after launch, the satellites were temporarily parked in a check-out position at longitude 172¬∞ W. MUOS ground stations MUOS ground station in Wahiawa, Hawaii The MUOS will include four ground station facilities. Site selections were completed in 2007 with the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the U.S. Navy and the Australian Department of Defence. The four ground stations, each of which serves one of the four active satellites of the MUOS constellation will be located at: the Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station at Kojarena about 30 km east of Geraldton, Western Australia; Naval Radio Transmitter Facility (NRTF) Niscemi about 60 km from Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, Italy; Naval SATCOM Facility, Northwest Chesapeake, Southeast Virginia at ; and the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific, Hawaii. =Controversy= Construction of the ground station in Italy was halted for nearly half of 2012 by protesters concerned with health risks and environmental damage by radio waves. One scientific study 'point[s] to serious risks to people and the environment, such as to prevent its realization in densely populated areas, like the one adjacent to the town of Niscemi.' Risk Analysis Turin University The system is not considered fully operational until all four ground stations are completed and turned over to the Navy. The other ground stations were turned over in 2012 and 2013. In spite of the controversy, the site at Niscemi was completed in anticipation of the launch of MUOS-4. Radio terminals The MUOS Waveform with complete red/black operational capability was released in 2012. Until the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program cancellation in 2011, the JTRS program would provide the DoD terminals that can communicate with the MUOS WCDMA waveform with a series of form-factor models. The JTRS Handheld, Manpack & Small Form Fit (HMS) AN/PRC-155 manpack built by General Dynamics Mission Systems survived the wider JTRS program cancellation and has shipped several low rate of initial production (LRIP) units.

Although the trachea is usually considered part of the lower respiratory tract, in ICD-10 tracheitis is classified under \\"acute upper respiratory infections\\". Symptoms *Increasing deep or barking croup cough following a recent upper respiratory infection *Crowing sound when inhaling (inspiratory stridor) *'Scratchy' feeling in the throat *Chest pain *Fever *Ear ache *Headache *Dizziness (light headed) *Labored breathing Causes Bacterial tracheitis is a bacterial infection of the trachea and is capable of producing airway obstruction. One of the most common causes is Staphylococcus aureus and often follows a recent viral upper respiratory infection. Bacterial tracheitis is a rare complication of influenza infection. It is the most serious in young children, possibly because of the relatively small size of the trachea that gets easily blocked by swelling. The most frequent sign is the rapid development of stridor. It is occasionally confused with croup. If it is inflamed, a condition known as tracheitis can occur. In this condition there can be inflammation of the linings of the trachea. A condition called tracheo-bronchitis can be caused, when the mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchi swell. A collapsed trachea is formed as a result of defect in the cartilage, that makes the cartilage unable to support the trachea and results in dry hacking cough. In this condition there can be inflammation of the linings of the trachea. If the connective nerve tissues in the trachea degenerate it causes tracheomalacia. Infections to the trachea can cause tracheomegaly. Diagnosis The diagnosis of tracheitis requires the direct vision of exudates or pseudomembranes on the trachea. X-ray findings may include subglottic narrowing. The priority is to secure the patient's airway, and to rule out croup and epiglottitis which may be fatal. Suspicion for tracheitis should be high in cases of onset of airway obstruction that do not respond to racemic epinephrine.  Treatment  In more severe cases, it is treated by administering intravenous antibiotics and may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for intubation and supportive ventilation if the airway swelling is severe. During an intensive care admission, various methods of invasive and non-invasive monitoring may be required, which may include ECG monitoring, oxygen saturation, capnography and arterial blood pressure monitoring.

It is a colourless (white) salt that is highly soluble in water, much more so than the related potassium salt. It is a strong oxidizing agent that is used in polymer chemistry, as an etchant, and as a cleaning and bleaching agent. The dissolution of the salt in water is an endothermic process. Preparation Ammonium persulfate is prepared by electrolysis of a cold concentrated solution of either ammonium sulfate or ammonium bisulfate in sulfuric acid at a high current density.F. Feher, \\"Potassium Peroxydisulfate\\" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 390. The method was first described by Hugh Marshall. Uses As an oxidizing agent and a source of radicals, APS finds many commercial applications. Salts of sulfate are mainly used as radical initiators in the polymerization of certain alkenes. Commercially important polymers prepared using persulfates include styrene-butadiene rubber and polytetrafluoroethylene. In solution, the dianion dissociates to give radicals: :[O3SO‚ÄìOSO3]2‚àí 2 [SO4]‚Ä¢‚àí The sulfate radical adds to the alkene to give a sulfate ester radical. It is also used along with tetramethylethylenediamine to catalyze the polymerization of acrylamide in making a polyacrylamide gel, hence being important for SDS-PAGE and western blot. Illustrative of its powerful oxidizing properties, it is used to etch copper on printed circuit boards as an alternative to ferric chloride solution. This property was discovered many years ago. In 1908, John William Turrentine used a dilute ammonium persulfate solution to etch copper. Turrentine weighed copper spirals before placing the copper spirals into the ammonium persulfate solution for an hour. After an hour, the spirals were weighed again and the amount of copper dissolved by ammonium persulfate was recorded. This experiment was extended to other metals such as nickel, cadmium, and iron, all of which yielded similar results. The oxidation equation is thus: (aq) + ‚Üí 2 (aq). Ammonium persulfate is a standard ingredient in hair bleach. Persulfates are used as oxidants in organic chemistry.Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, vol. 1, pp. 193‚Äì197 (1995). For example, in the Minisci reaction. Safety Airborne dust containing ammonium persulfate may be irritating to eye, nose, throat, lung and skin upon contact. Exposure to high levels of dust may cause difficulty in breathing. FMC Corporation, MSDS sheet dated: 2009-06-26 It has been noted that persulfate salts are a major cause of asthmatic effects in women. Furthermore, it has been suggested that exposure to ammonium persulfate can cause asthmatic effects in hair dressers and receptionists working in the hairdressing industry. These asthmatic effects are proposed to be caused by the oxidation of cysteine residues, as well as methionine residues.

Born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, the son of former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia David MacKeen, he served during World War I as an artillery officer, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was wounded in 1916. After the war, he received his LL.B in 1921 from Dalhousie University. He was a practicing lawyer and served during World War II as the commanding officer of the Halifax Rifles 2nd Battalion from 1945 to 1946. He was also the Honorary Lieutenant Colonel from 1948 to 1960. He helped to defend Kurt Meyer, Canada's only jailed war criminal. In 1933 he was appointed a King's Council by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. He was appointed Lieutenant Governor in 1963 and served until 1968. After, he became the first Chancellor of Acadia University. In 1969, he was awarded the Medal of Service of the Order of Canada,. The Medal of Service of the Order was converted to the Officer level of the Order of Canada in 1972, however as MacKeen died in 1971 his Medal of Service was never converted to an OC. MacKeen's papers are held by the Nova Scotia Archives. A portrait of MacKeen by Brenda Bury hangs at Government House Halifax. Another portrait of MacKeen hangs in the Halifax office of law firm Stewart McKelvey which is the successor firm to Stewart MacKeen & Covert where MacKeen practised law. In 1928, he married Alice Richardson Tilley, the daughter of Leonard Percy de Wolfe Tilley. They had two children: Judith Tilley MacKeen and Henry David MacKeen.

This nucleus is located beneath the fourth ventricle in the caudal portion of the pons, medial to the sulcus limitans. The abducens nucleus along with the internal genu of the facial nerve make up the facial colliculus, a hump at the caudal end of the medial eminence on the dorsal aspect of the pons. Structure Two primary neuron types are located in the abducens nucleus: motorneurons and interneurons. The former directly drive the contraction of the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle via the abducens nerve (sixth cranial nerve); contraction of this muscle rotates the eye outward (abduction). The latter relay signals from the abducens nucleus to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus, where motoneurons drive the contraction of the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle (hence, contralateral to the abducens nucleus that issues the command) ; contraction of this muscle rotates the eye inward (adduction). Function This \\"wiring\\" pattern suggests that the main function of the abducens nucleus is to generate coordinated movements of both eyes in the same direction. Indeed, electrical stimulation of the abducens nucleus has been shown to generate conjugate eye movements (i.e. both eyes rotate in the same direction, and by the same angle). Such eye movements occur whenever we look between targets located in the distance. Moreover, lesions to the axonal tract of interneurons (in the medial longitudinal fasciculus) have been shown to disrupt conjugate eye movements through the paralysis of the contralateral eye. Importantly, despite the lesions, this muscle remains functional during convergence eye movements. Finally, experiments where the electrical activity of single neurons in the abducens nucleus has been recorded during slow and fast conjugate eye movements have demonstrated very little differences in the discharge patterns of motoneurons and interneurons. Altogether, it is now well accepted that the abducens nucleus is a key structure for the conjugated movements of both eyes. Clinical significance Damage to the abducens nerve causes monocular ipsilateral lateral ophthalmoparesis: specifically, loss of the ability to move the ipsilateral eye outward (abduction). In contrast, damage to the area of the nucleus results in binocular lateral gaze paralysis: loss of the ability to move the eyes together in the direction of the side with the lesion. This is due to damage to both the motoneurons and interneurons projecting through the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the contralateral medial rectus neurons. Note, however, that the eye contralateral to the lesion can still move in the direction of the lesion during convergence movements.

The Senate Square (, ) presents Carl Ludvig Engel's architecture as a unique allegory of political, religious, scientific and commercial powers in the centre of Helsinki, Finland. Senate Square and its surroundings make up the oldest part of central Helsinki. Landmarks and famous buildings surrounding the square are the Helsinki Cathedral, the Government Palace, main building of the University of Helsinki and the , the oldest building of central Helsinki dating from 1757. Construction In the 17th and 18th centuries it was the location of a graveyard. In 1812 Senate Square was designated as the main square for the new capital of Helsinki in the city plan designed by Johan Albrecht Ehrenstr√∂m. The Palace of the Council of State (or Government Palace) was completed on the eastern side of the Senate Square in 1822. It served as the seat of the Senate of Finland until it was replaced by the Council of State in 1918, and now houses the offices of the Prime Minister of Finland and the cabinet. The main University building, on the opposite side of the Senate Square, was constructed in 1832. The Helsinki Cathedral on the northern edge of the Senate Square was Engel's lengthiest architectural project. He worked on it from 1818 until his death in 1840. The Helsinki Cathedral ‚Äî then called the Church of St. Nicholas ‚Äî dominates the Senate Square, and was finalized twelve years afters Engel's death, in 1852. Statue of Alexander II Statue of Alexander II A statue of Emperor Alexander II is located in the center of the square. The statue, erected in 1894, was built to commemorate his re-establishment of the Diet of Finland in 1863 as well as his initiation of several reforms that increased Finland's autonomy from Russia. The statue comprises Alexander on a pedestal surrounded by figures representing law, culture, and peasants. The sculptor was Walter Runeberg. During the Russification of Finland from 1899 onwards, the statue became a symbol of quiet resistance, with people protesting against the decrees of Nicholas II by leaving flowers at the foot of the statue of his grandfather, then known in Finland as \\"the good tsar\\". After Finland's independence in 1917, demands were made to remove the statue. Later, it was suggested to replace it with the equestrian statue of Mannerheim currently located on Mannerheimintie in front of the Kiasma museum. Nothing came of either of these suggestions, and today the statue is one of the major tourist landmarks of the city and a reminder of Finland's close relationship with Imperial Russia.

The show originally premiered in primetime on ABC on March 27, 1968, with a daytime edition premiering on April 1, 1968. The primetime series aired weekly until September 19, 1968 and the daytime series aired daily until January 2, 1970, when it was replaced with All My Children. The daytime series was revived for NBC's daytime schedule and premiered on April 4, 1983, running until June 29, 1984. The original Dream House was hosted by Mike Darow with Chet Gould announcing. Bob Eubanks hosted the revival series with Johnny Gilbert as announcer. The ABC version was recorded in New York City, while the NBC run was staged at the network's studios in Burbank, California. 1968‚Äì70 The first format involved two couples competing in a game of quick recall. The first contestant to buzz-in answered and received five points for a correct response. If the contestant was wrong, however, the other couple could try to answer for ten points. When a contestant gave a correct answer, he or she was locked out of the next question. Two minutes before the end of the game, which lasted from four to five minutes, the point values doubled, and at the end was the \\"Catch-Up Round\\" in which the team that was trailing could choose one last question from 10 to 50 points (if they answered correctly, the other couple got one last shot). The winning couple won a room of furniture. Couples who won seven rooms of furniture on the daytime version (four on the 1968 primetime version) won their choice of either a new house (worth over $40,000, plus $7,000 to purchase land) or $20,000 in cash. Beginning in 1969, three couples competed in the first round in which the first couple to buzz-in with a correct answer scored five points. A wrong answer, however, gave the other couples a chance to score ten points. Only during that first round would all contestants be allowed to buzz-in on all questions. The points were doubled during the last two minutes of the round. The two highest-scoring couples advanced to the next round, played exactly the same as the previous two-couple format. Five-time champions were offered an airplane in lieu of attempting to win two more games. 1983‚Äì84 =Main Game= Two teams of two (usually married couples), one of them a returning champion, competed to win a house worth approximately $100,000. The host read a true/false toss-up question open to all four players. A correct answer awarded that couple $50 and their choice of four categories, while a miss gave the money and control to their opponents. Each category had a multiple-choice question with three possible answers. After the couple in control gave their answer, the opponents had the option to challenge and select a different one. The couple with the right answer won $100, or $150 in the event of an unsuccessful challenge. Each team could challenge twice during the round. Once a category had been played, it was removed from the board and a new toss-up was asked. The round continued until all four categories had been used. The game was played in two rounds, with the leader after the first round winning a prize. The second round was played the same as round one, except that each team had a one-time opportunity to double the value of the question before the question was asked. The couple leading after two rounds won the game, received a room of furniture, and advanced to the bonus round. Couples kept whatever they earned, win or lose. If the game ended in a tie, one more true/false toss-up question was played to break the tie. During the show's 15-month NBC run, special weeks were set aside for siblings, single couples with children and engaged couples. There was also a week in November 1983 where the cast of Diff'rent Strokes played for a designated couple, as well as one from May 1984 in which two different celebrity teams played for charity each day. Rule changes Several rule changes went into effect in April 1984. The couple in control was required to hit their plunger to determine the question value displayed on a \\"money machine\\", a random light which stopped at $50, $100, or $150. The amount could also be accompanied with \\"Prize,\\" which awarded a bonus prize to the team that answered correctly, or \\"Turnover,\\" which gave control of the question to the opposing team. In the second round, a \\"Number Off\\" space was added to the machine, which allowed the team who answered correctly to remove one extra number from the combination lock if they reached the bonus round. Also, if the winning team led by $500‚Äì$950 after two rounds, they originally received a prize, but this was later changed to a $500 bonus. Winning by $1,000 or more was worth a new car. Unlike the first format, there was no double option available in round two. =Bonus round= In the bonus round, the couple tried to open a set of \\"Golden Doors\\" by programming the correct three-digit combination into an electronic lock that secured them. The lock displayed three rows of four digits each, and the correct combination consisted of one digit from each row. The couple was given an opportunity to remove incorrect digits before making their guess. Originally, each day that a couple reached the bonus round, one incorrect digit was automatically removed from the lock, following the sequence of top-middle-bottom. A later rule change removed one digit for each time the couple returned, thus depriving them of having one eliminated on their first day. A couple could also have a digit removed if they had landed on \\"Number Off\\" on the Money Machine once the format for the front game was changed. After the initial removal of digits, the couple chose one of three categories and answered three questions in it, each with two possible answers. Each correct response eliminated one more digit ‚Äì from the top row for the first question, the middle row for the second, the bottom row for the third. After the questions, the couple entered their guess at the combination. Once a digit was chosen, it could not be changed. After making their guess, the couple pressed a button referred to as a \\"time release bar,\\" which caused a series of four lights built into the frame of the Golden Doors to activate from the bottom up. If the combination was correct, all the lights came on, the Golden Doors opened, and the couple won the house. If not, the topmost section remained dark, a buzzer sounded, and the host revealed the correct combination. Champions returned to face the Golden Doors each day until they either programmed the winning combination, won enough games to automatically win the house, or were defeated by another couple. Seven victories were initially required to win the house; this threshold was later lowered to five, then raised to six. In a match where a couple was in a position to win the house if they won the main game, a plunger alternately called a \\"Golden Circuit Breaker\\" and a \\"Hotline Switch\\" was brought out at the beginning of the second round. If the couple won, the plunger was pushed after the match and the Golden Doors automatically opened. Any couple that won the house ‚Äî either by guessing the combination or by winning the requisite number of games ‚Äî retired undefeated, and two new couples competed on the next show. Broadcast history =ABC= Replacing reruns of the cult crime drama The Fugitive, Dream House began broadcasting on April 1, 1968, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Its competition depended on the local market, as both NBC and CBS went down during that half-hour to allow their affiliates to run local or syndicated programming. ABC used the show as a promotional device; questions were frequently about the network's shows and stars, and Monty Hall appeared in December 1968 to promote the move of his Let's Make a Deal from NBC to ABC. The show ended amid some controversy. In the summer of 1969, TV Guide reported that none of the houses given away on the series at that point had been completed. Furthermore, according to the report, some winning couples had to borrow considerably more than the $7,000 the show awarded for the purchase of land. Shortly after this article was published, Dream House began offering the option of $20,000 in lieu of the house, but the damage had already been done and the ratings began to decline. The network cancelled Dream House in late 1969 and its final episode aired on January 2, 1970; the show's time slot was immediately taken over by All My Children. =NBC= Dream House premiered in the 11:30 a.m. Eastern (10:30 a.m. Central) time slot on April 4, 1983, replacing the 13-week game show Hit Man (which had been canceled despite the network's ratings increasing in that slot). Airing opposite the second half of the highly rated CBS game show The Price Is Right on CBS and the ABC soap opera Loving (which premiered three months later), the series ran for a total of 1¬º years. The final episode aired on June 29, 1984; three days later, NBC began airing a television adaptation of the board game Scrabble, which would occupy the 11:30 a.m. timeslot for the first three years of its nearly six- year run. =Episode status= The studio master tapes of the 1968‚Äì70 version are not known to exist. They may have been erased by ABC as this was standard procedure for its daytime programs until 1978, although the controversies surrounding the show may also have played a role. In 2013, the studio master tapes of the 1983‚Äì84 version, which were in the possession of series creator Don Reid, were destroyed by a flood.

Each episode, running for about 25 minutes, reviews the events of a particular selected year, from 1962 to 2009. News archive footage features, along with subtitles as the means of narration, to recount important national and international events of the time. Music from the selected year plays across the footage, with occasional scenes of live performances or music videos, often (but by no means exclusively) by an Irish artist. No advertisements are shown during the broadcast (apart from the occasional old advertisement dating from the relevant year). Each decade takes at least eight months to make. The theme tune for the series comes from Steely Dan's 1972 hit \\"Reelin' In the Years\\". All five series are marked by a knowing attitude, where certain stories that seemed inconsequential at the time are remembered because they have taken on significance in the present day. This has gained the programme a reputation for being very funny. An example is seen in the 1987 episode: Taoiseach Charles Haughey discusses what he would do if he were to win money in the newly formed National Lottery. Haughey, whose lavish lifestyle was later revealed to have been funded by \\"donations\\" from businessmen, exclaims, \\"I might keep a bit for myself!\\". A 2008 poll (conducted by the RT√â Guide) of Ireland's Top 100 television programmes resulted in Reeling in the Years being voted \\"most popular home-produced TV programme ever\\". In 2008, a DVD--Reeling in the 80s--was released for the Irish market--with follow-up DVDs Reeling in the 90s and Reeling in the 70s released in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Episode list =Original series= The original series focused on the 1980s and first aired on Monday nights from 6 September to 8 November 1999. =Second series= The second series focused on the 1990s and first aired on Monday nights from 11 September to 27 November 2000 except on 30 October and 13 November. =Third series= The third series focused on the 1970s and first aired on Tuesday nights from 10 September to 12 November 2002. =Fourth series= The fourth series focused on the 1960s (1962 to 1969 only) and first aired on Friday nights from 10 September to 29 October 2004. It features neither 1960 nor 1961 as these pre-date the official launch of Telef√≠s √âireann, the television arm of the national broadcaster. It was felt, presumably, that there would be too little archive material from which to make an engaging programme about these years. Indeed, the episodes covering the first half of the 1960s are characterised by extensive use of photographs and posters, as opposed to film and video footage, to represent various historical events. =Fifth series= The fifth series focused on the 2000s and first aired on Sunday nights from 17 October to 26 December 2010 except on 28 November. =Sixth series= The sixth series focused on the 2010s to be produced in 2021 (broadcast date as yet unknown). Copyright and DVD release Each edition of Reeling in the Years opens with the logo and the featured year on top. The above example shows the 1984 edition. In the past, RT√â had said that, because of the number of clips from external companies used in the series, it would be infeasible to release it on VHS or DVD. It claimed that securing \\"video clearance\\" for each clip and song would make any release prohibitively expensive. RT√â did consider releasing an altered version of the programme which would only contain the images and music that they owned the rights to, but that \\"the programme would only be half as good then, it wouldn't be anything like the shows that went out on air, and we'd end up disappointing people.\\" However, in October 2008, RT√â announced that they would be releasing a DVD of a cut-down version of the 1980s material. Reeling in the 80s is an altered version of the programme which contains only the images and music that the producers were able to secure rights to, and it runs to about 150 minutes (versus 240 minutes for the original series). It does, however, contain some original material that has been unearthed since 1999, and which has greater significance now, such as footage of former Taoiseach Brian Cowen. Reeling in the 90s was released on 13 November 2009, while Reeling in the 70s was released in November 2010. The Reeling in the decades Boxset was released in 2011 which collected the 70s, 80s and 90s DVDs in one boxset. =DVD discography= *Reeling in the 80s (2008) *Reeling in the 90s (2009) *Reeling in the 70s (2010) *Reeling in the 60s never issued yet Legacy In recent years, Reeling in the Years has been used regularly by RT√â One as a filler programme during the spring months all the way through to the Christmas period. It currently is shown at 18:30 on Sunday evenings if there is no talent programme or documentary and most bank holidays, when there is no Eastenders it usually fills the 20:00 slot on Mondays or Fridays or even 19:30 slot on Tuesdays or Thursdays. This has led to some interesting parallels with real-life events. When Cian O'Connor won his bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, RT√â showed the 2004 episode of Reeling in the Years, complete with Anne Doyle's announcement that O'Connor was to be stripped of his gold medal won at the 2004 Summer Olympics. The next day RT√â showed the 2005 episode of Reeling in the Years, complete with the announcement that London had secured the 2012 Summer Olympics with then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair reacting by saying what a momentous day it was for neighbouring Britain, followed by footage of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, which occurred the following day. A website ranked editions of Reeling in the Years in order of the \\"most and least depressing\\" ‚Äì least were 1994, 2004 and 2007; most were 1981, 1986 and 2008. In 2020 plans will be made for a new series covering the 2010s decade. Will go to broadcast in 2021 due to Covid-19 not possible to produce Reeling in the Years in 2020 but a 2020 programme of Reeling in the Years wont be until 2030 or later. Similar programmes = Ireland = The Irish language station TG4 broadcast a similar programme called Siar Sna. TV3 (now Virgin Media One) aired a programme called series Those Were the Days with a focus on pop music. =Other countries= In Britain, the BBC produced a similar series in the early 2000s, called \\"I Love...\\", in which public figures discuss the pop culture of each year. The Spanish version of Reeling in the Years (Los A√±os del No-Do) began airing in 2013 and is produced by the Spanish state- owned television and radio broadcaster RTVE. The word \\"No-Do\\" is a shortened name for Noticiarios y Documentales (News and Documentaries). Following the same format of Reeling in the Years, Los A√±os del No-Do encompasses the years from 1943 to 1981. It has been associated containing propaganda to support the Spanish caudillo Franco who ruled Spain from 1936 to 1975. In Norway, the public broadcaster NRK produced a similar series, \\"Back to the xx-ies\\" (\\"Tilbake til xx-tallet\\") covering the 1960s (\\"Tilbake til 60-tallet\\"), 1970s (\\"Tilbake til 70-tallet\\"), 1980s (\\"Tilbake til 80-tallet\\") and 1990s (\\"Tilbake til 90-tallet\\"). They were produced as four series each of 10 episodes covering one year of their respective decade - 40 episodes in total.

Composition It is the salt derived from the ammonium cation and the hydrosulfide anion. The salt exists as colourless, water-soluble, micaceous crystals. On Earth the compound is encountered mainly as a solution, not as the solid, but NH4SH ice is believed to be a substantial component of the cloud decks of the gas-giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, with sulfur produced by its photolysis responsible for the color of some of those planets' clouds. It can be generated by mixing hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. Preparation Solutions of ammonium hydrosulfide can be prepared by passing hydrogen sulfide gas through concentrated ammonia solution. According to a detailed 1895 report, hydrogen sulfide reacts with concentrated aqueous ammonia solution at room temperature to give (NH4)2S¬∑2NH4HS. When this species is cooled to 0 ¬∞C and treated with additional hydrogen sulfide, one obtains (NH4)2S¬∑12NH4HS. An ice-cold solution of this substance kept at 0 ¬∞C and having hydrogen sulfide continually passed through it gives the hydrosulfide. The common \\"stink bomb\\" consists of an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfide. The mixture easily converts to ammonia and hydrogen sulfide gases. This conversion illustrates the ease of the following equilibrium: : (NH4)SH NH3 \\\\+ H2S Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide each have a powerful and unpleasant smell. \\"Ammonium sulfide\\" Aqueous solutions of ammonium sulfide (CAS registry number 12135-76-1), also known as diammonium sulfide are commercially available, although the composition of these solutions is uncertain as they could consist of a mixture of ammonia and (NH4)SH. Ammonium sulfide solutions are used occasionally in photographic developing, to apply patina to bronze, and in textile manufacturing. Also, due to its offensive smell, it is the active ingredient in a variety of pranks including the common stink bomb. It can be used as a selective reducing agent (cf 2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene), where there are two nitro groups only one of them is selectively reduced. The 1990-1991 CRC Handbook of Physics and Chemistry gives information for anhydrous ammonium monosulfide ((NH4)2S) and ammonium pentasulfide ((NH4)2S5) as separate from anhydrous ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4HS), describing the former two both as yellow crystalline substances that are soluble in cold water and alcohol, and which both decompose in hot water or at high temperature in general (115¬∞C for the pentasulfide), but the latter as a white crystalline solid (which also decomposes in hot water). Thus, it seems that solid ammonium sulfide can be distinct from solid ammonium hydrosulfide, even if this is not true in aqueous solution.

Forming the Walshers in the late 1870s, Walsh's violent tactics would dominate the Bowery in several years. Walsh would soon become involved in what would become a long a bitter feud with Johnny Irving's Dutch Mob during the early 1880s as the two fought over the Bowery. On three separate occasions, the two gang leaders fought each other in knife fights although these proved inconclusive. The police refused to interfere in the gang war, as was general policy at the time, preferring to allow the gangs to wipe each other out. The final showdown between Walsh and Irving occurred on October 16, 1883 when, as Walsh was drinking in Shang Draper's saloon on Sixth Avenue, Irving and Billy Porter entered and confronted Walsh. After an altercation between the two, Walsh shot and killed Irving. Porter in turn killed Walsh and was then shot by Draper. Although Porter survived, neither he nor Draper were charged with either Walsh or Irving's death. Further reading *Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York. New York: Alfred A.

It is located at 4.4¬∞ North Latitude, 298.0¬∞ West Longitude and is approximately 200 km across. From Voyager images, Sarandib Planitia is considered part of either the ridged plains unit (Kargel and Pozio 1996) or smooth plains unit (Rothery 1999) of Enceladus, thought to be the youngest terrain on Enceladus. In more recent (and higher resolution) Cassini images, Sarandib is resolved into a region of relatively low ridges, with a band of rifted terrain cutting through the middle from northwest to southeast. In addition, a series of long-wavelength compression ridges are seen in the western portion of Sarandib Planitia, reminiscent of banded terrain on Europa, like Astypalaea Linea. Only ~20 craters larger than 1 kilometer across (the largest only 4.5 kilometers across) have been found in Sarandib, demonstrating the youthful age of the region. Sarandib Planitia is bounded on the north and west by a band of grooved terrain named Samarkand Sulci. Given the similarity in the spatial relationship between the Diyar Planitia and Harran Sulci, it is likely that the formation of Sarandib Planitia and Samarkand Sulci are related. Sarandib Planitia is named from the old Arabic/Persian/Urdu name for Sri Lanka, an island visited by Sindbad on his 6th voyage in Arabian Nights.

This created a rail link from Chattanooga, on the Tennessee River, to seaports on the Atlantic Ocean.

The financial problems of the parent company forced the CofG into bankruptcy, and it was sold at foreclosure three years later, being reorganized as the Central of Georgia Railway on November 1, 1895. In 1907 railroad magnate and financier E. H. Harriman gained a controlling interest in the railway, and in 1909 sold his interest to the Illinois Central Railroad, which he also controlled. In 1932, during the Great Depression, the CofG went into receivership, from which it did not emerge until 1948. In 1956, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (\\"Frisco\\"), seeking a route to Atlantic Ocean ports, gained control of the CofG, but the Interstate Commerce Commission declined to approve a merger of the two roads, so the Frisco sold its CofG stock to the Southern Railway in 1963. At the end of 1956 the CofG operated of road and of track; that year it reported 3208 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 73 million passenger-miles. Those totals do not include the Savannah and Atlanta, the L&W;, the Wadley Southern or the Wrightsville and Tennille. The CofG became a Southern Railway subsidiary on June 17, 1963. In 1971 the Southern formed the Central of Georgia Railroad to merge the Central of Georgia Railway, the Savannah and Atlanta Railway, and the Wrightsville and Tennille Railroad. Passenger operations Postcard depiction of the streamliner Man o' War. It was well known for its four beautiful Budd built streamlined cars.

Both of these trains were named after prize-winning racehorses. When Amtrak took control of the Southern Railway's passenger service in 1971, The Southern decided to discontinue the \\"Nancy Hanks II\\" but continue operating the \\"Crescent Limited\\" until 1977.

Well into the 1960s, CofG trains remained segregated, long after most Southern railroads abolished racial bars following a desegregation order by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The CofG only operated in Georgia, and some parts of Alabama, and was thus not engaged in interstate commerce.

It is sited on the Roman road between Old Sarum and Winchester. Settlements in the parish are the villages of West Winterslow and Middle Winterslow, and the hamlets of East Winterslow and The Common. History The area has evidence of prehistoric settlements, including Bronze Age features and an Iron Age hillfort at Ashley's Copse. Middle Winterslow is located along a Roman road towards Old Sarum. The three settlements (today's West, Middle and East Winterslow) are recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as Wintreslei, meaning \\"Winter's mound or burial place\\". The Winterslows developed as separate manors, with Middle Winterslow known for a time as Middleton. As recently as 1958, the village around All Saints' church was named on maps as Winterslow, with West Winterslow adjacent to its southeast. On current maps and road signs, both areas are West Winterslow. Governance The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward starts on the outskirts of Salisbury in the south west and stretches in a northeasterly direction to Winterslow. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 3,894. Churches and chapels The Church of England parish church of All Saints at West Winterslow is Grade II* listed. It has 12th-century origins but was rebuilt in the 19th century by T.H. Wyatt. A chapel of ease dedicated to St John the Baptist was opened at The Common in 1860. A Methodist chapel was built at The Common in 1810; the present building dates from 1865. An Evangelical church, the Gospel Lifeboat Mission, was opened at Middle Winterslow in 1891. The present building is from 1979. Winterslow Baptist Church, at West Winterslow, is a tin tabernacle built in 1908. Notable buildings Roche Old Court (early 17th century) and Roche Court (1805), near East Winterslow, are Grade II* listed. Notable people William Hazlitt (1778‚Äì1830), writer and critic, lived here. Peter Bellinger Brodie (1778‚Äì1854, conveyancer) and his brother Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie (1783‚Äì1862, pioneering physiologist and surgeon) were born here. Amenities Winterslow CE Primary School, Middle Winterslow, serves the parish and nearby villages. It was built as a National School in 1856 and educated children of all ages until 1962. At Middle Winterslow is a large modern village hall with a tennis court. There is one pub: the Lord Nelson at Middle Winterslow. The Lion's Head at The Common has recently shut down (2018). Roche Court near East Winterslow has a sculpture park and gallery. The Clarendon Way long-distance footpath passes through Middle Winterslow and West Winterslow; its route along the Roman road is shared with the Monarch's Way.

Like many film genres, the exact definition is often in the eye of the beholder, but Hollywood did produce and market a number of topical films in the 1930s and by the 1940s, the term \\"social problem\\" or \\"message\\" film was conventional in its usage among the film industry and the public. Many characteristics that have grown to define the social problem film revolve around the perceived consciousness of the nation about a certain social issue and integrating that issue into a narrative structure. Social problems such as the horrors of war, suffering of the poor, addiction, the rights of women, and the inhumanity of a certain world are often put on display. The problem with defining this type of film as a genre lies within the ability it has to separate itself from films that display similar style, as a lot of films do address social issues. However, the social problem film differentiates itself by focusing on the problems within the historical context of the current time, dealing with the social issue of a certain era as it applies to that era with a style that is much more didactic than its contemporaries. Furthermore, the social problem film allows further immersion into a certain issue than other genre films. For instance, gangster and prison films will reflect certain features of a social issue but won't actually fully explore the problem in the way that would qualify it for this genre.  Defining characteristics  = Historical context and didactic nature = An important fact of the social problem film is its ability to react and display a social problem that is relevant to the current era it was produced in. It specifically addresses an issue while the issue is still part of the national consciousness, often forming an argument for what the problem actually is through the narrative and character development. Early social problem films often blended ideological feelings of the time into a narrative which translated it into a message for audiences to absorb. This can be evidenced within certain sociological experiments that occurred revolving around the ability for a film to change public perception. A prime example of this is the representation of anti-semitism within the film Gentleman's Agreement and the subsequent sociological study by Russell Middleton that measured perceived anti-semitism before and after seeing the film. Surprisingly the film seemed to positively affect the subjects as the majority of people who participated in the study had markedly less anti- semitic feelings than before they saw the film. Although there are certain factors that need to be considered this study seems to indicate once again the primary didactic nature of the Social Problem Film as well as the tackling of subject matter relevant to the current era of the film and how audiences of the historical period perceived such a message. This phenomenon of historical context and audience reaction created an interesting balance between the teaching nature of the film and its ability to contain an interesting narrative. Oftentimes the earlier films of the classical era can be seen as a bit preachy, often appearing less like a fictional feature and more like a public service announcement. This is displayed in the common occurrence of a teaching moment often near the end of the film where a character will literally give a speech often referring to the social message the film is attempting to portray. Examples can be seen through the judges at the end of Wild Boys of the Road and Where Are My Children?, both of whom provide a lesson in monologue form that almost seems separate from the fictional narrative being presented. This relevance to the problem of the era the film resides in lends a sort of didactic authority to this type of film that others may not have. For instance, the film Where Are My Children? had trouble getting through the National Board of Review to public release due to reviewers believing that audiences were being provided with misleading information regarding birth control. They believed that the film was more educational in nature rather than a fictional narrative addressing a social issue. = Focused narrative on characters and institutions = The social problem film often takes a larger social issue during its respective era and displays it in a much more focused way. The problem will be expressed through a narrative often involving a few characters, often a family or an individual that traverses the film world experiencing the perceived social issue. Oftentimes they will interact directly with social institutions meant to display the social problems. The typifying of these institutions is styled based on the overall ideological message of the film, either being portrayed as ineffective or idealized as a proper solution. These can be seen throughout the development of the social problem film and even into contemporary times as the form of the social problem film changed. Examples of this style of narrative are apparent within films such as The Soul of Youth in which the larger problem of delinquent children with no home is portrayed through the ineffectiveness of the orphanage the protagonist resides in juxtaposed with the idealized life of the family of the judge he eventually settles in with. Another instance that deserves to be mentioned comes once again from Wild Boys of the Road in which the film reaches its climax as the protagonists are being dealt with by a judge, bringing the larger social issue into an individualist lens by applying the solution of a nationwide problem to a few individual experiences. Another important Social Problem Film dealing with institutions is the alcoholism themed Days of Wine and Roses. The film follows the progressive demise of a couple due to their inability to control their drinking, once again devolving a larger societal problem onto a focused set of characters. It does, however, offer a solution in the form of the institution of Alcoholic's Anonymous which serves as an effective way to treat one's self. A sociological study done by Elizabeth Hirschman revealed that the film's portrayal was indeed relatable to addicts and alcoholics who after watching the film viewed AA as a viable option to address their problem. This effect on the real population indicates the interaction that Social Problem Films hope to have on their audience in comparison to films meant to purely entertain while skimming the surface of certain issues. A more contemporary instance of the focused narrative of characters and institutions in the Social Problem Film is the ineffectiveness and cruelty of the military hospital in Coming Home, a movie about returning vets from Vietnam. The mistreatment and negligent behavior affecting all vets in the hospital is reduced to the experiences of two or three characters. = Real life insertions and location shooting = One aspect that is widely seen within the social problem film is the usage of non-actors to portray either background characters or voices of reason within the narrative as well as the desire to film scenes on location. Both of these factors help lend authenticity and relation to the real world which is essential to the genre. Some notable examples are the inclusion of actual Judge Ben Lindsey playing himself in the previously mentioned film The Soul of Youth. This insertion created an environment the audience knew was based in reality and thus lent a sense of authenticity to the didactic nature this genre possesses. The presence of a figure from the real world directly confronts the idea that the messages displayed in social problem films must be confirmed by real-life counterparts. It lends a sense of integrity reminiscent of journalism or a documentary film. Location shooting is a factor that although not limited to the social problem film, has grown to exemplify certain factors within the genre. The idea of shooting outside of a studio and in the real environment again strengthens the films authenticity in the same way non-actors do. A film that utilized this style of shooting in order to gain this sense of realism is the previously mentioned Wild Boys of the Road. The film's scenes that are set within the train yard that the children temporarily reside in is shot on location in an actual train yard in Glendale, Ca. Perhaps the most notable instance of the idea of real-life insertions is the opening scene of the social problem film about Mexican immigration following the instituting of the Bracero Program in 1942 meant to alleviate the shortage of farmhand work in the United States. The film, titled Border Incident, opens with a flyover shot of farmland as an unseen narrator describes the landscape, the lack of labor, and the subsequent creation of the bracero program in response. This is an insertion of a program that actively was occurring during the production of this film. This reality-based narrative combines with the voice over, which mentions borders no less than five times to subtly push an ideology of mutual dependency towards the audience while allowing itself the appearance of being an authentic representation of the situation, showing again the effect real life insertions can have on the social problem films ability to affect its viewers. = Transit and family = Many social problem films contain a theme of transit and the importance of familial relationships. These factors lend further authenticity to the genre as the audience seems to often follow the protagonist as he or she travels a necessary journey to arrive at a viable solution. Internal journeys are often mirrored in literal transportation of the characters. This can be seen in the traveling across the nation in Wild Boys of the Road, the trip to the doctor's office in Where Are My Children?, and the international migration of farmworkers in Border Incident. Similarly, the idea of the family is apparent within this genre, oftentimes the idea of the family is of utmost importance. There is a finality in terms of the protagonist's descent when he or she has lost the trust and support of their family, and thus the social problem is often resolved by a return to these ideals. Although wartime feelings can account for some of this, it is important to note that this theme is maintained throughout the development of the genre. Even in more contemporary social problem films such as Coming Home and The Good Lie, there is a sense of familial importance, the former in terms of his \\"brothers\\" who he stands by no matter what, and the latter in the form of their tribe members who travel thousands of miles for a new life. History =Progressive Era= Historian Kay Sloan has shown how various reformist groups made social problem shorts and features during the silent era. Generally, these dealt with prohibition, labor relations and concerns over \\"white slavery.\\" The ideologies of these Pre-World War I productions often aligned with concerns over the worker and the interaction filmmakers had with real world problems. This was important to the development of the genre as it was the first foray into displaying issues of the common man but wasn't successful in terms of offering a viable solution. Rather, the didactic nature of these films indicated an upper-middle class solution to labor issues; oftentimes it would take the presence of a non-working class negotiator to resolve the issues laborers in the films dealt with. The discovery of the effect of and utilization of the happy ending was also implemented during this time. The happy ending left a cathartic effect on its audience, leaving them satisfied with the social message being provided. This itself is an imperative to the social problem genre due to its demonstration of directors and filmmakers desire to affect social change through movies. As a genre, however, these Progressive statements did not touch off a long-lasting concern in the film industry, which was solidifying behind standardized product, oligopoly and the star system. =The 1930s= Warner Brothers under Darryl F. Zanuck started making topical films \\"ripped from the headlines.\\" These \\"headliners\\" generally were cheaply made, gritty in their realist aesthetic, and foregrounded a working class milieu and New Deal political sympathies. The social problem films of this era reflected the general national consciousness of the New Deal. Many social problem films of the time fed into a populist form of thought meant to instill confidence among the nation in the wake of the Great Depression, supporting the Franklin Delano Roosevelt platform that supposedly would alleviate the unemployment problem the United States faced at that time. Social problem films made during this era put the obligation of finding work on the individual while also displaying the benefits of having a neighborly attitude of helping those in need back to sustainable living. This is particularly displayed in films such as Wild Boys of the Road where the protagonist runs away from home with friends to try and find work, only to end up arrested and in need of assistance, which is subsequently granted by a Judge. The films interaction with New Deal ideologies is reflected in the confident tone of the judge as he grants aid to the homeless kids presented to him, the progressive nature of neighborly helpfulness is thrust upon the audience without allowing them to contemplate the fact that it took a middle class figure to save the unemployed. Just as the New Deal gave confidence in the short term but lagged in long-term growth for employment so did the social problem films of this time depict a sense of optimism even if they were stuck in the non-progressive narrative of a middle class savior. Mervy LeRoy's I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was the most notable of the genre, and its success led Warner Brothers and other studios to copy the formula. Meanwhile, at Columbia Pictures, Frank Capra made his reputation (among the industry and filmgoing public alike; a rarity in those days) by developing his signature blend of social problem film and screwball comedy. Working with writer Robert Riskin, he would develop, repeat and refine this blend in films like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Meet John Doe, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. =The 1940s and postwar films = The postwar social problem films marked a noticeable shift away from economic problems to ones of social and psychological adjustment. This is perhaps due to the idea of returning veterans ability to become reestablished in normal society. As the thoughts and feelings of the nation progressed from worrying about unemployment to the horrors of war and rehabilitation of those suffering from addiction, so did the social problem film adapt to the national consciousness of its time. William Wyler's Best Years of Our Lives chronicled three returning veterans adjusting to civilian life. It was particularly powerful in that it served as a soothing to the anxieties many Americans felt about the returning of veterans to society. The national fear included the idea that these returning veterans would be bitter among their return not feeling properly reciprocated while also changed from the horrors they had seen. Also factoring in was the idea that the nuclear family had been broken up. The film addressed this social problem through its optimistic portrayal of the struggle for normalization, using a protagonist who had lost both hands in the war, notedly played by a non-professional actor who had that same experience, Harold Russell. The film depicts the intense male bonding that occurs during wartime in a positive way, showing the support each of the men have for each other. It also shows the struggles they face upon returning to their pre-war lives, although in an attempt to alleviate national anxiety the film ultimately resolves itself into a happy ending in which everything is reconciled. Although this film follows the general guidelines of a social problem film from the classic era such as usage of non-actors, the importance of historical context, a melodramatic feeling, and the didactic nature of the genre, the identification and solution to the social problem is less of a warning to society and more about increasing positive feelings in a nation reeling from the horrors of war. Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend was about alcoholism, inaugurating a cycle of films dealing with drug and alcohol abuse. Films like Gentleman's Agreement, Pinky and Home of the Brave tackled anti- Semitism and racism. The 1944 film Gaslight based on an earlier play, dramatized the Psychological abuse technique later known as Gaslighting(because of the film). In particular Gentleman's Agreement addresses specific issues that plagued the postwar environment in America. The film follows a journalist as he decides to pass for Jewish in order to understand their experience. One social issue that was integrated within United States society is the categorizing of minorities together as one group; African-Americans, Asian Americans, Jews, and homosexuals were all discriminated against without distinction. Awareness of this problem was raised a bit, however, through the evils of the Nazis being revealed to the nation as a result of this type of hatred. Antisemitism became a topic of discussion among the world as well after the suffering the Jewish people had endured and the social problem film responded through attempted representation of the problem. The efforts in Gentleman's Agreement were criticized by Jewish critics for not really delving into Jewish culture at all as well as not going deep enough into the effect of the Holocaust. The film was seen as depicting antisemitism as a nasty habit rather that cultural discrimination. However, the film succeeded at a commercial level and was able to affect audiences in a way that reduced their antisemitic feelings. =The 1950s and 1960s= McCarthyism, in the form of the House Un-American Activities Committee, dampened some of Hollywood's enthusiasm for left-leaning critiques of American society, but the genre continued nonetheless over the next two decades. Robert Wise's 1951 science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still urged international cooperation in matters of violence and world security in an environment of Cold War mistrust and nuclear paranoia: the \\"message\\" is literally delivered to the Earth by a civilized extraterrestrial. Stanley Kramer's expos√©s of racism‚ÄîThe Defiant Ones, Pressure Point and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner‚Äîbecame synonymous with the genre. Also, \\"juvenile delinquency films\\" combined the censorious tone of social problem films with exploitation film and melodrama. A series of Journalistic pieces on the ineffectiveness of mental health facilities also lead to an increase in public awareness about the social problem of mental health care. In particular, the expos√© Bedlam 1946 caused outrage among Americans affecting the national attitude of the time, which was already in a fragile place due to Nazi horrors being revealed to the public. This combined with the untrusting environment and cold war tensions was reflected in a bevy of films about mental health, the ineffectiveness of treatment, and the way these sort of people can be helped. The social problem genre reflected this notion particularly well through its 1956 film Bigger Than Life, which was consequently based on another article titled Ten Feet Tall published in The New Yorker. The film tackles the social problems of mental health and addiction as it displays its protagonist in a healthy happy familial relationship until he is forced to take cortisone for a rare disease, he abuses the medication resulting in mental health issues. The hospital and doctors in this film are shown as incompetent willing to believe anything the patient tells them and even supplying him with more cortisone when he shows drug-seeking behavior. This film also shows a marked shift from the social problem films of classic Hollywood due to a myriad of factors. In 1948, the Paramount Decrees were instituted after a landmark antitrust case by the United States against the major studios of the time. This resulted in a restriction on many forms of distribution, marketing, and time between film runs. This resulted in a shifting of power from the major studios of the time and thus they needed to find a new way to market their films. The creation of Cinemascope, which widened the aspect ratio allowing for widescreen viewing, and was viewed as the beginning of the end of the classical era of Hollywood. Having access to these new technologies the social problem film too would adapt, Bigger Than Life exhibited less didactic speech giving and allowed more interpretation from the audience as to what the social problem was. = The 1970s = A big theme of films of the 1970s is the Vietnam War. Films such as Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter focused on exposing the extreme conditions, both mentally and physically, that soldiers face during deployment. The social problem film, however, returns to its common theme of returning veterans, resulting in the critically acclaimed Coming Home, which followed a woman whose husband was away on tour as she volunteers at the veteran hospital and befriends a crippled soldier. However, the way in which the film interacts with narrative as well as with its audience shows a shift in form that reflects attitudes of the time. The '60s and '70s were a period time when second-wave feminism became apparent, raising awareness about inequalities regarding many social issues, though it mainly focused on white upper-class feminism. This national consciousness of feminist ideals combined with a wartime environment that was largely a failure, as well the inability to fully care for veterans is expressed through Coming Home's narrative and characters while also maintaining certain factors of the classic social problem film. The feminization of the Vietnam experience can be seen through the protagonist Luke, who is able to allow Sally to transcend her role as a stereotypical military wife, while also feminizing himself as he progresses into moving back to society. The more passive, a stereotypical feminine quality, he becomes the more he is allowed to leave the horrors of Vietnam behind. This type of characterization differs greatly from the characters we see in earlier returning veteran social problem films as they often portrayed the veteran as ultra-masculine and his wife as a traditional caretaker. Furthermore, the narrative of this film shows a marked difference from early social problem films. Instead of a didactic theme constantly being pushed on the audience, the story goes back and forth between this teaching vibe and following more of a soap opera romance formula. It is sometimes difficult to discern what the film wants us to focus on. However, the film does maintain certain characteristics of the social problem film such as a focused narrative, ending on a didactic speech, and usage of non-actors to portray the veterans at the hospital. = Contemporary social problem films = As the United States transitioned into the contemporary era, the social issues that encompassed the nation have adapted to focus on different aspects of the problems, especially in the case of immigration and the veteran experience, both of which feature heavily in the classic social problem film. For instance, the theme of the film Border Incident was the immigration of migrant farmworkers from Mexico. The returning veteran social problem films titled Best Years Of Our Lives and Coming Home focused on the treatment as well as the rehabilitation of veterans. In the contemporary United States, an immigration social issue which has been relevant for years is the idea of refugee asylum, whereas the returning veteran story-lines now often focus on the addiction to war and the inability to function normally without it. The Sudanese refugees in particular are of focus as their country is plagued in civil war, yet asylum in the United States had been blocked due to terrorist fears. A contemporary social problem film that addresses this issue is titled The Good Lie which follows the life of a group of Sudanese children as they escape their village to a refugee camp and come to America as adults. The beginning of the film does a decent job of representing the struggle over 25,000 children faced while trekking across Africa enduring the elements, animals, and soldiers trying to kill them as it follows the protagonists as they make the journey themselves, losing some along the way. It utilizes classic techniques such as location shooting at the refugee camp and the usage of real refugees as background characters. However, the film has much more in common with the form of social problem films such as Coming Home. It not only stars a famous actress in Reese Witherspoon but ultimately utilizes engagement with the narrative much more than trying to preach to its audience. As the protagonist group arrives in America the film experiences a shift from displaying the plight of these refugees to a culture clash of sorts as they struggle to adapt to American customs and realize the ineffectiveness of the bureaucratic systems meant to help them. Like Coming Home, the audience is not being put in a space where the film is meant to be purely educational, rather they are encouraged to discern the social problem from the drama being displayed. This is shown in the frustration of some reviewers who claim the plot seems manufactured and doesn't focus enough on certain social issues. This particular aspect of the changing form of the social problem film is largely due to audiences desire to be entertained as well as satiated with a well-formulated story to engage in. Another instance in which this becomes palpable is in the changing representation of returning veterans. The effects of wartime on American society are fluid depending on the situation and national feelings of the time. This is evident as post-WWII films often focused on a return to home for the veterans, encouraging family life and spousal support, as well as the revealing of the capability of humans to commit evil, resulting in forays into addressing these issues. Then during Vietnam, the feminist movement combined with national feelings of regret created both hyper-masculine films depicting the horror of battle but also the returning veterans plight and a more formulaic approach to narrative instead of a didactic one. The current era then is focused on international conflict within the middle east which has created a division in terms of ideology in our country. The social problem film has adapted to encompass these feelings through films such as Green Zone which addresses the idea of false motivations for entering the war against Iraq. More pertinent to the social problem film genre, however, is the idea of returning veterans. Whereas the treatment of these men has been displayed on screen, the contemporary social problem goes beyond that scope, and rather into the psyches of the soldiers themselves and the systems that perpetuate their situation. This is done through the depiction of war in a way that the 20th century would never consider, as another type of social problem, an addiction. This is the case in The Hurt Locker a 2008 film depicting the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in Iraq. Although it did shoot on location in Jordan, utilize non-actors, and focus on a small group of people the movie is much more like more recent social problem films in that it focuses on characterization, storytelling, and filming stylization to portray its social issue more than straightforward preaching. The film is both cinematic and visceral interweaving aspects of the war in documentary style while juxtaposing it with the usage of sound and technological advances to create an intense encapsulating narrative. Again the viewer is meant to see the protagonist's mundane home life compared to his experience on tour, where he seems more at home. The film begins on a quote equating war to a drug and ends on his days on tour counter resetting to 0, indicating both the hardship these men face and how it has shaped them into being more like machines built for a purpose rather than purely motivated soldiers. These scenes show a palpable shift from telling the audience how to feel via ending monologue, to displaying the problem and letting audiences interpret it for themselves. = Television and social media = With the development of new technologies such as television, it was inevitable that programming about social issues would become apparent. From documentaries for social justice to public broadcasting about local issues, the television is able to be accessed in ways movies can't. Certain programming such as The Biggest Loser address a specific social problem such as obesity in a setting which is presented as reality. However, in reality, the whole thing is pretty much scripted. Contestants waive their rights to creating their own story-line and are trained to point of collapsing, not a healthy way to address weight loss. This pseudo-reality is problematic in that it presents a certain social problem, along with a viable solution, like diet and exercise, yet it doesn't speak to the cultural issues and systematic factors like cheap fast food in poverty-stricken areas. The rise of social media has led to a transformation of many established systems, such as advertising, news, protests, campaigning, and exposure to other cultures. The ability to instantly connect with an event occurring and to share something with the public instantly has led to a new development of networks that can be accessed at the click of a mouse. So just as these other aspects of life were effected so is the idea of the social problem film. The ability for users to obtain, via YouTube, actual real-life video of events occurring around the world makes it tougher for filmic representations to become the didactic entity they need to be in order to fit in the genre. For instance, with over 100,000 results for a search on Iraq war footage, it becomes difficult to depict a sense of reality in which the viewer can relate purely, therefore the filmmaker's artistic influence becomes more apparent. This combined with the development of news programming via television has created a sort of environment where the social problem film was forced to change form, the majority didactic approach was no longer satisfactory as people have access to actual footage, therefore the implementation of deeper characterization and richer narratives became relevant in the more contemporary entries into this genre.

It opened originally in 1893 under the elevated train shed of the Reading Railroad Company after the city of Philadelphia advocated to move public markets from the streets into indoor facilities for both safety and sanitary reasons. The Reading Railroad Company owned and operated the market space until 1976 when the company liquidated, leaving the market without its parent company and foot traffic from the train. Presently, it still occupies the ground floor and basement levels of the Reading Terminal's former train shed which is now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Vendor stalls occupy the ground floor with entrances on Filbert Street to the South, Twelfth Street to the West, and Arch Street to the North. The stalls are arranged in a grid pattern with an open area in the center with tables and seating. Over one hundred merchants offer fresh produce, meats, fish, artisan cheese, groceries, ice cream, flowers, grilled cheese, baked goods, crafts, books, clothing, and specialty and ethnic foods. Two of the vendors are descendants of original merchants from the initial opening in the late 1800s. The basement floor of the market holds the state-of-the-art refrigerated storage area for vendor use. Currently, the market is open every day of the week, although the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants (a small but significant minority) generally do not operate Sunday through Tuesday. Bassett's Ice Cream at Reading Terminal Market History =Origins= Harry Ochs Original Harry Ochs meat stand Open-air markets have flourished in Philadelphia since its founding. Growth of the city demanded more markets, and the string of open-air markets extending from the Delaware River ran for six blocks, or one full mile, prompting the main street (then called 'High Street') to be renamed 'Market Street' in 1858. Soon after the markets reached their peak growth and capacity, the public began to perceive open-air markets within the city as dirty and unhygienic. Some residents also considered the frenzy of activity along the High/Market Street as a nuisance and traffic hazard. In 1859, city officials bowed to public pressure and dismantled all of them and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania chartered seventeen different market companies. This prompted two indoor markets to open at 12th and Market Streets, Franklin Market and Farmers' Market. These two would be the foundation of the Reading Terminal Market. =Expansion and growth= Inside the market The Industrial Revolution brought with it the expansion of the railroad, and great palatial urban terminals sprang up in major cities. Architect F. H. Kimbal of the Wilson Brothers Architecture & Engineering firm designed the Reading Railroad's headhouse terminal in 1891, prior to its opening in 1893. The rails were elevated to reach the train shed platform built over top of the new consolidated market, which opened a year earlier. George McKay was chosen to be the market's first superintendent while the building was undergoing its final phase of construction. The state-of-the-art refrigerated storage area in the basement opened for use in July 1893. The basement storage area consists of 52 separate rooms ranging in volume from for a total of of storage space. The temperature of each room can be controlled individually to meet temperature requirements for different goods: for meat and poultry, for fruits and vegetables. The refrigeration system uses brine water and ammonia, and includes an array of specially designed pumps, compressors, and other equipment in its operation. The storage area was more expensive to maintain and had a larger staff than the market itself, though refrigerating the basement storage area was thought to be well worth the high cost. It allowed merchants to keep seasonal products in stock all year round for the first time. Third parties also leased the storage area for storing other goods. Restaurants and plant and produce sellers around the area leased out space in the basement. Hospitals used the basement area to store perishable medicine. Local Breweries, including Yuengling, used it to store their hops. In its first few decades, the Reading Terminal Market was a success. There were 380 merchants in its first year of operations, and the market had nearly full occupancy for the following 60 years. Business, already good, flourished with the innovation of a free market basket service, which allowed suburban housewives to get grocery orders delivered to and held at their nearest train station. Refrigerated trucks allowed the market to reach into some 60 suburban towns as well as seaside resorts along the Jersey Shore. =Decline = Reading Terminal Market Sign The Great Depression of the 1930s brought hardship to the market. By the late 1930s, merchants were under increasing pressure from the AFL and CIO to join their respective labor unions. This led to a series of strikes that further disrupted business. The introduction and proliferation of supermarkets also hurt market business during the 1930s. One of these new establishments opened across 12th street, directly competing with the Reading Terminal Market. Pressure to compete with supermarkets led to fewer stalls being run by farmers, and more being run by middle men reselling a variety of goods. Despite the turmoil brought on by the depression and new competition, the Reading Terminal Market remained afloat during the 1930s. By some accounts, the market did rather well. According to George H. Eltien, then superintendent, the market was shipping phone orders to 38 states, Canada, and Mexico throughout the decade. Pressure from supermarkets was not hurting all of the merchants. Ten of the market's 64 merchants had been there since its founding in 1892. In 1930, the Reading Terminal Market Merchants Association established as an effort to promote and advertise the market and avoid losing any more business. The Association was responsible for several promotional events including the first annual Food Show and Home Progress Exhibitions. It also helped to fund a 1934 renovation of the market's facade that installed new electric lights and window decorations. America's involvement in World War II during the 1940s affected the Market primarily in a positive way. In 1944, the most economically straining year of the war, the Market was at 97 percent occupancy. Food shortages brought on by the war increased the demand for the market's goods. On May 9, 1946, the Reading Terminal Market experienced its largest recorded crowd. Over 12,000 people gathered at the market to purchase meat, poultry, and pork products that were unavailable elsewhere due to shortages. The suburbanization of America and decline of the railroads in the 1950s and 1960s severely affected the market. The market began running on a deficit in 1954, and by 1959 was only 70 percent occupied, forcing Reading to raise rents. The state-of-the-art cold storage facility was shut down and dismantled, forcing tenants to supply their own storage. Several other events hurt the market and its merchants financially. The Dock Street wholesale market was closed and demolished as part of the urban renewal program in Society Hill. This hurt many resellers at the Reading Market who depended on the Dock Street market for inventory. The Reading Railroad Company filed for bankruptcy in 1971, and ceased to function as a railroad business in 1976. The company continued to serve mainly as a real estate business, but paid little attention to managing and promoting the market, and pondered ways to get rid of the market so that it would be easier to sell the terminal building. = Rebirth = Philbert by Eric Berg In the 1980s the Reading Company changed its attitude towards the market and began efforts to revitalize it. Those efforts continued after SEPTA Regional Rail trains moved from the train terminal above the market to the new underground Market East Station (now Jefferson Station) below it in 1984. In 1990, ownership of the Reading Terminal and the market passed to the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority (PCCA), and in 1994, Philadelphia City Council established a new, non-profit Reading Terminal Market Corporation (RTMC) to operate the market. The RTMC and the PCCA continued the revitalization program begun by the Reading Company, recruiting new tenants and increasing promotion of the market. By the mid-1990s to the 2000s, the market was once again living up to its founder's' vision. Over 90% of its leasable space was occupied by profitable and stable vendors. The market is currently open 7 days a week, but not all vendors are open on Sundays. The Pennsylvania Dutch vendors are open Wednesday through Saturday. Present day Reading Terminal Market  The 1200 block of Filbert Street ‚Äì Harry Ochs Way Today the market serves as a popular location for local Philadelphians to buy their goods and produce as well as singular culinary treats and unique merchandise; it is listed with such Philadelphia tourist destinations as Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell as well. It is adjacent to two Marriott Hotels, a Hilton Garden Inn, the Pennsylvania Convention Center, SEPTA's Jefferson Station, the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal, and another Philadelphia landmark, the Fashion District Philadelphia shopping mall. As addressed in the official Reading Terminal Market's mission statement, the current organization wants: * To preserve the architectural and historical character, and function, of the Reading Terminal Market as an urban farmers' market. * To provide a wide variety of produce, meat, fish, bakery and dairy products, and other raw and prepared food, brought to a public market in the center of the city by farmers, growers, producers and chefs; * To maintain an environment that recognizes and celebrates the diversity of our citizens and fosters their interaction; * To strengthen the historic link and mutual dependency of our rural and urban communities; and, * To achieve this, while preserving the financial viability and achieving self-sufficiency for the Market. These values show the current goals that the market community strives for as a union of service providers as well as their identity as a collective non-profit organization. The present day market has also continued to evolve in terms of the types of merchants that have their businesses in the market; it has shifted from being a place with only produce, delis and fish counters to a more dynamic merchant selection. In addition to longstanding vendors such as Bassett‚Äôs Ice Cream‚Äîwhich first signed a lease at Reading Terminal Market in 1893‚Äîthe market has innovated in recent years, introducing new types of vendors and experimenting with pop-up food carts. In addition to mainstays such as butchers and fishmongers, the market is home to the non- profit Fair Food Philly‚Äôs market stand, a gourmet corn-dog vendor, a winery, and a beer hall. Day-carts‚Äîwhich have typically housed the wares of souvenir sellers and arts and crafts vendors‚Äînow may sell foods and beverages. One of the newest vendors to operate a day-cart is a craft distiller of spirits. Pennsylvania Dutch pretzel baker Besides the up-and-coming vendors that have made themselves a part of Reading Terminal Market, a variety of events have come out of the continued development of the market. Some of these events include a \\"beer-tasting extravaganza\\", ‚ÄúBreaking Bread, Breaking Barriers: Food as a Bridge to Cultural Understanding‚Äù series and a community gathering benefiting local Syrian refugees who are getting to know their neighborhood.  References in popular culture  Philbert the pig, a sculpture by Eric Berg, is the Market's mascot and donations made to this 'piggy bank' go to support healthy eating programs at The Food Trust. The market has been a filming location for several major motion pictures including Trading Places and National Treasure.

It was developed and overseen by a unit within the National Bureau of Standards (which unit later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory) with assistance from the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Bell Telephone Laboratories. It is considered the first American fully automated and operational guided missile. Background In January 1941 RCA proposed a new TV-guided anti-shipping weapon, called Dragon, for which an operator would use the TV image sent from the nose of the weapon and operate aerodynamic controls during the weapon's fall. The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) would provide the airframe for use with a standard bomb, and was the same guidable ordnance airframe design used for the earlier, abortive Project Pigeon weapons program. The Pelican was a June 1942 modification using semi-active radar homing. By mid-1943, a modification of the design was proposed to use a new active radar homing system from Western Electric with a (one short ton) general-purpose (GP) bomb, the same basic \\"AN-M66\\" ordnance unit as used for the heavier USAAF VB-2 version of the Azon radio-controlled ordnance. This Pelican version entered testing in summer 1944 at Naval Air Station New York, where it hit its target ship in two out of four drops. Development The Bat was the production version which combined the original NBS airframe with a AN-M65 GP bomb, the same basic ordnance that was used in the contemporary Azon guided munition, and the Pelican active radar system. Gyrostabilized with an autopilot supplied by Bendix Aviation, the steerable tail elevator was powered by small wind-driven generators. The Navy's Bureau of Ordnance in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) supervised development and the NBS was in charge of the overall development. Flight tests were conducted at the Naval Air Ordnance Test Station at Chincoteague Island, Virginia. Hugh Latimer Dryden won the President's Certificate of Merit for the development of the Bat, which \\"was flight tested by a small unit based at Philadelphia against targets in New Jersey.\\" While the NBS developed the Bat's aerodynamic and gyroscopic stabilizing systems, MIT and Bell Labs worked together on its guidance mechanism. Deployment A Bat weapon on a bomb cart, with its nose radome removed The antiship variant of the Bat (SWOD, for \\"Special Weapons Ordnance Device\\",SWOD Mark 9 Modification 0) eventually saw combat service beginning in April 1945 off Borneo, dropped by Consolidated PB4Y Privateers (one bomb mounted under each wing) at altitudes of at airspeeds of . Several Japanese ships were sunk and the kaibokan Aguni was damaged from a range of , which is frequently miscredited as being sunk by a destroyer.http://www.combinedfleet.com/Aguni_t.htm Several Bats were also fitted with modified radar systems (SWOD Mark 9 Model 1) and dropped on Japanese-held bridges in Burma ‚Äì the same targets that the MCLOS-guidance, half-ton (AN-M65 GP bomb) weight VB-1 Azon PGM ordnance was designed to take on ‚Äì and other land-based targets. The Bat's pioneering radar guidance system was easily confused by radar land clutter, particularly against targets close to shore. About a total of 2,600 Bat missiles were deployed. After the war, the naval designation ASM-N-2 was applied to the unit. The Privateer was the primary launch platform for the Bat, but other aircraft were also modified to launch the weapon, including the Vought F4U Corsair, Curtiss SB2C Helldiver, and Grumman TBF Avenger. The primary post-World War II aircraft to carry the weapon was the P-2 Neptune. Existing missiles The original NBS test airframe of the Bat was renovated in 2001 to resemble the real missile and is currently on display at the museum of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the successor to the earlier US National Bureau of Standards.

The largest crowd to ever see a game at the park was the 2016 Governor's Cup in which 8,542 fans watched the Mississippi State Bulldogs defeat the Ole Miss Rebels, 2-0. The ballpark derives its name from the sale of naming rights to Trustmark Corporation headquartered in Jackson, MS. Features Trustmark Park features a 360¬∞ concourse that allows fans to circle the playing field without missing a pitch. The ballpark is in a recessed bowl with seating starting at the main level and proceeding downward. All support facilities face outward onto the concourse, thus spectators can leave their seats and not be separated from the game action. Red bricks and exposed steel trusses reflect the feel of a historic ballpark, with modern-day conveniences. The scoreboard located behind the left-center-field wall includes a and video board that features everything from live action to instant replay to commercials. The Farm Bureau Grill, beyond the right-field wall, is a full-service restaurant with a capacity for 200+ customers. The Farm Bureau Grill is open during games, and it is also open for lunch Monday through Friday year-round. The restaurant can also be rented throughout the year for special events such as holiday parties, wedding receptions, business functions, etc. There are eight baseball-themed concession stands that offer a wide variety of ballpark treats. 22 luxury suites that seat between 16 and 64 fans are climate controlled and equipped with flat screen televisions, refrigerators, ice makers, serving counters and sliding glass doors that open up to private seating areas. Suites are available for yearly and nightly rentals. The ballpark also includes a picnic pavilion located in the left field corner of the stadium and two party decks located on the suite level. The picnic pavilion can be rented on a nightly basis for groups of 100 to 350+ people. The first and third base party decks are also available on a nightly basis for groups of 30 to 50 fans. Many businesses host employee appreciation functions throughout the year. There are 150 closed-circuit video monitors positioned around the ballpark televising the game. A merchandise store and a kids play area is located at the main gate. The team store is open Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM year-round. The field dimensions are down the left-field line, down the right-field line, and to center-field. The playing surface is peppered with a maze of underground pipelines capable of draining up to of rain every hour. Events In 2011, the venue hosted the Conference USA Baseball Tournament, won by Rice. It hosted the 2012 tournament, as well, which was won by UAB. Each year Trustmark Park plays host to the Governor's Cup, a neutral-site meeting between Mississippi State and Ole Miss. While both teams play each other on campus as part of Southeastern Conference play, this game is a non-conference matchup between the two bitter rivals that regularly draws capacity crowds. The tradition of a one-off game in the Jackson area has existed since 1980, when it was known as the Mayor's Trophy and played in Jackson proper: it was moved to Pearl when Trustmark Park opened in 2006 and thus renamed. As of 2020, the Bulldogs lead the overall neutral-site series 22-18, with a 9-4 lead in games played in Pearl.

It was named after a race horse that was named for Abraham Lincoln's mother. The name is even older than the mid-20th century train derived from that of a short-lived but famous steam special, the Nancy Hanks. The earlier Nancy operated in 1892 and 1893. Nancy Hanks II made its first trip on July 17, 1947. The new train's cars were painted blue and gray and, like the first Nancy, each bore a likeness of the famed trotter on the side. \\"The Nancy\\", as it was affectionately known, was an all-coach, reserved-seat train with grill lounge service. The train had an average speed of 48 mph (including stops) and made the journey in 6 hours. It left the Central of Georgia Depot in Savannah daily at 7 a.m., running to Atlanta Terminal Station via Macon Terminal Station, and returned from Atlanta at 6 p.m. (18:00). Black and white passengers were separated on this pocket streamliner until the 1960s. Four \\"divided\\" segregated coaches were built by American Car & Foundry (ACF) for Nancy, and African-Americans were not allowed to eat in the grill-lounge car. The Central of Georgia was the last major Southern railroad to desegregate. Since it ran only in Georgia and did not engage in interstate commerce, it evaded the Interstate Commerce Commission's 1961 order to desegregate.Arsenault, Raymond; Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice, p. 438 In the 1960s the Central leased a dome car from the Norfolk and Western-Wabash line, where it had operated for a number of years; the car was thoroughly renovated for service on the Nancy Hanks II. The dome parlor-lounge car was 85 feet (26 m) long, made of steel and originally was built by Pullman-Standard. It had a dark-blue exterior and interior upholstery in royal blue and gray. In keeping with the racehorse theme, the lounge beneath the dome was branded the \\"Saddle & Stirrup.\\" Despite its popularity in Middle Georgia, the Nancy suffered a marked decline in ridership during the 1960s, in tandem with the larger decline of rail service during this period. While Southern opted to stay in the passenger business when Amtrak took over most passenger service, the Nancy was not among the routes retained. As a result, the Nancy made its last run on April 30, 1971, the day before Amtrak came into being. Atlanta's Terminal Station was demolished the following year.

He was the mayor of Russell, Manitoba from 1915 to 1918, concurrent with his early tenure in the legislature. Wilson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1915. Running for the Liberal Party, he easily defeated Conservative candidate J.P. Laycock in the constituency of Russell. Wilson was re-elected without difficulty in the 1920 election. During these years, he was a backbench supporter of Premier Tobias Norris's government. The Liberals were defeated in the 1922 provincial election, and Wilson lost his seat to Isaac Griffiths of the United Farmers of Manitoba. He sought re-election in 1927, but was again defeated. Wilson served as chair of the Russell School Board from 1935 to 1942. He was re-elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1941 provincial election, following a nineteen-year absence. Previously, the United Farmers of Manitoba had evolved into the Progressive Party, and had merged with the Liberals to create the \\"Liberal-Progressive Party\\".

While pitching in Major League Baseball (MLB), from to , Byrd was known as being the \\"nicest guy in baseball.\\" Late in his career, he developed an old-fashioned, early twentieth- century windup in which he swung his arms back and forth to create deception and momentum. Byrd became recognizable and well known for his unique delivery. High school, college and minor leagues Byrd played his high school career at Saint Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky. Byrd attended Louisiana State University where he pitched as part of the Tigers baseball team that won the 1991 College World Series. He was originally drafted in the fourth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball draft by the Cleveland Indians. Byrd spent five years in the minor leagues before being traded to the New York Mets and making his major league debut on July 28, 1995. Major leagues As a member of the Philadelphia Phillies, Byrd was selected for the 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Byrd's career was revived in 2002, when he won 17 games, despite pitching for a Kansas City Royals team that lost 100 games. Byrd parlayed his 2002 season into a two-year free agent contract with the Atlanta Braves. On July 1, 2003, Byrd underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. He was able to successfully come back from the operation and pitch in his first postseason appearance for the Braves during the 2004 National League Division Series. In December 2004, the Anaheim Angels signed Byrd to a $5 million(USD), one-year contract following the trade of right- handed pitcher Ram√≥n Ortiz to the Cincinnati Reds. Byrd went 12‚Äì11 with a 3.74 earned run average in 205 innings with the Angels. He was second in the American League with 21 quality starts.

The paper accused him of spending $24,850 on HGH and syringes from 2002 to 2005. Byrd defended himself, claiming that he was being treated for a tumor on his pituitary gland, and took the drugs under medical supervision. Subsequent news reports assert that Byrd began taking HGH before any pituitary gland condition was diagnosed and that one of the medical professionals to have prescribed Byrd HGH was a Florida dentist whose dental license had been suspended for fraud and incompetence.

R. McKinney, directed by Arthur Hiller, and starring Nick Nolte, JoBeth Williams, Ralph Macchio, and Judd Hirsch. It was shot in Columbus, Ohio, mostly at the former Central High School. At the time of its release, the film held a rating of R with the MPAA rating system.  Plot  On a typical Monday morning at John F. Kennedy High School in the inner city of Columbus, Ohio, there is conflict between teachers, a student with a stab wound, and a talk of an upcoming lawsuit. Vice Principal Roger Rubell, Principal Eugene Horn, and lawyer Lisa Hammond, who is in charge of taking depositions for the Calvin case, in which a recent graduate is suing the school for granting him a diploma despite his illiteracy. Alex Jurel is a veteran Social Studies teacher who takes his job lightly, despite being one of the most popular teachers in school because of his ability to identify and connect with the students. Jurel has been worn down by years of being in-between the rowdy students and the demands of the administration. He is assigned to temporarily take over the duties of the school psychologist, and meets a young man named Eddie Pilikian, to whom he becomes a mentor. During this time, a romance also develops between Jurel and Hammond, his former student. Other subplots include Herbert Gower, a wandering mental institution outpatient, mistaken for a substitute teacher and put in charge of a U.S. History class, whose brilliant history mind makes it fun, educational, and engaging; gym teacher Mr. Troy's sexual relationship with a student that ends with Jurel taking her to an abortion clinic, and the death of Eddie's best friend Danny, a schizophrenic and kleptomaniac student who is shot and killed by the police after he draws a gun from his locker during a drug search. Superintendent Donna Burke and school lawyer Al Lewis are attempting to avoid bad publicity associated with the Calvin lawsuit. To prove this, they try to figure out which teachers will potentially damage the school's reputation in their depositions. The administration recognizes the threat Jurel poses to their social standing and forces him to resign before his deposition, ostensibly for helping the student obtain an abortion. After harsh criticism from Lisa, he finally stands up to Burke and Rubell, reminding them that the school exists for the students and not for the administration and protecting their jobs. He also threatens to sue and petition should he be fired. He proudly walks back into the school, with loud cheers from the school's students and Lisa looking on proudly.

Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader remarked that \\"the characters [in the film] have all been invented for strictly didactic purposes: they come on waving their moral conflicts like big white bed sheets, and as soon as you see them you can predict every trite turn of the plot.\\" A critic for Variety said that the film \\"makes stinging, important points about the mess of secondary public education, but [that] those points are diluted gradually by an overload of comic absurdity.\\" Roger Ebert remarked that \\"the idea here was to do for teaching what 'MASH' did for the war. Unfortunately, they've done for schools what 'General Hospital' did for medicine. 'Teachers' has an interesting central idea, about shell-shocked teachers trying to remember their early idealism, but the movie junks it up with so many sitcom compromises that we can never quite believe the serious scenes.\\" Ebert ended his review by stating \\"the sad bottom line\\": Pat Collins of the CBS Morning News remarked that with the film, \\"there's an overwhelming urge to take out a giant eraser and wipe the screen clean of what is absolutely the worst 'high school is a jungle' movie to come down the locker line corridor in a long time\\", singling out \\"the ham in the performances of the actors who have all done better in the past\\", before calling it \\"a shrill, preachy and superficial treatment of the subject of public school education.\\" She concluded her review for the film by saying that \\"teachers, students and parents in the real world don't need Hollywood to tell them what's wrong with the problems of public schools\\" and that \\"compared to Teachers, homework is more fun.\\"Collins, Pat (1984-10-17). \\"Movie Review: Teachers\\".

The original version has been lost, but its content has been preserved in the r√≠mur of Hr√≥mundr Gripsson, known as Griplur, which were probably composed in the first half of the 14th century, but appeared in print in 1896 in Fernir forn√≠slenzkar r√≠mnaflokkar, edited by Finnur J√≥nsson. These r√≠mur were the basis for the not very appreciated Hr√≥munds saga which is found in the 17th-century MS of the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection, AM 587b 4¬∞, as well as thirty-eight known later manuscripts. The saga as we now have it contains a number of narrative discrepancies, which are probably the result of the scribe working from a partly illegible manuscript of the r√≠mur. Contents According to √ûorgils saga ok Hafli√∞a, a saga included in the great compilation Sturlunga saga, the original version was composed by the farmer Hr√≥lfr of Sk√°lmarnes and was recited by him at a wedding at Reykjah√≥lar in 1119: The saga that we now have is about Hr√≥mundr serving king √ìl√°f King of Warriors (√ìl√°fr Li√∞smannakonung) and Hr√≥mund's battles with the berserker Hr√∂ngvi√∞, as well as the undead witch-king √ûr√°inn, a draugr (he was a former king of Gaul, Valland). √ûr√°inn had killed 420 men, including the Swedish king Semingr, with his enchanted sword Mistletoe (Mistilteinn.) Hr√≥mund grapples with √ûr√°inn and wins, burns his body and takes Mistletoe. This first section of the saga corresponds with the saga described in √ûorgils saga ok Hafli√∞a. It's been questioned whether √ûorgils saga could have reported such details accurately over a century after the fact, but even if no such saga was told in 1119, the basic tale must have been familiar by the mid-13th century, when √ûorgils saga ok Hafli√∞a itself was written. Soon afterwards, Hr√≥mundr is slandered to King Olaf and forced to leave his service, but he returns to fight the two kings of Sweden, both named Haldingr or Haddingr, who have invaded Olaf's realm. With them is their champion Helgi Haddingjaskati (Hr√∂ngvi√∞'s brother) who is aided in battle by his lover K√°ra's magic. During the battle, she flies overhead in the shape of a swan, and she is probably based on the Valkyrie K√°ra. Her magical singing causes Helgi's enemies to forget to defend themselves, and Helgi is able to kill all eight of Hr√≥mundr's brothers. When Hr√≥mundr arrives, Helgi accidentally cuts off the swan's leg as he swings his sword, and is no longer protected by K√°ra's magic. Hr√≥mundr kills Helgi but is severely wounded. His rival at Olaf's court, Vali, gets Mistletoe away from him before Hr√≥mundr kills him as well. After recuperating and finding Mistletoe again, Hr√≥mund slays the last Swedish king Haldingr. This section of the saga reflects parts of the lost K√°rulj√≥√∞ which is mentioned in the prose section of Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana II. This section says that Helgi Hundingsbane and his lover, the Valkyrie Sigr√∫n are reborn as Helgi Haddingjaskati and K√°ra. It also reflects others of the \\"Helgi lays\\" preserved in the Poetic Edda; an episode in which Hr√≥mundr is searched for by a malicious counsellor named Blindr, but is concealed by being dressed as a female servant grinding grain, is very close to an escapade of Helgi in Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana II. It is probably not a historic account of real events since it was remarked by king Sverre of Norway, who heard it, that it was an amusing \\"lying tale\\" (lygisaga). Nonetheless, according to Landn√°mab√≥k, Hr√≥mundr Gripsson was the paternal great-grandfather of Ingolfr Arnarson, the first settler in Iceland. This means that he would have lived in Norway in the first half of the 8th century, and it's not impossible that stories about an ancestor who did exist were handed down by his Icelandic descendants (probably becoming increasingly embellished as time passed).  Sweden  Hr√≥mundr has been connected to Swedish legends of Ramunder hin Onde (Hr√≥mundr the Evil). In these traditions he was a wild and evil Viking who founded the estate of Ramundeboda in the forest of Tiveden, Sweden. His daughter Skaga constructed the Skaga stave church.

(Korean: Îñ≥Îã§ Í∑∏ÎÖÄ!!) (also known as Tteot-ta geu-nyeo or Tteotta or Ddautta) is a South Korean Flash cartoon series produced by a three-person team and hosted on the Korean website SamBakZa. The cartoons became particularly popular during the spring of 2004 when they were exposed to American and European audiences. The series is originated from Comic strip 'One day' (Korean: Ïñ¥Îñ§ÎÇ†) which has been published from November 2000 until March 2002 on Braille newspaper 'Newspaper that we read together' (Hangul: Ìï®Íªò ÏùΩÎäî Ïã†Î¨∏) that is published by Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo.http://www.sambakza.net/works_oneday/oneday_main.html The series is noted for its classic manhwa style elements and its high-quality animation. The first There she is!! generated a large amount of positive feedback from its online audience, including fan art, which drove SamBakZa to produce more cartoons in the series. The plot of the series is the romance between an anthropomorphic bunny and cat, in a world where such relationships are taboo. At the 2004 Anima Mundi animation festival in Brazil, this video won first place in both the Web Animation - Professional Jury and Web Animation - Audience divisions, as well as winning the Special Award Anima Mundi Web. Distribution rights to the series are licensed to Gyeonggi Digital Contents Agency (GDCA). SamBakZa have moved to the Production Support Center located in Gyeonggi-do Bucheon-si on 2008.http://www.sambakza.net/xe/BulletinBoard/9707 SamBakZa have also stated they may be setting up a registration system in the future on their main page, and will send emails to members when new episodes are released to the public. Since July 2014, all five episodes have remained in the top 20 of Newground's Best of All time with the original 'There She Is!!' holding the first-place position. Combined, the series has been viewed over thirteen million times on Newgrounds.  Characters  Doki: Doki (ÎèÑÌÇ§, cf. Korean word tokki ÌÜ†ÎÅº \\"rabbit\\") is a female rabbit who is madly in love with Nabi and considers everyone to be her friends. Although very loving and cheerful, she is somewhat obsessive and willing to go to extremes to get what she wants. She has a habit of befriending animals and putting green ribbons, similar to that of Nabi's, around their necks or tails. Nabi: Nabi (ÎÇòÎπÑ, cf. Korean word goyang'i Í≥†ÏñëÏù¥, \\"kitty\\") is a male cat as well as Doki's love interest in the story. He is reluctant to return Doki's love at first, finding her antics annoying and fearing the social repercussions, but grows to tolerate and eventually reciprocate it.On the character page if you roll over Nabi the arrow will turn from red to pink. He wears a green scarf and seems to have some skill in martial arts. In Step 3 it is shown that he works as a paperboy. Nabi translates to \\"butterfly\\",Google Translate and is a common name for a pet cat in South Korea. Jjintta Set: The Jjintta Set (Ï∞êÎî∞ ÏÑ∏Ìä∏ Jjintta Seteu, translating as \\"Moron Set\\") is a gang of three roughneck, shaggy male rabbits. The three are brothers, the children of a female rabbit and a male lion. They appear as minor antagonists in the second episode, but slowly develop a friendship with Nabi. Their members include: * Il-ho (ÏùºÌò∏, \\"Number One\\"), the leader of the group, and also firstborn. He has a rather fierce rivalry with Nabi and is extremely protective of Doki. In episode 2 He misunderstands that Nabi was forcing her in a relationship, but realizes otherwise later. In episode 5, He gives Nabi a ticket to \\"Paradise\\" albeit reluctantly. In the episodes it is unclear what motivates his behavior, but in 2016 the creator shared that Il-ho's motivation is his parentage. * Yi-ho (Ïù¥Ìò∏ Iho, \\"Number Two\\"), who wears an eye patch and has a crush on the keyboardist, Pi. The second eldest brother. * Sam-ho (ÏÇºÌò∏, \\"Number Three\\"), who wears a medical mask and appears to be less coordinated than the other members of the gang. The youngest brother.http://www.sambakza.net/works_tsi/tsi_main.html Band: While the website's profile does not give any information about them, they are present in Step 2. The band consists of Pi, a female cat keyboardist; and a male rabbit guitarist named Moon Red Eyes A tall male bunny wearing sun glasses, and artist. He was originally created as an antagonist. Hana: Hana (ÌïòÎÇò, translating as \\"One\\" or common name in Korea.) is a female cat, and the apparent owner of the band. She is shown to be very kind, especially towards Doki and Nabi, and has a loving trust in her bodyguard, Pizza. Pizza: Pizza (ÌîºÏßú, Pijja) is a large male cat, and Hana's bodyguard. He has a noticeable scar over his right eye, but its origin is unknown. Gray Rabbit: Gray Rabbit (ÌöåÏÉâ ÌÜ†ÎÅº Hoisaek Tokki, literally Gray Rabbit) is a large male rabbit who is in love with Hana. He is often depicted holding a bouquet of flowers. Works as an electrical engineer.  Step one: \\"There She Is!!\\"  275px The first animation in the series was released on the SamBakZa website on April 20, 2003. Its soundtrack is the Korean ska song \\"There she is!!\\" (Îñ≥Îã§! Í∑∏ÎÖÄ!!) by Witches (ÏúÑÏπòÏä§). The plot revolves around Doki, a female rabbit, meeting, falling in love with, and chasing Nabi, a male cat, in a world where love between the two species is socially unacceptable. The theme of the short is that all love can be accepted and has a chance. Nabi attempts to cure Doki's infatuation for him, but after seeing the extent of her love, he gives in and finds something he can appreciate in her. A version with English titling was published in 2004 to high acclaim. The characters names were not disclosed until 2006, in preparation for the last three steps. \\"There She Is!!\\" was nominated for both the Professional Award and the Cyber Jury Award at the Anima Mundi Web Festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2004. It won both categories.http://www.animamundi.com.br/web_galeria.asp?ano=2004&cod;=25  Step two: \\"Cake Dance\\"  The second short in the series, \\"Cake Dance\\" (Îñ≥Îã§ Í∑∏ÎÖÄ!! step 2. - ÏºÄÏù¥ÌÅ¨ ÎåÑÏä§), was released on the SamBakZa website on February 25, 2005. Its soundtrack is the Korean pop song \\"Happy Birthday to Me\\" by Bulldog Mansion. Like its predecessor, it is carried by classic manhwa style elements, but also includes considerable amounts of full-animation action. Nabi carries Doki's birthday cake across various obstacles including a gang of rabbits, the Jjintta Set, who attack him out of Yi-ho's mistaken belief that Nabi forced Doki into the relationship. It is also worth noting that near the end of the short, Doki and Nabi (as well as the rest of the party) are ejected from the caf√©, after Doki publicly shows affection for Nabi. The owner of the cafe clearly shows a bias against inter-species relationships, by displaying an \\"anti-intermarriage\\" sign on the door. This foreshadows some of the events which occur in step four of the series. In the end, Nabi runs into a younger female rabbit, whom the viewer is led to believe is in the same predicament that Nabi was in when the episode began, and he offers to help her safely navigate the streets with her cake (likely the same little girl who runs past in the very first scene, being teased by a rabbit boy with a fish, probably making fun of her for liking a cat). = Easter eggs = If one clicks on the fish in the moon during the stampede scene, the original comic starring Doki and Nabi (titled \\"Only You\\") followed by thanks from the creator will appear. This is only in the English version of the short; the Korean version displays what appears to be a snapshot of an animation panel in Flash, presumably from step two. The flying fish on the moon is a reference to another SamBakZa animation, Hot Fish, in which Doki and Nabi make an appearance. This is currently officially unavailable due to copyright issues with the soundtrack, \\"Sera\\" by Jeo Qu-cheon. However, it is available on YouTube. The signs on the walls of the subway station read \\"Bulldog Mansion\\". Clicking on them will give a link to their (now defunct) site.  Step three: \\"Doki and Nabi\\"  275px Step three begins an in-depth trilogy of sequels to the first two videos. It premiered at SICAF (Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival) on May 21‚Äì25, 2008, and was posted online on May 30.Untitled Document Its soundtrack is the Korean pop song \\"3Ï∞®ÏÑ±Ïßï\\" (Sam-cha Seong-jing, translating to \\"tertiary sex characteristic\\") by T.A.COPY. This step portrays Doki and Nabi's first date. Nabi begins as an unwilling recipient of Doki's love, but starts to reciprocate as the date goes on. The Jjintta Set and their objections are upset when Doki tackle-hugs Il-ho, then turning the hug into something akin to a nelson. In the end, Nabi asks Doki out on a second date, and their relationship blossoms into a mutual romance, and they share their first kiss. The intermarriage theme is more prominent in this episode, as are the consequences of their relationship: the step ends with a rock thrown through Nabi's window. = Easter eggs = Clicking the cloud on the top right of the loading screen triggers an alternate opening that focuses on Doki making her way to Nabi's house. Clicking the black poster during the scene with the neighbors opens T.A.COPY's site in another window. The scene where Doki befriends the hedgehog is a nod to Hayao Miyazaki's Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, in which Nausica√§ tames Teto the fox-squirrel. During the scene where Doki is chasing Nabi, after all attempts to capture Nabi fail, Doki throws a Pok√© Ball at Nabi's head. Also referenced just prior is the Chain Mine, as used by the MS18E Kampfer, in the series Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket.  Step four: \\"Paradise\\"  275px The fourth short, \\"Paradise\\", was released August 20, 2008. Its soundtrack is the Korean rock song \\"Wolsik\\" by Tabu from the album, A Lunar Eclipse. In this step, the protagonists deal with social revolt over intermarriage as Doki is attacked by an angry mob. She attempts to flee until her pet hedgehog turns to meet her pursuers. Doki goes back to save it, but is hurt and hospitalized. Fearing that intermarriage opponents will injure Doki further, Nabi abruptly ends the relationship, displaying an anti-intermarriage sign on his door. Doki considers asking him to come with her to \\"Paradise\\" (implied to be a location that accepts intermarriage), not noticing Il-ho spying on her. Il-ho confronts the detached Nabi to literally knock some sense into him, but his action sparks an attack by intermarriage supporters who assume he is viciously attacking Nabi. Il-ho turns to leave and finds intermarriage opponents in the way. Frustrated, he blindly punches through the crowd, only to hit his brother Yi-ho by mistake. This provokes a riot between intermarriage supporters and opposers. As the fight fades, we see Doki standing and crying over her hedgehog, which has stopped breathing and presumably died. Doki tries to contact Nabi, who can't answer since he was arrested alongside Il-ho during the riot. Assuming Nabi is not interested in a relationship with her, Doki loses all hope. She drops her cellphone from the roof of her apartment building and decides to leave for \\"Paradise\\". Much darker in character than the previous episodes, this episode is primarily in black and white, with Nabi's trademark green scarf, Doki's blushing cheeks and trademark pink bow, and the numerous intermarriage protest signs portrayed in gray-scale. As the episode progresses, Nabi's scarf gradually fades in color; when he breaks off the relationship with Doki, his scarf has completely faded to grey. In this use of colour imagery, the influence of SamBakZa's new sponsors and the increase in their technical ability can be seen. Toward the end, Doki's trademark pink bow and cheeks also fade to gray as she loses all hope of Nabi ever loving her. It was revealed on Newgrounds that the author thought that people would not like this part of the series because it was too serious. But, in the end it was also accepted by the Newgrounds audience, receiving a large number of views.  Final step: \\"Imagine\\"  275px The final step of There She Is!! debuted on December 9, 2008 with the rest of the series at Joongang Cinema along with other various short flash animations. The website crashed after its release due to unexpected demand.Amalloc's blog Its soundtrack is the song \\"Imagine\\" by Brunch. The introduction features a rearrangement of the traditional English song Greensleeves called \\"Greensleeves to a Ground\\",Ending credits - YouTube Link due to its reference to the colour green and the relevance of the lyrics. The end credits feature an arrangement of the music from the original \\"There She Is!!\\" In this step, Doki ties a green ribbon around a tree branch and leaves for \\"Paradise\\". Nabi, after his release from custody, sits down on a bench next to the vending machines where he first met Doki (which are now heavily vandalized). Next to him, a small yellow bird abandoned by its owner wanders off. Nabi saves the bird from a car and they arrive at the tree where Doki tied her ribbon. As the wind blows, Nabi sees dozens of green ribbons tied to the branches, representing the hope and wishes of the people wishing for change. (In Asia, tying a ribbon to a tree and making a wish is how you pray to the gods.) Realizing that he isn't alone in his belief that cat/rabbit love should be accepted, Nabi begins to pursue Doki, his scarf regaining its green colour. As Nabi is running to the airport, he comes upon another faceoff between the pro- and anti-intermarriage groups. The pro-intermarriage leader sees him and, believing Nabi to be charging the anti-intermarriage group, leads his group into an attack. Nabi is thrown into another riot when the anti-intermarriage group charges. The Grey Rabbit finds Nabi and tries to grab him, but is unsuccessful; this is when Doki's animals charge in, scaring the crowd and promptly ending the riot. Nabi is shown running through the gap, and as he clears the riot, an anti-intermarriage protester is shown falling in love with a pro-marriage member after falling into her arms, depicting a moment of hope for the pro-intermarriage cause. Nabi meets the Jjintta Set on a bridge and Il-ho presents him Doki's second ticket to Paradise, implying that he wants Nabi to join her on the trip. Nabi promptly rips it in two, showing his resolve to stay and fight. Seeing Nabi's change of heart, the Jjintta Set escort him to the airport, with Nabi hitching a ride on Il-ho's motorcycle. Along the way, a traffic light begins to turn red. Realizing that this will delay Nabi, Yi-ho pulls ahead and deliberately crashes his motorcycle, forcing the oncoming traffic from both sides to stop. Yi-ho shows joy for what he did, but a police-cat on a police cycle passes him, pursuing the bikers. Il-ho notices the police-cat in the rearview mirror, as Sam-ho pulls up offering to beat up the cop with a baseball bat and a chain, much to the annoyance of Il-ho. As Il-ho and Nabi continue on, Hana and Grey Rabbit pull up beside them in Hana's convertible. After Nabi is lifted into the car by Grey Rabbit, Hana contacts her bodyguard Pizza, who is already at the airport. At the airport, Pizza protects Doki from demonstrators on both sides as Nabi arrives. Nabi is confronted by the anti-intermarriage symbol behind Doki, which flickers into a pro-intermarriage sign, representing the fighting protestors. Nabi ignores the signs and the demonstrators and embraces Doki out of love, destroying the arguments of both sides (symbolized by the holographic signs disintegrating). After their reunion, the couple dodge thrown debris with dance-like motions reminiscent of Doki's daydreams in the first animation. As the couple leaves the airport, hope is given for cat/rabbit relationships: Hana smiles at Grey Rabbit's offer of flowers, while a blushing (and injured) Yi-ho is supported by Lip-cat, the feline keyboardist (and Pizza uses a demonstrator's head to wipe egg off of his hand). As the song draws to a close, Nabi and Doki clean graffiti off the vending machines where they first met, ending with a toast between them. Nearby, the tree that had once been covered in green ribbons now has green leaves budding, signifying that the people's dreams are starting to become a reality. Another Step On January 12, 2016, after HD versions of the original five episodes had been uploaded to YouTube, SamBakZa had launched an Indiegogo Campaign (since funded) in order to help fund a new episode of There She Is. The new Episode will primarily feature the Jjintta-set, the three scruffy bunnies, and will explore their origins and why they ultimately decided to help Doki and Nabi find their love. The final step officially aired on August 18th 2020 on Newgrounds for three days for a fee. It is scheduled for a later release on DVD. Amalloc has said that some of the scenes of the film will be released on YouTube in 2021. Merchandising Several requests have been made for various There she is!! merchandising, such as T-shirts and DVDs.SamBakZa forum, 2008 (postings expired) SamBakZa have not made anything available, although they have indicated that a DVD is forthcoming. amalloc announced on April 4, 2012 that a There She Is!!

The song has since been recorded by many artists, including Elvis Presley. \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" is the official bluegrass song of Kentucky. In 2002, Monroe's version was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. In 2003, CMT ranked \\"Blue Moon\\" number 11 in its list of 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music. Bill Monroe version Monroe‚Äôs earliest-known performance of \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" was on the Grand Ole Opry broadcast of August 25, 1945. He first recorded it for Columbia Records on September 16, 1946 at The Wrigley Building in Chicago, Illinois. That recording was released in early 1947.Sleevenotes to Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys, All the Classic Releases, 1937‚Äì1949, CD box set by JSP (2003). At the time, the Bluegrass Boys included vocalist and guitarist Lester Flatt and banjoist Earl Scruggs, who later formed their own bluegrass band, the Foggy Mountain Boys. Both Flatt and Scruggs performed on the recording, although Bill Monroe supplied the vocals on this song. The song, described as a \\"bluegrass waltz\\", had become a United States wide hit by 1947 and also became enormously popular with other bluegrass, country, and early rockabilly acts. The song was revered at the Grand Ole Opry and others; Carl Perkins played an uptempo version of this song in his early live performances. Elvis Presley version The search for another song to release along with \\"That's All Right\\"Official legal title of Crudup's (and Elvis's) 'That's All Right' at Sun Records in July 1954 led to \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" via Bill Black. According to Scotty Moore: Presley, Moore, and Black, with the encouragement of Sam Phillips, transformed Monroe's slow waltz, in time, into an upbeat, blues-flavored tune in time. After an early rendition of the song, Sun Records owner Sam Phillips exclaimed, \\"BOY, that's fine, that's fine. That's a POP song now!.\\"Burke, Griffin, p. 41 As with all of the Presley records issued by Sun, the artists were listed and stylized as \\"ELVIS PRESLEY SCOTTY and BILL\\". The same night that Dewey Phillips first played the flip side of this first release of Presley's music on WHBQ, \\"That's All Right\\", Sleepy Eye John at WHHM loosed \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\". Bob Neal of WMPS played the record, too. The pop jockeys, entranced by something new, began slipping \\"That's All Right\\" and \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" in among the easy-listening pop of Teresa Brewer, Nat Cole, Tony Bennett, and others. Archived at http://www.scottymoore.net/ With Presley's version of Monroe's song consistently rated higher, both sides began to chart across the Southern United States. Billboard has the song listed only in Memphis, and as number six with \\"That's All Right\\" at number 7 on October 9 in the C&W; Territorial Best Sellers. By October 23, \\"Blue Moon\\" was in the top 10 in Memphis, Nashville, and New Orleans, with \\"That's All Right\\" absent from the listings. Fellow Sun Records artist Charlie Feathers has often claimed that he came up with the arrangement of the song used by Presley. While others sources claimed that it was Presley who arranged the song. Monroe, at first, did not care for Presley's version until Monroe received a 15,000 USD royalty check after Presley's success with the song. The song was later used in a scene of the 2005 TV miniseries Elvis. =Personnel= * Elvis Presley ‚Äì lead vocals, acoustic rhythm guitar * Scotty Moore ‚Äì electric lead guitar * Bill Black ‚Äì double bass Other recordings In 1954, the Stanley Brothers recorded a version of the song using Presley's arrangement with bluegrass instrumentation, neatly bridging the stylistic gap between Monroe and Presley's approaches. Bill Monroe subsequently re-recorded and performed the song using a mixture of the two styles, starting the song in its original time arrangement, then launching into an uptempo rendition. Patsy Cline recorded \\"Blue Moon\\" in 1963. Cline's vocals were overdubbed over a different arrangement for the soundtrack to Cline's bio movie Sweet Dreams. In 1968, Al Kooper recorded a version for his debut solo album I Stand Alone.http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-stand-alone-mw0000459426 In 1969, Jerry Reed recorded a version for his album Jerry Reed Explores Guitar Country. In 1991, Paul McCartney recorded a version for Unplugged (The Official Bootleg) which was a combination of both the Bill Monroe and Elvis Presley versions. In 2000, John Fogerty recorded a version for a Ricky Skaggs tribute album to Bill Monroe titled Big Mon: The songs of Bill Monroe. In 2003, the Psychobilly/Rockabilly band \\"Zombie Ghost Train‚Äù covered the song on their album Monster Formal Wear Carl Perkins was inspired by the song to move to Memphis, Tennessee where he enjoyed a more fruitful career.

The name was chosen because the founders had their home residences in the Kingdom of Hanover. As a corps it is a founder member (1848) of the K√∂sener Senioren-Convents-Verband (KSCV), the oldest governing body of such student associations in both Germany and Austria. Hannovera commits itself still to the principles of academic fencing as well as the common principles of tolerance and democracy shared by all Corps of the KSCV. Its members wear red and blue couleur (red cap and tricoloured sash) on official occasions. Hannovera's Latin motto is Nunquam retrorsum, fortes adiuvat fortuna! (engl: Never backward, fortune favours the bold). Corps Hannovera officially regards the 18th of January 1809 as its founding date though it can be proved that there were similar gatherings of Hanoverian students in G√∂ttingen as far back as 1735. Corps Hannovera is also a founding member and stringent follower of the blaues Prinzip or blue principle (along with fellow cartel Corps and ). The blue principle is a social principle which consists of the promotion of gentlemanly conduct and social behaviour in general. Flowing from these ideals Corps Hannovera host several social events in their club house (Corpshaus) which are generally regarded as some of the most coveted and exclusive social occasions in G√∂ttingen. The most famous member of Hannovera was Otto von Bismarck, who probably had the \\"wildest\\" time of his life in the course of his studies at G√∂ttingen, where, owing to his excessive boisterousness, he was forced to live outside the town walls and was once placed under arrest for a period of ten days in the university jail (in German: Karzer). Other famous members of Corps Hanovera G√∂ttingen were general Friedrich Balduin von Gagern, the leader of the liberal opposition in the Reichstag, Rudolf von Bennigsen, economist Wilhelm Roscher, poet Ernst Schulze, botanist Heinrich Wendland, surgeon Louis Stromeyer, geologist Otto Volger, fisheries expert Walther Herwig, the Imperial German ambassador to China and Japan Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein and Wolfgang Kapp. The Corps has some members from the United Kingdom and the United States. One of them was the later physician Mitchell Campbell King from South Carolina, who belonged to the circle of Bismarck's American friends in G√∂ttingen. During his stay at Gottingen in 1856 John Pierpont Morgan joined the Corps, but was \\"not a full fledged member\\" since he wanted to avoid a smite.Edwin Palmer Hoyt: The House of Morgan (1966), p. 84-85 Others have worked in the US and Canada like surgeon Hinrich Bitter-Suermann.

This includes control of the project's schedule, languages, algorithms, tools, frameworks and coding style. A cowboy coder can be a lone developer or part of a group of developers working with minimal process or discipline. Usually it occurs when there is little participation by business users, or fanned by management that controls only non-development aspects of the project, such as the broad targets, timelines, scope, and visuals (the \\"what\\", but not the \\"how\\"). \\"Cowboy coding\\" commonly sees usage as a derogatory term when contrasted with more structured software development methodologies. Disadvantages  In cowboy coding, the lack of formal software project management methodologies may be indicative (though not necessarily) of a project's small size or experimental nature.Hughes, Bob and Cotterell, Mike (2006). Software Project Management, pp.283-289. McGraw Hill Education, Berkshire. Software projects with these attributes may exhibit: =Lack of release structure= Lack of estimation or implementation planning might cause a project to be delayed. Sudden deadlines or pushes to release software may encourage the use of \\"quick and dirty\\" techniques that will require further attention later. =Inexperienced developers= Cowboy coding can be common at the hobbyist or student level where developers might initially be unfamiliar with the technologies, such as testing, version control and/or build tools, usually more than just the basic coding a software project requires. This can result in underestimating time required for learning, causing delays in the development process. Inexperience might also lead to disregard of accepted standards, making the project source difficult to read or causing conflicts between the semantics of the language constructs and the result of their output. =Uncertain design requirements= Custom software applications, even when using a proven development cycle, can experience problems with the client concerning requirements. Cowboy coding can accentuate this problem by not scaling the requirements to a reasonable timeline, and might result in unused or unusable components being created before the project is finished. Similarly, projects with less tangible clients (often experimental projects, see independent game development) could begin with code and never a formal analysis of the design requirements. Lack of design analysis could lead to incorrect or insufficient technology choices, possibly requiring the developer to port or rewrite their software in order for the project to be completed. =Incompleteness= Many software development models, such as Extreme Programming, use an incremental approach which stresses that the software must be releasable at the end of each iteration. Non-managed projects may have few unit tests or working iterations, leaving an incomplete project unusable. As such, agile methodologies have been compared to cowboy coding but agile has formal processes, procedures, measurement, project management and other oversight while cowboy coding has none of this. Advantages * Developers maintain a free-form working environment that may encourage experimentation, learning, and free distribution of results. * It allows developers to cross architectural and/or tiered boundaries to resolve design limitations and defects. * As discussing architectures, writing specifications and reviewing the code all take their time, a single developer (if sufficient) may produce a well working application faster by cowboy coding. Tasks like research or prototyping may not require the code quality more complex methods provide. * Since coding can be done during the developer's free time, a project could come to fruition which otherwise wouldn't have.K, Alex. \\"Google's '20 percent time' in action\\", Official Google Blog, May 18, 2006 See also * Hacker, a subculture that relies on the creativity of individual programmers * Code monkey, a pejorative term for programmers who are employed to write simple or repetitive code * Self-employment * Indie game development * References External links * Cowboy Coder definition at Ward's Wiki * Cowboy Coding definition at Ward's Wiki * Category:Software development philosophies Category:Computer programming folklore Category:Software engineering folklore ","title":"Cowboy coding"},{"id":"2088390","text":"√ì Conchobhair Sligigh (anglicised O'Conor Sligo), Gaelic-Irish family and Chief of the Name.

It was released in March 2000, and came in two varieties: Professional and Personal. R5 was the 4th major release of BeOS for a public audience, and the 6th since it left developer-only stages. It changed only slightly from the previous release, BeOS R4.5, and was even seeded to developers as \\"R4.6\\". Improved POSIX compliance, particularly in the area of networking, was provided. The OS in general was moved towards the new modular media kit over the former audio-only sound subsystem. For end-users, new logos and some new icons were the only major differences. R5 was the first release of BeOS for x86 to have a freely downloadable version which could be fully installed on a user's hard drive; previous versions had a free Live CD download, which could not be installed. R5 was also to be the last version to support the PowerPC architecture which BeOS had originated on, including the company's own BeBox hardware. According to Be's marketing, it was the first OS to ship with legal MP3 encoding and decoding support. Versions =Personal Edition= Personal Edition, a 48MB download, was the most commonly used version of R5. Stripped of developer tools (though these were later made available as a separate download), mp3 and Indeo encoders, and RealPlayer, it was installed into a 500MB \\"hardfile\\" through Windows or Linux, and could be booted either directly from Windows 9x or DOS, or using a boot floppy. Once booted, it could be installed to a real hard drive or partition, and the Be Bootloader could be installed to allow dual-booting. This bootloader uses only the MBR of the hard disk, and will continue to function even if the BeOS is uninstalled. =Professional Edition= Professional Edition was only available commercially, and for the first time in BeOS's history, could not be purchased from the company unless you were a developer. Instead, a number of regional resellers sold it - Gobe Software in the United States, Apacabar and Koch Media in Europe, and Hitachi in Asia. These resellers were responsible for all packaging of the OS, from localisation to CD labelling and packaging. As a result, some variations exist between packaged R5 Professional discs, with some being slipstream updated to the newest patches, and most notably, the inclusion of commercial printer drivers with Gobe releases, and French translations of the user documentation on Apacabar. The CD shipped with an ISO9660/HFS hybrid partition, containing documentation, GPL licensed source code, the Personal Edition installer (with the aim of you circulating the installer to friends), a copy of Partition Magic for Windows, and the Mac OS boot-loading code for the PowerPC version. Two separate BFS partitions existed, one for x86, one for PowerPC, and the x86 one is directly bootable from CD. In addition to all the features of Personal Edition, Professional Edition includes the full developers tools, including a rebranded CodeWarrior, RealPlayer G2, Fraunhofer MP3 encoders, and support for both encoding Indeo video, and playback/encoding of Indeo Real Time. Additional media on the CD varied by supplier, but always included some sample multimedia files, including two songs composed by Be staff (\\"5038\\" and \\"virtual (void)\\") as well as a video of Be staff pushing computer monitors off the roof of their building in Menlo Park. Updates Three updates for R5 were released during 2000. =R5.01= R5.01 was mainly a stability fix for R5 Professional, fixing some deadlocks in drivers and critical servers. However, additional POSIX support was again added for networking, although the update neglected to include the newer headers to use some of these functions - they were only available in an updated Developer Tools for Personal Edition download. =R5.02= R5.02 (marked as R5.01 on personal) contained all of R5.01's updates, as well as some enhanced drivers, and more stability fixes. =R5.03= R5.03 was solely a security fix, and fixed a remote-access bug in the system's ftpd. The update, however, made a change to the core C library to do this, and in doing so, updated the version of glibc it was based on, again providing slightly more POSIX compatibility. Succession Following the failure of BeIA, Be's Internet Appliance venture, the company ceased operations, and R5 was the last official release. A widely leaked version of BeOS that had been seeded to developers, codenamed Dano, carried many new features, and a build ID indicating it was BeOS R5.1.0. Another extremely widely leaked update is a new, fully POSIX compliant, kernel-land networking stack, known internally in Be as BONE. While officially alpha, this brings higher stability to R5, as well as opening up the application base available. The updater for BONE Alpha 7 increases the system version number to R5.04. ZETA was accepted by some BeOS users as a successor to R5, however legal issues surrounding how Magnussoft obtain Be Inc's source code later lead to the discontinuation of the product. However, at least during its protracted release candidate stage, it was dogged with problems that left some people using R5, and in some cases, looking to Haiku for the future of their OS. Haiku OS, now on its beta release, is now the last surviving successor to BeOS. Although deemed by the developers as beta software, the stability, compatibility with BeOS binaries and feature-completeness make Haiku OS a viable option today. Haiku has even improved on BeOS, and includes features never implemented into BeOS, including: wifi support; the layout kit; a unique package manager; and support for x64 processors and modern hardware.

As a result of the blacklist he wrote under a pseudonym through the 1960s. Manoff's experiences while blacklisted were among the inspirations for the 1976 film The Front. Career = Early writing = Manoff was born in New York City. He did not attend college and quit school at age fifteen. He began writing and won a contest in Story magazine. In the 1930s he assembled games and songs of the streets of the city for the Works Progress Administration's Writer's Project. His first novel, Telegram From Heaven, published by Dial Press in 1942, recounts the struggle of an unemployed stenographer from the viewpoint of the stenographer, A review of the book in The New York Times said that Manoff \\"has written a readable book, pulsing with life,\\" and that he \\"knows the life of the submerged poor and he has an intimate sympathy for them.\\" = Films and theater = Manoff's first screenplay was made into the 1944 film Man from Frisco. Three more of his screenplays were made into movies prior to his being blacklisted: My Buddy (1944), Casbah (1948, starring Peter Lorre and Yvonne De Carlo), and No Minor Vices (1948, starring Dana Andrews, Lilli Palmer, and Louis Jordan. His novella All You Need is One Good Break was published in Story and produced on Broadway in 1950, in a production starring John Berry. The reviews were described by featured player Lee Grant as \\"scathing.\\"Grant, Lee (2014). I Said Yes to Everything: A Memoir. Blue Rider Press. . The New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson called the play \\"a tabloid tale about a tenement wastrel\\" and said it was \\"maudlin when it was not commonplace.\\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle also panned the play, calling it a \\"tiresome, rather whiny business.\\" The review praised the performance of Lee Grant, who left the hit play Detective Story to join the cast. All You Need is One Good Break closed after four performances but was briefly revived later that year. = Blacklisting = In April 1951, director Edward Dmytryk testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) that Manoff and other film writers and directors were members of the Communist Party. Later that year he was again identified before HUAC as a Communist by screenwriter and admitted former Communist Leo Townsend. He was blacklisted. Grant, who became his wife, was also blacklisted after she gave an impassioned eulogy at the memorial service for the blacklisted actor J. Edward Bromberg, who appeared in All You Need is One Good Break. Her name later appeared in the publication Red Channels, and as a result, for the next ten years,\\"Lee Grant on life beyond the Hollywood blacklist\\", CBSnews.com, August 3, 2014. she too was blacklisted and her work in television and movies was limited.Turner Classic Movies \\"Evening With Lee Grant\\" (1of4), Detective Story, interview with Robert Osborne, 2014 In a 2014 interview, Grant said that she knew nothing about Communism and said \\"it was one of the big rifts between my husband and myself. He was a Communist. And I didn't have the base for that kind of philosophy. I just couldn't understand it.\\" = Later career = While they were blacklisted, Manoff and fellow writers Abraham Polonsky and Walter Bernstein formed what has been described as a \\"kind of collective to help each other survive by writing under the table\\" for television, mainly for the historical series You Are There. Manoff used the pseudonym \\"Joel Carpenter.\\" In addition to You Are There, he wrote episodes of Naked City, Route 66, and The Defenders. At the time of his death in 1965 he was adapting for film a Bernard Malamud story that was to star Harry Belafonte. Walter Grauman, who directed a Naked City episode written by Manoff, said years later that he was shocked to learn that his real name was not \\"Carpenter\\" and discovered it by accident. He called Manoff a \\"terrific writer.\\"  Legacy  Walter Bernstein described Manoff as \\"a talent that never really flourished.\\" A number of blacklisted writers produced scripts for the You Are There series, and author Erik Christiansen writes that \\"Arnold Manoff's story is the saddest of the You Are There team\\" and that he had difficulty getting off the blacklist. The informal collective of Manoff, Bernstein, and Polonsky was dramatized in the 1976 film The Front, which was written by Bernstein. In an early scene, the Michael Murphy character, modeled on Bernstein, introduces the Woody Allen character to two other blacklisted writers. Personal life In her 2014 memoir I Said Yes to Everything, Lee Grant wrote that Manoff was known as \\"the silver fox\\" when she first met him in 1950 during rehearsals for All You Need is One Good Break, because of his white hair that made him look older than his 36 years. He'd already been married three times and had a nine-year-old daughter with his second wife, Ruth. He was married at the time to Marjorie MacGregor, the mother of his two sons, Tom and Michael. Grant recounted that she and Manoff were \\"an item\\" during production of the play. Grant wrote that she was living at home before their marriage, and that her parents did not approve. She said that there was a \\"Pygmalion\\" aspect to their marriage, and that Manoff sought to instruct her on Soviet literature and politics. She wrote that Manoff had little interest in her upbringing and that she never met most members of his family, including his mother. Manoff and Grant had a daughter, Dinah Manoff, who became an actress. They were separated at the time of his death.  Death  Manoff died in 1965 of a heart ailment. He was survived by two daughters, two sons, two sisters, and his mother.

The powertrain delivers enough torque to the wheel to overcome stationary forces, resulting in the vehicle moving forwards or backwards. A two-wheel drive vehicle has two driven wheels, typically both at the front or back, while a four-wheel drive has four. A steering wheel is a wheel that turns to change the direction of a vehicle. A trailer wheel is one that is neither a drive wheel, nor a steer wheel. Front-wheel drive vehicles typically have the rear wheels as trailer wheels. Drive wheel configurations =Front-wheel drive= Front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicles' engines drive the front wheels. Using the front wheels for delivery of power as well as steering allows the driving force to act in the same direction as the wheel is pointing. This layout is commonly used in modern passenger cars. Opperman Motocart A rare example of front wheel drive was the Opperman Motocart. This slow-speed agricultural and light freight vehicle was a tricycle with the front wheel carrying a large tractor tyre. The wheel was powered by a small single cylinder Douglas engine carried on the front mono fork that formed the steering gear. See also Front-engine, front-wheel drive layout. =Rear-wheel drive= Rear-wheel drive (RWD) typically places the engine in the front of the vehicle, with a driveshaft running the length of the vehicle to the differential transmission. However, mid engine and rear engine layouts can also be used. It was a common layout used in automobiles throughout the 20th century. At this time, FWD designs were not practical due to complexity (in FWD, engine power and steering must both be combined in the front axle). =Two-wheel drive= For four-wheeled vehicles, two-wheel drive describes vehicles that transmit torque to at most two road wheels, referred to as either front- or rear-wheel drive. The term 4x2 is also used, to indicate four total road-wheels with two being driven. For vehicles that have partial four-wheel drive, the term two-wheel drive refers to the mode when four-wheel drive is deactivated and torque is applied to only two wheels. =All-wheel drive= =Four-wheel drive= This configuration allows all four road wheels to receive torque from the power plant simultaneously. It is often used in rally racing on mostly paved roads. Four-wheel drive is common in off-road vehicles because powering all four wheels provides better control on loose and slippery surfaces. Four-wheel drive manufacturers have different systems such as \\"High Range 4WD\\" and \\"Low Range 4WD\\". These systems may provide added features such as a varying of torque distribution between axles or varying gear ratios. Common terms for this configuration include four-wheel drive, 4WD, 4x4 (pronounced \\"four-by-four\\"), integral, and all-wheel drive (AWD).

It was ostensibly a CBC show set in the \\"Hundred Lakes\\" region of Ontario from the CBC affiliate station CBNR, celebrating its 25th year on air. It was in fact a satire of overly-earnest regional CBC radio programming, and featured the return of the character of Paul Moth (played by Mack Furlong), previously the hapless host of The Great Eastern radio comedy series. The back story for the show was that long-time host Frank \\"Sunny\\" Day had gone into hiding when a circulated CBC publicity photo of him caused the law to indict him for a Ponzi scheme involving cheese futures. Paul Moth was quickly found as his replacement, and he went around insulting interviewees, inadvertently mocking local festivities and spouting bucolic observation of the rural life that came out more crazed and manic than intentioned by the obliviously self-unaware host. This show was written by Mack Furlong, Steve Palmer, Ed Riche and Glen Tilley (all previously writers for The Great Eastern), and ran for one 10-week season.

Its goal is to create a truly level playing field in today's international business environment. The Convention requires adherents to criminalise acts of offering or giving bribe, but not of soliciting or receiving bribes. A 2017 study found that multinational corporations that were subject to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention were less likely to engage in bribery than corporations that were based in non-member states. History In 1989, the OECD established an ad hoc working group for comparative review of national legislations regarding the bribery of foreign public officials. In 1994, the OECD Ministerial Council adopted the recommendation of the \\"Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions\\"; The convention was signed on 17 December 1997 and came into force on 15 February 1999. A revised recommendation was adopted in 2009. Principles Countries that have signed the convention are required to put in place legislation that criminalises the act of bribing a foreign public official. The OECD has no authority to implement the convention, but instead monitors implementation by participating countries via its Working Group on Bribery. Countries are responsible for implementing laws and regulations that conform to the convention and therefore provide for enforcement. The OECD performs its monitoring function in a four-phased examination process, with Phase 4 launched on 16 March 2016. Phase I consists of a review of legislation implementing the conventions in the member country with the goal of evaluating the adequacy of the laws. Phase 2 assesses the effectiveness with which the legislation is applied. Phase 3 assesses how well adherents are enforcing the Convention, the 2009 Recommendation, and any follow-up recommendations from Phase 2. Phase 4 is intended to be a tailored review specific to the needs of the adherent country. The Working Group on Bribery prepares a public report at the end of each phase. These reports are adopted under the principle of \\"consensus minus one,\\" meaning that the country under examination cannot block publication of the report. Members The Convention is open to accession by any country which is a member of the OECD or has become a full participant in the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions. As of 2017, 43 countries have ratified or acceded to the convention:Ratification status. {          *     * *     * } Costa Rica, Colombia and Latvia are the most recent states to have ratified the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, having done so on July 23, 2017, January 19, 2013 and May 30, 2014, respectively. Other countries that have participated as observers in the Working Group include China, Peru, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

The name \\"Arnold Palmer\\" refers to the professional American golfer Arnold Palmer, who was known to often request and drink this beverage combination; some attribute the invention of the beverage to the golfer. An alcoholic version of the beverage (generally made with vodka) is often referred to as a John Daly. However, MillerCoors began marketing and distributing a commercially available malt-based version of the beverage under the Arnold Palmer Spiked name in early 2018. History In 2012, an ESPN 30 for 30 Shorts documentary was produced on the drink, featuring Palmer, beverage experts, a group of PGA golfers and comedian Will Arnett discussing the drink's history and popularity. In the film, Palmer attributes the spreading of the drink's name to an incident in which a woman copied his ordering the drink at lunch after a long day of designing a golf course in Palm Springs, California during the late 1960s, saying \\"I'll have that Arnold Palmer drink, too.\\" Palmer preferred three parts unsweetened tea, to one part lemonade, but when mixed equal parts tea and lemonade, the drink is sometimes called a Half & Half. According to a waitress at Augusta National Golf Club, Palmer ordered his namesake beverage by saying, \\"I'll have a Mr. Palmer.\\" When Palmer visited the Latrobe Country Club in his hometown, the staff at the snack shack served the beverage to him or his wife, Kit, without prompting. \\"Mr. Palmer should never have to order the drink named after him.\\"  Mass-produced versions  The drink has been sold under the Arnold Palmer trademark via a licensing arrangement with Innovative Flavors since 2001. Arizona Beverage Company began marketing and selling the beverage with Palmer's picture and signature on the bottle in 2002 and has handled distribution ever since. The line has expanded to include various flavors including Green Tea, Southern Style Sweet Tea and Pink Lemonade, Zero Calorie, Strawberry, Peach, Mango and Natural Energy. Lemonade combined with iced tea is also sold without the Arnold Palmer trademark by other companies, such as Nestea, Lipton Brisk, Honest Tea (as Half and Half), Nantucket Nectars (as Half and Half), Country Time, Sweet Leaf, XINGtea, Snapple, and Peace Iced Tea (as Caddyshack). It has 43 mg of caffeine per 23 oz drink.

A typical JAMMA PCB supports only 1 joystick and 3 buttons each for 2 players. JAMMA boards that require this extra harness are referred to as JAMMA+ or JAMMA Plus boards. The kick harness is named for its most ubiquitous use in arcades: the additional kick buttons in the game Street Fighter II. Many games, especially fighting games, have adopted similar button layouts. Harnesses for games that do not employ kick buttons, such as trackball and driving games, are still commonly referred to as kick harnesses. The harness connects directly to the PCB, having its own ground loop and power connection. In the case of Capcom's CPS-2 system board, the kick harness is a 34-pin connector that plugs into the side of the 'A' Board. Unlike JAMMA inputs, kick harnesses have not been standardized. Even PCBs requiring functionally identical inputs may require different wiring. For example, Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II have the same control panel layout, and are both produced by Capcom, but they have different pinouts due to the configuration of their respective CPS-1 and CPS-2 system boards.

He was appointed Argentina's Minister of Health in January 2002, days after the congressional appointment of interim President Eduardo Duhalde, and ratified in his post by President N√©stor Kirchner upon taking office in May 2003. =Minister of Health= Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a became the focus of a controversy in February 2005, when he was verbally attacked by the head military chaplain, Bishop Antonio Baseotto, because of the minister's public support of the legalization of abortion in Argentina (where interrupting a pregnancy is a serious crime except when the mother's life is in grave danger, or in cases of rape of a mentally impaired woman), as well as his endorsement of sex education and his implementation of a program of free contraception and condom distribution programs.Clar√≠n (2/28/2005) The dispute underscored both the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, as well as the factious nature of local church-state relations themselves. Though Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a was not retained in his post by Kirchner's wife and successor, Cristina Kirchner, when she took office in December 2007, and was instead appointed Ambassador to Chile, he was influential in the appointment of a new health minister, Juan Luis Manzur, in July 2009.P√°gina/12 (6/30/2009) On December 12, 2019, two days after returning as Argentina's Minister of Health, Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a issued a protocol expanding hospital abortion access to pregnancies which resulted from rape.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/world/americas/argentina-abortion- rape-hospitals.html In addition, the protocol provides that girls as young as 13 years of age can have abortions in such cases without the consent of either of their parents. The protocol also weakens a doctor's ability to refuse to perform such abortions due to personal objection as well.

The palace is located on the shore of the Sea of Marmara, to the south of the Hippodrome and east of the Little Hagia Sophia. Names Hormisdas is an earlier name of the place. The name Bucoleon was probably attributed after the end of the 6th century under Justinian I, when the small harbour in front of the palace, which is now filled, was constructed. According to tradition, a statue featuring a bull and a lion stood there, giving the port its name (Œ≤Œø·ø¶œÇ and ŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ are Greek for \\"bull\\" and \\"lion\\" respectively). The palace is accordingly also called the \\"House of Hormisdas\\" and \\"House of Justinian\\". History Boukoleon palace was probably built during the reign of Theodosius II in the 5th century. Emperor Theophilos rebuilt and expanded the palace, adding a large fa√ßade on top of the seaward walls and in 969 Emperor Nikephoros II built a circuit wall. Boukoleon would remain the main palace for the Byzantine court until the 11th century with the construction of the Palace of Blachernae by the Komnenos dynasty. Boukoleon was still used for state meetings; 1161 with the sultan of Rum, Kilij Arslan II, and 1171 with the King of Jerusalem, Amalric, and served as a religious meeting place, when Emperor Manuel I Komnenos held a church council in 1166. Boukoleon housed the regalia of the Byzantine emperors, and the palace chapel included sacred relics. Access to the palace chapel was restricted, but despite this there are indications it was part of Christian pilgrimages. Fourth crusade In the 1204 sacking of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, Boukoleon was taken by Boniface of Montferrat who: > \\"rode all along the shore to the palace of Bucoleon, and when he arrived > there it surrendered, on condition that the lives of all therein should be > spared. At Bucoleon were found the larger number of the great ladies who had > fled to the castle, for there were found the sister of the King of France, > who had been empress, and the sister of the King of Hungary, who had also > been empress, and other ladies very many. Of the treasure that was found in > that palace I cannot well speak, for there was so much that it was beyond > end or counting.\\" (Villehardouin) Among the prizes, then, was Empress Margaret, daughter of Bela III of Hungary, whom Boniface married. During the subsequent Latin Empire (1204‚Äì1261), the Bucoleon continued to be used as an imperial residence. After the recapture of the city by Michael VIII Palaiologos, however, the palace, along with the entire Great Palace complex, was gradually abandoned in favour of the Blachernae Palace. When Mehmet II, the Ottoman emperor, entered the city in 1453, it was noted that the then-famous palace still stood, albeit in ruins. Upon his entrance to the palace, he allegedly uttered: Modern day The ruins of the palace were partially destroyed in 1873 to make way for the railway line to Sirkeci. The ruins suggest that a balcony looking out to the sea was present, accessible through three marble-framed doorways, still visible today. In 2018, it was announced by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality that the palace would be restored by the Cultural and Natural Heritage Conservation Board. It is planned that the palace will become an open-air museum with \\"a timber walking trail for visitors, a museum, and a pool.\\"  See also  * Great Palace of Constantinople * Palace of Blachernae * Palace of the Porphyrogenitus ** Porphyrogenitos References Sources   Further reading  * Cyril Mango.

The album was released in 1980 as a 10 inch EP on green vinyl. It was later re-released on black vinyl as a 12 inch with a grey and black sleeve. It includes the song \\"Don't Care\\", which had entered the UK Top 50 two years earlier. Background Copeland originally intended to record \\"Don't Care\\" with The Police but Sting had difficulties identifying with the lyrics and felt he couldn't do it justice. Sensing that the song had potential, Copeland went on to record it himself, playing all the instruments and singing. In order not to disrupt the career of The Police, which at the time was an emerging band, Copeland chose to record under the pseudonym \\"Klark Kent\\". Released as a single by A&M; in 1978, \\"Don't Care\\" reached number 48 in the UK Singles ChartKlark Kent UK Chart History, The Official Charts. When Klark Kent was subsequently invited to Top of the Pops to perform the song, Copeland, Sting, Andy Summers, Kim Turner, Florian Pilkington-Miksa and Miles Copeland showed up wearing masks to disguise their identity. Copeland's voice couldn't be heard through the mask, which was also deemed as particularly scary by the show's producers, so he eventually had to drop it in favour of heavy make-up and shades, making his real identity quite clear.Barry Miles and John Tobler, The Police: A Visual Documentary, Omnibus Press, London, 1984 The success of \\"Don't Care\\" prompted Copeland to record and release three other singles - \\"Too Kool to Kalypso\\", \\"Away from Home\\" and \\"Ritch in a Ditch\\". Promotional videos were shot for \\"Away from Home\\" and \\"Too Kool to Kalypso\\". Eventually the project solidified in an album comprising eight tracks. The \\"t\\" from \\"Ritch in a Ditch\\" was omitted from the album version. Like the first two of The Police's albums, Klark Kent was recorded on a minimal budget at Surrey Sound Studios with Nigel Gray engineering. Some of the music and themes in the album reflect Copeland's songwriting for The Police. They are normally in an upbeat tempo and address with sarcasm issues like suburban living and Third World politics. The song \\"Guerrilla\\" features some Arab words Copeland learned while growing up in Beirut. The main riff of the song \\"Excess\\" would be re-used later for the soundtrack of Rumble Fish. \\"Theme from Kinetic Ritual\\" would later be used by MTV as the opening theme of the show \\"The Cutting Edge\\". Copeland disseminated a few hints about his real identity in the design of the album. In the inner sleeve there is a collage of pictures where a photograph of The Police performing with Henry Padovani is visible. In all the pictures in the album Copeland can be seen wearing a black and yellow sweater with hooped stripes in reference to how Sting originally earned his nickname. The single \\"Don't Care\\" also includes the line \\"You know I'm fooling with my fake I.D./So you don't need to check my history\\". Klark Kent was released on CD in Japan in 1986, and re-issued in 1991 on the Pony Canyon imprint. For unknown reasons, these were released with the name \\"Klerk Kant\\". Rumours suggest that this was due to potential litigation with DC Comics, owners of the \\"Clark Kent\\" identity. All eight tracks on the EP were later collected in the 1995 album Kollected Works, with all of the Klark Kent single-only tracks. Reception When the \\"Klark Kent\\" album came out, The Police had just released Zenyatta Mondatta and were at the peak of their success, and as such it got a lot of media attention. It was widely assumed that this was Copeland working under a pseudonym. Copeland initially denied being Klark Kent, stating that Kent was just a friend and that he helped him making the album. In an interview on Australian TV in 1981 he stated that Kent was a young Hungarian ballet instructor trained by the CIA.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiMDzxtjOw Eventually he admitted his involvement. Reviewing the album for Smash Hits in 1980, Red Starr described the album as \\"unpretentious\\" and \\"light-hearted\\" and the songs as \\"energetic, utterly straightforward and reasonably tuneful, if a bit lacking in the lyrical department\\". He went on to say the musicianship was \\"excellent\\" and \\"relaxed and inventive\\".

Japan Kollected Works Kollected Works is a compilation of songs that Stewart Copeland wrote under the pseudonym Klark Kent released on CD in 1995. It includes all the songs from Klark Kent, four \\"Klark Kent\\" non-album single tracks (\\"Too Kool to Kalypso\\", \\"Office Girls\\", \\"Thrills\\" and \\"Office Talk\\"), a new version of \\"Love Lessons\\", a song originally recorded by Colts (Stewart Copeland and Derek Holt) in 1986, and two previously unreleased tracks - \\"Strange Things Happen\\" and \\"Stay Ready\\". \\"Strange Things Happen\\" had been recorded around the time of Copeland's journey to Africa prior to producing his LP and film The Rhythmatist (1985). It was left off the album and an alternative, slightly longer version was given to the soundtrack album of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 in 1986. Like the new version of \\"Love Lessons\\", \\"Stay Ready\\" uses a drum machine instead of drums. Both previously unreleased tracks were recorded at The Worried Rabbit Studio in Assyria. Copeland recorded another track under the pseudonym Klark Kent - \\"Yo Ho Ho\\". The song was released on the IRS compilation album Just in Time for Christmas in 1992 but is not included on the CD version. \\"Too Kool to Kalypso\\" would eventually find its way onto Copeland's album \\"The Stewart Copeland Anthology\\", marking the first release of a song originally recorded as Klark Kent under his real name. In the Police's 1993 box set Message in a Box: The Complete Recordings, Sting commented for the first time on his decision not to sing \\"Don't Care\\" and why he thought the song was a better fit for Copeland, stating that \\"Stewart is good at being arrogant in a funny way. As in the Klark Kent's line 'If you don't like my arrogance, you can suck my socks'\\".https://genius.com/Klark-kent-dont-care-lyrics In a retrospective review, Paul Collins of Allmusic panned the \\"Klark Kent\\" album, arguing that Copeland only recorded it for ego-driven reasons, and that his vocals make the songs unbearable. He concluded \\"the album only really succeeds when Copeland sticks to instrumentals\\". Despite this, Allmusic also made Kollected Works an album pick and published a review by Richard Foss declaring it to be \\"inventive new wave pop of the highest order\\" and \\"a record that combined the musical sensibilities of the Police and the lyrical concerns of Weird Al Yankovic\\". Foss applauded the album's humor and eccentricity, while contending that the tracks also have plenty of musical depth to make them hold up to repeated listens.

There were also two other directors, Jeremy Keith, who owned one-third of the club, and Steve Harding. Mackay soon became more formally involved by Sleightholme, and he was promoted to director of football. In early 2006, the club was facing a boardroom battle between Sleightholme and Keith. Following protests by the Rams Protest Group and RamsTrust, it didn't seem that Sleightholme and Keith would be chairman and chief executive respectively for much longer and, indeed, in April 2006, Sleightholme resigned, stating \\"My position has been made untenable. Recently it has come to my attention that meetings have been held, important decisions taken and documents signed without my knowledge. Important information has been withheld from me.\\" Keith himself departed later in the month, to be replaced by a new board led by Peter Gadsby. In March 2009, Sleightholme gave evidence in the court case against Jeremy Keith, Murdo Mackay, Derby County's former finance director Andrew MacKenzie, accountant Mark Waters and solicitor David Lowe who were all charged in relation to a fraud allegation centred on a loan from a Panama- based company that effectively saved Derby County after their relegation from the Premiership.

It dates back to 300 BCE and was the ancient capital of the Pundra Kingdom. right right Mahasthangarh ( M√¥hasthang√¥·πõ) is one of the earliest urban archaeological sites so far discovered in Bangladesh. The village Mahasthan in Shibganj thana of Bogra District contains the remains of an ancient city which was called Pundranagara or Paundravardhanapura in the territory of Pundravardhana.Brochure: Mahasthan ‚Äì the earliest city-site of Bangladesh, published by the Department of Archaeology, Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Government of the People‚Äôs Republic of Bangladesh, 2003 A limestone slab bearing six lines in Prakrit in Brahmi script recording a land grant, discovered in 1931, dates Mahasthangarh to at least the 3rd century BC.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 56‚Äì60. It was an important city under the Maurya Empire .The fortified area was in use until the 8th century AD. Etymology Mahasthan means a place that has excellent sanctity and garh means fort. Mahasthan was first mentioned in a Sanskrit text of the 13th century entitled Vallalcharita. It is also mentioned in an anonymous text Karatoya mahatmya, circumstantially placed in 12th‚Äì13th century. The same text also mentions two more names to mean the same place ‚Äì Pundrakshetra, land of the Pundras, and Pundranagara, city of the Pundras. In 1685, an administrative decree mentioned the place as Mastangarh, a mixture of Sanskrit and Persian meaning fortified place of an auspicious personage. Subsequent discoveries have confirmed that the earlier name was Pundranagara or Paundravardhanapura, and that the present name of Mahasthangarh is of later origin.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 16‚Äì19 Geography Mahasthangarh (Pundranagar), the ancient capital of Pundravardhana is located north of Bogra on the Bogra-Rangpur highway, with a feeder road (running along the eastern side of the ramparts of the citadel for 1.5 km) leading to Jahajghata and site museum.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 14‚Äì15. Buses are available for Bogra from Dhaka and take 4¬Ω hours for the journey via Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge across the Jamuna River. Buses are available from Bogra to Mahasthangarh. Rickshaws are available for local movement. Hired transport is available at Dhaka/ Bogra. Accommodation is available at Bogra.Mc Adam, Marika, Bangladesh, Lonely Planet When travelling in a hired car, one can return to Dhaka the same day, unless somebody has a plan to visit Somapura Mahavihara at Paharpur in the district of Naogaon and other places, or engage in a detailed study. It is believed that the location for the city in the area was decided upon because it is one of the highest areas in Bangladesh. The land in the region is almost above sea level, whereas Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is around above sea level. Another reason for choosing this place was the position and size of the Karatoya, which as recently as in the 13th century was three times wider than Ganges. Mahasthangarh stands on the red soil of the Barind Tract which is slightly elevated within the largely alluvium area. The elevation of 15 to 25 metres above the surrounding areas makes it a relatively flood free physiographic unit. Discovery Several personalities contributed to the discovery and identification of the ruins at Mahasthangarh. Francis Buchanan Hamilton was the first to locate and visit Mahasthangarh in 1808, C.J.O'Donnell, E.V.Westmacott, and Beveridge followed. Alexander Cunningham was the first to identify the place as the capital of Pundravardhana. He visited the site in 1879. Citadel The citadel (see map alongside), the fortified heart of the ancient city, is rectangular in plan, measuring roughly long from north to south, and from east to west, with high and wide ramparts in all its wings. Area of the citadel is approximately 185 ha. The Karatoya, once a mighty river but now a small stream, flows on its east. Till the 1920s, when excavations started, the inside of the citadel was higher than the surrounding areas by over 4 metres and was dotted with several straggling elevated pieces of land. The rampart looked like a jungle clad mud rampart with forced openings at several points. The rampart was higher than the surrounding area. At its south-east corner stood a mazhar (holy tomb). A later day mosque (built in 1718‚Äì19) was also there. At present there are several mounds and structural vestiges inside the fortifications. Of these a few of note are: Jiat Kunda (well which, according to legends, has life giving power), Mankalir Dhap (place consecrated to Mankali), Parasuramer Basgriha (palace of a king named Parasuram), Bairagir Bhita (palace of a female anchorite), Khodar Pathar Bhita (place of stone bestowed by God), and Munir Ghon (a bastion). There are some gateways at different points: Kata Duar (in the north), Dorab Shah Toran (in the east), Burir Fatak (in the south), and Tamra Dawaza (in the west) At the north-eastern corner there is a flight of steps (a later addition) that goes by the name of Jahajghata. A little beyond Jahajghata and on the banks of the Karatoya is Govinda Bhita (a temple dedicated to Govinda). In front of it is the site museum, displaying some of the representative findings. Beside it is a rest house. Suburb of the citadel Gokul Medh, Bogra Besides the fortified area, there are around a hundred mounds spread over an area with a radius of 9 km. (See map alongside). Excavated mounds: # Gobhindo Bhita, a temple close to the north-eastern corner of the citadel # Khulnar Dhap, a temple 1 km north of the citadel # Mangalkot, a temple 400m south of Khulnar Dhap # Godaibari Dhap, a temple 1 km south of Khulnar Dhap # Totaram Panditer Dhap, a monastery 4 km north-west of the citadel # Noropotir Dhap (Vashu Bihara), a group of monasteries 1 km north-west of Totaram Ponditer Dhap (said to be the place where Po-shi-po Bihara mentioned by Xuanzang (Hieun Tsang) was located) # Gokul Medh (Lokhindorer Bashor Ghor), a temple 3 km south of the citadel # Shkonder Dhap, a temple 2 km south-east of Gokul Medh Major unexcavated mounds: # Shiladebir Ghat # Chunoru Dighi Dhap # Kaibilki Dhap # Juraintala # Poroshuramer Shobhabati # Balai Dhap # Prochir Dhibi # Kanchir Hari Dhibi # Lohonar Dhap # Khujar Dhap # Doshatina Dhap # Dhoniker Dhap # Mondirir Dorgah # Bishmordana Dhibi # Malinar Dhap # Malpukuria Dhap # Jogir Dhap # Podmobhatir Dhap # Kanai Dhap # Dulu Mojhir Bhita # Podda Debhir Bhita # Rastala Dhap # Shoshitola Dhap # Dhonbandhor Dhap # Chader Dhap # Shindinath Dhap # Shalibahon Rajar Kacharibari Dhipi # Kacher Angina # Mongolnather Dhap # ChhoutoTengra/ Babur Dhap/ Kethar Dhap #entrance of mahasthangarhBoro Tengra/ Shonyashir Dhap Excavations Systematic archaeological excavation of Mahasthangarh was first started in 1928‚Äì29 under the guidance of K.N.Dikshit of the Archaeological Survey of India. The areas around Jahajghata, Munir Ghon and Bairagir Bhita were explored. Excavation was resumed in 1934‚Äì36 at Bairagir Bhita and Govinda Bhita. Excavation was carried out in 1960s around the Mazhar, Parasuramer Prasad, Mankalir Dhap, Jiat Kunda and in a part of the northern rampart. In the next phase excavation was carried out sporadically in parts of the east and north ramparts but the final report is yet to be published. In the period 1992‚Äì98 excavation was conducted in the area lying between Bairagir Bhita and the gateway exposed in 1991 as a Bangla-Franco joint venture, which is now in its second phase with excavation around the mazhar in the western side of the citadel.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 21‚Äì23. Movable antiquities The Mauryan period Mahasthan inscription in Brahmi, recording a land grant. Buddha Sculpture The excavations have led to the recovery of a large number of items, a few of which are listed here. Inscriptions: A 4.4 cm x 5.7 cm limestone slab bearing six lines in Prakrit in Brahmi script, discovered accidentally by a day labourer in 1931 was an important find. The text appears to be a royal order of Magadh, possibly during the rule of Asoka. It dates the antiquity of Mahasthangarh to 3rd century BC. An Arabic inscriptional slab of 1300‚Äì1301 discovered in 1911‚Äì12 mentions the erection of a tomb in honour of Numar Khan, who was a Meer-e- Bahar (lieutenant of the naval fleet). A Persian inscriptional slab of 1718‚Äì19 records the construction of a mosque during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 56‚Äì65. Coins: Silver punch marked coins are datable to a period between the 4th century BC and the 1st‚Äì2nd century AD. Some uninscribed copper cast coins have been found. Two Gupta period coins have been reported from a nearby village named Vamanpara. A number of coins belonging to the sultans of 14th‚Äì15th century and British East India Company have been found. Ceramics: Mostly represented by a vast number of shards. Sculpture: A 5th century Buddha stone sculpture recovered from Vasu Vihara, a Lokesvara stone sculpture showing blending of Visnu and Avalokitsvara, salvaged from neighbouring Namuja village, a number sandstone door-frames, pillars and lintels (datable to 5th‚Äì12th century), numerous Buddha bronze sculpture datable to 10th‚Äì11th century, a terracotta Surya discovered at Mankalir Bhita, and numerous other pieces. Terracotta Plaques: A number of terracotta plaques have been discovered. Many of these are on display in the site museum, which is open Sunday to Thursday summer:10 am to 6 pm, winter:9 am to 5 pm. Recess:1‚Äì2 pm, Friday recess is from 12.30 to 2.30, opens at 9 am in summer, other timings same. Summer timings 1 April to 30 September, winter timings 1 October to 30 March. Books on Mahasthangarh and other archaeological sites in Bangladesh (in Bengali and English) are available at the ticket counter for the site museum. Highlights of some excavated sites =Inside the citadel= Bairagir Bhita: Constructed/ reconstructed in four periods: 4th‚Äì5th century AD, 6th‚Äì7th century, 9th‚Äì10th century, and 11th century. Excavations have revealed impoverished base ruins resembling temples. Two sculptured sandstone pillars have been recovered.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, pp. 25‚Äì46. Khodarpathar Bhita: Some pieces of stone carved with transcendent Buddha along with devotees in anjali (kneeling with folded hands) recovered. Parasuramer Prasad: Contains remains of three occupation periods ‚Äì 8th century AD findings include stone Visnupatta of Pala period, 15th- 16th century findings include some glazed shreds of Muslim origin, and the third period has revealed two coins of the British East India Company issued in 1835 and 1853. Mankalir Dhap: terracotta plaques, bronze Ganesha, bronze Garuda etc. were discovered. Base ruins of a 15-domed mosque (15th‚Äì16th century) was revealed. Bangla-Franco joint venture: Excavations have revealed 18 archaeological layers, ranging from 5th century BC to 12th century AD, till virgin soil at a depth of around 17 m. =Outside the citadel= Govinda Bhita: Situated 185 m north-east of Jahajghata and opposite the site museum. Remains dated from 3rd century BC to 15th century AD. Base remains of two temples have been exposed. Totaram Panditer Dhap: Situated in the village Vihara, about 6 km north-west of the citadel. Structural remains of a damaged monastery have been exposed. Narapatir Dhap (Vasu Bihar) Narapatir Dhap: Situated in the village Basu Vihara, 1.5 km north-west of Totaram Panditer Dhap. Base remains of two monasteries and a temple have been exposed. Cunningham identified this place as the one visited by Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) in the 7th century AD. Gokul Medh: Also known as Behular Basar Ghar or Lakshindarer Medh, situated in the village Gokul, 3 km to the south of the citadel, off the Bogra-Rangpur road, connected by a narrow motorable road about 1 km. Excavations in 1934‚Äì36 revealed a terraced podium with 172 rectangular blind cells. It is dated 6th‚Äì7th century. Local mythology associates it with legendary Lakshmindara-Behula. The village Gokul also has several other mound Kansr Dhap has been excavated. Skandher Dhap: Situated in village Baghopara on the Bogra-Rangpur road, 3.5 km to the south of the citadel, a sandstone Kartika was found and structural vestiges of a damaged building were revealed. It is believed to be the remains of Skandha Mandira (temple consecrated to Kartika), mentioned in Karatoya mahatmya, as well as Kalhan's Rajatarangin, written in 1149‚Äì50. There also are references to Skandhnagara as a suburb of Pundranagara. Baghopara village has three other mounds. Khulnar Dhap: Situated in village Chenghispur, 700 m west of the north-west corner of the citadel has revealed remains of a temple. The mound is named after Khullana, wife of Chand Sadagar. From the present findings it can be deduced that there was a city called Pundravardhana at Mahasthangarh with a vast suburb around it, on all sides except the east, where the once mighty Karatoya used to flow. It is evident that the suburbs of Pundravardhana extended at least to Baghopara on the south-west, Gokul on the south, Vamanpara on the west, and Sekendrabad on the north.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, p. 67. However, the plan of the city and much of its history are still to be revealed.Hossain, Md. Mosharraf, p. 76. a distance view of mahasthangarh wall Bhimer Jangal This well-known embankment starts from the north-east corner of Bogra town and proceeds northwards for about 30 miles to a marshy place called Damukdaher bit, under police station Govindaganj (Rangpur District) and it is said, goes oil to Ghoraghat. It is made of the red earth of the locality and retains at places even now a height of 20 feet above the level of the country. There is a break ill it of over three miles from Daulatpur (north west of Mahasthan-garh) to Hazaradighi (south-west, of it). About a mile south of Hazradighi. the stream Subil approaches the jangal and runs alongside it down to Bogra town. Some people think that the Subil is a moat formed by digging the earth for the jangal but as there is no embankment on the northern reach of the Subil now called the Ato nala. which merges in the Kalidaha bil; north of Mahasthan-garh O'Donnell was probably right in saying that the Subil represents the western of the two branches into which the Karatoya divided above Mahasthan. On the Bogra-Hazradighi section of the jangal, there are two cross embankments running down to the Karatoya, about 2 miles and 4 miles respectively north of Bogra town and there is a diagonal embankment connecting these cross bonds and then running along the Karatoya until it meets the main embankment near Bogra. This jangal or embankment appears to have been of a military character, thrown up to protect the country on its east. The break roar Mahasthan may be due to the embankment having been washed away or to the existence of natural protection by the bit. The Bhima to whom the embankment is ascribed may be the Kaivarta chief of the eleventh century who according to the Ramcharitam ruled over Varendra in succession to his father Rudraka and uncle Divyoka, who had ousted king Mahipala II of the Pala, dynasty. Bhima in his turn was defeated in battle and billed by Ramapala. Mahipala's son. Jogir Bhaban South west of Bagtahali (beyond Chak Bariapara) and some 3 miles west of the khetlal road is a settlement of the Natha sect of Saiva sannyasis, known as Yogir-bhavan, forming the eastern section of Arora village. An account of this settlement is given by Beveridge, J.:1.S.T., 1878; p. 94\\\\. It occupies about so, bighas of land and forms the headquarters of the sect. of which there are branches at Yogigopha and Gorakh-kui, both in the Dinajpur District, the former in its south-west part some 5 miles west of Paharpur, J.A.S.B.1875, p. 189, and the latter in its north-west part some 4 miles west of Nekmardan. The shrines at Yogir-bhavan are situated in the south-west corner of an en¬¨closure or-math. One of them called Dharmma-dungi, bears a brick inscription, reading scrvva-siddha sana 1148 Sri Suphala ... (the year =1741 A.D.). 'In front of it is another shrine called \`Gadighar,' where a fire is kept burn at all hours. Outside the enclose are four temples, dedicated respectively to Kalabhai¬¨rava, Sarvamangala Durga and Gorakshanatha. The Kalabhairava temple contains a diva linga and bears a brick inscription reading Sri Ramasiddha sana 1173 sala (=1766 A.D.) ample Sri Jayanatha Nara- Narayana. The Sarva¬¨mangala temple contains three images of Hara-Gauri, one of Mahishamardini, a fragment of an Ashta-matrika slab, a fragment of a three- faced female figure probably Ushnishavijava (Sadhanamala; II. pl. XIV) and a four-armed female figure playing on a vina (evidently Sarasvati, but worshipped here as Sarva¬¨ mangala). Over the entrance is a brick inscription reading 1089 Meher Natha sadaka sri Abhirama Mehetara (the year =1681 A.D.). In the Durga temple is a stone image of Chamunda, and in the Gorakshanatha one, a Siva lihga. There are three brick built samadhis near the latter temple. Arora South-west of the Dadhisugar and standing on the Masandighi, in Arora village; is Salvan Rajar bari referred to under Baghahali. This Silvan may possibly be the same as king Salavahan, son of Sahila-deva of the Chamba inscription who won the title of Kari-ghata-varsha (= hunjara-ghata-varsha ?) (R. C. Majumdar, vange kambojadhikara,' vanga-rani, Chaitara, 1330.B.S.p. 251, ind. Ant, XVII.pp. 7‚Äì13). Beveridge refers to this mound in JA.S.B., 1878, p 95. This name of Sahila seems, to occur again in Sahiladitya lakshmam in v. 10 of the Silimpllr inscription (Ep. Ind, XIII, p. 291). If this identification is correct, then the word kaunjanraghatacarshcna in the Bangarh stone inscription (Gauda-raja-mala, p. 35) is really the title or virudha of the Gudapati of the Kumboja family and not the date of the inscription. Teghar North of Chandnia that the road skirts the bil and comes to Teghar village Which juts out into the bil 'Near about here are several mounds; such as Naras¬¨patir dhap. Kacher Angina (or glazed courtyard, a term applied to many ruins in these parts) etc. The biggest of these mounds, Mangal-nather dhap, (Fig. 6) is situated close to the point, from which a road branches off to Bihar. It is said that terracotta plaques as well as stone images were found at this site, but were all consigned to the neighbouring dighi. Rojakpur Proceeding westward along the road from Gokul to Haripur, we pass into the western arm of the latter village, already referred to. and meet the Bogra¬¨ Khetlal road near the Chandnia hat. West of Haripur and south of the Somrai bil is the village of Rojakpur, into which, as already stated, the elevated ground from Chandnia hat extends. On this ground are two mounds called respectively Chandbhita. (probably referring to the Manasa legend) and Dhanbhandar. A little further west is another mound called Singhinath Dhap. Mathura East of Bumanpara and extending up to the garh on the east and the Kalidaha bill on the north, is the village of Mathura, in Which there are several tank and on a ridge overlooking the Gilatala moat, two mounds called Parasuramer Sabhabati and Yogir Dhap. Threats to Mahasthangarh In a 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage, Global Heritage Fund identified Mahasthangarh as one of 12 worldwide sites most \\"On the Verge\\" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management (poor water drainage in particular) and looting as primary causes. Anecdote There is a local legend that Shah Sultan Balkhi Mahisawar arrived at Pundravardhana in the garb of a fakir (mystic holy pedlar of Islamic philosophy) riding a fish. (Mahisawar is Persian word meaning a 'person who rides a fish'). He came from Balkh in Afghanistan with a retinue. The period of his arrival is variably put at 5th century AD, 11th century AD and 17th century AD. At that time there was a king named Parasuram with his seat and palace in Mahasthangarh. Mahisawar requested Parasuram for a piece of land to spread his prayer mat on which he could pray. The request was granted but the prayer mat started expanding as soon as it was laid on the ground. When the prayer mat reached the area around the palace bewildered Parasuram declared war. In the beginning the battle seemed to be favouring Parasuram. A scavenger Harapala informed Mahisawar that it was difficult to defeat the royal troops because of the pool called Jiat Kunda. A dead soldier bathed in the waters of Jiat Kunda came back to life. On knowing this Mahisawar asked a kite to drop a piece of beef in Jiat Kunda. When this was done, the pool lost its powers. The royal troops were on the verge of defeat. The commander of the royal troops, Chilhan, with a large number of his followers, went over to Mahisawar. Thereafter Parasuram and many members of the royal family committed suicide. There are many variations of this anecdote, some of which are sold in Bengali booklets in and around Mahasthangarh/Pundravardhana. Some antiquity comparisons Mahasthangarh dates back to at least 3rd century BC and is acknowledged as the earliest city-site so far discovered in Bangladesh. Somapura Mahavihara at Paharpur in Naogaon District was once the biggest Buddhist monastery south of the Himalayas. It dates from the 8th century AD. Mainamati ruins in Comilla District date back to 6th‚Äì13th centuries AD. In neighbouring West Bengal, the ruins of Pandu Rajar Dhibi on the banks of the Ajay River in Bardhaman district date back to 2000 BC. However, this recent archaeological discovery has not yet been properly studied by outside experts and specialists in this field, and as such the historical value of many of the statements must be considered as uncertain.Majumdar, R.C., pp. 20‚Äì21 The ruins at Chandraketugarh in 24 Parganas South and Rajbadidanga in Murshidabad district date back to the early years of the Christian era.Majumdar, R.C., pp. 530, 540 Buddhist Viharas * Somapura Vihara * Halud Vihara * Vasu Vihara * Ananda Vihara * Sitakot Vihara Gallery Image:Mahasthangarh, Bogra, September 2016 09.jpgBoundary wall of Mahasthangarh Image:BD Mahasthangarh5.JPGOrnamental stone carving on display at Mahasthangarh Image:Mankalir Mound (17).jpgMankalir Mound Image:BD Mahasthangarh6.JPGGovinda Bhita just outside the Mahasthangarh citadel Image:Place of parshuram (42).jpgPlace of Parshuram Image:Mahasthangar Karotoa River Bogra Bangladesh.JPGKaratoya River by the Mahasthangarh citadel Image:Gokul Medh, Bogra, September 2016 28.jpgLakshindar Behular Basar Ghar at Gokul Image:Mahasthangar Gokul Medh Bogra Bangladesh.JPGGokul Medh Image:Gokul Medh, Bogra, September 2016 18.jpgGokul Medh Image:Mahasthangarh, Bogra.jpgMahasthangarh Image:Mahasthanghor bogra.jpgMahasthangarh Image:Govinda Bhita, Mahasthangarh, Bogra, September 2016 05.jpgGovinda Vita Image:Mahasthangar Govinda Bhita Bogra Bangladesh.JPGGovinda Vita Image:Govinda Bhita (6).jpgGovinda Vita Image:Mahasthangar Museum Bogra Bangladesh (3).JPGMahasthangarh Museum Image:Mahasthangar Museum Bogra Bangladesh (6).JPGMahasthangarh Museum Image:Mahasthangar Museum Bogra Bangladesh (7).JPGMahasthangarh Museum Image:Palace of Parshuram, Mahasthangarh, Bogra, September 2016 06.jpgPlace of Parshuram Image:Totaram Panditer Dhap (16).jpgBihar Dhap Image:Mahasthangar Museum Bogra Bangladesh (11).JPGMahasthangarh Museum Image:Shiva Lingam with Gauripatta at Mahasthangarh Museum.jpgMahasthangarh Museum File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (3).jpgmahasthangarh wall File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (33).jpgresort of mahashangarh File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (24).jpgwall of mahasthangarh File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (40).jpgmahasthangarh File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (32).jpgdistance view File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (39).jpgmahasthangarh File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (2).jpgMahasthangarh File:‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ó‡¶°‡¶º (7).jpgmahasthangarh wall See also * Kantajew Temple * Shahbaz Khan Mosque * Shona Mosque * Bagha Mosque * Khan Mohammad Mridha Mosque * Sixty Dome Mosque * Saat Masjid * Lalbagh Fort References External links * * Explore Mahasthangarh with Google Earth on Global Heritage Network See also * List of archaeological sites in Bangladesh Category:Indo-Aryan archaeological sites ","title":"Mahasthangarh"},{"id":"2088552","text":"FairVote (formerly the Center for Voting and Democracy) is a 501(c)(3) organization that advocates electoral reform in the United States. Founded in 1992 as Citizens for Proportional Representation to support the implementation of proportional representation in American elections, the organization in 1993 became the Center for Voting and Democracy and in 2004 changed its name to FairVote to reflect its support of such platforms as instant-runoff voting (IRV), for single-winner elections, a national popular vote for president, a right to vote amendment to the Constitution, and universal voter registration. FairVote releases regular publications on the state of the U.S. electoral system, including Dubious Democracy and Monopoly Politics. Notable members of FairVote's board of directors include its chair, former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic. The previous chair was former Congressman and 1980 independent presidential candidate John Anderson. About =Founding= FairVote was founded as Citizens for Proportional Representation in 1992 in Cincinnati, Ohio, by a diverse group of scholars, grassroots activists, civic leaders, and politicians. The result of a merger of several smaller groups promoting proportional representation reform into a single, nationalized advocacy group, it originally had co-founder Robert Richie as executive director, co-founder Matthew Cossolotto as president and third co-founder Steven Hill as western regional director based in Seattle and later San Francisco. John Anderson was head of its national advisory board and in 1992 published a New York Times commentary advocating IRV in presidential elections. The CPR ended its founding year operating in Alexandria, Virginia, with around 200 members. =History and timeline= Since its founding, FairVote has expanded its reach and expressed its platforms to both the public and all levels of government through campaigns, blogs, newsletters, lobbying, interviews, amicus curiae briefs, and numerous media outlets. Notable events include: *1992: Ted Berry, the first African-American mayor of Cincinnati, conducts a welcoming speech at the CPR opening convention. Berry was a firm supporter of proportional representation and fought in the 1980s and 1990s to reinstate the practice in Cincinnati after its repeal in 1957. *1993: Citizens for Proportional Representation changes its name to the Center for Voting and Democracy to reflect support of other reforms, such as IRV and universal voter registration. The Center for Voting and Democracy relocates to Washington, D.C. *1994: Robert Richie appears on national radio to explain a federal judge's ruling that cumulative voting be used to settle a voting rights case in Cane vs. Worcester County, M.D. The Center for Voting and Democracy releases the first Dubious Democracy, its biannual report on the state of democracy in congressional elections. *1996: Steven Hill runs the first campaign for electoral system reform in the US for several decades, a voter initiative to pass preference voting (proportional representation) in San Francisco. The campaign loses, 54-46%, but sets the stage for future victories. *1997: The Center releases Monopoly Politics, a report on the undemocratic elements of the single winner plurality system. The Center's news conference is filmed on C-SPAN, and Rob Richie's opinion appears in The New York Times. *1999: IRV for statewide elections passes in the New Mexico State Senate. *2002: Led by western regional director Steven Hill, San Francisco becomes the first major city to pass a voter initiative, 54-46%, to adopt IRV for certain citywide elections *2002: Steven Hill's book Fixing Elections: the Failure of American's Winner Take All Elections is published, making the case for electoral system reform in the United States. *2004: San Francisco becomes the first city since Ann Arbor, MI in 1975 to use IRV in public elections, after suing recalcitrant city officials to compel compliance with the law. *2005: Arkansas institutes IRV for overseas military voters *2006: South Carolina institutes IRV for military and overseas voters and Oakland and Minneapolis pass it for city elections *2007: Maryland becomes the first state to pass the National Popular Vote plan for president *2010: Oakland, Berkeley and San Leandro, CA all use IRV for the first time to elect local offices. *2012: Robert Richie writes for The Huffington Post supporting a national popular vote for president *2013: Robert Richie coauthors the fourth edition of Every Vote Equal, a book explaining and supporting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact *2014: New York lawmakers pass a national popular vote bill that will award the state's electoral votes to the candidate who receives the majority of the popular vote *2015: FairVote co-hosts with the Washington College of Law a \\"Democracy Slam\\" with NBC's Chuck Todd and other leading journalists and professors, with its key reforms receiving high ratings. *2016: Maine becomes the first state to adopt IRV statewide, with FairVote having a FairVote Maine arm involved in the campaign. FairVote is headquartered in Takoma Park, Maryland. =Mission= The stated mission of FairVote is \\"a nonpartisan champion of electoral reforms that give voters greater choice, a stronger voice, and a representative democracy that works for all Americans.\\" FairVote concentrates its efforts on electoral reform in the United States through research, education, outreach, and support of policies that foster equal representation and greater transparency within the electoral administration. The organization's projects fall into three broad categories: fair access to participation, fair elections, and fair representation. To that end, it sponsors programs like the Democracy Secretary of State (SoS) Project, which scrutinizes practices obstructing the voting process while proposing solutions to hold electoral officials accountable for their actions. The Promote Our Vote project focuses on local ideas to spur participation. Members of FairVote regularly write blogs, provide commentary in interviews, and offer internships for interested youth. Public perception =General coverage= FairVote has been covered by many major news outlets, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and NPR, which tend to call it a nonpartisan voting rights advocacy group. Other commonly used terms include: \\"voting rights organization,\\" \\"election reform advocacy group,\\" \\"national reform organization,\\" and \\"election participation and reform group.\\" The Denver Post referred to the group as \\"election- protection campaigners.\\" =Alleged liberal bias= In his New York Times profile of FairVote co-founder Steven Hill, Scott James called FairVote a \\"left-wing group\\". Other writers have claimed that many FairVote policies, such as IRV, are popular in \\"liberal enclaves\\" and supported by \\"populist groups\\" such as Common Cause, an advocacy organization,Common Cause and thus give the group a liberal tilt. Louis Jacobson, a writer for Roll Call, argues that any group supporting the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact will be perceived as liberal-leaning because of Democratic frustration with the Electoral College after the 2000 Presidential Election. But Rob Richie, FairVote's president, has said, \\"[FairVote] is definitely not a Democratic stalking horse.\\" In addition, FairVote points to John Anderson, who was president of the organization's first advisory board and a current member of the Board of Directors, who ran for President as an Independent in 1980. In fact, before Anderson ran for President, he was a Republican Congressman from Illinois. Proposed reforms Released in 2013, Reform 2020 is a set of four goals that the group hopes to reach by 2020: *Fair Representation Voting *Ranked Choice Voting *Constitutional Right to Vote *National Popular Vote =Electoral procedure= FairVote advocates the use of instant-runoff voting (IRV) in single-winner elections. Under this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference, in contrast to the more widely used plurality voting system. FairVote has spread the term \\"ranked-choice voting\\" (RCV) in the United States to describe single transferable vote and instant-runoff voting; the organization opposes Condorcet electoral systems, which are also ranked- choice voting systems. In 2002, FairVote backed a San Francisco ballot initiative amending Section 13.102 of the city charter to allow IRV in local elections. The city began using IRV to elect local officials on November 2, 2004. Subsequent ballot initiatives supported by FairVote have allowed the use of IRV in the following cities (listed with first year of use): *Takoma Park, Maryland (2007) *Minneapolis, Minnesota (2009) *Oakland, California, Berkeley and San Leandro (2010) *Portland, Maine (2010) *San Leandro, California (2010) *St. Paul, Minnesota (2011) *Springfield, Illinois (2011) *Telluride, Colorado (2011) *Memphis, Tennessee (not yet implemented) *Santa Fe, New Mexico (2018) FairVote supports modification of state laws governing the Electoral College so that the president is elected by national popular vote. FairVote advocates the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an agreement among states and the District of Columbia to award their electoral votes to the candidate with the highest popular vote total in all 50 states and DC. FairVote has played an active role in lobbying state officials to join the compact. New York Assemblyman Fred Thiele said he first proposed New York's entrance into the compact after being approached by FairVote. FairVote advocates the use of proportional representation (which they call \\"fair representation voting\\") in multi-seat assembly and council elections throughout the United States. In this system, each candidate or party controls a share of seats equal to its share of the vote. The organization has proposed combining several congressional districts into one to allow for proportional representation in the United States Congress, as well as in the California and Michigan state assemblies. They advocate for several PR systems, including STV (which they also call \\"Ranked Choice Voting\\"), cumulative voting, unordered open list (\\"Open Ticket Voting\\"), SNTV (\\"Single-Vote Method\\"), and MMP (\\"Districts Plus\\"). =Voting rights= FairVote has backed the proposed Right to Vote Amendment (House Joint Resolution 44), sponsored by Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), under which citizens would be guaranteed a constitutional right to vote. FairVote filed a policy brief in support of the legislation, stating, \\"We believe that the right to vote is a cornerstone of representative democracy that depends upon broadly defined voter eligibility, universal voter access to the polls, and election integrity.\\" FairVote has also advocated universal voter registration, a system in which all citizens of legal voting age would be registered to vote automatically. Research and reports =Election research= FairVote has conducted research on both presidential and Congressional elections. Most of its presidential election research focuses on the electoral college's effects on campaigning. In its 2012 Presidential Election analysis, FairVote documented the large disparity in both time and money spent in swing states (e.g., Florida) versus safe states (e.g., Maryland). In addition, FairVote has begun publishing data on how much time sitting presidents spend in swing states. FairVote releases two main documents of Congressional research every election cycle. The first is \\"Monopoly Politics\\", which contains predictions and analysis for each race. FairVote first categorizes each seat according to its competitiveness; seats are labeled Safe Democratic, Likely Democratic, Lean Democratic, Toss Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican, or Safe Republican. Relatedly, FairVote gives each district a partisanship ranking derived from previous elections. FairVote then predicts what percentage of the vote candidates will receive. Lastly, the research tries to predict incumbent winning percentages for the election cycle. For example, FairVote expects incumbents to do 4.5% better in 2014 than they did in 2012. The second major document is \\"Dubious Democracy\\", an assessment of Congressional elections' fairness. By aggregating Congressional race data since 1982, the research attempts to highlight several elements of Congressional elections ‚Äî the ratio of competitive to noncompetitive districts, the effects of gerrymandering, and voter turnout ‚Äî that FairVote believes hurt the democratic process. In the report, every Congressional race is placed on a scale of competitiveness, from Tight (<5% margin of victory) to No Contest (>40% margin of victory), and the percentage of races within each category is tracked over time. In addition, the research tracks voter turnout and wasted votes over time. Lastly, the report follows the success of incumbents in winning reelection over time. In addition to Monopoly Politics and Dubious Democracy, after the 2010 midterm elections FairVote released data on the effect of third-party and spoiler candidates. The report found that there were many districts in which the winning candidate did not receive a majority of the vote, a fact the group finds problematic. In addition, the research highlighted races in which Independents garnered a sizable percentage of the vote. Finally, FairVote created Representation 2020, a project that hopes to achieve parity in the numbers of men and women serving in elected office. The project has three main goals: institutionalizing changes in party rules to recruit and train more women to run for office, creating family- friendly legislative schedules, and replacing single-member districts with multi-member districts with proportional representation. Representation2020 has since become a separate nonprofit called RepresentWomen; it is still closely aligned with FairVote. =Voting rights= FairVote has created two projects that aim to expand and protect voting rights in the United States. The first, Promote Our Vote, tries to provide support and resources for groups focused on expanding voting rights. The group provides electoral research, legal analysis, and communications assistance. In addition, Promote Our Vote creates support for a constitutional right to vote amendment by building up support at the local level, focusing mainly on college campuses. The second project is Democracy SoS, which aims to familiarize voters with the important role of state-level Secretary of State officials. To that end, the project has issued reports on state election preparedness, interviewed state election officials, and published voter guides that focus on election reform policies. The project also hopes to popularize its candidate surveys, which include questions about election planning and election integrity. Involvement in court cases FairVote has participated in a number of recent court cases as amici curiae to advance fair representation voting, particularly under the California and federal Voting Rights Act. Notable recent cases in which they have been involved include: =Sanchez v. City of Modesto (2007)= Sanchez v. City of Modesto (2007) dealt with the constitutionality of the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA). After the California Superior Court of Stanislaus County declared the CVRA unconstitutional in favor of the City of Modesto, plaintiffs Enrique Sanchez, Emma Pinedo and Salvador Vera appealed to the Fifth Appellate District of the Court of Appeal of California. Along with Kathay Feng from the organization California Common Cause, FairVote submitted an amicus curiae brief in favor of the plaintiffs. FairVote argued that winner-take-all at-large voting systems caused \\"vote dilutions in jurisdictions affected by racially polarized voting, even where minority voters cannot form a majority in a single member district.\\" Supporting the CVRA, FairVote viewed the law requiring courts to \\"fashion effective remedies to cure vote dilution affecting smaller and dispersed minority populations.\\" Asserting that the CVRA allows California to become more representative of the people, FairVote concluded that the CVRA was an important and constitutional piece of government reform. The Court of Appeal applied rational basis review to CVRA and declared the law constitutional, reversing the lower court's decision. =United States v. Village of Port Chester (2008)= In December 2006, the United States Department of Justice alleged that Port Chester's at- large system of electing its board of trustees violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The US government claimed that the at-large electoral system denied the Hispanic population \\"an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\\" In United States v. Village of Port Chester (2008), US District Judge Stephen Robinson of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision that the Village's election system violated the Voting Rights Act and ordered remedial plans from all parties. The Defendants of the case, the Village of Port Chester, proposed cumulative voting as a remedy, which \\"allows citizens to cast multiple votes for a given candidate for a given seat.\\" In 2007, the Brennan Center, representing FairVote as amicus curiae, submitted a brief supporting cumulative voting as a remedy, but also proposing another system known as \\"choice voting\\", a process of ranking candidates. FairVote argued that \\"cumulative and choice voting avoid the necessity for deliberately drawing districts along racial lines\\" and that a winner-take-all system would not allow the Hispanic minority population to gain representation. FairVote also argued that cumulative voting is appropriate under the Voting Rights Act, as it \\"ensures the equal principle of \\"one-person, one vote\\"\\", is race-neutral, and that it is supported by case law and history. On November 6, 2009, the Court did not accept choice voting but accepted Port Chester's remedy of cumulative voting. On June 16, 2010, Port Chester elected its first Latino to the Board of Trustees. =Minnesota Voters Alliance v. City of Minneapolis (2009)= FairVote Minnesota is an independent ally of FairVote. FairVote Minnesota, siding with the City of Minneapolis, served as intervenor-respondent in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. City of Minneapolis, a case that was attested at the Minnesota Supreme Court. Minnesota Voters Alliance v. City of Minneapolis dealt with the constitutionality of IRV, which was adopted by the City of Minneapolis for its municipal elections. Minnesota Voters Alliance, a non-profit organization who served as the appellants, argued that the \\"method violates their right to vote, to associate for political purposes, and to equal protection under both the United States and the Minnesota Constitutions\\". Siding with the city, FairVote Minnesota stated that instant-runoff voting (IRV) is a form of RCV that allowed voters to rank multiple candidates on a single ballot. They argued that this form of voting had legitimate policy reasons such as simplifying the election process, saving money, increasing voter turn-out, ensuring more diverse representation, and promoting civil election campaigns. In their defense of the City of Minneapolis, FairVote argued that the appellants bore a \\"\\"heavy burden of persuasion\\" because they brought a facial challenge to the constitutionality of IRV\\" and that \\"Minneapolis IRV is constitutional because it is supported by legitimate interests, imposes no burden on the right to vote, and applies to all voters\\". The Court affirmed the lower district court's ruling that IRV did not infringe on the appellants' constitutional rights, thus rejecting the Minnesota Voters Alliance's challenge to IRV. After the result, Jeanne Massey, executive director of FairVote Minnesota, applauded the Minnesota Supreme Court decision and stated that the Court \\"blazed a path that every community in our state can follow toward better elections and a stronger democracy\\" and that the decision was \\"a resounding endorsement of ranked choice voting\\". =Jauregi v. City of Palmdale (2014)= Juan Jauregui, the plaintiff, filed a complaint in April 2012 alleging that Palmdale's at-large method of electing members to its City Council resulted in vote dilution for Latino and African American residents. The lawsuit claimed that Palmdale's at-large method denied minority residents effective political participation and thus violated the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA). The case was brought up to Judge Mooney of the Superior Court of the State of California in the County of Los Angeles. In July 2013, Judge Mooney declared that the CVRA vested the court in implementing appropriate remedies in favor of the plaintiffs. The City of Palmdale immediately appealed the decision, reasoning that in 2001 Palmdale residents voted for an at-large election system. The case reached the California Court of Appeal in the Second Appellate District. On January 2014, FairVote submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of the plaintiffs. FairVote argued that fair representation voting, unlike at-large systems, enhanced minority groups to elect at least one candidate of their choice. FairVote advocated for a number of alternative methods, such as ranked choice voting, single voting, and cumulative voting. However, the City of Palmdale opposed FairVote's participation, arguing that the amicus brief \\"threatens significant prejudice to the City\\" as it would continue to delay the certification of the City's November 2013 election. The California Court of Appeal has denied FairVote's application to file as amicus curiae.

Overview The various sagre almost always have their origins in old country fairs or similar entertainments, but many of them now aim at visitors or even foreign tourists, and some, like the Quintana of Foligno, had lapsed for many years but have been recently revived. A sagra is often dedicated to some specific local food, and the name of the sagra includes that food; for example: Festival delle Sagre astigiane, a Sagra della Rana (frog) at Casteldilago near Arrone, a Sagra della Cipolla (onion) at Cannara, a Sagra della Melanzana ripiena (stuffed eggplant) at Savona, a Sagra della Polenta at Perticara di Novafeltria, a Sagra del Lattarino at Bracciano, a Sagra del Frico at Carpacco-Dignano and so on. Among the most common sagre are those celebrating olive oil, wine, pasta and pastry of various kinds, chestnuts, and cheese.

His father, James Morisset, was a famous goldsmith of Huguenot descent. The name of James Morisset is inextricably associated with the finest examples of Applied Art in enamels and precious metals and stones to have been produced in England in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. James Morisset crafted presentation swords and snuff boxes, and many of his works remain today held by the Queen of England, in Museums or in private collections. ‚Äì 17 August 1852), penal administrator, was commandant of the second convict settlement at Norfolk Island, from 29 June 1829 to 1834.  Military career  Born in London in 1780, he was commissioned into the 80th Foot in 1798, saw service in Egypt and British India, and was badly wounded in 1811 in the Peninsular War, leaving his face badly disfigured. He was promoted Lieutenant in 1801. Transferring to the 48th Foot, in 1817 he arrived in New South Wales with his regiment. He was promoted Major in 1819. In December 1818 he was appointed as commandant and magistrate at Newcastle. His public works were admired by Governor Macquarie. His attention to prisoners, and attempt to adapt punishments to individual convicts was also praised by Commissioner Bigge. He was regarded as a stern disciplinarian, one historian claiming \\"the cat-o'-nine-tails and the triangle ‚Ä¶ were in daily and almost hourly service\\". In 1823 he was appointed commandant at Bathurst where he restored order after clashes with aborigines had led to martial law being declared in the district. He returned to England on leave in February 1825 where, at the age of 43, he married Emily Louisa Vaux. While in England Morisset reported on convict control in New South Wales and applied for the post of commandant of Norfolk Island which was about to be re-established as a penal settlement for the most hardened convicts. He was recommended for this position by Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and promoted lieutenant colonel, but Governor Ralph Darling appointed him instead as superintendent of police. The Governor was apparently reluctant to appoint Morisset to Norfolk Island because of the high salary he had been promised and because he insisted in taking his family. Morisset bitterly resented this (?) no proof of this statement, but in 1829 got his way and was appointed commandant of Norfolk Island. At the time the convict population was about 200 but rose to over 550 by 1831, and 700 the next year. During his tenure there the convicts made several attempts at mutiny, and he gained the reputation as a strict disciplinarian. Governor Darling regretted that \\"nothing but Severity has been attempted, to effect [the convicts] reformation'. Morisset recommended importing a treadmill, a common form (Producing food) of punishment at the time, but the British government objected on the grounds of expense. Darling was sympathetic to Morisset, calling him \\"a very Zealous Officer\\" whose duties were of \\"a most arduous nature\\". He observed that \\"the Conduct of the Prisoners has of late been outrageous in the extreme, having repeatedly avowed ‚Ä¶ to Murder every one employed at the Settlement, and it is only by the utmost vigilance that they have been prevented accomplishing their object.\\" The convicts, he noted \\"are Men of the most desperate Character\\". Morisset requested to be moved, but the government replied that he \\"should be reminded that it was at his own solicitations that he was appointed\\". The editor of a Sydney newspaper, E. S. Hall, wrote in 1832 that the convicts on Norfolk Island had been \\"made the prey of hunger and nakedness at the caprice of monsters in human form ‚Ä¶ and cut to pieces by the scourge ‚Ä¶ [and] have no redress or the least enquiry made into their suffering\\". An abortive mutiny in January 1834, which led to nine deaths and many wounded, resulted in a trial of the ringleaders being held on Norfolk Island instead of in Sydney. During his time at Norfolk Island Morisset was dogged by ill-health, perhaps a result of his old head wound, and in 1834, because of a violent nervous disorder was given a year's leave in Sydney, Foster Fyans being appointed to act in his place. When this leave expired Morisset resigned his post. Morisset retired to farming near Bathurst, where he was appointed police magistrate. He lost heavily in a bank crash and was forced to sell his property to pay his debts. Although in ill-health he continued as magistrate until his death on 17 August 1852, leaving his wife and ten children in poverty. Emily and the children were not in poverty due to her inheritance from her family and the Morisset family. Three of Morisset's sons continued his British military tradition by becoming officers in the paramilitary Native Police force which operated against Aboriginal groups resisting British colonisation in Australia. One of these sons, Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset was Commandant of this force in the early 1860s.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1943 to 1949. Elected as a candidate of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, he was twice expelled from that party during his tenure in the legislature. Richards's father, Beresford Walter Richards, was a member of the Canadian Authors' Association. The younger Richards came to Canada in 1921, and was educated in Athabaska, Alberta and at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Mining Engineering. Career He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held in The Pas on August 17, 1943, to replace former Premier John Bracken after the latter's move to federal politics. Although the CCF had never elected a candidate in The Pas, Richards won an overwhelming victory against three opponents. During this campaign, he ran on a platform advocating socialism as it had been introduced by the Labour government of New Zealand. The CCF was the dominant opposition party in Manitoba during this period, and Richards sat with his party on the opposition benches. Richards was a charismatic personality, known for a powerful debating style and flamboyant manner of dressing. He was soon appointed to the provincial CCF executive as the party's chief organizer, and built a powerful constituency base within the party. At one time, the CCF organization in The Pas was the largest in the province. Richards was a maverick on the left-wing of the CCF, and the similarity of his views with those of the communist Labor- Progressive Party made him many enemies in his own party. In a 1945 letter to the Manitoba CCF executive committee, Richards and fellow maverick Dwight Johnson called for cooperation with other left-wing and progressive parties against the Progressive Conservatives in the upcoming federal election. Their position was identical to that promoted by the Labour Progressive Party, and many in the CCF leadership believed that Richards and Johnson were directly influenced by the LPP. The CCF leadership, including Stanley Knowles and Donovan Swailes, forcefully opposed Richards and Johnson's position. The party was especially upset at Richards's decision to meet with the CCF executive in Portage la Prairie, to discuss the possibility of running a \\"united front\\" candidate of the left. Richards and Johnson were soon marginalized in the party. Stanley Knowles accused Richards of holding Communist sympathies at party gathering, and Richards was deliberately left uninformed of executive meetings. Denied the opportunity to promote his position in the CCF newspaper, Richards read a statement in the provincial legislature during the 1945 session, calling for cooperation with other progressive parties and advocating friendly relations with the Soviet Union. In making this statement, he also accused the CCF leadership of suppressing debate within party channels. Richards later claimed that the party leadership had been \\"embarking on a right wing course\\" by its actions during this period. Ironically, some CCF members interpreted the Richards-Johnson position as a shift away from socialism, in that the \\"broad left\\" coalition they were advocating included left-leaning members of the Liberal Party. Many party members supported Richards and Johnson in their battles against the CCF hierarchy, however, and Richards in particular remained very popular with his riding association. Suspension Richards and Johnson were both suspended from the CCF by the provincial council in 1945, by a vote of 33 to 5. Although the council could not expel members from the party, the two MLAs were immediately expelled from the CCF legislative caucus. In the 1945 federal election, Richards supported federal Cooperative Commonwealth Federation candidate Ronald Moore in the riding of Churchill, on the grounds that Moore was the candidate best positioned to defeat the Progressive Conservative candidate. Moore was, in fact, elected. A few months later, Richards ran for re-election in the 1945 provincial election as an \\"Independent CCF\\" candidate. He convinced the local CCF organization not to field a candidate against him, and was re-elected over Progressive Conservative candidate Robert Milton by 81 votes. Richards wrote a conciliatory appeal to the Manitoba CCF after the election, and asked for reinstatement. At the party's general convention in December 1945, he was re- admitted to the party by a delegated vote of 80 to 35. Stanley Knowles continued to oppose him, but was in Britain when the convention took place. Richards continued to support cooperation among left parties and to advocate friendly relations with the Soviet Union, but he avoided open criticism of the party leadership. In the legislature, he was known as the CCF's most skilled debater. Richards was nominated from the convention floor for the leadership of the Manitoba CCF in 1948, following the resignation of Seymour Farmer the previous year, but declined to run and Edwin Hansford was elected the new party leader without opposition. Even after his reinstatement, Richards's views continued to create tensions with others in the CCF. In 1948, he successfully passed a motion at the party's general convention calling for opposition to America's foreign policy in Europe. Similarly, in March 1949, he was the only other CCF caucus member who did not repudiate statements made by St. Clements MLA Wilbert Doneleyko, denouncing the Marshall Plan and plans for an Atlantic Treaty as a new American hegemony. Shortly thereafter, both Richards and Doneleyko signed a letter calling for the CCF to oppose the emerging North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. After this letter was circulated, Stanley Knowles and Donovan Swailes again accused Richards of adopting Communist tactics to disrupt the CCF. At the party's 1949 convention, Richards and Doneleyko were expelled from the party by a vote of 56 to 18. The next day, the party passed a resolution in support of NATO. Richards again ran as an \\"Independent CCF\\" candidate in the 1949 election, and was again endorsed by the local CCF association. However, at the behest of the provincial executive, a rival party organization was created in The Pas and an official CCF candidate nominated. Both candidates were resoundingly defeated by Liberal Francis Bud Jobin, who took nearly three times as many votes as Richards. Election loss The loss ended Richards's political career. He quietly rejoined the CCF in the 1950s, but never again sought provincial or federal office. Lloyd Stinson, who led the Manitoba CCF from 1952 to 1959, once wrote the following about Richards: Richards returned to his profession as a mining engineer after leaving politics. In 1986, W.O. Kupsch and S.D. Hanson published a work entitled, \\"Gold and Other Stories as told to Berry Richards : Prospecting and Mining in Northern Saskatchewan\\".

The Hamilton Watch Company had its genesis as an American watch design and manufacturing company, which incorporated in 1892 and produced its first watch in 1893. After its formation, the Hamilton Watch Company went on to manufacture and market pocket watches and wristwatches, ending American manufacture in 1969. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, the Hamilton Watch Company became a diversified conglomerate itself and was subsequently integrated into the Swatch Group. Today the brand is one of more than twenty watch brands belonging to the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch manufacturer and marketer. Hamilton pocket watch, ca. 1904 Hamilton 990 movement, ca. 1910. Hamilton Ventura, 1957  History: 1892‚Äì1969  Hamilton succeeded three watch firms manufacturing timepieces in the same facilities in Lancaster, PA, including the Lancaster Watch Company. The precursor to the Hamilton Watch Co., the Lancaster, Pennsylvania based Keystone Standard Watch Co., was started by Abram Bitner in 1886 with the purchase of Lancaster Watch Company's factory. Keystone manufactured watches featuring a patented \\"Dust Proof\\" design that used a small mica window to cover the only opening in the plate of the movement. Keystone existed until 1891 when the company was sold to Hamilton Watch Company. The Hamilton Watch Company was established in 1892 after Keystone Standard Watch Company was purchased from bankruptcy. During the same year, Aurora Watch Company of Illinois also merged into Keystone. The name of the new company was originally to be \\"Columbian,\\" but when it was discovered the Waterbury Watch Company had trademarked that name, a meeting of stock holders was called in November 1892 and a new name selected.Time for America, Don Sauers The company was named after James Hamilton, son of Andrew Hamilton, a Scottish born attorney who laid out and founded Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and was the original owner of the Lancaster site on which the factory was situated. During the expansion of the railroads in the U.S., Hamilton maintained over 56% of the market. Railroads purchased all of Hamilton's production. As the market switched from pocket watches to wrist watches after World War I, the company manufactured wrist watches. During World War II, Hamilton retooled its business model to serve the military, dropping its consumer products. The Hamilton Watch Company was housed on a complex in Lancaster. Hamilton took possession of Aurora Watch Company's machinery shortly after incorporation. The first watch made under the Hamilton name was an 18-size 17-jewel pocket watch in 1893. During Hamilton's first fifteen years, only two size movements were produced ‚Äî the 18-size and the smaller 16-size.A Little Hamilton History The company's first series of pocket watches, the Broadway Limited, was marketed as the \\"Watch of Railroad Accuracy,\\" and Hamilton became popular by making accurate railroad watches. Hamilton introduced its first wristwatch in 1917, designed to appeal to men entering World War I and containing the 0-sized 17-jewel 983 movement originally designed for women's pendent watches. In 1928 Hamilton purchased the Illinois Watch Company for in excess of $5 million from the heirs of John Whitfield Bunn and Jacob Bunn. Some of the most collectible early Hamilton wristwatches include The Oval, The Tonneau, The Rectangular, The Square Enamel, The Coronado, The Piping Rock, The Spur, The Glendale, The Pinehurst, The Langley, The Byrd, The Cambridge, the Barrel \\"B\\", and The Flintridge. Many models came in both solid gold and gold-filled cases and, though rare, some wristwatches such as the Grant were made of silver. Marine chronometers During World War II, production of consumer watches was stopped, with all watches manufactured being shipped to troops. More than one million watches were sent overseas. The company was extremely successful in producing marine chronometers and deck watches in large numbers to fill the needs of the United States Navy, and other Allied navies as well. The Model 21 Hamilton was built first and had a chain drive fusee, followed by the Model 22. The Model 22 had a traditional mainspring, available in a traditional double box and also in a deck watch. The Model 21 and 22 had a two-day power reserve and the movements of both were marked U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships. The model 22 was also used by the U.S. Army and on the back of some it is marked U.S. Army, but all the model 22 movements are marked U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships. The Model 23 was a 16 size chronograph pocket watch. The Model 4992b was in a 16 size case, with a black dial. It was used as the pocket watch for U.S. military, featuring a 21 jewel railroad grade movement. 1950s the last decade as a watch manufacturing powerhouse in America In 1951, Hamilton rebuffed a hostile takeover bid by the Benrus watch company. The fallout from the failed takeover action culminated in Hamilton Watch Co. vs Benrus Watch Co. (206 F.2d 738, 740 (2d Cir. 1953)), a Federal proceeding that is considered to be landmark case in the realm of Federal anti-trust case law. In 1955, Hamilton provided a \\"celestial time zone clock, permitting flight-type navigation\\" for the Astra-Gnome concept of what an automobile would look like in the year 2000. In 1957, Hamilton introduced the world's first electric watch, the Hamilton Electric 500. It was available in a variety of non- traditional asymmetrical case styles including the Ventura that was designed by Richard Arbib. The watch was worn by Elvis Presley, who also featured it the movie Blue Hawaii. In 1962, Hamilton entered into a joint venture (60% owned by Hamilton) with the Japanese watchmaking firm Ricoh to produce electric watches meant primarily for the Japanese market. The electronic components were produced at Hamilton's Lancaster factory while production of the mechanical works and final assembly were undertaken in Japan. Although production levels of Hamilton-Ricoh watches were high (over 1000 per month), demand was low and consequently, the Hamilton-Ricoh partnership was unable to compete with the substantial market presence of Seiko. The partnership was dissolved in 1965, with the remaining Hamilton-Ricoh electronic movements (marked \\"Ricoh 555E\\") re-cased as \\"Vantage\\" and sold in the U.S.  Swiss/U.S. operations: 1969‚Äì1974  Swiss Hamilton/Buren Micro-rotor movement In 1966, Hamilton acquired the Buren Watch Company of B√ºren an der Aare, Switzerland, including all factories and technologies that had been developed by Buren up to that point. From 1966 to 1969, Hamilton Lancaster and Buren Switzerland were operated as a joint concern, with Hamilton using a number of Swiss movements for their \\"American\\" watches and Buren utilizing a number of components manufactured by Hamilton Lancaster. It was during this time that Hamilton started to selectively incorporate the highly innovative Buren Micro- rotor (a.k.a. Micro Rotor/Micro-rotor) movement into small numbers of certain upper tier watches, in addition to their ordinary hand-wound and traditional automatic watches. The Buren (now Hamilton/Buren) Micro-rotor was the first patented automatic wristwatch movement to eliminate the sizable external oscillating weight inherent to most automatic winding watches. Instead, it utilized a much smaller weight that was entirely integrated into the chassis of the movement. This design allowed for a substantially slimmer automatic watch that still retained a center sweep second hand. The Micro-rotor concept was also conceived by Universal Gen√®ve for use in their Polerouter series of timepieces during this same time. The official title of \\"first Micro-rotor movement\\" is still in dispute among some horology aficionados, even though Buren patented their design in 1954, and Universal Geneve applied for their patent in May 1955. In 1969, the Hamilton Watch Company completely ended American manufacturing operations with the closure of its factory in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, shifting manufacturing operations to the Buren factory in Switzerland. From 1969 to 1972, all new Hamilton watches were produced in Switzerland by Hamilton's Buren subsidiary. In 1971, the Buren brand was returned to Swiss ownership and by 1972, the Buren-Hamilton partnership was dissolved and the factory liquidated, due to decreased interest and sales of the Hamilton-Buren product.An Artifact of Innovation: The Hamilton/Buren Intramatic On May 16, 1974, the Hamilton brand was sold to SSIH (subsequently The Swatch Group).  Transitional watches: 1970s‚Äìpresent  Hamilton Khaki Field Officer H70615133 In 1971, the Omega & Tissot Holding Company SSIH purchased the Hamilton brand and utilized the Hamilton name for a number of branding efforts, including numerous quartz watches in the 1980s. The Hamilton Watch Division became a subsidiary of HMW. The Hamilton Watch Company changed their name to HMW at the time they sold their Watch division to SSIH. A team led by John Bergey of Hamilton Watch in Lancaster, Pennsylvania developed the Pulsar, the world's first digital watch. Through the merger of SSIH and ASUAG Groups in 1984, Hamilton became a subsidiary of The Swatch Group.

Early life Born in 1941 and educated at Redruth Grammar School, both of Croucher's legs were severed below the knee by a train in 1960 after he collapsed in a drunken stupor and fell down an embankment onto a railway line in Wiltshire. He subsequently trained to be a teacher but was still determined to pursue his love of mountaineering in spite of his disability. He became the first person fitted with artificial limbs to walk the 900 miles from John O'Groats to Lands End in 1969 which he claimed also hardened his stumps for subsequent mountain climbing. Mountaineering Six months after the 900-mile walk to Lands End Croucher climbed the Jungfrau and the M√∂nch mountains in Switzerland and in 1972 he scaled the treacherous west flank of the Eiger. Two years later he also conquered the Matterhorn. He has climbed many other mountains, including peaks in the Himalayas and these are comprehensively listed on his official website. His artificial legs are made from aluminium, with a plastic \\"flexible foot\\" which enables him to wear mountain boots or fit crampons. Writing about him, Chris Bonington was quoted as stating \\"There is no one like him, his extraordinary achievements have earned him a place in climbing history.\\" In a December 1979 article in the South American Explorer, Crouch wrote about the thermal advantages of not having lower legs during high-altitude ascents: > Obviously, keeping your feet warm is a problem in high altitude climbing ‚Äî > but only if you have feet.

Dayton was reared Presbyterian, but was influenced by meeting J.R. Graves. He united with the Baptists in 1852. James Robinson Graves, Dayton, and James Madison Pendleton were known as \\"The Great Triumvirate\\" of the Landmark movement. From 1854 through 1858, Dayton was the corresponding secretary of the Southern Baptist Convention Bible Board. He moved with his family to Nashville, Tennessee to take the position. Both Graves and Dayton were members of the First Baptist Church of Nashville. Dayton made significant contributions to the Landmark movement of the mid-nineteenth century in the area of religious fiction, which \\"popularized Landmark tenets.\\" His most serious novel, Theodosia Ernest, or, The Heroine of Faith, was published in 1856-1857 in two volumes. The first volume presented issues related to baptism, and the second discussed church polity. Theodosia Ernest originally appeared as a series in The Tennessee Baptist in 1855. In 1857, R.B.C. Howell, a critic of Landmarkism, became pastor for a second tenure at First Baptist of Nashville, where he served until 1868. Howell had a struggle for control with Graves, described as the greatest controversy for the Southern Baptists until the \\"fundamentalist- moderate\\" controversy of the last decades of the twentieth century. It resulted in arguments over church discipline, and Graves' being excluded from the church and Dayton's being forced to resign from the Bible Board. In 1858, Dayton published Pedobaptist and Campbellite Immersions, a review of numerous Baptist writers on issues related to baptism. It is considered the classic Landmark statement on this topic. He also served as associate editor of The Tennessee Baptist for about 18 months in 1858-1859. J. R. Graves was the most prolific writer and outstanding leader of the Landmark movement. But, the 20th-century theologian J. E. Tull concluded that Dayton's 1858 book was \\"the most cogent attack upon 'alien immersions' which the Landmark movement produced.\\" J.E. Tull, A Study of Southern Baptist Landmarkism in the Light of Historical Baptist Ecclesiology, New York: Columbia University, 1960, p. 135 He published the Baptist Banner in Atlanta, Georgia (1863‚Äì1864). At the time, he was pastor of Houston Lake Baptist Church and First Baptist Church, and the president of Houston Female Institute, all in Perry, Georgia. Death Dayton died of tuberculosis at Perry, Georgia on June 11, 1865. He was buried in the Evergreen Cemetery.

Name history \\"Orioles\\" is a traditional name for baseball clubs in Baltimore, after the state bird of Maryland, with the colors of black and orange/gold/yellow. It was used by major league teams representing the city from 1882 through 1899 in the old American Association and the original National League two decades after its founding in 1876, and by a charter team franchise member of the new American League from 1901 through 1902. The original American League franchise was shifted to New York City in 1903 along with former player and owner/manager John McGraw, and eventually became known as the New York Yankees. First minor league team, 1903‚Äì1914 In 1903, an Oriole minor league team joined the Eastern League (renamed the International League in 1911, and not to be confused with the present day 'Double AA' level, minor league Eastern League). This Orioles team stayed mediocre for the first few years of its existence, but after the arrival of Jack Dunn (1872‚Äì1928), as manager, it won the Eastern League pennant in 1908. This E.L./I.L. Orioles team played at the old American League Park (a.k.a. Oriole Park) at the southwest corner of Greenmount Avenue and 29th Street in the Waverly neighborhood of northeast Baltimore. The 1914 season featured the professional debut of local son, George Herman Ruth (\\"Babe Ruth\\"), but competition from the Baltimore Terrapins of the new Federal League challenge for major league status, with their more modern steel-beamed ballpark across the street, forced Dunn to sell Ruth (to the Boston Red Sox) later in the 1914 season and many of his other players, and eventually temporarily relocate the team to Richmond, Virginia (eventually becoming the present-day Syracuse Mets, still playing in the I.L.). Second minor league team, 1916‚Äì1953 The 1920 Baltimore Orioles After the Federal League's demise, Dunn returned with an Orioles team in 1916. This team, later in the 1919 I.L. Baseball Season won the International League pennant with 100 victories, the first team to win that many games and went on a championship spree, seldom seen in major or minor league baseball ever since. Featuring another future Hall-of-Fame pitcher in Lefty Grove, the Orioles improved on that in 1920 by winning 110 games, including the last 25 of the season. In 1921, the Orioles won 27 straight games (a record for consecutive victories by a minor league team that would stand until the Salt Lake City team of the western Pioneer League won 29 in 1987). The Orioles won the League by 20 games over the second place team, and had a home record of 70 wins and 18 losses. Despite their impressive record, however, they lost the \\"Little World Series\\" to the American Association's champion Louisville Colonels, 4 games to 1. The Orioles actually led the fourth game, 12‚Äì4, but a riot broke out among the Louisville home crowd in the top of the 9th inning, and the game was forfeited to Baltimore, 9‚Äì0.Baltimore Sun, October 10, 1921, pg 1 The I.L. Orioles continued to roll over International League opposition for several more seasons straight through to the 1925 Baseball Season. The team entered the Governors' Cup playoffs in the International circuit in 1936, 1937, and 1940, but did not win another pennant until the \\"war year\\" of 1944. The team was leading the League on July 4 of that year, when their home wooden and steel beamed stadium, Oriole Park (formerly Terrapin Park of 1914), burned down. Even after relocating several blocks northwest to the old 1922 football bowl of Municipal Stadium on 33rd Street Boulevard (also known as \\"Baltimore Stadium\\"), the team seemed to have a hard time recovering from that loss, playing lackluster ball through the rest of the season and losing their last game, only to strangely \\"back into the championship\\" when the second place team, the Newark Bears, also lost their recent games. The Orioles, under manager Alphonse \\"Tommy\\" Thomas, went on to win the \\"Junior World Series\\" that year, four games to two, against Louisville. Six years later, with the shackles of war-time baseball cast off, in 1950, under manager Nick Cullop, Baltimore won the league championship again, only to lose the \\"Junior World Series\\" to the Columbus Red Birds of Ohio, four games to one. In 2001, the Orioles teams of 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924 were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. Back to the majors After the 1953 season, the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore and took the name of the Baltimore Orioles. The last minor league/International League Orioles team (of 1916‚Äì1953) re-located to Richmond (coincidentally just as had the earlier Orioles team in 1914), this time as the Richmond Virginians from 1954‚Äì64, later relocating as today's Toledo Mud Hens franchise in northwest Ohio since 1965. \\"Governors' Cup\\", International League titles The Orioles won the Governors' Cup, the championship of the IL, 2 times, and played in the championship games \\"Little World Series\\", 5 times. *1936 ‚Äì Lost to Buffalo *1937 ‚Äì Lost to Newark *1940 ‚Äì Lost to Newark *1944 ‚Äì Defeated Newark *1950 ‚Äì Defeated Rochester Notable players * Phil Weintraub - 1938; Major League Baseball first baseman and outfielder References Category:St. Louis Browns minor league affiliates Category:Cleveland Indians minor league affiliates Category:Baseball teams established in 1903 Category:Baseball teams disestablished in 1953 Category:Defunct International League teams Category:Sports teams in Baltimore Category:Philadelphia Phillies minor league affiliates Category:1903 establishments in Maryland Category:1953 disestablishments in Maryland Category:Defunct baseball teams in Maryland ","title":"Baltimore Orioles (minor league)"},{"id":"2088636","text":"Armadillidiidae is a family of woodlice, a terrestrial crustacean group in the order Isopoda. Unlike members of other woodlouse families, members of this family can roll into a ball, an ability they share with the outwardly similar but unrelated pill millipedes and other animals. This ability gives woodlice in this family their common names of pill bugs or roly polies. Other common names include slaters and doodle bugs. The best known species in the family is Armadillidium vulgare, the common pill bug. Pill bugs are not native to the Americas, but instead were introduced from Europe. Ecology and behaviour Pill bugs in the family Armadillidiidae are able to form their bodies into a ball shape, in a process known as conglobation. This behaviour is shared with pill millipedes (which are often confused with pill bugs), armadillos, and cuckoo wasps. It may be triggered by stimuli such as vibrations or pressure, and is a key defense against predation; it may also reduce respiratory water losses. The diet of pill bugs is largely made up of decaying or decomposed plant matter such as leaves, and to a lesser extent, wood fibers. Pill bugs will also eat living plants, especially in wet conditions, sometimes consuming leaves, stems, shoots, roots, tubers, and fruits. Pill bugs can be serious pests in certain agricultural systems, particularly in areas that are prone to heavy rains and flood conditions. Pill bugs will feed on numerous crop plants including corn, beans, squash, peas, melon, chard, beet, cucumber, potato, spinach, lettuce, and strawberry, with potential for significant yield loss in strawberry in particular. Some species of pill bugs are known to eat decaying animal flesh or feces. They will also eat shed snakeskin and dead bugs, if necessary. Pill bugs contribute to their ecosystem as decomposers. They are capable of taking in heavy metals such as copper, zinc, lead and cadmium and crystallize these into spherical deposits in the midgut. In this way, they temporarily remove many of the toxic metal ions from the soil although the toxic metals are returned to the soil when they die. They also provide a food source for birds, toads, spiders, wasps, and centipedes. Classification The family Armadillidiidae is differentiated from other woodlouse families by the two-segmented nature of the antennal flagellum, by the form of the uropods, and by the ability to roll into a ball. Within the family Armadillidiidae, 15 genera are currently recognized: *Alloschizidium *Armadillidium *Ballodillium *Cristarmadillidium *Cyphodillidium *Echinarmadillidium *Eleoniscus *Eluma *Paraschizidium *Paxodillidium *Platanosphaera *Schizidium *Trichodillidium *Troglarmadillidium *Typhlarmadillidium References External links * *Regional maps for the most common American names for this isopod can be found in the results for question 74 of the Harvard Dialect Survey Category:Woodlice ","title":"Armadillidiidae"},{"id":"2088644","text":"Birger Brosa's seal Birger Brosa Old Norse: Birgir Br√≥sa ( d. 9 January 1202) was jarl of Sweden 1174‚Äì1202.

Birger was appointed to the position of jarl during the reign of Knut Eriksson. He maintained the position during Knut's successor Sverker II until his death in 1202. Before 1170, Birger was married to Brigida Haraldsdotter, the daughter of Norwegian King Harald Gille. She had formerly been married to the Danish pretender Magnus Henriksson, who had briefly ruled in Uppsala 1160‚Äì1161.Brigida Haraldsdatter (Store norske leksikon) Birger appears to have maintained peace in Sweden during the civil wars that ravaged Denmark and Norway. Many of the pretenders in these kingdoms sought refuge with Birger. Among them were the Birkebeiner chieftains Eystein Meyla and Sverre Sigurdsson who were kinsmen of Brigida Haraldsdotter. Birger's son Philippus was in the service of King Sverre and died as his jarl in 1200. Birger owned estates in √ñsterg√∂tland, N√§rke, V√§rmland and S√∂dermanland.

Several Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members beat and killed Michael Donald, a 19-year-old African-American, and hung his body from a tree. One perpetrator, Henry Hays, was executed by electric chair in 1997, while another, James Knowles, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty and testifying against Hays. A third man was convicted as an accomplice, and a fourth was indicted but died before his trial could be completed. Hays' execution was the first in Alabama since 1913 for a white-on-black crime. It was the only execution of a KKK member during the 20th century for the murder of an African American. Donald's mother brought a civil suit for wrongful death against the United Klans of America (UKA), to which the attackers belonged. In 1987 a jury awarded her damages of $7 million, which bankrupted the organization. This set a precedent for civil legal action for damages against other racist hate groups. Victim Michael Donald (July 24, 1961 ‚Äì March 21, 1981) was born in Mobile, Alabama, the son of Beulah Mae (Greggory) Donald and David Donald, and was the youngest of six children. He attended local schools while growing up. In 1981 he was studying at a technical college, while working at the local newspaper, the Mobile Press Register. Donald grew up in a city and state influenced by the passage in the mid-1960s of federal civil rights legislation that ended legal segregation and provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voting rights. African Americans could again participate in politics in the South; their ability to register to vote also meant that they were selected for juries. Background In 1981, Josephus Anderson, an African American charged with the murder of a white policeman in Birmingham, Alabama during an armed robbery, was tried in Mobile, where the case had been moved in a change of venue. At a meeting held in Mobile while the jury was still debating, members of Unit 900 of the United Klans of America (UKA), Alabama Realm, complained that Anderson was not still convicted because the jury had African-American members. Bennie Jack Hays, the second-highest-ranking official in the UKA, reportedly said: \\"If a black man can get away with killing a white man, we ought to be able to get away with killing a black man.\\" The first trial of Anderson ended with a dead-lock of the mixed white-black jury. Anderson's case was retried, which resulted in another mistrial declared on all four counts on Friday 20, 1981. The prosecutor announced his intention to retry the case for a third time. At 10 p.m., local media started to report the hung jury's second failure to reach a verdict. Following a meeting held together the same day, Henry Hays (aged 26) ‚Äì Bennie Hays' son and the Exalted Cyclops of the UKA ‚Äì along with James Llewellyn \\"Tiger\\" Knowles (aged 17),\\"Suit Filed Against KKK In Death Of Black Youth,\\" Jet.

Murder  While Hays and Knowles were cruising through one of Mobile's mostly black neighbourhoods, they spotted Michael Donald walking home after he bought a pack of cigarettes at the nearby gas station for his sister. Without any link to the Anderson case or even a past criminal record, Donald was chosen at random for being black. The two UKA members lured him over to their car by asking him for directions to a local club and forced Donald into the car at gunpoint. The men then drove out to another county and took him to a secluded area in the woods near Mobile Bay. Donald attempted to escape, knocking away Hays' gun and trying to run into the woods. The men pursued Donald, attacked him and beat him with a tree limb. Hays wrapped a rope around Donald's neck and pulled on it to strangle him while Knowles continued to beat Donald with a tree branch. Once Donald had stopped moving, Hays slit his throat three times to make sure he was dead. The men left Donald's lifeless body hanging from a tree on Herndon Avenue across the street from Hays's house in Mobile, where it remained until the next morning. The same night, two other UKA members burned a cross on Mobile County courthouse lawn to celebrate the murder. Investigation and criminal proceedings = Arrests = While the local police chief suspected the Klan, officers first took three suspects into custody based on their possible involvement in a drug deal gone wrong; Donald's mother insisted that her son had not been involved in drugs. The police released the suspects at the conclusion of their investigation. Beulah Mae Donald contacted national civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson, who organized a protest march in the city and demanded answers from the police.\\"Michael Donald\\" , Spartacus website] The FBI investigated the case and it was ready to close its investigation, but Thomas Figures, the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Mobile, asked the Dept. of Justice to authorize a second investigation. He worked closely with FBI agent James Bodman. His brother Michael Figures, a state senator and civil rights activist, served as an attorney to Beulah Mae Donald and also encouraged the investigation. Two and a half years later in 1983, Henry Hays and James Knowles were arrested. Knowles confessed to Bodman in 1983, and additional evidence was revealed during the civil trial initiated by Donald's mother Beulah Mae Donald in 1984, leading to the indictment of Benjamin Franklin Cox, Jr., a truckdriver, as an accomplice in the criminal case. Henry's father Bennie Hays was also indicted. = Convictions = Henry Francis Hays (November 10, 1954 ‚Äì June 6, 1997) was convicted of capital murder. The jury voted in favor of life imprisonment but the judge overruled the jury's verdict and sentenced Hays to death.

James Llewellyn \\"Tiger\\" Knowles was indicted by a federal grand jury in 1985 for violating the civil rights of Michael Donald, and pleaded guilty to civil rights violations in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.

He had earlier testified that the slaying was done \\"to show Klan strength in Alabama.\\" Knowles was released on parole in 2010. Benjamin Franklin Cox, Jr., a truck driver from Mobile who provided the rope, was initially discharged by a trial judge in 1984, citing Alabama's 3-year statute of limitations for criminal conspiracy, but an Alabama grand jury reindicted Cox for murder in 1987.

Hays died of a heart attack before he could be retried. Civil proceedings Acting at the request of Beulah Mae Donald, Morris Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, brought a wrongful death suit in 1984 against the United Klans of America in federal court in the Southern District of Alabama, according to the SPLC. The civil trial brought out evidence that enabled the criminal indictment and conviction of Cox as an accomplice, and of Bennie Jack Hays for inciting the murder. The original complaint was considered too vague to hold up, but Judge Alex T. Howard Jr. helped refine the legal theory of \\"agency,\\" which held the Klan accountable for the acts of its members. This prevented the case from being dismissed before it could go to the jury. In 1987 the Klan was found civilly liable by an all-white jury and sentenced to damages of $7 million in the wrongful-death verdict in the case. The suit became a precedent for civil legal action against other racist hate groups in the United States. Payment of the judgment bankrupted the United Klans of America and resulted in its \\"national headquarters\\" being sold for $51,875, the proceeds going to Donald's mother. She died the following year on September 17, 1988. Commemoration Michael Donald Avenue In 2006, Mobile commemorated Michael Donald by renaming Herndon Avenue, where the murderers had hanged Donald's body. Mobile's first black mayor, Sam Jones, presided over a small gathering of Donald's family and local leaders at the commemoration. Donald's murder has been the subject of several works of fiction and nonfiction. The Texan political commentator Molly Ivins told the story of the Donald family in her essay, \\"Beulah Mae Donald,\\" which appeared in her 1991 anthology, Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?. Ravi Howard wrote a novel, Like Trees, Walking (2007), based on the murder. He won the Ernest J. Gaines Award for Literary Excellence in 2008 for it. Laurence Leamer wrote a book, The Lynching: The Epic Courtroom Battle That Brought Down the Klan (2016), chronicling the case. In film and television, the 1991 film Line of Fire (also called Blind Hate) depicts the civil court case related to the murder. Ted Koppel created \\"The Last Lynching\\", a Discovery Channel television program about US civil rights history that aired in October 2008. It centered on the murder of Michael Donald, the criminal prosecution of his killers, and the civil suit against the UKA. The National Geographic's Inside American Terror series explored Donald's murder in a 2008 episode about the KKK.

It appeared in two phases: a few first copies were printed and illuminated by Blake himself in 1789; five years later he bound these poems with a set of new poems in a volume titled Songs of Innocence and of Experience Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul. Blake was also a painter before the creation of Songs of Innocence and Experience and had painted such subjects as Oberon, Titania, and Puck dancing with fairies. \\"Innocence\\" and \\"Experience\\" are definitions of consciousness that rethink Milton's existential-mythic states of \\"Paradise\\" and \\"Fall\\". Often, interpretations of this collection centre around a mythical dualism, where \\"Innocence\\" represents the \\"unfallen world\\" and \\"Experience\\" represents the \\"fallen world\\". Blake categorizes our modes of perception that tend to coordinate with a chronology that would become standard in Romanticism: childhood is a state of protected innocence rather than original sin, but not immune to the fallen world and its institutions. This world sometimes impinges on childhood itself, and in any event becomes known through \\"experience\\", a state of being marked by the loss of childhood vitality, by fear and inhibition, by social and political corruption and by the manifold oppression of Church, State and the ruling classes. The volume's \\"Contrary States\\" are sometimes signalled by patently repeated or contrasted titles: in Innocence, Infant Joy, in Experience, Infant Sorrow; in Innocence, The Lamb, in Experience, The Fly and The Tyger. The stark simplicity of poems such as The Chimney Sweeper and The Little Black Boy display Blake's acute sensibility to the realities of poverty and exploitation that accompanied the \\"Dark Satanic Mills\\" of the Industrial Revolution. Songs of Innocence Songs of Innocence was originally a complete work first printed in 1789. It is a conceptual collection of 19 poems, engraved with artwork. This collection mainly shows happy, innocent perception in pastoral harmony, but at times, such as in \\"The Chimney Sweeper\\" and \\"The Little Black Boy\\", subtly shows the dangers of this na√Øve and vulnerable state. The poems are each listed below: :Introduction :The Shepherd :The Echoing Green :The Lamb :The Little Black Boy :The Blossom :The Chimney Sweeper :The Little Boy Lost :The Little Boy Found :Laughing Song :A Cradle Song :The Divine Image :Holy Thursday :Night :Spring :Nurse's Song :Infant Joy :A Dream :On Another's Sorrow Songs of Experience Songs of Experience is a poetry collection of 26 poems forming the second part of William Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience. The poems were published in 1794 (see 1794 in poetry). Some of the poems, such as \\"The Little Girl Lost\\" and \\"The Little Girl Found\\", were moved by Blake to Songs of Innocence and were frequently moved between the two books.See the various extent editions republished in their original publication order at the William Blake Archive.

Individual poems have also been set by, among others, John Tavener, Victoria Poleva, Jah Wobble, Tangerine Dream, Jeff Johnson, and Daniel Amos. A modified version of the poem \\"The Little Black Boy\\" was set to music in the song \\"My Mother Bore Me\\" from Maury Yeston's musical Phantom. The folk musician Greg Brown recorded sixteen of the poems on his 1987 album Songs of Innocence and of Experience and by Finn Coren in his Blake Project. The poet Allen Ginsberg believed the poems were originally intended to be sung, and that through study of the rhyme and metre of the works, a Blakean performance could be approximately replicated. In 1969, he conceived, arranged, directed, sang on, and played piano and harmonium for an album of songs entitled Songs of Innocence and Experience by William Blake, tuned by Allen Ginsberg (1970). American composer and producer David Axelrod produced two solo albums, Song of Innocence (1968) and Songs of Experience (1969) which were homages to the mystical poetry and paintings of William Blake. The composer William Bolcom completed a setting of the entire collection of poems in 1984. In 2005, a recording of Bolcom's work by Leonard Slatkin, the Michigan State Children's Choir, and the University of Michigan on the Naxos label won four Grammy Awards: Best Choral Performance, Best Classical Contemporary Composition, Best Classical Album, and Best Producer of the Year (classical). The composer Victoria Poleva completed \\"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\\" in 2002, a chamber cycle on the verses by Blake for soprano, clarinet and accordion. It was first performed by the ensemble Accroche-Note of France. The Swedish composer David Unger completed \\"Night songs op. 24\\", a setting of five poems from Songs of Innocence for solo voice and piano in 2013. It was first performed by baritone Anthony Schneider and pianist Rosemary Barnes in Vienna, Austria the same year. Popular group Tangerine Dream based their album Tyger on lyrics by William Blake. Popular rock group U2 released an album called Songs of Innocence in 2014, and followed it in 2017 with Songs of Experience. Karl Jenkins' Motets includes a setting of The Shepherd. The fictional rock band Infant Sorrow, as featured in the 2008 film Forgetting Sarah Marshall, appears to be named after the Blake poem. Facsimile editions The Huntington Library and Art Gallery in San Marino, California, published a small facsimile edition in 1975 that included sixteen plates reproduced from two copies of Songs of Innocence and of Experience in their collection, with an introduction by James Thorpe. The songs reproduced were Introduction, Infant Joy, The Lamb, Laughing Song and Nurse's Song from Songs of Innocence, and Introduction, The Clod & the Pebble, The Tyger, The Sick Rose, Nurses Song and Infant Sorrow from Songs of Experience. Tate Publishing, in collaboration with The William Blake Trust, produced a folio edition containing all of the songs of Innocence and Experience in 2006.

In effect, one can derive a low-dimensional representation of the observed variables in terms of their affinity to certain hidden variables, just as in latent semantic analysis, from which PLSA evolved. Compared to standard latent semantic analysis which stems from linear algebra and downsizes the occurrence tables (usually via a singular value decomposition), probabilistic latent semantic analysis is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. Model c) . The d and w are observable variables, the topic c is a latent variable. Considering observations in the form of co-occurrences (w,d) of words and documents, PLSA models the probability of each co-occurrence as a mixture of conditionally independent multinomial distributions: : P(w,d) = \\\\sum_c P(c) P(dc) P(wc) = P(d) \\\\sum_c P(cd) P(wc) with 'c' being the words' topic. Note that the number of topics is a hyperparameter that must be chosen in advance and is not estimated from the data. The first formulation is the symmetric formulation, where w and d are both generated from the latent class c in similar ways (using the conditional probabilities P(dc) and P(wc)), whereas the second formulation is the asymmetric formulation, where, for each document d, a latent class is chosen conditionally to the document according to P(cd), and a word is then generated from that class according to P(wc). Although we have used words and documents in this example, the co-occurrence of any couple of discrete variables may be modelled in exactly the same way. So, the number of parameters is equal to cd + wc. The number of parameters grows linearly with the number of documents. In addition, although PLSA is a generative model of the documents in the collection it is estimated on, it is not a generative model of new documents. Their parameters are learned using the EM algorithm.  Application  PLSA may be used in a discriminative setting, via Fisher kernels.Thomas Hofmann, Learning the Similarity of Documents : an information- geometric approach to document retrieval and categorization, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 12, pp-914-920, MIT Press, 2000 PLSA has applications in information retrieval and filtering, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and related areas. It is reported that the aspect model used in the probabilistic latent semantic analysis has severe overfitting problems.

Each stage will have a stage winner, but the overall winner in the GC is the rider who has the fastest cumulative time across all stages.BBC Sport http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/tour_de_france/378101.stm Hence, whoever wins the GC is generally regarded as the winner of the race. Riders who finish in the same group are awarded the same time, with possible subtractions due to time bonuses. Two riders are said to have finished in the same group if the gap between them is less than three seconds. A crash or mechanical incident in the final 3 kilometres of a stage that finishes without a categorised climb usually means that riders thus affected are considered to have finished as part of the group they were with at the 3km mark, so long as they finish the stage. It is possible to win the GC without winning a stage. It is also possible to win the GC race without being the GC leader before the last stage. The most important stages of a bicycle race for GC contenders are mountain stages and individual time trial stages. Both of these offer the best chance for a single racer to outperform other racers. Jerseys In many bicycle races, the current leader of the GC gets a special jersey awarded. In the Tour de France, the leader wears a yellow jersey, in the Giro d'Italia a pink jersey, in the Vuelta a Espa√±a the leader's jersey is red, and in the Tour Down Under the leader's jersey is ochre.

GSM uses TDMA technology in the radio interface to share a single frequency between several users, assigning sequential timeslots to the individual users sharing a frequency. Each user transmits periodically for less than one-eighth of the time within one of the eight timeslots. Since the users are at various distances from the base station and radio waves travel at the finite speed of light, the precise arrival-time within the slot can be used by the base station to determine the distance to the mobile phone. The time at which the phone is allowed to transmit a burst of traffic within a timeslot must be adjusted accordingly to prevent collisions with adjacent users. Timing Advance (TA) is the variable controlling this adjustment. Technical Specifications 3GPP TS 05.10http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/05_series/05.10/0510-8c0.zip and TS 45.010http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/45_series/45.010/45010-a00.zip describe the TA value adjustment procedures. The TA value is normally between 0 and 63, with each step representing an advance of one bit period (approximately 3.69 microseconds). With radio waves travelling at about 300,000,000 metres per second (that is 300 metres per microsecond), one TA step then represents a change in round-trip distance (twice the propagation range) of about 1,100 metres. This means that the TA value changes for each 550-metre change in the range between a mobile and the base station. This limit of 63 √ó 550 metres is the maximum 35 kilometres that a device can be from a base station and is the upper bound on cell placement distance. A continually adjusted TA value avoids interference to and from other users in adjacent timeslots, thereby minimizing data loss and maintaining Mobile QoS (call quality-of-service). Timing Advance is significant for privacy and communications security, as its combination with other variables can allow GSM localization to find the device's position and track the mobile phone user. TA is also used to adjust transmission power in space-division multiple access systems. This limited the original range of a GSM cell site to 35km as mandated by the duration of the standard timeslots defined in the GSM specification. The maximum distance is given by the maximum time that the signal from the mobile/BTS needs to reach the receiver of the mobile/BTS on time to be successfully heard. At the air interface the delay between the transmission of the downlink (BTS) and the uplink (mobile) has an offset of 3 timeslots. Until now the mobile station has used a timing advance to compensate for the propagation delay as the distance to the BTS changes. The timing advance values are coded by 6 bits, which gives the theoretical maximum BTS/mobile separation as 35km. By implementing the Extended Range feature, the BTS is able to receive the uplink signal in two adjacent timeslots instead of one. When the mobile station reaches its maximum timing advance, i.e. maximum range, the BTS expands its hearing window with an internal timing advance that gives the necessary time for the mobile to be heard by the BTS even from the extended distance. This extra advance is the duration of a single timeslot, a 156 bit period. This gives roughly 120 km range for a cell.http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics- manufacturing/6838169-1.html and is implemented in sparsely populated areas and to reach islands for example.

Landis at first appeared to be the winner of the 2006 Tour de France, and the third non-European winner in the event's history, before testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The competition was ultimately won by √ìscar Pereiro. Landis was an all-around rider, with special skills in climbing, time-trialing, and descending. Landis turned professional in 1999 with the Mercury Cycling Team. He joined the U.S. Postal Service team in 2002, and moved to the Phonak Hearing Systems team in 2005. In January 2010, a French judge issued a national arrest warrant for Landis on computer hacking charges related to the 2006 doping allegations.Jolly, David. (2010-02-19) New York Times, 2010-02-15, Arrest Warrant For Floyd Landis. Nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-30.Floyd Landis hacked into anti-doping agency computers-says-France Newsolio, February 15, 2010 Until 2010, Landis maintained his innocence and mounted a defense. Although Landis's legal team documented inconsistencies in the handling and evaluation of his urine samples, the disqualification was upheld. He was suspended from professional competition through January 30, 2009, following an arbitration panel's 2-to-1 ruling on September 20, 2007. Landis appealed the result of the arbitration hearing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which subsequently upheld the panel's ruling. In January 2011, Landis was unable to find a new team, which effectively ended his professional career. On May 20, 2010, after almost four years of contesting the allegations, Landis admitted to continual doping, and revealed that Lance Armstrong and many other top riders who rode on his team doped as well. Early life and education Floyd Landis is the second child and oldest son of Paul and Arlene Landis. His childhood home is in the village of Farmersville in West Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.Everson, Darren (2006, July 30). Landis lived in the Conestoga Valley School District. World Descends on Farmersville. New York Daily News, p. 62-63. He graduated from Conestoga Valley High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1994. He was raised in a devout Mennonite family and community. Landis used his first bike to ride while out fishing with his best friend but quickly learned to enjoy riding for its own sake. At one point, he became determined to ride in a local race. Landis showed up wearing sweatpants because his religion forbade wearing shorts. He won that race, and more wins followed as Landis continued to enjoy the sport. Disturbed at his son's participation in what he considered a \\"useless\\" endeavor, Landis's father tried to discourage him from racing his bike by giving him extra chores. This left him no time to train during the day, so he would sneak out of the house at night to train, sometimes at 1 or 2 a.m. and often in the freezing cold. Landis's fatherFloyd Landis ‚Äì Mennonite in tights. The Religion Report 26 July 2006 received a tip that his son had been going out at night. He did not appreciate his son's passion for cycling and thought he might be getting into drugs or alcohol. He often followed Landis at a distance to make sure he was not getting into trouble. Landis's father later became a hearty supporter of his son and considered himself one of Floyd's biggest fans.OLN Television broadcast of the 2006 Tour de France, July 22, 2006 Career =Master of the Mountains= Landis at the 2006 Tour of California. Landis won the first mountain bike race he entered. In 1993, he was crowned U.S. junior national champion. He told friends he would win the Tour de France one day. At age 20, Landis moved to Southern California to train full-time as a mountain biker. He soon established a reputation for toughness, once finishing a race riding on only his rims. However, his training regimen resembled that of a road biker, and in 1999 he switched to road cycling. Landis performed well enough on the road that Lance Armstrong recruited him to U.S. Postal and chose Landis to ride alongside him as a domestique during his Tour wins from 2002 to 2004, part of his then-record seven Tour titles. In each of these Tours, Landis served as Armstrong's lieutenant, or chief domestique, pushing the pace in the mountains to break the pack before Armstrong took off on his own to win the stage. In the 2004 tour, Landis led Armstrong and a few of Armstrong's main rivals over the final climb of stage 17, putting on such an impressive display of strength that actor and avid bike-racing fan Robin Williams dubbed him the \\"Mofo of the Mountains\\". Landis's performance led some observers to peg him as a possible team leader and future winner of the Maillot Jaune. Landis left U.S. Postal later that year after receiving a better contract offer from the Phonak squad. In the 2005 Tour de France, Landis finished ninth overall in the General classification, his highest finish in the tour at that time. Landis started the 2006 season strongly, with overall wins in the Amgen Tour of California, and then in the prestigious Paris‚ÄìNice, both week-long stage races. Winning Paris‚ÄìNice gave Landis 52 points in the UCI ProTour individual competition, starting him off in first place for 2006. Landis continued his display of strength with another overall win in the Ford Tour de Georgia, which took place from April 18 to April 23. In addition to winning the Tour de Georgia time trial, Landis managed to retain every second of his lead through the mountains with a close second-place finish to Tom Danielson on Brasstown Bald, the most difficult climbing stage of the tour. =Hip ailment= The powerful performance of Landis up to stage 16 of the Tour de France and his comeback in stage 17 is particularly notable given his hip ailment, osteonecrosis, which was revealed in an article in The New York Times during the 2006 Tour de France.\\"What He's Been Pedaling\\", The New York Times, July 16, 2006. This deterioration in the ball joint of his right hip stemmed from diminished blood supply and constricted blood vessels caused by scar tissue. The original injury that led to the formation of the scar tissue was a femoral neck fracture sustained in a bicycle crash during a training ride near his Southern California home in October 2002. Landis kept the ailment secret from his teammates, rivals, and the media until an announcement was made while the 2006 Tour was underway. This same ailment also affected former multi-sport athlete Bo Jackson and American football player Brett Favre. Landis rode the 2006 Tour with the constant pain from the injury, which he described: \\"It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into my knee. The morning is the best time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when I ride it hurts. Most of the time it doesn't keep me awake, but there are nights that it does.\\"\\"Landis's Hip Will Need Surgery After Bid for Tour\\", The New York Times, July 10, 2006. During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his first place in the General Classification \\"a triumph of persistence\\" despite the pain. (subscription required) He was stripped of his win on September 20, 2006. Landis underwent successful hip resurfacing on September 27, 2006, receiving a Smith and Nephew Birmingham metal-on-metal hip joint.I have a metal hip and it's nothing to do with resurfacing =Doping case: 2006‚Äì2007= On July 27, 2006, the Phonak Cycling Team announced a urine sample submitted by Floyd Landis tested positive for an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone epitestosterone (T/E ratio) after his performance in stage 17 of the 2006 Tour de France. Landis denied doping and placed faith in a test using his backup sample. Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive. It did, and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team. Landis's personal physician later disclosed that the test had found a T/E ratio of 11:1 in Landis, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1.The T/E ratio allowable limit is based on new science, and that there has been controversy about whether the WADA limit of 4:1 is scientifically acceptable, in other words, that this limit is too low. The Landis ratio of 11:1 would not have disqualified him a country such as Australia. The test on Landis's stage 17 A sample had been performed by the French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD). LNDD is a division of the Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life and is accredited by the World Anti- Doping Agency (WADA). In early August, Landis was found guilty of doping and was disqualified. Second place rider √ìscar Pereiro became the race's official winner. The decision of whether to strip Landis of his title was made by the International Cycling Union (UCI). Under UCI rules, the determination of whether a cyclist violated any rules must be made by the cyclist's national federation, in this case USA Cycling, which transferred the case to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). David Witt, a close personal friend who introduced Landis to his future wife (the daughter of Witt's then girlfriend and future wife), shot himself with a handgun in the North Park community of San Diego on August 15, 2006. Landis and Witt met as roommates in 1998 when Landis moved to San Diego. Witt and Landis shared the same cycling coach, and Witt was instrumental in Landis's transition from mountain biking to road bicycle racing. Witt and his wife attended the 2006 Tour de France and were in Paris with Landis to celebrate his victory. Witt's North Park restaurant was adorned with Landis memorabilia, including two of Landis's jerseys. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that a Landis family spokesman read the following from a statement: \\"Floyd, Amber and the family are devastated by the news of David's death. They loved him dearly, and they miss him. [The Landises] hope their privacy is respected in this time of mourning.\\" Many years later, Landis claimed that Witt may have killed himself because of his knowledge of Landis's doping practices. In a 2010 ESPN interview, Landis acknowledged that Witt knew about Landis's doping and said, \\"I'm not saying that's the reason he's dead, but without that, I don't see why he wouldn't still be here.\\" Even before the USADA's ruling on the matter, the controversy resulted in the disbandment of Landis's former team Phonak. On September 20, 2007, Landis was found guilty of doping by a 2‚Äì1 vote of the hearing committee, with Patrice Brunet and Richard McLaren in the majority, and Christopher Campbell dissenting. Landis was banned from the sport for two years, dated retroactively to January 2007. Landis appealed the decision of the committee to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The hearing ran from March 19 to March 24, 2008 in New York City. The decision was announced on June 30, 2008, with the result that the conviction and ban were upheld. In September 2008, Landis moved in U.S. federal court to vacate the CAS arbitration award, contending that the procurement of the award was tainted by partiality and conflicts of interest. Landis contested the $100,000 U.S. \\"costs\\" award, characterizing it as a disguised punitive award. The parties agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice in December 2008, ending the litigation surrounding the doping case. On April 14, 2009, the French newspaper L'Express reported information that had been obtained from hacking into the French national laboratory for doping detection. The information was sent to a Canadian counterpart lab from a computer registered to Arnie Baker, Landis's ex-coach. On August 25, 2009, The New York Times reported, \\"No evidence has surfaced to connect Mr. Landis or Dr. Baker to the hacking, and each has denied any involvement.\\" However, on February 15, 2010, it became known that a French judge issued an arrest warrant for Landis on the hacking charge in late January. During 2006 and 2007, Landis is believed to have raised about $1 million from the \\"Floyd Fairness Fund\\", established by businessman Thom Weisel. He appealed to supporters to donate \\"anything they could\\" to help him pay his reportedly $2 million legal bill, while denying his involvement in doping. Landis reached an agreement with federal prosecutors over allegations that he fraudulently solicited donations for a defense fund he set up to fight doping charges. He appeared before a federal judge on August 24, 2012 for a \\"deferred prosecution\\" hearing at which he agreed to pay restitution. =Return to cycling= After his two-year ban ended in early 2009, Landis returned to cycling with the OUCH Pro Cycling Team, a U.S. team that races domestically.UnitedHealthcare announces title sponsorship Cycling News, Dec 17, 2009Landis to Race April 19 in NY ESPN, April 3, 2009 His first race following his suspension and his first race as a member of the OUCH team was the 2009 Tour of California, in which he finished 23rd out of a field of 84 riders. Landis left the OUCH team at the end of 2009, stating he wished to ride the longer, tougher stage races offered in Europe and internationally that better suit his strengths. He then raced the Tour of Southland in New Zealand in November 2009, with local team CyclingNZshop.com-Bio Sport,Landis admits tour dream return is over Cycling News, Nov 1, 2009 finishing 17th overall out of a field of 95 riders. For the 2010 season, he joined the Bahati Foundation Cycling Team. However, after Landis admitted to doping himself and accused many other prominent American cyclists of doping, the Bahati Team began to fall apart, and Landis competed in the July 2010, Cascade Cycling Classic in Bend, Oregon as a lone rider without a team.Holcomb, Brian. (July 21, 2010) \\"Floyd Landis heads to Cascade as Bahati Foundation team reorganizes\\". VeloNews.com. Retrieved 7-22-2010 Landis was unable to find a team in the next months, and in January 2011, decided to end his career. =Doping accusations and admission: 2010= On May 20, 2010, midway through the 2010 Amgen Tour of California, The Wall Street Journal reported that Floyd Landis had sent a series of emails to senior cycling and anti-doping officials in which he admitted to doping from June 2002 through his victory in the 2006 Tour de France. It was also reported that Landis and his coach Dr. Brent Kay sent emails to Tour of California director Andrew Messick. Landis had asked Messick to be allowed last-minute entry to the 2010 race; when Messick refused, Landis released his allegations regarding cycling to the media.From May 22, 2010 USA Today article, \\"Lance Armstrong makes public emails from Floyd Landis\\", which used Floyd Landis emails provided by Lance Armstrong as its source. Floyd Landis to Andrew Messick: \\"I certainly understand that my revealing that Lance Armstrong has relied on blood doping, EPO, and anabolics to win the three Tours de France in which I helped him will jeopardize your substantial investment in facilitating his appearance so from a business point of view I understand fully.\\" He accused several former teammates, including Lance Armstrong and George Hincapie, of using EPO and blood transfusions in the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Landis also claims there was blood doping at the 2004 Tour de France. Armstrong and Team RadioShack maintained that Landis and his coach had asked for a spot on , and Landis only went public with the allegations after being denied a contract. Landis also alleged that he assisted Levi Leipheimer and Dave Zabriskie in taking EPO before the Tour of California one year. In an ESPN interview that day, Landis steadfastly denied that he had used synthetic testosterone during the 2006 Tour de France, but admitted to using human growth hormone and other doping modalities. The 2006 Tour de France was the only race to produce evidence Landis had ever used banned substances. Landis admitted that he had no physical evidence to support his allegations of others' involvement in doping, but that his emails were intended to \\"clear his conscience.\\" Landis stated that Armstrong told him in 2002 that U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team director Johan Bruyneel had made a \\"financial arrangement\\" with the International Cycling Union (UCI) to ensure that details of a positive test on Armstrong remained confidential. Pat McQuaid, the president of UCI, who had received copies of Landis's emails, said that Landis's allegations were \\"completely untrue\\", that Landis was \\"seeking revenge,\\" and that UCI had \\"made contact with a lawyer and will take appropriate action.\\" Bruyneel \\"absolutely den[ied] everything [Landis] said\\" and noted that several people \\"have had the story for a few weeks but didn't give it any credibility\\" and that Landis was \\"angry at the world\\" for the collapse of his career following his conviction. Olympic medalist Steve Hegg said he felt \\"betrayed\\" and \\"deceived\\" and characterized Landis as \\"a bitter guy.\\" David Millar, who served a two-year suspension for EPO doping from 2004 to 2006 and is on the team, said: \\"If [Landis] had stood up and manned up four years ago, he'd be racing the Tour de France now. He'd have a different book out. He'd have not lost a penny. He'd be admired by young people. He would have a different life ahead of him...\\" Both the World Anti-Doping Agency and the U.S. government began investigating Landis' accusations. The U.S. case investigation was led by Jeff Novitzky, a special agent with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Doug Miller, an experienced federal prosecutor, both of whom were part of the BALCO investigative team. Landis filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit against Armstrong under the federal False Claims Act, where he alleged that Armstrong and team managers defrauded the U.S. government when they accepted money from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). In February 2013, the United States Department of Justice joined the whistleblower lawsuit, which also accused former USPS team director Johan Bruyneel and Tailwind Sports, the firm that managed the USPS team, of defrauding the U.S. In February 2017, the court determined that the federal government‚Äôs 100 million civil lawsuit against Armstrong, started by Landis, would proceed to trial. The matter was settled in April 2018 when Armstrong agreed to pay the United States Government 5 million. It was reported that Landis would receive 1.1 million as a result of his whistleblower actions. =Post-cycling career= In July 2011, Landis gave an interview to Graham Bensinger in which he described his plans and training to race professionally in NASCAR.InDepth with Graham Bensinger, July 15, 2011 In November 2011, Landis and his former coach Arnie Baker, were convicted of \\"benefiting from\\" hacking into the computers of the Chatenay-Malabry anti-doping lab. Both received 12-month suspended sentences.\\"Landis Guilty in Hacking,\\" New York Times, November 10, 2011 In April 2012, it was revealed that Landis was under investigation by federal prosecutors in connection with possible wire and mail fraud committed when he raised his legal defense fund in 2007. In August 2012, Landis admitted to fraud, and was ordered to pay 487,000 in restitution. He reached a deal to avoid being prosecuted for the fraud charges as long as he paid the restitution. Landis is portrayed by American actor Jesse Plemons in the 2015 film The Program, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Ben Foster as Lance Armstrong and Chris O'Dowd as David Walsh. He opened a cannabis company in Colorado in mid-2016. Landis's 2006 Tour de France attack gained new attention at the 2018 Giro d'Italia, when Chris Froome's race-clinching long-range solo breakaway on Stage 19 of the 2018 Giro d'Italia was described by fellow rider George Bennett immediately after the stage as ‚Äúdoing a Landis‚Äù. In October 2018 Landis announced that he would launch a new UCI Continental cycling team sponsored by his cannabis business, Floyd's of Leadville. He indicated that funding for the team would come from the bulk of the money he received from the settlement of the Lance Armstrong whistleblower lawsuit, and that it would be managed by Gord Fraser. In November 2019 Landis announced the team would be folding after one year of operation.Ballinger, Alex (13 November 2019) Floyd Landis‚Äôs Continental team is folding after one season Cycling Weekly.

The population (in 2011) of people living in municipalities (or unincorporated census subdivisions) located along the coast of Conception Bay was 90,490http://www.stats.gov.nl.ca/statistics/Census2011/PDF/Pop_CCS_2011.pdf making it one of the most densely populated areas of the province. Conception Bay is adjacent to the St. John's Metropolitan Area which contains 5 of the 10 largest settlements in the province and is home to over 200,000 people. The smaller communities in Newfoundland may often be referenced by the Bay in which they are located, e.g.: 'Port de Grave, CB'. Geography The bay indents the Avalon Peninsula, opening towards the Atlantic Ocean at its northeast. It is bounded by Cape St. Francis in the south and Split Point near Bay de Verde in the north. It has a maximum depth of 300 metres (980 ft). Conception Bay covers an area of 1295 square kilometres and contains several islands, the three largest being Bell Island, Little Bell Island and Kellys Island. The Bay is fed by rivers from its east and west, which flow on into the Atlantic Ocean. Portugal Cove towards Holyrood. The larger island is Kellys Island and the smaller one is Little Bell Island. Portugal Cove . Bay de Verde and Baccalieu Island can be seen in the distance.  History  The name Conception Bay comes from the Portuguese Ba√≠a da Concei√ß√£o or Baia de Comceica and was presumably given in honour of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8. The name first appears on the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504‚Äì1505. Conception Bay was the site of Britaniola Colony, established in 1610. It was the site of Sea-Forest Plantation founded in 1610 and Bristol's Hope Plantation founded in 1619. During the 1610s, the Bay was the hideout of the infamous Newfoundland based buccaneer, Peter Easton. Artifacts from the 17th-century planter era through the 19th century have been found, such as Spanish coins, one minted in Peru. There was trade between Newfoundland and Bilbao during the 17th century.Peter E. Pope and Bryn Tapper, \\"Historic Carbonear, Summer 2013\\", Provincial Archaeology Office 2013 Archaeology Review, Vol. 12-2013, accessed 24 April 2015Mark Rendell, \\"17th- century coins unearthed in Carbonear\\" , The Telegram, 17 April 2014, accessed 24 April 2015 From the late 1890s to the 1960s, Bell Island was home to an iron ore mine in Wabana, operated most recently by the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO). The ore was shipped for processing to DOSCO's steel mill in Sydney, Nova Scotia. During World War II, anchored DOSCO cargo ships, along with the loading pier at Wabana, were the target of Nazi U-boats on at least two occasions. During one attack on anchored ore carriers, a torpedo missed its target and struck the pier, making Bell Island one of the few places in North America to suffer a direct enemy attack (see Attacks on North America during World War II). The wrecks of the four cargo ships sunk during these two attacks are visible at low tide; a memorial on shore is dedicated to the 69 merchant sailors who lost their lives. Since 2011 Memorial University of Newfoundland has been conducting archaeological excavations at Carbonear bordering the bay.  Other information  The provincial government operates a passenger-vehicle ferry service from Bell Island to Portugal Cove (on the bay's southeastern shore), operating through what locals know as the \\"Bell Island Tickle.\\" Humpback whales have been known to enter the bay while migrating. Private vessels and tourist charters frequent the bay's waters during the summer months. Property development in the St. John's exurb of Conception Bay South in recent decades has led to increasing recreational use of the bay.

Berlin's first book, 2005's The Man Behind the Microchip: Robert Noyce and the Invention of Silicon Valley, was a biography of inventor-entrepreneur Robert Noyce. Her second book, 2017's Troublemakers: Silicon Valley's Coming of Age, is a history of the Valley in the period 1969-1983. Troublemakers looks at the work of seven individuals during these years when the software, personal computing, video game, advanced semiconductor logic, and venture capital industries first took shape. Bob Taylor kick-started the precursor to the Internet, the Arpanet, and masterminded the personal computer. Mike Markkula served as Apple‚Äôs first chairman, with an ownership stake equal to that of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. Sandra Kurtzig, an early software entrepreneur, was the first woman to take a technology company public. Bob Swanson cofounded Genentech.

The four sons of the former king Canute I fell out with King Sverker II in about 1204 and sought support among the Birkebeiner party in Norway. The Birkebeiner leader Jarl H√•kon Galen married their cousin in January 1205 and promoted their claim. The brothers, of whom only Eric Knutsson is known by name, returned to Sweden in the same year. To which extent they had Norwegian military backing is unclear. By the fall of 1205 the brothers were staying at the estate of √Ñlgar√•s when the Sverker clan attacked. In the ensuing fight all the brothers were slain but Eric. The laconic sources make clear that it was a battle and not merely a mass execution.Paulsson, G√∂te, Annales Suecici medii aevi.

An oral tradition says that it was \\"2000 paces from the church of √Ñlgar√•s in the direction where the sun rises in September\\". While the House of Eric lost this battle, Eric made it to Norway where he stayed for the next 2-3 years.

It employs a dual-mesh networking topology in which all devices are peers and each device independently transmits, receives, and repeats messages. Like other home automation systems, it has been associated with the Internet of Things. Insteon-based products were launched in 2005 by Smartlabs, the company which holds the trademark for Insteon. A Smartlabs subsidiary, also named Insteon, was created to market the technology. According to a press release on June 13, 2017, SmartLabs and its Insteon technology has been acquired by Richmond Capital Partners with Rob Lilleness of Universal Electronics assuming the role of chairman and CEO. Protocol Every message received by an Insteon compatible device undergoes error detection and correction and is then retransmitted to improve reliability. All devices retransmit the same message simultaneously so that message transmissions are synchronous to the powerline frequency, thus preserving the integrity of the message while strengthening the signal on the powerline and erasing RF dead zones. Insteon powerline messaging uses phase-shift keying. Insteon RF messaging uses frequency-shift keying. Each message contains a two-bit \\"hops\\" field that is initialized to 3 by the originating node and decremented each time a node in the network repeats the message. Individual Insteon messages can also carry up to 14 bytes of arbitrary user data for custom applications. Network topology Insteon is an integrated dual-mesh (formerly referred to as \\"dual-band\\") network that combines wireless radio frequency (RF) and a building's existing electrical wiring. The electrical wiring becomes a backup transmission medium in the event of RF/wireless interference. Conversely, RF/wireless becomes a backup transmission medium in the event of powerline interference. As a peer-to-peer network, devices do not require network supervision, thus allowing optional operation without central controllers and routing tables. Insteon devices can function without a central controller. Additionally, they may be managed by a central controller to implement functions such as control via smartphones and tablets, control scheduling, event handling, and problem reporting via email or text messaging. A computer can be used as a central controller by connecting it to an Insteon USB/serial PowerLinc modem, which serves as a communication bridge between the computer and the Insteon device network. Security Insteon network security is maintained via linking control to ensure that users cannot create links that would allow them to control neighbors‚Äô Insteon devices, and via encryption within extended Insteon messages for applications such as door locks and security applications, should those applications choose to implement encryption. Insteon enforces linking control by requiring users to have physical possession of devices, or knowledge of their unique Insteon IDs in order to create links. Firmware in Insteon devices prohibits them from identifying themselves to other devices unless a user either physically presses a button on the device during the installation process or explicitly addresses the device via a central controller. Linking to a device by sending Insteon messages (e.g., from a central controller) requires knowledge of the address of the target Insteon device. As these addresses are unique for each device and assigned at the factory (and displayed on a printed label attached to each device), users must have physical access to the device to read the device address from the label and manually enter it when prompted during installation. The security of Insteon RF devices was criticized in a DEF CON presentation in 2015. Installation Insteon devices are configured by applying a sequence of \\"taps\\" (button presses) to a pushbutton on each device to establish direct device-to-device links. Alternatively, a central controller may be used to configure devices. Each Insteon device has its own unique identifier code, similar to a MAC address, and the technology allows directly linked devices to manage their identifiers. Compatibility Older Insteon chip sets manufactured by Smartlabs can transmit, receive, and respond to (but not repeat) X10 power line messages, thus enabling X10 networks to interoperate with Insteon. In 2014, Insteon released a home automation system compatible with the touch-enabled Metro interface, with devices appearing as \\"live tiles\\", and later added voice control via Microsoft Cortana.Darryl Taft, \\"Insteon Taps Microsoft Cortana for Windows Phone 8.1 Home Automation App\\", eWeek, July 16, 2014 In 2015, voice control was added via compatibility with Amazon Echo. That same year, Logitech announced the Harmony Hub-based remote would support Insteon devices when deployed with an Insteon Hub. Also in 2015, Insteon announced an initiative to integrate the Google-owned Nest learning thermostat with the Insteon Hub. Insteon was one of two launch partners for Apple's HomeKit platform, with the HomeKit-enabled Insteon Hub Pro. In 2015, Insteon announced support for the Apple Watch, allowing watch owners to control their home with an Insteon Hub.

Life and career Boyer grew up in Monterey, California and was a member of the Velo Club Monterey there. He raced as an amateur in Europe from 1973, after joining the ACBB club in the Parisian suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. The club frequently provided riders for the Peugeot professional team, which had had English-speaking riders since the Briton, Tom Simpson, led it in the 1960s. Boyer, however, turned professional in 1977 for the smaller Lejeune-BP team, sponsored by a Parisian cycle company and an international oil giant. He first competed in the Tour in 1981, when the organiser, F√©lix L√©vitan, encouraged him to wear not his team jersey but a Stars and Stripes design which suggested that he was the American national champion. Many have said that L√©vitan, who looked after the financial aspects of the race while his colleague Jacques Goddet managed the sporting side, saw Boyer as a way to attract further American interest and money. Boyer rode the Tour de France five times and finished 12th in 1983 (French Jean de Gribaldy Sem team with Sean Kelly). He was unusual in refusing to eat meat and became well known for the large quantities of nuts and fruit that he brought to the race. The French team manager, Cyrille Guimard, described Boyer as \\"un marginal\\", a description hard to translate but which suggests an outsider, almost a hippie. The British journalist Dennis Donovan, working for the London magazine Cycling remarked on Boyer's intense religious beliefs. In the 1981 Tour, he said, English-speaking journalists felt sorry for him as a colleague in a French-speaking world and offered him a collection of girlie magazines. Boyer, said Donovan, declined politely and said he preferred to read his Bible. Boyer also competed in and won the 1980 Coors Classic in the USA, and the 1985 Race Across America completing the 3,120 miles in nine days, two hours, and six minutes. His career included 87 amateur victories and 49 professional ones. Boyer was inducted into the United States Cycling Hall of Fame in 1998. In November, 2002, Boyer was convicted after pleading guilty to 10 felony counts of child molestation. He was sentenced to 20 year prison term which was suspended by the judge and had him serve one year in jail and five years probation. In January, 2006, after successful completion of his probation conditions, his probation officer recommended that Boyer be released from probation. In 2006, Boyer participated in the Race Across America again, this time in the new \\"Solo Enduro\\" category which requires all participants to use 40 hours of rest (stopping) during the race at official stations along the course. Early in the race Boyer showed he was using a different strategy from other favorites. While the two ahead of him were using minimal rests (30 minutes and 2¬Ω hours after the first 36 hours of racing), Boyer had already used 5¬Ω hour of off-bike time. In the end, all Enduro contenders used their required 40 hours' off-bike time well before the finish, where Boyer prevailed in the Enduro division. Since 2007 Boyer has lived much of the year in Rwanda where, along with Kimberly Coats, his wife, he runs Team Rwanda, a cycling team for Rwandan cyclists, and assists with Project Rwanda, a relief agency focused on providing bicycles and other aid to people in Rwanda. For three months in mid 2010, former Team BMC Racing professional and 2008 AMGEN Tour of California King of the Mountains winner Scott Nydam and multiple national U.S. cyclo-cross champion Clark Natwick assisted Boyer with training, logistics and testing of the Rwandan team. Adrien Niyonshuti has earned a spot in the 2012 London Summer Olympics cross-country mountain bike race for Rwanda. In 2014, Team Rwanda moved to a new complex only a few kilometers from the Gorilla Park Headquarters in Kinigi, Rwanda. The center is called Africa Rising Cycling Center.

It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean off Europe and Africa and into the south-eastern Indian Ocean. It is an important species in commercial fisheries and is listed as a Vulnerable species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Description The Atlantic horse mackerel has quite a slender, quite compressed body with a large head in which the rear of the upper jaw reaches the front of the eye and the lower jaw projects beyond the upper jaw. The eye has a well developed adipose eyelid. It has two dorsal fins, the first is tall and has seven thin spines, with the final spine being much shorter than the others. The second dorsal fin is separated from the first by a narrow gap and is considerably longer than the first with 29-33 soft rays. The anal fin is about as long as the second dorsal fin and there are two separate spines at its anterior end. The moderately sized pelvic fin has a single spine and five soft rays and has its origin below the end of the pectoral fin base. A curved line of 33-40 bony scutes runs from the head to the tail, each having a small spine which increase in size and become bonier towards the tail. The lateral line has a total of 66-67 scales, of which 31-36 are scutes. It is dark blue in colour with silvery flanks and a white belly, there is a dark spot on the operculum. This species attains a maximum fork length of , although they are normally around and a weight of . Distribution The Atlantic horse mackerel occurs in the north and eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. In the Atlantic it is found from Norway to South Africa where it may extend around the Cape of Good Hope along the southern African Indian Ocean coast Maputo in Mozambique. However, if Trachurus capensis is considered to be a valid species then this species is restricted to the north east Atlantic. It has been recorded in Cape Verde but is thought to occur there only as a vagrant. Habitat and biology The Atlantic horse mackerel is a benthopelagic species which normally occurs over sandy substrates at depths of , although it has been reported as deep as and it is sometimes found nearer the surface waters. It is a migratory species, moving northwards in the summer months and returning southwards when the sea temperature starts to fall. In the north east Atlantic two stocks are recognised, the western stock spawns in a wide area from Ireland to the Bay of Biscay in the early Spring and moves northward to the southern coats of Norway and the northern North Sea in the summer. The North Sea stock spawns in the southern part of the North Sea during the summer and then migrates northwards into the central North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. Off Mauritania this species has its main spawning season in November to January while the related Cunene horse mackerel (Trachurus trecae) spawns in June and August. Off Ireland spawning occurs irregularly during the summer from June to August reaching its peak in July. The females spawn in batches, each of up to 140,000 eggs and hatching larvae in length. Spawning is indeterminate meaning that the total number of eggs a female can produce is dependent on factors which can change over the course of a spawning season. The eggs and larvae are pelagic. The juveniles of thus species frequently often shoal with the juveniles of other fish species, mainly Atlantic herring (Clupea clupea) and with other species of horse mackerels such as the Mediterranean horse mackerel (T. mediterraneus) and blue jack mackerel (T. picturatus). Juveniles are also often encountered sheltering in the tentacles of jellyfish. In South Africa the maximum recorded age is 24 years while 40 years of age has been recorded in the northeast Atlantic. They are thought to breed from two to four years old for females. Off Mauritania, the juveniles are caught at depths of while mature fish are taken in shallower waters of less than .The age and growth of the Atlantic horse mackerel vary across its extensive range and are affected by the levels to which stocks are exploited. The diet of this species, in both juveniles and adults, is copepods, shrimps, small fishes and squids. An examination of the stomach contents of Atlantic horse mackerels caught in the Aegean Sea recorded a total of 60 different prey species which belonged to five major systematic groups, polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and bony fish. Copepods, Euphasids and Mysids made up the highest percentage of food eaten. Bony fish were the secondmost numerous food ingested, while polychaeta and arrow worms were infrequently recorded food items. The diet showed very little seasonal variation with copepods and mysids making up the largest proportion of prey throughout the year, with fishes being most frequent prey except in the spring. Larger fish, over fed largely on the larvae of bony fishes. No less than 45 species of copeopod were identified in this study, and Acartia clause and Oncea media were numerous and important throughout the year. Crustaceans were the most important prey to be eaten by this species in all seasons, however, bony fish were the most important prey items for larger fish. Abstract Taxonomy and naming The Atlantic horse mackerel is the type species of the genus Trachurus but when Constantine Samuel Rafinesque created the genus in 1810 he used Trachurus saurus as the type species but Carolus Linnaeus had used the name Scomber saurus and had already described Scomber trachurus so Rafinesque's name was invalid. The genus Trachurus is part of the subfamily Caranginae of the family Carangidae, which is the largest family in the order Carangiformes. The generic and specific names are a compound of the Greek trachys meaning \\"rough\\" and oura meaning \\"tail\\", this appears to be an ancient name for horse mackerels, presumably in reference to the spiny scutes on the caudal peduncle. The common name horse mackerel has been said to derive from the belief that other fishes rode on its back but it may derive from the old Dutch word Horsmakreel which means a mackerel which spawns over a shallow or bank, a hors, and this was taken into English as \\"horse mackerel\\". The Cape horse mackerel (Trachurus capensis) is considered to be the subspecies T. trachurus capensis of the Atlantic horse mackerel by some authorities and it is thought that there is no adequate series of these specimens of this taxa along the coast of Africa available to confirm the validity of this taxon. Fisheries Trachurus trachurus catch The Atlantic horse mackerel is fished for commercially using trawls, longlines, purse seines (using artificial light), traps and on line gear. In 1999 the Food and Agriculture Organization stated that the total catch reported to it was 322 207 tonnes with the largest catches being in the Netherlands and in Ireland. There is a total allowable catch (TAC) in the North Sea for this species and landings have consistently been below this level but the TAC is not in line with the scientific advice. There have been calls to create a management plan for the Atlantic horse mackerel in the North Sea but currently there are no specific management objectives for it. The stock needs to be assessed and management objectives should be set before the fishery can be shown to be sustainable. Conservation The IUCN classify the Atlantic horse mackerel as Vulnerable because even if there has been no decline in the population in European waters there have been greater than ninety percent declines off the West African coast which means that this species will have undergone a decline of at least 35-40% decline over the past three generation lengths, which are estimated at 30‚Äì35 years. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) classifies the population of this species as below the safe biological limit for exploitation. The populations are experiencing a slow decline with increased fishing pressure at the maximum sustainable yield since 2006 with low recruitment since 2004. Human uses The Atlantic horse mackerel is consumed fresh. It may be preserved by freezing, salting and drying, smoking and canning. It can be prepared by frying, broiling or baking. The flesh is said to have a pleasant flavour with an oily delicate texture which is a good sourse of omega-3 fatty acids. Nutritionally 100g of the flesh of the Atlantic horse mackerel provides 97 kcal of energy and is made up of: Chicharros en escabeche *Water: 77.4 g *Protein: 19.8 g *Fat: 2 g *Cholesterol: 64.4 mg *Total minerals: 1.3 g *Phosphorus: 224 mg In Iberia it may be prepared as an escabeche while some are exported to Japan as aji to be used in sushi.

By Johannes Hopffe 1585. Sacred mysteries are the areas of supernatural phenomena associated with a divinity or a religious ideology. Sacred mysteries may be either: # Religious beliefs, rituals or practices which are kept secret from non-believers, or lower levels of believers, who have not had an initiation into the higher levels of belief (the concealed knowledge may be called esoteric). # Beliefs of the religion which are public knowledge but cannot be easily explained by normal rational or scientific means. Although the term \\"mystery\\" is not often used in anthropology, access by initiation or rite of passage to otherwise secret beliefs is an extremely common feature of indigenous religions all over the world. A mystagogue or hierophant is a holder and teacher of secret knowledge in the former sense above. Whereas, mysticism may be defined as an area of philosophical or religious thought which focuses on mysteries in the latter sense above. Greco-Roman mysteries The mystery religions of antiquity were religious cults which required initiation of an \\"initiate\\" or new member before they were accepted, and sometimes had different levels of initiation, as well as doctrines which were mysteries in the sense of requiring supernatural explanation. In some, parts of the doctrine were apparently only known to priests. They included the Eleusinian Mysteries, Mithraism, the Cult of Isis, the Cult of Sol Invictus, and the Essenes. Mystery traditions were popular in ancient Greece and during the height of the Roman Empire,Antonio Virgili, Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Roma, Gangemi, 2008 and parts of Early Christianity used secrecy in the same way. Christian mysteries Although the term is not used equally by all Christian traditions, many if not most basic aspects of Christian theology require a supernatural explanation. To name but a few key examples, these include the nature of the Trinity, the virgin birth of Jesus, and the resurrection of Jesus. These are mysteries in the sense that they cannot be explained or apprehended by reason alone. The word mysterion (ŒºœÖœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ) is used 27 times in the New Testament. It denotes not so much the meaning of the modern English term mystery, but rather something that is mystical. In the biblical Greek, the term refers to \\"that which awaits disclosure or interpretation\\".Danker, Frederick William, The Concise Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament (University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 2009, ), Kindle location. 4417. In the Catholic church the Latin term is mysterium fidei, \\"mystery of faith\\", defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1997) to mean a mystery hidden in God, which can never be known unless revealed by God. In the Roman Catholic Church the First Vatican Council re- affirmed the existence of mysteries as a doctrine of Catholic faith as follows: \\"If any one say that in Divine Revelation there are contained no mysteries properly so called (vera et proprie dicta mysteria), but that through reason rightly developed (per rationem rite excultam) all the dogmas of faith can be understood and demonstrated from natural principles: let him be anathema\\" (Sess. III, De fide et ratione, can. i). The position, if not the terminology, of other Christian churches is essentially the same. In parts of the Early Christian Church, many aspects of Christian theology, including some sacraments and sacramentals, the so-called disciplina arcani, were kept hidden from the pagans lest they become objects of ridicule, and were also introduced gradually to catechumens or new converts. As the Age of Persecution ended, the secrecy was gradually relaxed.Discipline of the Secret article in Catholic Encyclopedia But the term continued to be used, and the same word is used in the Eastern Orthodox churches to describe \\"mysteries\\" and \\"sacraments\\". This is not usually so in the West, although theologically many aspects of sacraments are recognized as mysteries in the main sense described above, especially (for those churches accepting it) the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. Hence Pope Paul VI's papal encyclical of 3 September 1965 on the Eucharist was titled, from its opening words, Mysterium fidei. In the Roman Rite Catholic Mass within or immediately after the formula of consecration of the wine, the celebrant says \\"The mystery of faith\\". Originally the term \\"Mystery\\" was used for the sacraments generally in both the East and the West, as shown from the \\"Mystagogical Homilies\\" of St. Cyril of Jerusalem and the work, On the Mysteries by St. Ambrose of Milan.On the Mysteries by St. Ambrose of Milan, Mystagogical Lectures St. Cyril of Jerusalem Although all the official doctrines of Christian churches have long been fully public, the loosely defined area of Christian thought called Christian mysticism often concerns the contemplation of sacred mysteries and may include the development of personal theories about them, undertaken in the knowledge that they can never be fully apprehended by man. =Eastern Christianity= The term is used in Eastern Christianity to refer to what the Western Church currently calls sacraments and sacramentals, terms which the Western Church has carefully defined in canon law. Thus, for instance, the Council of Trent declared there to be exactly seven sacraments. The Eastern Churches, in contrast, have never defined the Mysteries in such precise terms. And, although the Western Church teaches that the consecrated bread and wine of the Eucharist are one sacrament, the Divine Liturgy refers to the Eucharist as the Mysteries, in the plural. Orthodox Christians have always received Holy Communion in both species (both the body and the blood), and even reserve both in the tabernacle. The sacred mysteries can be defined as \\"those holy acts through which the Holy Spirit mysteriously and invisibly confers Grace (the saving power of God) upon man\\".Archpriest Seraphim Slobodskoy, The Law of God (Printshop of St. Job of Pochaev, Jordanville, NY, 1996, ), p. 471. Although Orthodox instructional materials may list seven sacred mysteries, the same as the Western seven sacraments: Baptism, Chrismation (Confirmation), Confession (Penance, Reconciliation or Confession), Holy Communion (Eucharist or Holy Communion), Marriage (Holy Matrimony), Ordination (Holy Orders), and Unction (Anointing of the Sick. Archaic: Extreme Unction) (Western names in parentheses), the term is not limited to these seven. As in the West, all faithful men are expected to receive six of the seven listed above, and may or may not receive either marriage or ordination, or both; women may not be received into the priesthood, but may be given monastic orders. Christian life is centered in the mystery of the incarnation of Christ, the union of God and man. However, the redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through theosis.The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective, (St. John of Kronstadt Press, Liberty, TN, 1986), p. 6. The Sacraments, or Sacred Mysteries are the most important means by which the faithful may obtain union with God, provided they are received with faith after appropriate preparation. Christians believe that God is present everywhere and fills all things by his divine grace, and that all of creation is, in some sense, a \\"sacrament\\". However, they believe that \\"He is more specifically and intensively present in [those] particular and reliable manners which He Himself has established,\\"The Sacramental Life (1986), p. 7. i.e., in the Sacred Mysteries. Other religions and groups In several other religions, knowledge of some esoteric parts of the doctrine or teachings is reserved only for certain members. This has been a feature of Tantric Buddhism, Hinduism, Catharism, some parts of Shia Islam, and the Druze religion. In traditional Judaism, study of much of the mystical tradition of Kabbalah is reserved for scholars. Esotericism is a strong characteristic of many modern movements such as Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, and Scientology.

Founded in 1999, the alliance ceased to exist in 2010 when its remaining members joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. History Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader M. H. M. Ashraff started discussions on forming a new political alliance in 1998. The purpose of the alliance was to bring about unity among Sri Lanka's differing communities. Although initial discussions weren't successful, the alliance was eventually registered with the Department of Elections as a political party on 23 August 1999 with the name National Unity Alliance (NUA). Two political parties were members of the NUA - the SLMC and the Sri Lanka Progressive Front. The aim of the NUA was to create a united Sri Lanka by 2012 and its motto was \\"Mother Lanka wants every citizen ‚Äì All citizens want one Sri Lanka\\". Both the SLMC and the NUA were members of the governing People's Alliance (PA) but by 2000 relations between the SLMC/NUA and PA had become strained. The SLMC/NUA nevertheless contested the 2000 parliamentary election in alliance with PA - in some electoral districts the SLMC fielded candidates under the PA whilst in others it fielded candidates under the NUA. Contesting in 13 electoral districts the NUA received 197,983 votes (2.29%), winning four seats in Parliament. The SLMC also secured seven seats under the PA. During the 2000 election campaign Ashraff was killed in a mysterious helicopter crash on 16 September 2000. Just before his death Ashraff had sent faxes to the media stating that the SLMC and NUA had severed all ties with the PA. Following Ashraff's death Rauff Hakeem became the SLMC's \\"thesiya thalaivar\\" (national leader) but there was a power struggle between Ashraff's widow Ferial Ashraff and Hakeem for control of the SLMC. In June 2001 President Chandrika Kumaratunga dismissed Hakeem from the cabinet. All SLMC/NUA ministers, including Ferial Ashraff, resigned from the government on the instructions of the SLMC leadership. The SLMC leadership also decided that the SLCM should leave the PA and join the opposition. However, Ferial Ashraff remained in the PA as leader of the NUA. Three SLMC MPs loyal to Ashraff - Wimalaweera Dissanayake, U. M. Hanifa and U. L. M. Mohideen - also remained in the PA. Contesting under the PA, the NUA secured two seats in Parliament - Ashraff and M. H. Segu Isadean - at the 2001 parliamentary election. On 20 January 2004 the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) formed the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) as a successor to the PA. The NUA joined the UPFA on 2 February 2004. The NUA contested the 2004 parliamentary election under the UPFA and Ashraff and Isadean retained their seats. After the election Ashraff was appointed as a cabinet minister whilst Isadean became a deputy minister. The alliance became moribund thereafter and in February 2010 Ferial Ashraff and other NUA members joined the SLFP. The alliance was de-registered as a political party in 2012.

They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the Turkic peoples. Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire. In addition, a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe. Turks from the Central Asia settled in Anatolia in the 11th century, through the conquests of the Seljuk Turks. The region then began to transform from a predominantly Greek Christian society into a Turkish Muslim one. The Ottoman Empire came to rule much of the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East (excluding Iran), and North Africa over the course of several centuries. The empire lasted until the end of the First World War, when it was defeated by the Allies and partitioned. Following the Turkish War of Independence that ended with the Turkish National Movement retaking much of the territory lost to the Allies, the Movement abolished the Ottoman sultanate on 1 November 1922 and proclaimed the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923. Not all Ottomans were Muslims and not all Ottoman Muslims were Turks, but by 1923, the majority of people living within the borders of the new Turkish republic identified as Turks. Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a \\"Turk\\" as \\"anyone who is bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship\\". While the legal use of the term \\"Turkish\\" as it pertains to a citizen of Turkey is different from the term's ethnic definition, the majority of the Turkish population (an estimated 70‚Äì75 percent) is of Turkish ethnicity. The vast majority of Turks are Muslims. Etymology and definition The ethnonym \\"Turk\\" may have first been discerned in Herodotus' (c. 484‚Äì425 BC) reference to Targitas, a king of the Scythians;. furthermore, during the first century AD., Pomponius Mela refers to the \\"Turcae\\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \\"Tyrcae\\" among the people of the same area. The first definite references to the \\"Turks\\" mainly come from Chinese sources which date back to the sixth century. In these sources, \\"Turk\\" appears as \\"Tujue\\" (), which referred to the G√∂kt√ºrks... In the 19th century, the word T√ºrk referred to Anatolian peasants. The Ottoman ruling class identified themselves as Ottomans, not as Turks.(Kushner 1997: 219; Meeker 1971: 322) In the late 19th century, as the Ottoman upper classes adopted European ideas of nationalism, the term T√ºrk took on a more positive connotation.(Kushner 1997: 220‚Äì221) During Ottoman times, the millet system defined communities on a religious basis, and today some Turks regard only those who profess the Sunni faith as true Turks. Turkish Jews, Christians, and Alevis are not considered Turks by some.(Meeker 1971: 322) In the early 20th century, the Young Turks abandoned Ottoman nationalism in favor of Turkish nationalism, while adopting the name Turks, which was finally used in the name of the new Turkish Republic. Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a \\"Turk\\" as anyone who is \\"bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship.\\" History =Prehistory, Ancient era and Early Middle Ages= Anatolia was first inhabited by hunter-gatherers during the Paleolithic era, and in antiquity was inhabited by various ancient Anatolian peoples.. After Alexander the Great's conquest in 334 BC, the area was Hellenized, and by the first century BC it is generally thought that the native Anatolian languages, themselves earlier newcomers to the area, as a result of the Indo-European migrations, became extinct. The early Turkic peoples lived somewhere between Central Asia and northwest China, with genetic data pointing to southern Mongolia and northern China, as a semi-agricultural group, but later started their expansion with a predominantly nomadic life style. In Central Asia, the earliest surviving Turkic-language texts, found on the eighth-century Orkhon inscription monuments, were erected by the G√∂kt√ºrks in the sixth century CE, and include words not common to Turkic but found in unrelated Inner Asian languages. Although the ancient Turks were nomadic, they traded wool, leather, carpets, and horses for wood, silk, vegetables and grain, as well as having large ironworking stations in the south of the Altai Mountains during the 600s CE. Most of the Turkic peoples were followers of Tengrism, sharing the cult of the sky god Tengri, although there were also adherents of Manichaeism, Nestorian Christianity and Buddhism.Frederik Coene, The Caucasus-An Introduction, p.77 Taylor & Francis, 2009 However, during the Muslim conquests, the Turks entered the Muslim world proper as slaves, the booty of Arab raids and conquests. The Turks began converting to Islam after the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana through the efforts of missionaries, Sufis, and merchants. Although initiated by the Arabs, the conversion of the Turks to Islam was filtered through Persian and Central Asian culture. Under the Umayyads, most were domestic servants, whilst under the Abbasid Caliphate, increasing numbers were trained as soldiers. By the ninth century, Turkish commanders were leading the caliphs‚Äô Turkish troops into battle. As the Abbasid Caliphate declined, Turkish officers assumed more military and political power by taking over or establishing provincial dynasties with their own corps of Turkish troops. =Seljuk era= During the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks, who were influenced by Persian civilization in many ways, grew in strength and succeeded in taking the eastern province of the Abbasid Empire. By 1055, the Seljuks captured Baghdad and began to make their first incursions into Anatolia.. When they won the Battle of Manzikert against the Byzantine Empire in 1071, it opened the gates of Anatolia to them.. Although ethnically Turkish, the Seljuk Turks appreciated and became carriers of Persian culture rather than Turkish culture... Nonetheless, the Turkish language and Islam were introduced and gradually spread over the region and the slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway. In dire straits, the Byzantine Empire turned to the West for help, setting in motion the pleas that led to the First Crusade.. Once the Crusaders took Iznik, the Seljuk Turks established the Sultanate of Rum from their new capital, Konya, in 1097. By the 12th century, Europeans had begun to call the Anatolian region \\"Turchia\\" or \\"Turkey\\", the land of the Turks.. The Turkish society in Anatolia was divided into urban, rural and nomadic populations;. other Turkoman (Turkmen) tribes who had arrived into Anatolia at the same time as the Seljuks kept their nomadic ways. These tribes were more numerous than the Seljuks, and rejecting the sedentary lifestyle, adhered to an Islam impregnated with animism and shamanism from their central Asian steppeland origins, which then mixed with new Christian influences. From this popular and syncretist Islam, with its mystical and revolutionary aspects, sects such as the Alevis and Bektashis emerged. Furthermore, intermarriage between the Turks and local inhabitants, as well as the conversion of many to Islam, also increased the Turkish-speaking Muslim population in Anatolia. By 1243, at the Battle of K√∂se Daƒü, the Mongols defeated the Seljuk Turks and became the new rulers of Anatolia, and in 1256, the second Mongol invasion of Anatolia caused widespread destruction. Particularly after 1277, political stability within the Seljuk territories rapidly disintegrated, leading to the strengthening of Turkoman principalities in the western and southern parts of Anatolia called the \\"beyliks\\".. =Beyliks era= A map of the independent beyliks in Anatolia during the early 1300s. When the Mongols defeated the Seljuk Turks and conquered Anatolia, the Turks became the vassals of the Ilkhans who established their own empire in the vast area which stretched from present-day Afghanistan to present-day Turkey. As the Mongols occupied more lands in Asia Minor, the Turks moved further into western Anatolia and settled in the Seljuk-Byzantine frontier.. By the last decades of the 13th century, the Ilkhans and their Seljuk vassals lost control over much of Anatolia to these Turkoman peoples. A number of Turkish lords managed to establish themselves as rulers of various principalities, known as \\"Beyliks\\" or emirates. Amongst these beyliks, along the Aegean coast, from north to south, stretched the beyliks of Karasi, Saruhan, Aydin, Mente≈üe and Teke. Inland from Teke was Hamid and east of Karasi was the beylik of Germiyan. To the north-west of Anatolia, around S√∂ƒü√ºt, was the small and, at this stage, insignificant, Ottoman beylik. It was hemmed in to the east by other more substantial powers like Karaman on Iconium, which ruled from the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak River to the Mediterranean. Although the Ottomans were only a small principality among the numerous Turkish beyliks, and thus posed the smallest threat to the Byzantine authority, their location in north-western Anatolia, in the former Byzantine province of Bithynia, became a fortunate position for their future conquests. The Latins, who had conquered the city of Constantinople in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, established a Latin Empire (1204‚Äì61), divided the former Byzantine territories in the Balkans and the Aegean among themselves, and forced the Byzantine Emperors into exile at Nicaea (present-day Iznik). From 1261 onwards, the Byzantines were largely preoccupied with regaining their control in the Balkans. Toward the end of the 13th century, as Mongol power began to decline, the Turcoman chiefs assumed greater independence.. =Ottoman Empire= The Ottoman Empire was a Turkish empire that lasted from 1299 to 1922. Ottoman territories during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, in 1923, produced waves of Turkish refugees, who were known as \\"Muhacirs\\", who fled from hostile regions of the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Aegean islands, the island of Cyprus, the Sanjak of Alexandretta, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union to migrate to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace. Under its founder, Osman I, the nomadic Ottoman beylik expanded along the Sakarya River and westward towards the Sea of Marmara. Thus, the population of western Asia Minor had largely become Turkish-speaking and Muslim in religion. It was under his son, Orhan I, who had attacked and conquered the important urban center of Bursa in 1326, proclaiming it as the Ottoman capital, that the Ottoman Empire developed considerably. In 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe and established a foothold on the Gallipoli Peninsula while at the same time pushing east and taking Ankara... Many Turks from Anatolia began to settle in the region which had been abandoned by the inhabitants who had fled Thrace before the Ottoman invasion.. However, the Byzantines were not the only ones to suffer from the Ottoman advance for, in the mid-1330s, Orhan annexed the Turkish beylik of Karasi. This advancement was maintained by Murad I who more than tripled the territories under his direct rule, reaching some , evenly distributed in Europe and Asia Minor.. Gains in Anatolia were matched by those in Europe; once the Ottoman forces took Edirne (Adrianople), which became the capital of the Ottoman Empire in 1365, they opened their way into Bulgaria and Macedonia in 1371 at the Battle of Maritsa.. With the conquests of Thrace, Macedonia, and Bulgaria, significant numbers of Turkish emigrants settled in these regions. This form of Ottoman-Turkish colonization became a very effective method to consolidate their position and power in the Balkans. The settlers consisted of soldiers, nomads, farmers, artisans and merchants, dervishes, preachers and other religious functionaries, and administrative personnel.. In 1453, Ottoman armies, under Sultan Mehmed II, conquered Constantinople. Mehmed reconstructed and repopulated the city, and made it the new Ottoman capital.. After the Fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire entered a long period of conquest and expansion with its borders eventually going deep into Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.. Selim I dramatically expanded the empire's eastern and southern frontiers in the Battle of Chaldiran and gained recognition as the guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.. His successor, Suleiman the Magnificent, further expanded the conquests after capturing Belgrade in 1521 and using its territorial base to conquer Hungary, and other Central European territories, after his victory in the Battle of Moh√°cs as well as also pushing the frontiers of the empire to the east.. Following Suleiman's death, Ottoman victories continued, albeit less frequently than before. The island of Cyprus was conquered, in 1571, bolstering Ottoman dominance over the sea routes of the eastern Mediterranean.. However, after its defeat at the Battle of Vienna, in 1683, the Ottoman army was met by ambushes and further defeats; the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz, which granted Austria the provinces of Hungary and Transylvania, marked the first time in history that the Ottoman Empire actually relinquished territory.. By the 19th century, the empire began to decline when ethno- nationalist uprisings occurred across the empire. Thus, the last quarter of the 19th and the early part of the 20th century saw some 7‚Äì9 million Muslim refugees (Turks and some Circassians, Bosnians, Georgians, etc.) from the lost territories of the Caucasus, Crimea, Balkans, and the Mediterranean islands migrate to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace.. By 1913, the government of the Committee of Union and Progress started a program of forcible Turkification of non-Turkish minorities. By 1914, the World War I broke out, and the Turks scored some success in Gallipoli during the Battle of the Dardanelles in 1915. During World War I, the government of the Committee of Union and Progress continued to implement its Turkification policies, which affected non-Turkish minorities, such as the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide and the Greeks during various campaigns of ethnic cleansing and expulsion. In 1918, the Ottoman Government agreed to the Mudros Armistice with the Allies. The Treaty of S√®vres ‚Äîsigned in 1920 by the government of Mehmet VI‚Äî dismantled the Ottoman Empire. The Turks, under Mustafa Kemal, rejected the treaty and fought the Turkish War of Independence, resulting in the abortion of that text, never ratified, and the abolition of the Sultanate. Thus, the 623-year-old Ottoman Empire ended.. =Modern era= Once Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk led the Turkish War of Independence against the Allied forces that occupied the former Ottoman Empire, he united the Turkish Muslim majority and successfully led them from 1919 to 1922 in overthrowing the occupying forces out of what the Turkish National Movement considered the Turkish homeland.. The Turkish identity became the unifying force when, in 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed and the newly founded Republic of Turkey was formally established. Atat√ºrk's presidency was marked by a series of radical political and social reforms that transformed Turkey into a secular, modern republic with civil and political equality for sectarian minorities and women.. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Turks, as well as other Muslims, from the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Aegean islands, the island of Cyprus, the Sanjak of Alexandretta (Hatay), the Middle East, and the Soviet Union continued to arrive in Turkey, most of whom settled in urban north-western Anatolia.. The bulk of these immigrants, known as \\"Muhacirs\\", were the Balkan Turks who faced harassment and discrimination in their homelands. However, there were still remnants of a Turkish population in many of these countries because the Turkish government wanted to preserve these communities so that the Turkish character of these neighbouring territories could be maintained.. One of the last stages of ethnic Turks immigrating to Turkey was between 1940 and 1990 when about 700,000 Turks arrived from Bulgaria. Today, between a third and a quarter of Turkey's population are the descendants of these immigrants. Geographic distribution =Traditional areas of Turkish settlement= Turkey Turkish people in Istanbul In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuks began settling in the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, beginning the enlargement of their empire and sphere of influence in Anatolia; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Anatolia and gradually spread over the region.Melek Tekin: T√ºrk Tarihi Ansiklopedisi, Milliyet yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991, p. 237. The slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway. Ethnic Turks make up between 70% to 75% of Turkey's population. Cyprus The Turkish Cypriots are the ethnic Turks whose Ottoman Turkish forebears colonised the island of Cyprus in 1571. About 30,000 Turkish soldiers were given land once they settled in Cyprus, which bequeathed a significant Turkish community. In 1960, a census by the new Republic's government revealed that the Turkish Cypriots formed 18.2% of the island's population.. However, once inter- communal fighting and ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974 occurred between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots, known as the \\"Cyprus conflict\\", the Greek Cypriot government conducted a census in 1973, albeit without the Turkish Cypriot populace. A year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the Turkish Cypriot population was 118,000 (or 18.4%).. A coup d'√©tat in Cyprus on 15 July 1974 by Greeks and Greek Cypriots favouring union with Greece (also known as \\"Enosis\\") was followed by military intervention by Turkey whose troops established Turkish Cypriot control over the northern part of the island. Hence, census's conducted by the Republic of Cyprus have excluded the Turkish Cypriot population that had settled in the unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Between 1975 and 1981, Turkey encouraged its own citizens to settle in Northern Cyprus; a report by CIA suggests that 200,000 of the residents of Cyprus are Turkish. Balkans Turkish population in Bulgaria Ethnic Turks continue to inhabit certain regions of Greece, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Romania, and Bulgaria since they first settled there during Ottoman period. =Modern diaspora= Western Europe The Turks in Germany number about 4 million,.. which constitutes the largest Turkish community in Western Europe, as well as the largest within the Turkish diaspora. After World War II, West Germany began to experience its greatest economic boom (\\"Wirtschaftswunder\\") and in 1961 invited the Turks as guest workers (\\"Gastarbeiter\\") to make up for the shortage of workers. The concept of the Gastarbeiter continued with Turkey bearing agreements with Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands in 1964, with France in 1965; and with Sweden in 1967.. Current estimates suggests that there are approximately 9 million Turks living in Europe, excluding those who live in the European part of Turkey.. Modern immigration of Turks to Western Europe began with Turkish Cypriots migrating to the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when the British Empire annexed Cyprus in 1914 and the residents of Cyprus became subjects of the Crown. However, Turkish Cypriot migration increased significantly in the 1940s and 1950s due to the Cyprus conflict. Conversely, in 1944, Turks who were forcefully deported from Meskheti in Georgia during the Second World War, known as the Meskhetian Turks, settled in Eastern Europe (especially in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine). By the early 1960s, migration to Western and Northern Europe increased significantly from Turkey when Turkish \\"guest workers\\" arrived under a \\"Labour Export Agreement\\" with Germany in 1961, followed by a similar agreement with the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria in 1964; France in 1965; and Sweden in 1967... More recently, Bulgarian Turks, Romanian Turks, and Western Thrace Turks have also migrated to Western Europe. North America Compared to Turkish immigration to Europe, migration to North America has been relatively small. According to the US Census Bureau 196,222 Americans in 2013 were of Turkish descent. However, the actual number of Turks is considerably larger, as a significant number of ethnic Turks have migrated to North America not just from Turkey but also from the Balkans (such as Bulgaria and North Macedonia), Cyprus, and the former Soviet Union.. Hence, the Turkish American community is currently estimated to number about 500,000. Regarding the Turkish Canadian community, Statistics Canada reports that 63,955 Canadians in the 2016 census listed \\"Turk\\" as an ethnic origin, including those who listed more than one origin. The largest concentration of Turkish Americans are in New York City, and Rochester, New York; Washington, D.C.; and Detroit, Michigan. The majority of Turkish Canadians live in Ontario, mostly in Toronto, and there is also a sizable Turkish community in Montreal, Quebec. With regards to the 2010 United States Census, the U.S government was determined to get an accurate count of the American population by reaching segments, such as the Turkish community, that are considered hard to count, a good portion of which falls under the category of foreign-born immigrants. The Assembly of Turkish American Associations and the US Census Bureau formed a partnership to spearhead a national campaign to count people of Turkish origin with an organisation entitled \\"Census 2010 SayTurk\\" (which has a double meaning in Turkish, \\"Say\\" means \\"to count\\" and \\"to respect\\") to identify the estimated 500,000 Turks now living in the United States. Oceania A notable scale of Turkish migration to Australia began in the late 1940s when Turkish Cypriots began to leave the island of Cyprus for economic reasons, and then, during the Cyprus conflict, for political reasons, marking the beginning of a Turkish Cypriot immigration trend to Australia. The Turkish Cypriot community were the only Muslims acceptable under the White Australia Policy; many of these early immigrants found jobs working in factories, out in the fields, or building national infrastructure. In 1967, the governments of Australia and Turkey signed an agreement to allow Turkish citizens to immigrate to Australia. Prior to this recruitment agreement, there were fewer than 3,000 people of Turkish origin in Australia. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, nearly 19,000 Turkish immigrants arrived from 1968 to 1974. They came largely from rural areas of Turkey, approximately 30% were skilled and 70% were unskilled workers. However, this changed in the 1980s when the number of skilled Turks applying to enter Australia had increased considerably. Over the next 35 years the Turkish population rose to almost 100,000. More than half of the Turkish community settled in Victoria, mostly in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne. According to the 2006 Australian Census, 59,402 people claimed Turkish ancestry; however, this does not show a true reflection of the Turkish Australian community as it is estimated that between 40,000 and 120,000 Turkish Cypriots and 150,000 to 200,000 mainland Turks live in Australia. Furthermore, there has also been ethnic Turks who have migrated to Australia from Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq, and North Macedonia. Former Soviet Union The Turkish presence in the Meskheti region of Georgia began with the Turkish military expedition of 1578.. However, due to the ordered deportation of over 115,000 Meskhetian Turks from their homeland in 1944, during the Second World War, the majority settled in Central Asia.. According to the 1989 Soviet Census, which was the last Soviet Census, 106,000 Meskhetian Turks lived in Uzbekistan, 50,000 in Kazakhstan, and 21,000 in Kyrgyzstan. However, in 1989, the Meshetian Turks who had settled in Uzbekistan became the target of a pogrom in the Fergana valley, which was the principal destination for Meskhetian Turkish deportees, after an uprising of nationalism by the Uzbeks. The riots had left hundreds of Turks dead or injured and nearly 1,000 properties were destroyed; thus, thousands of Meskhetian Turks were forced into renewed exile. The majority of Meskhetian Turks, about 70,000, went to Azerbaijan, whilst the remainder went to various regions of Russia (especially Krasnodar Krai), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine.. Soviet authorities recorded many Meskhetian Turks as belonging to other nationalities such as \\"Azeri\\", \\"Kazakh\\", \\"Kyrgyz\\", and \\"Uzbek\\". Hence, official census's have not shown a true reflection of the Turkish population; for example, according to the 2009 Azerbaijani census, there were 38,000 Turks living in the country; yet in 1999, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated that there were 100,000 Meskhetian Turks living in the country.. Furthermore, in 2001, the Baku Institute of Peace and Democracy suggested that there was between 90,000 and 110,000 Meskhetian Turks living in Azerbaijan. Culture =Arts and Architecture= Safranbolu was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1994 due to its well-preserved Ottoman era houses and architecture. Turkish architecture reached its peak during the Ottoman period. Ottoman architecture, influenced by Seljuk, Byzantine and Islamic architecture, came to develop a style all of its own. Overall, Ottoman architecture has been described as a synthesis of the architectural traditions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. As Turkey successfully transformed from the religion-based former Ottoman Empire into a modern nation-state with a very strong separation of state and religion, an increase in the modes of artistic expression followed. During the first years of the republic, the government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts; such as museums, theatres, opera houses and architecture. Diverse historical factors play important roles in defining the modern Turkish identity. Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a \\"modern\\" Western state, while maintaining traditional religious and historical values. The mix of cultural influences is dramatized, for example, in the form of the \\"new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures\\" enacted in the works of Orhan Pamuk, recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature. Traditional Turkish music include Turkish folk music (Halk m√ºziƒüi), Fasƒ±l and Ottoman classical music (Sanat m√ºziƒüi) that originates from the Ottoman court. Contemporary Turkish music include Turkish pop music, rock, and Turkish hip hop genres. =Science= =Notable individuals= Notable individuals include Nureddin, Yunus Emre, Takiy√ºddin, ≈ûerafeddin Sabuncuoƒülu, B√¢k√Æ, Hay√¢l√Æ, Haji Bektash Veli, Ali Ku≈ü√ßu, Hez√¢rfen Ahmed √áelebi, Lag√¢ri Hasan √áelebi, Piri Reis, Namƒ±k Kemal, ƒ∞brahim ≈ûinasi, H√ºseyin Avni Lifij, Faik Ali Ozansoy, Mimar Kemaleddin, ƒ∞≈ütirak√ßi Hilmi, Mustafa Suphi, Ethem Nejat, Halid Ziya U≈üaklƒ±gil, Rƒ±za Tevfik B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ±, Latife U≈ü≈üaki, Feriha Tevfik, Fatma Aliye Topuz, Keriman Halis Ece, Zeki Rƒ±za Sporel, Cahide Sonku, S√ºleyman Seyyid, Abd√ºlhak H√¢mid Tarhan, Besim √ñmer Akalƒ±n, Orhan Veli Kanƒ±k, Abidin Dino, Ahmet Ziya Akbulut, Nazmi Ziya G√ºran, Tanburi B√ºy√ºk Osman Bey, Vecihi H√ºrku≈ü, Bedriye Tahir, Halide Edib Adƒ±var, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, Mehmet Emin Yurdakul, Tevfik Fikret, N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet, Hulusi Beh√ßet, Nuri Demiraƒü, Fahrelnissa Zeid, Leyla Gencer, Ahmet Erteg√ºn, Metin Oktay, Fikri Alican, Feza G√ºrsey, Ismail Akbay, Oktay Sinanoƒülu, Gazi Ya≈üargil, Behram Kur≈üunoƒülu, Fethullah G√ºlen, Mehmet √ñz, Tansu √áiller, Cahit Arf, Muhtar Kent, Efe Aydan, Neslihan Demir, Orhan Pamuk and Aziz Sancar. =Language= Atat√ºrk introducing the Turkish alphabet to the people of Kayseri. 20 September 1928. (Cover of the French L'Illustration magazine) The Turkish language also known as Istanbul Turkish is a southern Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. It is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey, Balkans, the island of Cyprus, Meskhetia, and other areas of traditional settlement that formerly, in whole or part, belonged to the Ottoman Empire. Turkish is the official language of Turkey. In the Balkans, Turkish is still spoken by Turkish minorities who still live there, especially in Bulgaria, Greece (mainly in Western Thrace), Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania (mainly in Dobruja) and the Republic of Moldova (mainly in Gagauzia).. The Turkish language was introduced to Cyprus with the Ottoman conquest in 1571 and became the politically dominant, prestigious language, of the administration.. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the Latin alphabet to replace the Arabic alphabet based Ottoman script. Over time, this change, together with changes in Turkey's system of education, would lead to more widespread literacy in the country.Lester 1997; Wolf-Gazo 1996 Modern standard Turkish is based on the dialect of Istanbul. Nonetheless, dialectal variation persists, in spite of the levelling influence of the standard used in mass media and the Turkish education system since the 1930s.. The terms aƒüƒ±z or ≈üive often refer to the different types of Turkish dialects. There are three major Anatolian Turkish dialect groups spoken in Turkey: the West Anatolian dialect (roughly to the west of the Euphrates), the East Anatolian dialect (to the east of the Euphrates), and the North East Anatolian group, which comprises the dialects of the Eastern Black Sea coast, such as Trabzon, Rize, and the littoral districts of Artvin... The Balkan Turkish dialects are considerably closer to standard Turkish and do not differ significantly from it, despite some contact phenomena, especially in the lexicon.. In the post-Ottoman period, Cypriot Turkish was relatively isolated from standard Turkish and had strong influences by the Cypriot Greek dialect. The condition of coexistence with the Greek Cypriots led to a certain bilingualism whereby Turkish Cypriots knowledge of Greek was important in areas where the two communities lived and worked together.. The linguistic situation changed radically in 1974, when the island was divided into a Greek south and a Turkish north (Northern Cyprus). Today, the Cypriot Turkish dialect is being exposed to increasing standard Turkish through immigration from Turkey, new mass media, and new educational institutions. The Meskhetian Turks speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish, which hails from the regions of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin. The Meskhetian Turkish dialect has also borrowed from other languages (including Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Russian, and Uzbek), which the Meskhetian Turks have been in contact with during the Russian and Soviet rule. =Religion= According to the CIA factbook, 99.8% of the population in Turkey is Muslim, most of them being Sunni (Hanafi). The remaining 0.2% is mostly Christian and Jewish. There are also some estimated 10 to 15 million Alevi Muslims in Turkey. Christians in Turkey include Assyrians/Syriacs, Armenians, and Greeks.Religious Freedom Report U.S. Department of State. Retrieved 15 September 2009. Jewish people in Turkey include those that descend from Sephardic Jews who escaped Spain in 15th century and Greek- speaking Jews from Byzantine times. There is an ethnic Turkish Protestant Christian community most of them came from recent Muslim Turkish backgrounds, rather than from ethnic minorities. According to KONDA research, only 9.7% of the population described themselves as \\"fully devout,\\" while 52.8% described themselves as \\"religious.\\" 69.4% of the respondents reported that they or their wives cover their heads (1.3% reporting chador), although this rate decreases in several demographics: 53% in ages 18‚Äì28, 27.5% in university graduates, 16.1% in masters-or-higher-degree holders. Turkey has also been a secular state since the republican era. According to a poll, 90% of respondents said the country should be defined as secular in the new Constitution that is being written. Genetics The largest autosomal study of Turkish genetics (on 16 individuals) concluded that the Turkish population form a cluster with Southern European populations and that the East Asian (presumably Central Asian) legacy to the Turkish people is estimated to be 21.7%.Alkan et al. (2014), BMC Genomics 2014, 15:963, Whole genome sequencing of Turkish genomes reveals functional private alleles and impact of genetic interactions with Europe, Asia and Africa A study in 2015 found that \\"Previous genetic studies have generally used Turks as representatives of ancient populations from Turkey. Our results show that Turks are genetically shifted towards modern Central Asians, a pattern consistent with a history of mixture with populations from this region\\". The authors found \\"7.9% (¬±0.4) East Asian ancestry in Turks from admixture occurring 800 (¬±170) years ago.\\" A 2019 study found that Turkish people cluster with Southern and Mediterranean Europe populations along with groups in the northern part of Southwest Asia (such as the populations from Caucasus, Northern Iraq, and Iranians). Another study found the Circassians are closest to the Turkish population among sampled European (French, Italian, Sardinian), Middle Eastern (Druze, Palestinian), and Central (Kyrgyz, Hazara, Uygur), South (Pakistani), and East Asian (Mongolian, Han) populations. Another 2019 study found that Turkish people have the lowest Fst distance with Caucasus population group and Iranian-Syrian group, compared to East-Central European, European (including Northern and Eastern European), Sardinian, Roma, and Turkmen groups or populations. Caucasus group in the study included samples from \\"Abkhazians, Adygey, Armenians, Balkars, Chechens, Georgians, Kumyks, Kurds, Lezgins, Nogays, and North Ossetia.\\" A study involving mitochondrial analysis of a Byzantine-era population, whose samples were gathered from excavations in the archaeological site of Sagalassos, found that the Byzantine population of Sagalassos might have left a genetic signature in the modern Turkish populations. Modern-day samples from the nearby town of Aƒülasun showed that lineages of East Eurasian descent assigned to macro-haplogroup M were found in the modern samples from Aƒülasun. This haplogroup is significantly more frequent in Aƒülasun (15%) than in Byzantine Sagalassos. One study found that results pointed out that language (Turkish) in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people, which means there was no elite assimilation in Anatolia.http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf Notes References Bibliography * . * . * * . * . * * . * * . * . * . * . * . * * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . *. * .  * . * . * . * . * . * * . * .  . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * * . * . * . * . * .  . * . * . * . * . * .  * . * . * .  . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * * . * . * . * Wolf-Gazo, Ernest.

While technically serving the Ilkhan Abu Sa'id, he was the effective power behind the throne. He therefore divided up Persia between himself and his sons.

Extern ministers were individually nominated by D√°il √âireann (the lower house), whereas of the Executive Council only the President was: he in turn nominated the other members. All ministers were formally appointed by the Governor-General. The Executive Council included the senior ministers, exercised cabinet collective responsibility, and had to be TDs (members of the D√°il); the extern ministers filled more junior technocratic roles, and need not be legislators, though in fact all were TDs. In practice, all ministers formed a united administration, and no extern ministers were appointed after 1927. Origins James G. Douglas, chair of the constitution drafting committee, proposed extern ministers on the model of the Swiss Federal Council.Mansergh 1934, pp.158‚Äì160; Cahillane 2016 p.128 Leo Kohn suggested a precursor was the \\"Directors\\" created outside the 1919 D√°il Cabinet by the First D√°il, but Nicholas Mansergh disagreed and Brian Farrell felt the 1919 model was UK junior ministers (parliamentary secretaries). The idea of extern ministers was first mooted as a way of placating republicans opposed to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty on which the Free State was founded. It would have allowed republicans to hold ministries in a national unity government without their having to take the Oath of Allegiance which the Treaty required of members the Oireachtas (parliament). The draft constitution provided for an Executive Council of twelve, of whom four, including the President and Vice President, must be members of the D√°il; of the other eight, at most three might be members of the D√°il or Seanad (upper house).Malone 1929, p.369 However, British government objections meant the proposal was altered, and extern ministers were required to take the Oath and, though nominated by the D√°il, were appointed by the Governor General. These monarchist changes were unacceptable to republicans. Nevertheless, as introduced, it still was hoped that extern ministers might be independent non-party figures, possibly non-politicians, who were not even members of the Oireachtas. The Third D√°il as a constituent assembly passed a resolution on 6 October 1922 which stated in part: :That this House approves as a general principle, of the proposal that certain Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council, nominated by the D√°il, and individually responsible to the D√°il alone for the departments respectively under their charge, need not be members of the D√°il A committee was formed to draft corresponding articles for the Constitution, and subsequently another committee nominated ministers for relevant departments. Constitutional provisions W.T. Cosgrave His government abandoned using extern ministers in 1927. The relevant provisions were articles 55 and 56 of the Constitution: ;Article 55.: Ministers who shall not be members of the Executive Council may be appointed by the Representative of the Crown [Governor General], and shall comply with the provisions of Article 17 of this Constitution [i.e. take the oath of allegiance]. Every such Minister shall be nominated by D√°il Eireann on the recommendation of a Committee of D√°il Eireann chosen by a method to be determined by D√°il Eireann, so as to be impartially representative of D√°il Eireann. Should a recommendation not be acceptable to D√°il Eireann, the Committee may continue to recommend names until one is found acceptable. The total number of Ministers, including the Ministers of the Executive Council, shall not exceed twelve. ;Article 56.: Every Minister who is not a member of the Executive Council shall be the responsible head of the Department or Departments under his charge, and shall be individually responsible to D√°il Eireann alone for the administration of the Department or Departments of which he is the head: Provided that should arrangements for Functional or Vocational Councils be made by the Oireachtas these Ministers or any of them may, should the Oireachtas so decide, be members of, and be recommended to D√°il Eireann by, such Councils. The term of office of any Minister, not a member of the Executive Council, shall be the term of D√°il Eireann existing at the time of his appointment, but he shall continue in office until his successor shall have been appointed, and no such Minister shall be removed from office during his term otherwise than by D√°il Eireann itself, and then for stated reasons, and after the proposal to remove him has been submitted to a Committee, chosen by a method to be determined by D√°il Eireann, so as to be impartially representative of D√°il Eireann, and the Committee has reported thereon. Implementation and abandonment The portfolios to which extern ministers were appointed were Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Minister for Lands and Agriculture, Minister for Fisheries, and Minister for Local Government and Public Health. Although extern ministers were appointed from 1922 until 1927, in reality they formed a single Cumann na nGaedheal government with the Executive Council, rather than being independent of it. No extern minister was chosen from outside the D√°il; nor from the opposition (Labour, Farmers' Party, or independents) despite the requirement to be \\"impartially representative of D√°il Eireann\\".Malone 1929, pp.373‚Äì4 The corporatist vocational councils mentioned in Article 56 were never created. The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 required that the parliamentary secretary of an extern minister be a member of the D√°il, whereas Executive Council ministers' parliamentary secretary were permitted to be from either house of the Oireachtas. In fact, only D√°il deputies were ever appointed.Coakley 2010, p.15 fn.14 The Annual Report of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for the year 1921 (delayed by the Civil War) was submitted by the Minister for Agriculture, Patrick J. Hogan, on 22 February 1923 to the Executive Council for transmission to the Governor General. Labour leader Thomas Johnson objected that, as an extern minister, Hogan should have submitted the report to the D√°il rather than the Executive Council; Hogan agreed that it had been a mistake. The Constitution (Amendment No. 5) Act, 1927 increased the maximum size of the Executive Council from seven to twelve. Thereafter, since twelve was the maximum total number of Ministers, there was no point in a TD being an extern minister rather than a member of the Executive Council. The amendment was enacted just before the June 1927 general election, and the subsequent Executive Council included the portfolios previously assigned to extern ministers. Although there was still the possibility of a senator or non- legislator being appointed extern minister, senators objected that Amendment No. 5 made a senator minister less likely. The Constitution (Amendment No. 15) Act, 1929 allowed a senator to be a member of the Executive Council. The 1937 Constitution requires ministers to be members of the Oireachtas.Constitution of Ireland, Article 28.7 The Constitutional Convention in 2013 recommended allowing non-legislators to become ministers; Enda Kenny rejected this, on the basis that someone nominated to the Senate by the Taoiseach could become a minister. This has happened twice: Se√°n Moylan in 1957 and James Dooge in 1981‚Äì1982.

A secure telephone is a telephone that provides voice security in the form of end-to-end encryption for the telephone call, and in some cases also the mutual authentication of the call parties, protecting them against a man-in-the-middle attack. Concerns about massive growth of telephone tapping incidents led to growing demand for secure telephones. The practical availability of secure telephones is restricted by several factors; notably politics, export issues, incompatibility between different products (the devices on each side of the call have to use the same protocol), and high (though recently decreasing) price of the devices.  Well known products  The best-known product on the US government market is the STU-III family. However, this system has now been replaced by the Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) and SCIP standards which defines specifications for the design of equipment to secure both data and voice. The SCIP standard was developed by the NSA and the US DOD to derive more interoperability between secure communication equipment. A new family of standard secure phones has been created based on Philip Zimmermann's VoIP encryption standard ZRTP.  VoIP and direct connection phones  As the popularity of VoIP grows, secure telephony is becoming more widely used. Many major hardware and software providers offer it as a standard feature at no extra cost. Examples include the Gizmo5 and Twinkle. Both of the former work with offerings from the founder of PGP, Phil Zimmermann, and his VoIP secure protocol, ZRTP. ZRTP is implemented in, amongst others, Ripcord Networks product SecurePC with up to NSA Suite B compliant Elliptic Curve math libraries. ZRTP is also being made available for mobile GSM CSD as a new standard for non-VoIP secure calls. The U.S. National Security Agency is developing a secure phone based on Google's Android called Fishbowl.  Historically significant products  SIGSALY exhibit at the National Cryptologic Museum Scramblers were used to secure voice traffic during World War II, but were often intercepted and decoded due to scrambling's inherent insecurity. The first true secure telephone was SIGSALY, a massive device that weighed over 50 tons. NSA, formed after World War II, developed a series of secure telephones, including the STU I, STU II and STU-III, as well as voice encryption devices for military telephones. In 1989 an Irish company called Intrepid developed one of the most advanced secure phones. Called Milcode, the phone was the first to implement code- excited linear prediction (or CELP) which dramatically improved voice quality and user operability over previous LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) and LPC-10e versions. Milcode also boasted significantly higher levels of security than previous secure telephones. The base model offered a proprietary encryption algorithm with a key length of 512 bits, and a more advanced model with a key length of 1024 bits. Key exchange used a public key, based on Diffie-Hellman, as opposed to a plug-in datakey. A new key was generated for each phone call. Milcode was also able to encrypt fax and data and was electromagnetically shielded to NATO TEMPEST standards. Other products of historical significance are PGPfone and Nautilus (designed as a non-key escrow alternative to Clipper, now officially discontinued, but still available on SourceForge), SpeakFreely, and the security VoIP protocol wrapper Zfone developed by the creator of PGP. Scrambling, generally using a form of voice inversion, was available from electronic hobbyist kit suppliers and is common on FRS radios. Analog scrambling is still used, as some telecommunications circuits, such as HF links and telephone lines in the developing world, are of very low quality.

World Food Day is an international day celebrated every year worldwide on 16 October to commemorate the date of the founding of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 1945. The day is celebrated widely by many other organizations concerned with hunger and food security, including the World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. WFP received the Nobel Prize in Peace for 2020 for their efforts to combat hunger, contribute to peace in conflict areas, and for playing a leading role in stopping the use of hunger in the form of a weapon for war and conflict. The World Food Day theme for 2014 was Family Farming: \\"Feeding the world, caring for the earth\\"; in 2015 it was \\"Social Protection and Agriculture: Breaking the Cycle of Rural Poverty\\"; in 2016 it is Climate Change: \\"Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too\\",UN's World Food Day website, accessed 15 September 2016 which echoes the theme of 2008, and of 2002 and 1989 before that. The theme of 2020 is ‚ÄúGrow, nourish, sustain. Together. Our actions are our future.‚Äù. Origins U.S. National Committee for World Food Day offices in Washington, D.C. World Food Day (WFD) was established by FAO's Member Countries at the Organization's 20th General Conference in November 1979. The Hungarian Delegation, led by the former Hungarian Minister of Agriculture and Food Dr. P√°l Rom√°ny, played an active role at the 20th Session of the FAO Conference and suggested the idea of celebrating the WFD worldwide. It has since been observed every year in more than 150 countries, raising awareness of the issues behind poverty and hunger. =Themes= Since 1981, World Food Day has adopted a different theme each year in order to highlight areas needed for action and provide a common focus. Most of the themes revolve around agriculture because only investment in agriculture ‚Äì together with support for education and health ‚Äì will turn this situation around. The bulk of that investment will have to come from the private sector, with public investment playing a crucial role, especially in view of its facilitating and stimulating effect on private investment. In spite of the importance of agriculture as the driving force in the economies of many developing countries, this vital sector is frequently starved of investment. In particular, foreign aid to agriculture has shown marked declines over the past 20 years.

In Central African Republic, the President of the Republic has inaugurated a bridge at Boda to coincide with World Food Day, making the agricultural production area more accessible. In Chad, thousands of people have attended debates, conferences and activities including theatre, films, folk dance, visits to project sites and visits by agricultural companies. In Ghana, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture has hosted a food security conference, while Namibia has run an awareness campaign through national media. In Botswana, the National Food technology research center recently exhibited its products and services at the World Food Day commemoration held at Kalakamati Farm on 19 October 2017. Egypt has hosted a Forum on nutrition issues. Morocco and Tunisia have held seminars and exhibitions. In Nigeria, organizations and individuals involved in feeding programs (e.g. Foodbank Nigeria) connect with other stakeholders in food production, agro-allied industries, wholesalers and community-based organizations to address food security challenges. For example, since 2009, Northern Nigeria is unstable. According to the humanitarian organisation Action Against Hunger (AAH), the ongoing and deepening humanitarian crisis in Northeast Nigeria has led to the displacement of over 1.5 million people, causing four million people to experience acute food insecurity and be in need of humanitarian assistance (Action Against Hunger). Since 2010, the AAH have been working with both \\"national agencies\\" and \\"local communities\\" to build capacity to treat deadly malnutrition caused by food insecurity (Action Against Hunger).http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/countries/africa/nigeria Actionagainsthunger. \\"Action Against Hunger Logo.\\" Nigeria.

R. Motha as an Indian Estates Workers Trade Union in 1950. It was an outgrowth of the Ceylon Indian Congress (CIC), formed 15 July 1939. In 1950 the CIC changed its name to the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) and became the largest trade union in the country. Another trade union, the Democratic Workers Congress (DWC), was formed in 1956 as a breakaway faction of the CWC as a result of leadership rivalries between the president, S. Thondaman, and the general secretary A. Aziz. The former retained control of the CWC to date. Thondaman has been the dominant trade union leader of the Indian Tamil workers for nearly four decades. As president of the Ceylon Indian Congress, he contested the Nuwara Eliya seat at the 1947 general election and won. His party put forward eight candidates in the plantation electorates and seven of them were returned, they were Thondaman, S. M. Subbaiah (Badulla), G. R. Motha (Maskeliya), K. Rajalingam (Nawalapitiya), K. Kumaravelu (Kotagala), C. V. Velupillai (Talawakelle) and D. Ramanujam (Alutnuwara). Organisation The political potentiality of the Indian Tamil workers and the CIC led by Thondaman were viewed as threats to the power of the ruling United National Party. Another view was that the enfranchisement of the Indian workers would interfere with the representation of the Kandyan Sinhalese in the legislature. However, the main reason for the disenfranchisement was the fear of political leaders like Senanayake (and even Ponnambalam) that the estate sector would become a prey to the Marxist movement. The left movement was militant and had a public image which concealed that its political strength was minuscule. However, the political leaders of the era had a more pessimistic prognosis.(K. M. de Sila, History of Sri Lanka, Penguin 1995, Ch. 33) Even though the Donoughmore Constitution had granted universal franchise to Ceylonese, this was not applied to the Indian Estate Tamils, due to opposition from caste-conscious Colombo Tamils, vote conscious Kandyan Sinhalese, as well as due to the general opposition to any form of universal franchise. The latter was named \\"mob rule\\" by Arunachalam Ponnambalam.Jane Russell, Communal Politics in the Donoughmore ear 1931-1947, Tissara Publishers, Sri Lanka 1982 Thus, even by 1939, only a fraction of the Hill-country Tamils had been granted the franchise. The fear of Marxist control of the estates, as well as the pressure of Kandyan politicians, led to attempts to not to extend citizenship to the Indian Tamils of the newly independent nation, except under very stringent conditions. In effect, the Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 and the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949 were passed by the Sri Lankan Parliament and simply reinforced the status quo of the harsher pre- Donoughmore era prior to Universal Franchise (see Sri Lanka Tamils (Indian origin) for more details of dis-enfranchisement). Thondaman opposed those laws and argued that most of the Indians were permanent residents and were the sons and daughters of the soil as are the Sinhalese or the \\"Malabar Tamils\\". The Marxist politicians criticised the move as an act of capitalist-imperialist lackeys, while S.J.V. Chelvanayakam the criticised the government as a Sinhala extremist regime, and branded Ponnambalam a traitor. Thondaman's political organization staged a non-violent satyagraha campaign against the implementation of citizenship laws and boycotted them for a period of time. Since 1952, the Indian Tamils could not elect any representative to the Parliament as their voting strength was drastically reduced. Thondaman supported the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the 1960 elections and, after the victory of this party, was appointed to the House of Representative as a nominated Member of Parliament. On December 3, 1964, Thondaman declined to vote on a motion connected with the Governor General's Throne Speech. This brought about the downfall of the SLFP government led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike. In the March 1965 elections, Thondaman shifted to the UNP to protest against the terms of the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of October 1964. After the victory of the UNP in 1965, S. Thondaman was named as appointed Member of Parliament. He was out of Parliament from 1970 to 1977 after the defeat of the UNP in the general election of 1970. During this period the CWC under his leadership gradually allied itself with the major Tamil political parties and subscribed to form the Tamil United Front (TUF). He was also elected a leader of the triumvirate leadership of this Tamil political organization. In May 1975, the TUF stressed that its objective was the setting up of the separate free, secular, sovereign, socialist state of Tamil Eelam and renamed itself into Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). Thondaman did not want to subscribe to this new separatist policy of the TULF and withdrew from it. He shifted his loyalties towards the United National Party which came to power in 1977. He served on the select committee for the revision of the constitution in 1978. In September 1978, he was invited by President J. R. Jayawardhane to join the Cabinet, which he accepted after the Executive Council of the Ceylon Workers Congress decided to do so. Since 1978, Thondaman has served as a Cabinet minister under Presidents J. R. Jayawardhane, R.Premadasa and since 1995 under president Chandrika Bandaranaike. When he joined the UNP government, he explained that he owed his position to the CWC, and the CWC's policy was to get citizenship for the stateless and better working conditions for estate labour. At the last legislative elections, held on 2 April 2004, the party was a minor partner in the UNP-dominated United National Front that won 37.8% of the popular vote and 82 out of 225 seats.

Viswanathan was married to Janaki and they have four sons and three daughters, none of them who professed their father's talent. His wife, Janaki, died on 14 May 2012. She was 77 when she died. He is known to have looked after his original Guru, S. M. Subbaiah Naidu, when the latter fell into financial difficulties and then continued to look after his wife until her death.As a rare human approach, M. S. Viswanathan, looked after his friend J. P. Chandrababu, the great Comedian and Singer of Tamil films, when the latter fell into financial ruins. Chandrababu stayed the last few years of his life in the house of M. S. Viswanathan, and as per the request of Chandrababu, MSV arranged his rites when he died in March 1974. Career Viswanathan had always wanted to be an actor and singer, but was not successful. He had a few small roles in stage dramas in the 1940s. The composer and violinist T. R. Papa met Viswanathan, took a liking to him and arranged a job for him as an errand boy for S. V. Venkatraman's musical troupe in 1942. In that company of musicians, Viswanathan realised that he had the inclination and the potential for composing music. He thereafter joined S. M. Subbaiah Naidu and at times assisted him. He then joined C. R. Subburaman's musical troupe as a harmonium player. Here, he met T. K. Ramamoorthy and T. G. Lingappa, the two leading violinists at that time. T. G. Lingappa also became a renowned music composer on his own in the 1950s. =Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy= In 1952, C. R. Subburaman died unexpectedly. Ramamoorthy and Viswanathan joined together and completed the background music for the films Subburaman was working on, including Devadas, Chandirani and Marumagal. N. S. Krishnan knew them both fairly intimately and also their respective talents by then because of his close relationship with C.R.Subburaman, with whom he had worked earlier in several films. Meanwhile, Viswanathan also worked as the third composer for the film Genova where the other composers were M.S Gnanamani and T.K.Kalyanam.'‡Æú‡ØÜ‡Æ©‡Øã‡Æµ‡Ææ' ‡Æ™‡Æü‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æé‡ÆÆ‡Øç.‡Æé‡Æ∏‡Øç.‡Æµ‡Æø. ‡Æá‡Æö‡Øà ‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡Øà‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ: ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æé‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡Æé‡ÆÆ‡Øç.‡Æú‡Æø.‡ÆÜ‡Æ∞‡Øç., ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ±‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç, archived version retrieved 27 September 2014 M.G.Ramachandran, the hero of the film Genova, had reservations about the 'raw, young music director' but the reservations lasted only till he listened to the songs. M.G.Ramachandran instantly recognised the arrival of a genius and the relationship lasted till the end of his career as a hero in 1977. Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy were asked to write the music for Panam, a 1952 film produced by A. L. Seenivasan and directed by N. S. Krishnan. Later the duo was asked to do the background score for the film Ratha Kanneer by its music composer C. S. Jayaraman. The duo composed music for over 100 films, and they worked together from 1952 to 1965. On 16 June 1963 at a special function M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy were each given the title of Mellisai Mannar(Kings of the Light Music). It was granted by Sivaji Ganesan at the Madras Triplicane Cultural Academy. The function was supported and facilitated by the Hindu Group of Publications, especially Mr. T. M. Ramachandran, Director C. V. Sridhar and Chitralaya Gopu. The duo parted in 1965 after release of Ayirathil Oruvan and since then they composed for films individually.

Jayalalithaa, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, conferred the title Thirai Isai Chakravarthy (Emperors of the Cine Music) on Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy in August 2012 and presented them with 60 gold coins and a new car. Viswanathan Ramamoorthy duo were the first musicians to arrange a stage performance of the film singers and live orchestra in India. Until then only traditional Carnatic music and Hindustani classical music was performed live in any function. This became a trend setter and paved the way not only for the birth of many musical troops, but also for knowing, understanding and learning about the western instruments among millions of Indians. =Independent music director= M. S. Viswanathan began his solo career in 1965. Viswanathan is known for having incorporated various genres of world music into Indian cinema music.

It features works of famous Danish designers like Arne Jacobsen, Jacob Jensen and Kaare Klint, who was one of the two architects who remodeled the former Frederiks Hospital (built 1752‚Äì57) into a museum in the 1920s. The exhibition also features a variety of Chinese and German porcelain. The museum houses the biggest library for design in Scandinavia. It also hosts a fully annotated and illustrated database of all furniture made in Denmark from 1900 to 2000, originally compiled by Reese and Marilyn Palley and later donated to and further developed by the museum. History The museum was founded in 1890 at the initiative of, among others, Industriforeningen. A purpose-built building designed by Vilhelm Klein and located next to Industriforeningen's premises on City Hall Square was completed in 1894 and opened to the public the following year. The exhibitions were housed in separate galleries, each dedicated to a particular field such as porcelain, faience, silver, furniture, glass and textiles. This arrangement reflected the primary aim of the museum which was to serve as a source of inspiration for craftsmen and manufacturers by highlighting the very best in craftsmenship and design from different ages. In 1926 the museum moved to its current building, the defunct Frederick's Hospital from 1757, a gift from the banker Emil Gl√ºckstadt. The architects Kaare Klint and Ivar Bentsen had undertaken the necessary alterations and furnishings. Collections Library and archives The Kaare Klint-designed reading room The museum is home to the largest library in Scandinavia dedicated to decorative arts and industrial design. Open to the general public, the library is at once a museum library, research library, and Danish central library within its field. Opening hours are Tuesday-Friday from 11-17\\\\. The library contains more than 1,000 journals. The latest issues of the 75 journals and magazines which the museum subscribes to can be read in the library's reading room. The reading room of the library hosts public lectures on design-related topics which draw upon the collections in both the museum and the library. The Danish Design Archive and the Poster Collection are located on the museum's first floor. Auditorium The museum has a small auditorium on the first floor seating 120 people. It is rented out for lectures, concerts, receptions and other events. Cultural references In the first Olsen Gang film, Bredgade 68 is where the Olsen Gang steals the golden statue.

Militant separatists The EPRLF was formed in 1980 by K. Pathmanabha (Padmanaba), Douglas Devananda, Suresh Premachandran and Varatharajah Perumal as a breakaway faction of the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students. In 1982 the EPRLF formed a military wing, People's Liberation Army, headed by Douglas Devananda. The PLA is believed to have received military training by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. In early 1986 disputes amongst the EPRLF leadership led to it splitting into two factions: EPRLF (Ranjan) and EPRLF (Douglas). In late 1986 the Tamil Tigers attacked the EPRLF, inflicting heavy losses. Many of its cadres were killed or taken prisoner and its camps and weapons were seized by the Tigers. Douglas Devananda was blamed for the debacle. In 1987 the EPRLF (Douglas) faction formally split from the EPRLF. It initially formed the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front with a breakaway faction of the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam led by Paranthan Rajan, but later transformed itself into the Eelam People's Democratic Party. Political party After its military defeat by the Tamil Tigers the EPRLF transformed itself into political party and allied itself with the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) who were occupying much of Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. The EPRLF's first foray into politics came in the flawed 1988 provincial council elections. With the assistance of IPKF the EPRLF secured 41 of the 71 seats on the North Eastern Provincial Council. On 10 December 1988 Varatharajah Perumal became the first Chief Minister of the North Eastern Provincial Council. The EPRLF formed an alliance with the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front, Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization and Tamil United Liberation Front to contest the 1989 parliamentary elections. The alliance won 188,593 votes (3.40%), securing 10 of the 225 seats in Parliament. 7 of the 10 alliance MPs were from the EPRLF. On 1 March 1990, just as the IPKF were preparing to withdraw from Sri Lanka, Varatharajah Permual moved a motion in the North Eastern Provincial Council declaring an independent Eelam. President Premadasa reacted to Permual's UDI by dissolving the provincial council and imposing direct rule on the province. The EPRLF's leadership fled to Madras (now Chennai), India. On 19 June 1990 the Tamil Tigers attacked an EPRLF meeting in Madras, murdering thirteen EPRLF members including leader K. Padmanaba, Jaffna District MP G. Yogasangari and former North Eastern Province Finance Minister P. Kirubakaran. In 1997, after the Sri Lankan military had recaptured the Jaffna peninsula from the Tamil Tigers, the EPRLF re-opened its Jaffna office. It took part in the 1998 local elections held in the peninsula and was able to win 13,140 votes (14.35%), winning 25 seats across 11 local councils. The party broke into two factions in 1999 when its General Secretary Kandaiah \\"Suresh\\" Premachandran made a deal with the Tamil Tigers. The majority of the party formed the EPRLF (Varathar) wing under the leadership of Varatharajah Perumal whilst the rest formed the EPRLF (Suresh) wing under the leadership of Suresh Premachandran. Crucially Suresh had control of most of the EPRLF's assets as well as its name (as registered with the Sri Lankan Department of Elections). =Suresh wing= The Suresh wing joined other pro-Tamil Tiger parties in 2001 to form the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). 2001 Parliamentary General Election 2004 Parliamentary General Election 2010 Parliamentary General Election =Varathar wing / Padmanaba wing= The Varathar wing has restyled itself as the Padmanaba wing, after its murdered leader. It is registered as a political party with the Sri Lankan Department of Elections under the name of Padmanaba Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front. In 2008 it joined with other anti-Tamil Tiger parties to form the Tamil Democratic National Alliance (later restyled Democratic Tamil National Alliance) to contest provincial and local elections. The wing's de facto leader (Varatharajah Perumal is in exile in India) Kandiah \\"Robert\\" Subathiran was murdered on 14 June 2003. The wing's current General Secretary (and de facto leader) is Thirunavukkarasu Sritharan (Sridharan). Paramilitary group There have been repeated allegations that various factions of the EPRLF, despite their claim to have given up violence, operate armed wings which have worked with the IPKF and Sri Lankan Army. A group composed of former EPRLF cadres known as Razeek Group works along with the Sri Lankan Army as a paramilitary group in activities against the Tamil Tigers in the Batticaloa region.

V√§sterhamn, one of the ferry terminals in Mariehamn, √Öland, viewed from the Birka Paradise ship at the night. A passenger terminal is a structure in a port which services passengers boarding and leaving water vessels such as ferries, cruise ships and ocean liners. Depending on the types of vessels serviced by the terminal, it may be named (for example) ferry terminal, cruise terminal, marine terminal or maritime passenger terminal. As well as passengers, a passenger terminal sometimes has facilities for automobiles and other land vehicles to be picked up and dropped off by the water vessel. Facilities Central Pier is a small passenger terminal in Hong Kong servicing cross-harbour ferries and other small passenger vessels. The Overseas Passenger Terminal in Sydney is a large passenger terminal capable of servicing large ocean liners and cruise ships. Passenger terminals may vary greatly in size. A small ferry terminal servicing a commuter ferry may just have the means to tie up the vessel and a waiting area for passengers. Even for a large, vehicle-carrying cross-sea ferry, the terminal at a small island location may be similar sized, with just a short ramp to enable vehicles to be driven onto the ferry. Passengers may be loaded onto a ship from the wharf by a gangway or by a linkspan. Goods packed in containers may be driven onto the vessel by a vehicle which then detaches itself from the container and returns to shore. If the passenger terminal handles vehicles (which is common especially in cross-sea ferry terminals), it will usually have the facilities, such as appropriate markings on the ground, to enable the vehicles to line up in an orderly manner. Vehicles may be driven off the ship directly, if the vessel is a Roll-on/roll-off ship. Passenger terminals in large ports usually have passenger facilities comparable with medium-sized airports, including waiting areas, ticketing desks, luggage deposit and retrieval areas, and food, beverage and other retail outlets. Ferry terminals for international ferries, such as those crossing between the United Kingdom and continental Europe, also have customs and immigration inspection facilities and security control areas similar to an international airport. Historically, the largest passenger terminals were located in major coastal cities servicing large ocean liners. With the demise of most ocean liners in the later half of the 20th century and the rise of cruise ship tourism in its stead, the largest passenger terminals today are those in \\"cruise home ports\\". In addition to extensive facilities to service passengers, these terminals must also be capable of handling the large amount of supplies required by large cruise ships and ocean liners. Major passenger ports (such as the Port of Southampton) tend to have numerous docks and wharves, some with multiple berths, in order to handle more than one ship simultaneously. Some ports use a single, large passenger terminal to service multiple docks, while others have multiple terminal buildings, each servicing a dock or wharf, so that passengers can board vessels directly from the terminal.

The TELO was originally created as a militant group, and functioned as such until 1986, when most of its membership was killed in a conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Its surviving members reorganised themselves as a political party, and it continues to function as such today. The TELO currently has two Members of Parliament. It is part of the Tamil National Alliance, a coalition of Tamil parties which won 2.9% of the popular vote and 14 out of 225 seats at the 2010 parliamentary election in Sri Lanka.  Early history  The TELO evolved out of the group of Tamil student radicals formed by Nadarajah Thangathurai and Selvarajah Yogachandran (better known by his nom de guerre Kuttimani) in the late 1960s. The group formally constituted itself into an organisation in 1979, inspired in part by the LTTE and the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS). Soon, it had become the most effective of the Tamil militant groups except the LTTE. Its success did not last long, however. Both Thangathurai and Kuttimani were captured by the Sri Lankan Army in 1981 while they were in the process of escaping to India. For a while after their arrest, the TELO was led by Sri Sabaratnam as the de facto leader.  India and the Eelam National Liberation Front  The TELO was thereafter relatively dormant until 1983. On 25 July 1983, both Thangathurai and Kuttimani were brutally tortured and killed in a prison riot by Sinhalese prisoners. Sri Sabaratnam then became its head. The trained cadre would be supplied with weaponry, and sent to Sri Lanka to wage a guerrilla war against the army. In February 1984, the TELO together with the EROS and the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) set up a common militant front for the Eelam struggle, which was called the Eelam National Liberation Front, or ENLF. The LTTE joined the ENLF in April that year. In co-ordination, the groups began carrying out attacks against government positions in Jaffna. The TELO used its arms to destroy the main police station in Jaffna, and attack military convoys. The combined assaults led to the near-total disappearance of government authority in Jaffna.  Internal dissension and the conflict with the LTTE  As a leader, however, Sri Sabaratnam lacked the charisma which the likes of Prabhakaran had, and he was unable to convey the sense of vision to the TELO which the LTTE had. As a result, the TELO's rapid growth was not backed up by a strong ideology like the LTTE's had been, and a number of its cadre were seen as bullies. Sri Sabaratnam, relying heavily on his association with and support by India, had not acquired the sort of advanced modern weaponry that the LTTE had, and the group therefore began losing its effectiveness. A number of TELO members became unhappy with Sri Sabaratnam's leadership, and dissension grew in the ranks. By 1985, a number of factions had emerged in the TELO. The rivalry between the factions led to the murder of Dass, one of the factional leaders, in April 1986. This led to a split in the organisation, with several dozen members leaving. In the meantime, differences with the LTTE were also growing. The LTTE was unhappy with the pro-India stance of the TELO. They also were upset that the TELO was getting by far the largest share of contributions from Sri Lankan Tamil expatriates, even though the TELO was not as active or successful as the LTTE. Prabhakaran also feared that India would use the TELO to have him killed. Matters came to a head with the assassination of two prominent Tamil politicians in Jaffna, M. Alalasundaram and V. Dharmalingam, in September 1985. The TELO and the LTTE blamed each other for the killings. In February 1986, the LTTE pulled out of the ENLF. On 29 April that year, they launched an all-out assault on the TELO. TELO bases across Jaffna were shelled with mortars. TELO cadres, whether armed or unarmed, came under rifle attack and were shot dead. No quarter was given, according to eyewitnesses. Those who surrendered were shot dead as they laid down their weapons, and those who attempted to flee were shot as they ran. Civilians were warned not to shelter fugitives. The few TELO cadres who managed to find refuge with other armed groups such as the EPRLF or the EROS were nearly the only ones who survived. On 5 May, the TELO's leader Sri Sabaratnam was shot dead by Kittu (Sathasivam Krishnakumar) of the LTTE. In all, over four hundred men had been killed, and the TELO had been virtually wiped out. The LTTE at the time justified its actions as necessary, arguing that the TELO was being used by India to infiltrate the Eelam struggle and reshape it to its own ends. Several years later, however, in 1990, Kittu, who had directed and led the massacres, admitted that it had been a mistake to kill the cadres of the TELO, although the assassination of the top leaders was justified. Some attempts were made during the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) period to revive the TELO as a militant group, and to avenge those killed by the LTTE. They were assisted by the Indian Army, which armed them and used them to try to contain the LTTE, who opposed the IPKF presence. However, they came under constant LTTE attack and suffered heavy casualties, losing as many as 70 in a single attack in September 1987. Once the IPKF withdrew, the military strength of these groups melted away, with most of their members surrendering to the LTTE in fear of reprisals. Since then, the TELO has never revived as an effective militant group. The TELO as a political party After the killing of Sri Sabaratnam, Selvam Adaikalanathan became the leader of the TELO. Following the melting away of its cadre after the IPKF's withdrawal, he decided that the TELO would never recover and therefore eventually reconstituted it as a political party. TELO formed an alliance with the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front, EPRLF and Tamil United Liberation Front to contest the 1989 parliamentary elections. The alliance won 188,593 votes (3.40%), securing 10 of the 225 seats in Parliament. 2 of the 10 alliance MPs were from TELO. TELO formed an alliance with EROS and People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam to contest the 1994 parliamentary elections. The alliance won 38,028 votes (0.48%), securing 3 of the 225 seats in Parliament. None of the 3 alliance MPs were from TELO. At the 2000 parliamentary elections TELO contested on its own and won 26,112 votes (0.30%), securing 3 of the 225 seats in Parliament. The TELO maintained an ambivalent position with relation to the LTTE for some years, but starting from the mid-1990s, it began to take an increasingly pro- LTTE stand. In 2001, it joined the Tamil National Alliance, a coalition of pro-independence Tamil parties, which supported, and was supported by, the LTTE. In an interview, Adaikkalanathan explained the contradiction behind the TELO supporting a group to which it was once opposed. While the TELO does not accept internecine killing and can never forget what the LTTE has done, he says it would be betraying the Tamil people to oppose the LTTE, because victory could only be achieved if all Tamil groups set aside their differences and present a united front.http://www.flonnet.com/fl2121/stories/20041022000905200.htm =2001 Parliamentary General Election= =2004 Parliamentary General Election= =2010 Parliamentary General Election= References * Hellmann- Rajanayagam, D.

The village is situated approximately north of Hull city centre and south-east of Beverley on the east bank of the River Hull. The civil parish consists of the village of Wawne and the hamlet of Meaux. According to the 2011 UK census, Wawne parish had a population of 975, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 878. History Wawne is first mentioned (as Wagene) in the Domesday Book in 1086. The name is from an assumed Old English word wagen, meaning \\"shaking\\" (probably connected with Modern English \\"wag\\" or the dialect \\"quag\\"), and is therefore believed to mean \\"shaking ground\\" or \\"quagmire\\". In the early Middle Ages Wawne was a very large parish, including Sutton-on-Hull and Stoneferry. Sutton became a separate parish some time in the Middle Ages. In 1155, Stephen the son of William, Earl of Aumale, confirmed that his father had made a gift of the Church of Wawne to the French abbey of St. Martin D‚ÄôAuchy, Aumale in Normandy (Seine Maritime) and William for the first time, mentioned Wawne's dependent chapel of Sutton. However, in William also granted the church to the abbey at Meaux. The church was later in dispute and it was possibly because of these two conflicting grants. During the time of Thomas, Abbot of Meaux (1182‚Äì97), Aumale upheld its right to Wawne against Meaux's claim, and Meaux was obliged to offer the French abbey ¬£6 13s. 4d. in order to enjoy the church and its chapel at Sutton; before eventually losing Wawne as the result of an exchange arranged by the Archbishop of York who reserved the church to his own use and annexed it to the chancellorship of York in 1230. River Hull at Wawne An alehouse at Wawne was first mentioned in the 1590s, and the Plough was named in 1666. Wawne and Meaux each had one or two licensed houses in the later 18th century, but only one was recorded from the 1820s, the Anchor, or Windham Arms, at the river crossing. The Windham Arms remained open until March 1967. It was later used as a farmhouse. The Waggoners Arms, on Sutton Road, was opened in the 1970s and is still trading today. For a time the \\"Waggoners\\" became a Chinese restaurant which was noted for its bright orange roof. This easily identifies the village when viewed from the air by aircraft passing overhead on their way to Humberside Airport. Parish Church of St Peter The Manor House in Wawne, home of the Ashe Windham family, was replaced by housing for the guards and other employees of Hull Prison. The parish church of St Peter was designated a Grade I listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. A small brick building was provided by the Windhams as a reading room in 1900, and evidently so used until 1926, when a First World War wooden hut was erected adjoining the room for a village institute. That hut was later replaced by another, and in the later 1980s a new brick-built village hall was put up on the site. The former reading room next door was used for church meetings. A library was run in Wawne Village Institute by the county council. Before its 20th-century growth, the village had a cricket field on the south side of Main Street. That was replaced by another pitch, laid out on 1¬Ω a. on the north side of Ferry Road, bought in 1963; in 1971 the parish council enlarged the site by c. ¬Ω a., and in turn made tennis courts and a children's play area there. A pavilion had been added by the 1980s. Land south-east of the church was bought in 1966 for a new vicarage but was later used instead for allotment gardens. = Ferry = Holderness Hunt crossing the River Hull on the ferry in 1910 There was a ferry across the River Hull at least as early as the 12th century. In the 1820s the Windham Arms was kept by the ferryman. By the 1890s there was a punt for ferrying pedestrians and cyclists and a pontoon / chain ferry for farm machinery, for horse-drawn vehicles and farm animals. This was later used for cars, and drivers were charged sixpence or a shilling depending on the size of the vehicle. The opening of Sutton Road Bridge in Hull (1937) had a serious effect on Wawne Ferry because this was only three miles downstream. Drivers could use the new bridge for nothing but had to pay to use the ferry and were often delayed at the Thearne side of the river. The ferry continued in use during the Second World War but closed in August 1946 when the Windham Arms and the ferry rights were sold to Moors' and Robson's Brewery. They appointed Walter Twidale as their tenant and he reported that the ferry boat was no longer safe to use.  Geography  The Waggoners Access to the village is provided via Meaux Road. Wawne itself was effectively a cul-de-sac, with no through roads. However, since 2002 development between the Public House and the village has taken the place of the old run down garage site. The developments, St. Peters Walk and Church Lane have provided the village with new housing and made a more attractive approach to the main village. Local volunteers have also arranged flowerbeds and farming antiquities around the street signs, further enhancing the overall look of the village. Both Ferry Road and Greens Lane terminate at the River Hull, where there is no crossing to the small village of Thearne on the opposite bank - Ferry Road is where the ferry was until 1946. The Post Office is situated on Main Street. Wawne County Primary School is located on Greens Lane and hosts an annual Fete in July. Flooding in 2007 The village was hit during the floods in June 2007, mainly in Oak Square, where a blocked drain caused water levels to rise two feet and about five houses were flooded. The rest of the village was safe from the rising waters, except for Meaux Road corner. Connections to Sutton on Hull Wawne has strong historic connections to the neighbouring village of Sutton on Hull, just 2¬Ω miles to the south east. In the early 12th century, villagers of the smaller hamlet of Sutton had to come to St Peter's Church in Wawne to attend mass and all feast days, this church then being ‚Äòsenior‚Äô to the tiny chapel in Sutton. Thus baptisms, marriages and burials could only be carried out at St Peter's, until Sutton had its own newly built church of St James‚Äô consecrated, in 1349, the year of the height of the Black Death. Over the centuries, there has been a great deal of connection and inter-marriage between both villages, and the Sutton & Wawne Museum is a local folk museum housed within the Old School in Sutton, with collections of many artefacts, documents and photographs of common interest to both parishes, including all the historic farms and fields in the areas now called Bransholme, Kingswood and Sutton Park, as well as Stoneferry and Wilmington. At the museum, volunteers also research local family history for visitors and residents of both parishes.

It is led by its founder Douglas Devananda. Background Douglas Devananda was one of the founding members of the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS), one of the earliest Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups. In 1980 EROS split into two as K. Pathmanabha (Padmanaba) Varatharajah Perumal broke away and formed the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF). Devananda joined the EPRLF. By early 1986 disputes had arisen between Devananda and Pathmanabha, the EPRLF's political leader. The EPRLF leadership split into two factions: EPRLF (Ranjan) and EPRLF (Douglas). In 1987 the EPRLF (Douglas) faction formally split from the EPRLF. Devananda initially formed the Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF) with a breakaway faction of the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam led by Paranthan Rajan. The ENDLF collapsed when Rajan started working with Indians - Devananda was opposed to the Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Devananda, now living in Madras, India, then formed the Eelam People's Democratic Party. =Kidnapping and extortion= The EPDP lacked funds and Devananda resorted to kidnapping and extortion of Sri Lankan Tamils living in Madras. In 1989 Devananda and 25 others were arrested for the second time by the Indian police, this time for kidnapping a ten-year-old boy for ransom at Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Madras, and imprisoned. He was given bail. In 1990 police in Kodambakkam, Madras, started an investigation on Devananda on charges of rioting and criminal intimidation of a person called Valavan. In 1990 Devananda jumped bail and returned to Sri Lanka. Paramilitary group In 1990 Devananda arrived in Colombo. A meeting was arranged by Sri Lankan intelligence between Devananda and Deputy Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne. Devananda offered to place the EPDP under Sri Lankan government control in return for support and protection from the Tamil Tigers. The government accepted - the EPDP had transformed itself into a paramilitary organisation. Devananda was attacked for betraying the Tamil people and collaborating with the enemy. EPDP cadres from all over Sri Lanka and India converged on Colombo. The government gave the EPDP vast financial assistance. The EPDP, with the support of the government, took control of the islands off Jaffna peninsula after the Tigers withdrew. The EPDP used the islands as a base to transport goods, particularly dried fish, between India and Sri Lanka. It also imposed taxes. Tamils living in Colombo were extorted money. On 1 January 1993 Tharmalingam Selvakumar, a former EPDP sympathiser, was abducted from the Premil Sports Club at Kotahena, Colombo. Selvakumar has alleged that he was taken in a van driven by Devananda to Devananda's house at 121 Park Road, Colombo 5. He was detained along with other prisoners in cells at the back of Devananda's house. Selvakumar was tortured and the EPDP tried to extort money from his family. All of this resulted in Devananda making a fortune. The EPDP's paramilitary wing continues to operate, despite its claims to have given up violence. The paramilitary wing has been accused to have helped the Sri Lankan Navy commit massacre in places like Allaipiddy. Political party EPDP regional headquarters, Valvettithurai, in 2014 Devananda and the EPDP entered electoral politics when it contested the 1994 parliamentary election as an independent group in Jaffna District. Most of the district was under Tamil Tiger control and so did not vote, allowing the EPDP win nine parliamentary seats with just 10,744 votes (0.14%), of which 9,944 votes came from the EPDP controlled Jaffna islands. The EPDP became an ally of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and her People's Alliance (PA) government. At the 2000 parliamentary election the EPDP won 50,890 votes (0.59%), securing four of the 225 seats in Parliament. In October 2000 Kumaratunga appointed Devananda as Minister of Development, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of the North, and Tamil Affairs, North and East. At the 2001 parliamentary election the EPDP won 72,783 votes (0.81%), securing two of the 225 seats in Parliament. Devananda lost his ministerial post following the change of government. At the 2004 parliamentary election the EPDP won 24,955 votes (0.27%), securing one of the 225 seats in Parliament. Devananda was appointed as Minister of Agriculture, Marketing Development, Hindu Education Affairs, Tamil Language & Vocational Training Centres in North when the United People's Freedom Alliance, the successor to the PA, returned to power. He was appointed Minister for Social Service and Social Welfare by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2005. There are unproved allegations of corruption against Devananda. =United People's Freedom Alliance= Since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war in May 2009 the EPDP has contested local and national elections under the UPFA banner rather than on its own. At the 2010 parliamentary election three EPDP members were elected on the UPFA ticket, all from Jaffna District.

As a widely supported means to address homelessness (i.e., lack of a place to live or adequate housing), supportive housing seeks to address two key problems: * Without housing, there is at best a highly problematic basis from which to mitigate the factors which lead to homelessness (e.g., lack of adequate income) and expensive problems which burden social service systems. * Without supportive services, the tenant is likely to regress (have a difficult time) for the reasons that are presumed by service providers and government to lead to their loss of housing in the first place. In the capacity building context, support services can be integral to maintaining the housing, the tenant or cooperative relationships, the financial and economic security, the contribution to the family and neighborhoods, and the growth opportunities to return to a valued life situation. In the 21st Century, supported/ive housing is linked to affordable housing (\\"affordable housing crisis\\") which affects communities throughout the US. The 1990 developments and creation of the term supportive/ed housing encompass models of community housing (\\"and disability\\") from the 1970s (e.g., first United Way mental health agency in New York) to new investments in new supported housing developments in the late 2000s (NYS Governor's Press release). Supportive housing encompasses a range of approaches including single sites (housing developments or apartment buildings in which units are designated as supportive housing) or scattered site programs in which participants often use rent subsidies to obtain housing from private landlord and supportive services may be provided through home visits. Services in supportive housing are flexible and primarily focused on the outcome of housing stability. New approaches to supportive/ed housing include explorations of home ownership for people with disabilities, and a range of diverse consumer-directed, personal assistance and community support services focused on community integration and support.Racino, J. (1999). \\"Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All\\". London: Haworth Press. Most common, however, with collaborations involving state, federal and local governments and non-profit sectors are congregate housing programs with service enhancements and increasing choices. From 2002 to 2007, an estimated 65,000 to 72,000 units of supportive housing were created in the United States. This represents about half the supply of supported housing units. Of the new units added, about half were targeted towards chronically homeless individuals, and one-fifth were for homeless families.Chronic Homelessness Briefing Paper, United States Interagency Council on Homelessness According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the number of Permanent Supportive Housing beds in the U.S. increased from 188,636 to 353,800 between 2007 and 2017. Although of the shelter population, the majority remain as single, adult males of minority groups (approximately 65%), 38% were between 31 and 50 years old, and 38% had a disability; the rest were homeless families with a high concentration (likely due to high housing costs)in the states of California, New York and Florida.US Department of Housing and Urban Development. (2009). \\"The 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress.\\" Washington, DC: Author.  Populations served  Sponsors of supportive housing projects generally aim to serve a specific population; the characteristics of those served and the housing program range widely: However, supporters of regular housing and support services in the community suggest choice based on other personal, social, and situational factors than specific population basis (e.g., choice of roommates or housemates, neighborhoods they live in).Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S., & Taylor, S. (1993). \\"Housing, Support and Community: Choices and Strategies for Adults with Disabilities\\". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. Targeted population groups (homeless initiatives) include: * Adolescents (including those in foster care or aging-out of foster care) * Elders (those who choose or require supportive services in a regular housing environment) * Single-parent households * Nuclear families (and multi- generational* households) * Mental health clients/residents who have been diagnosed with a mental illness such as depression, schizophrenia disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, or dementia * People with multiple needs, including medical ones (including people who have HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, addictions, or other chronically illnesses) * Foster homes (including the need for adult and children models) * Maternity homes (e.g., use of midwives) * People maturing out of transitional housing (recovery homes and halfway houses) * People with substance use (e.g., opioids) or combined diagnoses often post-treatment and families. Today, important new populations for supported housing in regular neighborhoods include working families, especially those with high proportional housing costs, older adults who need intensive (enriched) services to avoid nursing home placements, and people who need places to live due to the closure of the old style, institutional psychiatric care. Increasingly, supportive/ed housing may be required as unemployment increases, for newly emerging groups such as newly legalized gay and lesbian partners, multi-generational immigrant groups in the new multicultural world, and for those adolescents aging out of their parents' homes to new community options. One of the 2000s textbooks on Supported/ive Housing is a report on state projects in the US for older adults which includes use of the home and community-based (HCBS) waiver, efforts to reform more than 43 congregate residential categories in states, use of housing subsidies for low income persons, assisted living options, \\"comprehensive case/care management\\", and technical area such as \\"at-risk\\" housing and non- profit development (Pynoos et al., 2004).Pynoos, J., Hollander-Feldman, P.,& Ahrens, J. (2004). \\"Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults: Obstacles, Options and Opportunities.\\" Binghamton, NY and London: The Haworth Press.  Benefits of supportive housing for specific populations groups  Supportive Housing proposes to be a comprehensive solution to a problem rather than a band-aid fix (such as a shelter.) While many of those who stay in the shelter system remain in or return to the system for extended periods of time, a much higher percentage of those who are placed in supportive housing remain housed on a more permanent basis.Chronic Homelessness Brief , National Alliance to End Homelessness This idea is also referred to as the Housing First model, an approach to combating chronic homelessness by providing homes upfront and offering help for illnesses and addictions. The concept turns the traditional model, which typically requires sobriety (or prerequisites) (which can be used for enhanced services before a person can get housing, upside down. Research has shown that coupling permanent housing with supportive services is highly effective at maintaining housing stability, as well as helps improve health outcomes and decreases the use of publicly funded institutions. A review of the impact of these services found that they can improve health outcomes among chronically homeless individuals, including positive changes in self-reported mental health status, substance use, and overall well-being. In the Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness (CICH), participants who had been homeless for an average of eight years were immediately placed into permanent housing. The CICH evaluation reported that 95% of those individuals were in independent housing after 12 months.Elliott, Janice and Wilkins, Carol.\\"Chronic Homelessness,\\" United States Interagency Council on Homelessness Briefing Paper A study of homeless people in New York City with serious mental illness found that providing supportive housing to the individuals directly resulted in a 60% decrease in emergency shelter use for clients, as well as decreases in the use of public medical and mental health services and city jails and state prisons. Another study in Seattle in 2009 found that moving \\"people with chronic alcoholism\\" into supportive housing resulted in a 33% decline in alcohol use for clients. There is significant support for the contention that supportive housing also costs less than other systems where its tenant base may reside, such as jails, hospitals, mental health facilities, and even shelters. Research on the overall costs to the taxpayer of supportive housing has consistently found the costs to the taxpayer to be about the same or lower than the alternative of a chronically homeless person sleeping in a shelter. The CICH evaluation showed that average costs for healthcare and treatment were reduced by about half, which the largest decline associated with inpatient hospital care.\\"Supportive Housing is Cost-Effective ,\\" National Alliance to End Homelessness The use of supportive housing has been shown to be cost-effective, resulting in reductions in the use of shelter, ambulance, police/jail, health care, emergency room, behavior health, and other service costs. For example, one 2016 report identified studies documenting that these services can reduce health care costs, emergency department visits, and length of stays in psychiatric hospitals. The Denver Housing First Collaborative documented that the annual cost of supportive housing for a chronically homeless individual was $13,400. However, the per-person reduction in public services recorded by the Denver Housing First Collaborative came to $15,773 per person per year, more than compensating for the annual supportive housing costs.Parvensky, John, and Perlman, Jennifer. \\"Denver First Housing Collaborative: Cost Benefit Analysis and Program Outcomes report \\" When paired with low-income housing (or mixed- income housing), government subsidies (such as section 8 or Housing choice vouchers) and other revenue generating operations, supportive housing residences are claimed by their supporters to be capable of supporting themselves and even turning a profit (which can be used for enhanced services and amenities for the residents by a non-profit organization). According to a 2007 study done by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, supportive housing helps tenants increase their incomes, work more, get arrested less, make more progress toward recovery, and become more active, valued and productive members of their communities.  Impact on neighborhoods  Supportive housing can help people facing health challenges to continue to live in the community. However, proposals for new housing projects often faced local opposition, largely based on fears regarding adverse effects on property values and crime rates, local businesses, and the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhood. A 2008 study in Toronto, Canada reported: * There is no evidence linking supportive housing to property values and crime rates * Supportive housing tenants contribute to local businesses * Neighbors do not think the supportive housing buildings have a negative impact * Positive contributions of supportive housing tenants to the community One of the benefits of supportive/ed housing which is integrated into the community Carling, P.J., Randolph, F.L., Blanch, A.K., & Ridgeway, P.

In many ways, these projects can be a return to neighborhood based control of services' planning which resulted in the 1990s in new housing developments, after school programs, parent support groups, respite care and similar initiatives in the field of children's mental health,King, B. & Meyers, J.

Limitations, impediments and challenges affecting the development of Supportive Housing  = Financial feasibility = Prevailing rental rates and prices for housing in many U.S. real estate markets complicate efforts to acquire and adapt existing buildings and building sites for use as supportive housing. The combination of circumstances confronting supportive housing proposals and their advocates can produce the belief that most such housing proposals are unfeasible. Some projects fail to materialize because of a real or perceived lack of government program funds, charitable grants, bank loans or a combination of such funding to pay for the cost of creating and operating financially viable supportive housing.Supportive Housing Cookbook, 2004www.atlastahouse.org Other organizations, however, have accessed diverse mix and match funding for highly visible community demonstrations for special population groups.Taylor, S. (1987). Supported housing demonstration project in Pittsburgh, PA. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy. Enterprise Community Partners is one of many nonprofit organizations that finances supportive housing through tax credits, grants and loans. They pioneered the financing of supportive housing through the low-income housing tax credit in 1991, overturning the conventional wisdom that investors would not embrace these projects. Consultants specialize in the creative use of housing financing, and supportive housing consultants and technical assistance collaboratives are now available for assistance to localities. Early directions for financing of housing and support services in the community included financing sources, such as housing cooperative programs, mixed income housing associations, community development block grants, loans for accessibility programs, tax exempt bonds, trust funds, housing subsidies, and low interest loans.O'Connor, S. & Racino, J.

In some areas, this produced a movement to find alternative solutions rather than continuing to fund the traditional solutions, including shelter system, jails, asylums and hospitals. In addition to homelessness, the movement today is to downsize or close psychiatric centers (e.g., Olmstead initiative)\\"...Supreme Court Upholds Integration Mandate in Olmstead ‚Äì Olmstead v. L.C. and E.W.\\" (1999). Center for Accessible Society. and develop regular options for housing and support in the local communities; these population groups have also been counted in some reports as the homeless populations. In the U.S., hundreds of city governments have produced \\"10-year plans\\" that provide for supportive housing to end chronic homelessness because the Bush administration began pushing for creation of the plans in 2003. The goal: put the homeless people with complex situations and needs into permanent or transitional \\"supportive\\" housing with counseling services that help them get healthy lifestyles of their own choosing. The evidence shows supportive housing may be a viable solution: the number of street people in cities across the United States has plummeted for the first time since the 1980s. In 2005‚Äì2006, Miami, Florida reported a 20% decline in homeless populations and dozens of other U.S. cities reported similar census results: San Francisco, CA (30%), Portland, OR (20%), Dallas, TX (28%), New York, NY (13%).U.S. homeless numbers decline / NATIONWIDE: 'Supportive' housing seen as good start San Francisco Chronicle (CA), May 14, 2006 Guided by research, Congress has taken several steps to encourage the development of permanent supportive housing. Beginning in the late 1990s, appropriations bills have increased funding for HUD's homeless assistance programs and targeted at least 30 percent of funding to permanent supportive housing. Congress has also provided funding to ensure that permanent supportive housing funded by one of HUD's programs (Shelter Plus Care) would be renewed non-competitively, helping to ensure that chronically homeless people could remain in their housing.National Alliance to End Homelessness, Chronic Homelessness Fact Sheet The 2009 legislative mandate from the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act created bipartisan political support to adopt a collaborative approach to end homelessness. From this effort spawned the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness's Opening Doors Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness in 2010. With a focus on permanent supportive housing as a means of ending chronic homelessness, the plan outlines an interagency effort aligning mainstream housing, health, education, and human services.United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. \\"Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness .\\" = Imperfect markets = Seller's Markets: where demand exceeds the supply of permanent supportive housing, many housing providers can be selective when admitting tenants. While this can lead to an improved quality of life and a relatively high success rate for the most fortunate applicants, the unsuccessful homeless remain in unsatisfactory situations. To some extent, this problem is being addressed by \\"first step\\" programs aimed at preparing people for residency in permanent housing. Exclusionary practices always exist in the residential and housing fields, against human rights laws, however, there does remain lack of an affordable, accessible supply of housing the US, similar to the waiting lists for portable housing vouchers. = Lack of expertise in development and operations = One impediment to the development of additional housing stock where it is otherwise needed, permissible and feasible is the lack of real estate acquisition, development & financing expertise in the government agencies and non-profit (non-governmental) organizations interested in serving those who need and want supportive housing. The US Housing and Urban Development Department is trying to bridge that information and knowledge gap with the availability of regular reports on market and housing conditions throughout the nation, and statistics on all kinds of housing developments (e.g., homeownership, multifamily structures). In addition, there is a widening affordability gap in housing, especially with the lowest income households. \\"Experts point to several factors contributing to this gap: erosion in the housing stock, high housing prices, a drop in real wages, a decline in middle wage jobs, increases in transportation costs, expensive development requirements, regulatory constraints, and insufficient housing assistance funds to meet the needs.\\" US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research. (2008, May). Housing: Critical for Working Families and Communities. \\"Research Works\\", 5(5), p.1.  Economic impact on society  Studies cited by supporters conclude that supportive housing is a cost-effective solution for the problems of several populations; it is substantially less costly than most alternatives used to address the problems of homeless people, including shelters, institutions and hospitals. Supportive Housing often reduces the cost of emergency services for health care provided by governmental and non-profit agencies. The \\"chronically homeless\\", the 10-20% who are continually on the street with addiction and mental problems impose heavy costs on their communities in hospital, jail and other services‚Äîhundreds of thousands of dollars apiece annually in some instances. * For example, the average daily cost to house a person in various institutional settings in New York City (2004) ** Supportive Housing $41.85 ** Shelter $54.42 ** Prison $74.00 ** Jail $164.57 ** Psychiatric Hospital $467 ** Hospital $1185 Per a study published in JAMA in 2009, a supportive housing development called 1811 Eastlake saved taxpayers $4 million in the first year of operation alone, because these residents are now off the streets and out of emergency rooms and in a safe, steady and supportive living environment. The 1811 Eastlake study compared 95 Housing First participants, with 39 wait-list control members and found cost reductions of over 50 percent for the Housing First group. While it is not the first published evidence of the service use reductions and cost savings that permanent supportive housing interventions can provide, it is worth highlighting because the level of the cost savings ‚Äì almost $30,000 per person per year after accounting for housing program costs ‚Äì are greater than some seminal studies that have shown more modest cost offsets through permanent supportive housing. 1811 Eastlake provided assistance to homeless people with extensive health issues and still saw a savings of nearly $30,000 per tenant per year in publicly funded services, all while achieving improved housing and health outcomes. In Oregon, Portland's Community Engagement Program provides housing and intensive services to homeless individuals with mental illness and addictions. The program reduced the cost of health care and incarcerations from $42,075 to $17,199. The investment in services and housing during the first year of enrollment was averaged to approximately $9,870. This represents a 35.7% ($15,006 per person) annual cost saving for the first year following enrollment in CEP.Moore, Thomas L. \\"Estimated Cost Savings Following Enrollment in the Community Engagement Program\\" Supportive housing can be considered to be a human right to a decent life in the US. The cost-benefits can be viewed as immeasureable when viewed through the lenses of benefits to self, family, friends, neighbors, community organizations, health, safety and welfare (government), and local communities. For example, cost-benefits typically relate to governmental expenditures, which may involve cost-shifting among governmental levels and departments, and benefits usually refer to the governmental benefits related to its agenda (E.g., Deinstitutionalization, transinstitutionalization, decongregation, decategorization, Community integration) expressed for the individual and family as life outcomes. However, supportive housing, especially as assisted living, may be congregate in nature either related to hospital and nursing home systems reform on one hand (E.g., Pynoos et al., 2004), or in psychiatric, to its categorical disability service system with roots in community services systems and psychiatric hospitals (Racino, in press, 2014). In the field of intellectual disabilities, the term Supportive living is more common with decongregated, small size homes and apartments with choice options throughout local communities.Racino, J. (2014, in press). \\"Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US.\\" NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.  From supported housing to housing and support  The US has experienced an effort to move from facility-based services to more of a housing and support approach in regular homes in typical neighborhoods.Taylor, S., Racino, J., Knoll, J. & Lutfiyya, Z. (1987). \\"The nonrestrictive environment: On community integration for persons with the most severe disabilities.\\" Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S., & Taylor, S.

This movement, involving state-federal and university collaboration, has involved the development of principles of housing and support which could apply across different disability groups interested in moving from the facility-based (bundled program) approach to \\"housing and support\\". These principles are: * Housing for all. * Integrated housing. * Choice. * Supports based on the individual. * Separation of housing and support.Racino, J. (1992).

Supported housing, in particular, involves moving from traditional residential models in mental health community services (e.g., halfway houses and group homes, transitional residences/apartment programs, Fairweather Lodges) to the newer community support approaches which allow greater choice and flexibility in roommates, homes, and neighborhoods.Carling, P.

In particular, this period supported consumer housing preferences to form the basis for better quality housing and recognition of consumer choice. However, the primary concern remained the requirements of residential providers (no \\"zero reject\\" policy, this field), especially when addictions were identified as the primary concern for a few people/residents.Keck, J.

Supportive housing, in addition to \\"quality assurance procedures\\", are meant to \\"ensure quality of care and quality of life\\"; Sheehan and Oakes (2004) indicate that residents may be reluctant to complain on satisfaction surveys since they may be relocated to even stricter nursing facilities. However, these projects have included Real Systems Change Grants \\"to enhance opportunities for independent living for people with disabilities and to assist 3 communities (in Connecticut) to become models of inclusion of people with disabilities\\" and to transition from the nursing facilities (Ibid, 2004).Sheehan, N. & Oakes, C.

Ahrens, \\"Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults\\". London: Haworth Press. Supported housing (which is the first community living to involve housing, though NGO purchasing and leasing of community homes preceded this development) now is in its 4th decade in the university-governmental and community sectors, and was also succeeded by \\"models of housing and health\\" from the traditional medical sectors.  Supportive housing providers  Public housing authorities are \\"responsible for the aging housing stock in the US\\" and for the \\"direct or contractual operation of low and moderate income housing\\", among other responsibilities. The US Housing and Urban Development federal department has a range of programs (e.g., mortgage financing programs for home-ownership; Family Self Sufficiency programs). US HUD supports plans for the development or redevelopment of communities (\\"planned communities\\", US Congress) in 2019 and the development of \\"large scale housing and mixed use developments\\" (e.g., mixed income housing projects such as through the Madison Mutual Housing Association and Cooperatives; \\"housing-business-transportation- recreation-schools\\" projects), including on Indian reservations and land in the US.Carson, B.

Blanca de Castej√≥n (May 13, 1906 - December 26, 1969) was a Puerto Rican actress who appeared in 1930s Spanish- language Hollywood films and is best remembered for her work in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, especially her award-winning supporting role in Escuela de vagabundos. She was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and died in Mexico City. Life and career Blanca de Castej√≥n was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Rafael de Castejon Hern√°iz, a telegraph operator, and Josefa Otero Rivera, a housewife. She made her film debut in El impostor (1931), one of three films she made for Fox's Spanish-language unit.Eduardo Guaitsel, \\"Blanca, yo y otro,\\" Cine Mundial (October 1938) After stops in Mexico City and Havana, where she worked in the theater, Castej√≥n went to Buenos Aires, where she made two feature films: Crimen a las tres (1935, a box-office flop) and Por buen camino (1935). By the late 1930s she returned to Hollywood and starred in Spanish-language films, notably Mis dos amores (1938), starring the popular Mexican star Tito Guizar. She had already married Mexican actor Rafael Banquells when she relocated to Mexico City and joined the national film industry, where she made about thirty movies, taking part in what is known as the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. Though she initially starred in melodramas, Blanca de Castej√≥n became best-known for her supporting roles in comedies starring popular comedians like Luis Sandrini and Fernando Soler. She won the 1954 Ariel award (Mexico's version of the Oscars) for her supporting role as a ditzy socialite in Escuela de vagabundos (School for Tramps), a very popular remake of the 1938 screwball comedy Merrily We Live, opposite Pedro Infante.

In 1895, he isolated and identified adrenaline. Life Napoleon Cybulski was born on 14 September 1854 in Krzywonosy, in the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). He came from a Polish-Lithuanian noble family. His father was J√≥zef Napoleon Cybulski, of the Prawdzic coat of arms, and his mother was Marcjanna Cybulska, n√©e Hutorowicz. Cybulski graduated from secondary school in Minsk and studied medicine at the Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy (since 1881 called Imperial Military Medical Academy) in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 1880 he received his physician's diploma cum eximia laude (with the highest distinction). In 1877‚Äì85 he worked there as an assistant in the Department of Physiology under Ivan Tarkhanov. In 1885 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine with a thesis on the velocity of blood flow as detected by a photohemotachometer, a device he had constructed himself. He also carried out research on the influence of the phrenic nerve on the respiration rate and on the larynx and the vagus nerves. The same year (1885), he moved to Krak√≥w and became head of the Department of Physiology at the Jagiellonian University. In 1887‚Äì88 and 1895‚Äì96 he served as dean of the Faculty of Medicine and subsequently as rector (1904‚Äì5) and deputy rector (1905‚Äì9) of the university. He was the founder of the Krak√≥w School of Physiology and from 31 October 1891 was an active member of the Academy of Learning. His students included Adolf Beck, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szymonowicz, Leon Wachholz, Aleksander Rosner, and Stanis≈Çaw Maziarski. He married Julia Rogozi≈Ñska and opened a dental surgery office in order to satisfy the financial needs of his large family. In 1916 he bought a manor house in Nawojowa G√≥ra. In 1918 he received the Award of the Erazm and Anna Jerzmanowski Foundation bestowed by the Polish Academy of Learning. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine three times between 1911-1918. He died 26 April 1919 of stroke in his study in the Department of Physiology at the Jagiellonian University. He was posthumously awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Scientific work Napoleon Cybulski is widely regarded as a pioneer of electroencephalography and endocrinology in Poland and the world. In 1895, with his pupil W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szymonowicz (1869‚Äì1939), he discovered the hormonal interactions of the adrenal medulla and isolated adrenaline. He called the substance nadnerczyna (which in Polish literally means \\"adrenalin\\": nadnercze is the Polish for \\"adrenal gland\\"). In 1890 Cybulski carried out one of the first-ever EEG recordings of the cerebral cortex. Working with Adolf Beck (1863‚Äì1942), he conducted pioneering research on electroencephalographic waves. Under Cybulski‚Äôs supervision, Beck made pioneering studies of cerebral-cortex activity in response to peripheral-nerve stimulation in dogs and monkeys, using electrodes placed on the skull to record changes in electric potential. In this way they invalidated William Horsley‚Äôs notion that these changes reflected the activity of skull muscles. By further analyses of potential changes, they mapped out sensory regions of the cerebral cortex. They also provided evidence that the amplitude of signals depended on the strength and kind of sensory stimulus and on the depth of anesthesia. They suspected that brain function was mediated by neurons' bioelectrical activity. Their studies on brain mapping and nerve stimulation were absolutely innovative, since they were unfamiliar with earlier research done by Richard Caton on changes in bioelectrical activity of the dog brain during sleep, activity, and changes in behavior. Again working with Beck, Cybulski showed that every taste sensation in the tongue was caused by a separate kind of receptor. He gave a description of the difference between afferent and efferent impulses entering and leaving the spinal cord based on recordings from dorsal and ventral roots. In 1914 Napoleon Cybulski and S. Jele≈Ñska-Macieszyna photographed EEG recordings of experimentally induced seizures. Cybulski was one of the first physiologists to register and describe the blood flow linear velocity of the carotid artery and the femoral artery. Among his other discoveries was establishing that an increase in intracranial pressure causes disturbances in blood flow to the brain. Cybulski authored around 100 medical research papers. He initiated research on hypnosis in Poland. Some of his theses in O hypnotyzmie ze stanowiska fizyjologicznego (On Hypnosis From the Physiological Standpoint) anticipate ideas of Sigmund Freud and make him a precursor of the concept of the unconscious. Social questions Apart from medicine, Cybulski was also interested in a range of social questions and published books and articles such as Czy pa≈Ñstwo i spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwo majƒÖ obowiƒÖzek popieraƒá naukƒô? (Do the State and Society Have an Obligation to Support Science?, 1895), W sprawie organizacji gospodarstw w≈Ço≈õcia≈Ñskich (On the Organization of Peasant Farms, 1896) and Nauka wobec wojny (Science and War, 1918). He was a staunch advocate of allowing women to study medicine. In 1891, Cybulski and a pioneering Polish bacteriologist, Odo Bujwid (1857‚Äì1942), established the first girls' gimnazjum (secondary school) in Krak√≥w.

It stars Diane Lane, Michael Woods, and Cotter Smith. The film was marketed with the tagline \\"When fantasy leads to terror.\\" It was filmed on location in and around Pittsburgh. Plot summary Katya Yarno is a window dresser for Horne's department store who specializes in displays with sexy, slightly kinky themes. Surrounded by the equipment of her trade--mannequins and lingerie-- Katya lives in a loft apartment in downtown Pittsburgh. She spends her evenings taking her bath by candlelight and thinking up new and more provocative window displays. Katya soon becomes the obsession of Jack Price, a handsome (and married) psychopath. Jack proceeds to stalk Katya and makes her life a living hell. Tired of being harassed, Katya decides to give Jack a taste of his own medicine.

Hill - Police Officer #1 * David Crawford - Katya's father * Ray Laine - Doctor * Bingo O' Malley - Man in Window * Don Brockett - Locksmith  Development  Arthur began working on Lady Beware in the late '70s, shortly after the success of her second feature, The Mafu Cage, which screened at Cannes, landed her a four-picture deal at Universal. Universal, however, ended up rejecting the project, which ended up having \\"100 homes, 17 drafts, and eight writers,\\" as Arthur told The Los Angeles Times in 1986 ahead of the film's release. \\"The purse-holders are men, and they attempted to make Lady Beware into a violent picture,\\" Arthur added. \\"I'm not interested in making a picture where a woman gets beat up. I want to show how a lady deals with this kind of insidious violence. A policeman can't help.\\"  Production  The film was shot on location in Pittsburgh during the summer of 1986 after Scotti Brothers Entertainment agreed to finance and distribute it. The budget was reportedly under $2 million. Lady Beware's 28 days of shooting took place primarily in the city's North Side and downtown neighborhoods.  Controversy  Arthur did not approve of the film's final cut, which she said was re- edited by the producers to appeal to the exploitation crowd. \\"[Some distributors asked for] more sex, so they took outtakes of Diane Lane standing there naked and incorporated them into the film,\\" she told The Los Angeles Times ahead of the film's release. \\"To me, that's exploitative. They printed up negatives where I never said print. I, as a female director, would never exploit a woman's body and use it as a turn-on.\\" Arthur added that she did not remove her name from the film because she thought it would be unfair to the actors, who can't remove their names from the final product.  Home media release  Lady Beware was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1988 by International Video Entertainment. A second VHS release was put out in 1991 by Avid Home Entertainment.

It is a yellow, weakly fluorescent solid with melting point over 300 ¬∞C. It is soluble in organic solvents such as acetonitrile, but is decomposed by water in the presence of light. The name \\"heptazine\\" is also used for derivative compounds, which have the three hydrogens substituted by other functional groups. Heptazine oligomers and polymers were discovered in the 19th century but their study has long been hampered by their general insolubility. They are used as flame retardants. Heptazine derivatives have been the object of interest recently for potential applications in electronics materials, explosives, and more. The synthesis of heptazine proper was reported only in 1982. History Berzelius discovered in 1815 that the ignition of mercuric thiocyanate yielded, besides cinnabar , carbon disulfide, and nitrogen, a yellow insoluble residue. In the same year, W√∂hler described the characeristic twisted yellow column that forms when the salt is ignited and burns (which is the popular \\"Pharaoh's serpent\\" school chemistry demo). This foam has recently been found to consist of highly and randomly folded sheets of a material with composition close to . The sheets very thin (less than 20 nm) and are conjectured to consist of heptazine or s-triazine cores linked at their corners by nitrogen atoms. In 1834 Liebig described the compounds that he named melamine, melam, and melon. In the following years, Leopold Gmelin and Wilhelm Henneberg prepared novel salts that were eventually recognized as connected to the compounds described by Liebig, and named melonates and cyamelurates. The structure of these compounds was elucidated only in 1937, by Linus Pauling and J. Holmes Sturdivant. They showed by X-ray crystallography that these compounds contain a core of fused triazine rings, which he named \\"cyameluric nucleus\\". The synthesis of unsubstituted heptazine was reported only in 1982, by R. S. Hosmane and others from the group of N. Leonard. The structure of Liebig's melon eventually identified by T. Komatsu as consisting of linked heptazine units Structure and properties According to Pauling and Sturdivant, the heptazine core is best described as a resonance equlibrium of 20 different structures: Each of the last three structures above has 5 other versions that differ by rotation and/or mirroring of the whole molecule. If one averages pairs of structures that are equivalent through mirroring, or triplets equivalent through 120 degree rotations, the first 2 and the last 18 reduce to the following schemas: Heptazine has a peculiar crystal structure, whose cell spans 16 molecules in asymmetric positions and orientations. Theoretical calculations indicate that, in heptazine and some of its derivatives, the lowest triplet state (T1) has higher energy (by about ‚âà ‚àí0.25 eV) than the lowest excited singlet state (S1). Thus heptazine was claimed to be the first example of a stable closed-shell organic molecule violating Hund‚Äôs rule. Derivatives and uses Generic heptazine derivative; R1, R2, R3 are arbitrary substituents. Usual numbering of substituent positions on the heptazine core. Attachment of groups to the nitrogens (positions 1,3,4,6,7,9) imply rearrangement of the single and double bonds. The derivative with three amino substituents (2,5,8-triaminoheptazine) is called melem. Melem can be polymerized by condensation with loss of , so that the heptazine cores are linked through amine (NH) bridges. The oligomers and polymers thus obtained are called melon. Melem and melon are effective flame retardant compounds. The compounds have in common that they melt or decompose at very high temperatures and that they are insoluble in any solvent. This makes characterisation difficult. The heptazine derivate with three hydroxyl substituents is called cyameluric acid. The heptazine derivative with an azide substituent and two hydroxyl groups is called Linus Pauling's mystery molecule. It is the last molecule he drew on his chalkboard (preserved for posterity) before he died in 1994. Two theories attempt to lift the mystery. It is suggested that Pauling failed to solve the double helix structure of DNA before Watson and Crick because he viewed uracil as an amide and not as the tautomeric hydroxy compound. The other theory suggests that Pauling intended to use the compound as a potential spectroscopic label for binding to DNA. Nelson Leonard observed that Pauling \\"must have returned to the source of his original structural inspiration for a new application.\\" The tri-azido derivatives are investigated for their use as high-energy-density materials (explosives). It is believed that one of the graphitic forms of the carbon nitride C3N4 is built up of linked heptazines. Heptazines could be a precursor molecule to the diamond- like beta carbon nitride.

He is particularly famous for his actions at the Battle of Yashima in 1184. According to the Heike Monogatari, the enemy Taira placed a fan atop a pole on one of their ships, daring the Minamoto warriors to shoot it off. Sitting atop his mount in the waves, his target atop the ship rocking as well, Nasu nevertheless shot it down with only one shot. After the Genpei War, he was made shugo of Tottori Castle, but he lost this position to Kajiwara Kagetoki after being defeated in a hunting competition. He left Echigo Province and‚Äîfollowing the death of Minamoto no Yoritomo‚ÄîNasu became a Buddhist monk in the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ sect. Eventually, he formed a temple, which has since been passed down to the oldest son of the Nasu family. For administrative purposes, detailed records were kept regarding who was to inherit the temple. As a result of this, it was possible to trace the Nasu lineage right up to the destruction of the temple during World War II. Most believe that he died at the age of 64, in the year 1232, during a ceremony in Kobe honoring those who died in the Genpei War. In popular culture Nasu no Yoichi is one of the main characters in the manga/anime Drifters, where he appears as a young man under the age of 19 and is voiced by Mitsuki Saiga. The story of Nasu shooting the fan off of the rocking boat was briefly re-enacted in the Studio Ghibli film, Pom Poko, when the old Tanuki shape shifts into it. In High School Inari Tamamo-chan manga, the story was twisted, Nasu no Yoichi was Tenko Fushimi, as her bow skills were legendary, but concealed the fact that she was a fox guardian.
