They were one of two lineages of equines native to South America during the Pleistocene epoch alongside those of the Equus subgenus Amerhippus. Hippidion principale  Evolution  left Hippidion has been considered a descendant of pliohippines, horses that migrated into the South American continent around 2.5 million years ago. Early analysis of the ancient DNA of Hippidion and other New World Pleistocene horses supported the novel hypothesis that Hippidion was actually a member of the living genus Equus, with a particularly close relationship to the wild horse, Equus ferus. However this was later shown to be incorrect, with more complete sequences finding Hippidion as an outgroup to all living equines and less closely related to living horses than the \\"New World stilt legged horse\\", Haringtonhippus francisci. Hippidion is traditionally thought to have 3 species, H. principale, H. saldiasi and H. devillei, however, in the DNA analysis, the single sampled H. principale specimen was found to be nested with H. saldiasi, with H. devillei found to be clearly genetically distinct. Hippidion and other South American horses became extinct approximately 8,000 years ago. Specific archaeological recovery at the Cueva del Milodon site in Patagonian Chile demonstrates that Hippidion saldiasi existed in that vicinity in the era of 10,000 to 12,000 years before present.C. Michael Hogan, Cueva del Milodon, Megalithic Portal, 13 April 2008 Horses did not reappear in South America until the 16th century, as a result of introduction by humans.  Description  left It stood approximately (also 13.2 hh) high at the shoulders and resembled a donkey. The skull of Hippidion is noted for its nasal bone, which projects forward from the skull.  Diet and Ecology  left A study found that Late Pleistocene specimens of Hippidion had lower Œ¥13C values than those of specimens of Amerihippus, indicating a preference for C3 woodland and wooded open habitats.  Discovery  Remains of Hippidion saldiasi have been recovered in locations such as the Piedra Museo site, Santa Cruz, Argentina and Cueva del Milodon, Chile. The significance of such archaeological recovery is amplified by the association with hunting of these animals by prehistoric man at possible Pre-Clovis horizons.  Distribution  Fossils of Hippidion have been found in:Hippidion at Fossilworks.org ;Pleistocene * Tarija, √ëuapua and Ulloma Formations, Bolivia * Janda√≠ra Formation, Brazil * Ch√≠u-Ch√≠u Formation and Cueva del Milod√≥n, Chile * Sopas and Dolores Formations, Uruguay * Taima-Taima, Venezuela  Extinction  Hippidion became extinct alongside the other South American equines at the end of the Late Pleistocene, between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago as part of the Quaternary extinction event, which resulted in the extinction of most large animals in both North and South America. Climactic modelling suggests that the preferred habitat for species of Hippidion declined after the Holocene transition, but the decline isn't enough to explain the extinction.

The Cyprus dwarf hippo was roughly the same size as the extant pygmy hippopotamus. Unlike the modern pygmy hippo, the Cyprus dwarf became small through the process of insular dwarfism. This same process is believed to cause the dwarfism found in some dwarf elephants, the pygmy mammoth, and Homo floresiensis. The animal is estimated to have measured tall and long. H. minor is the smallest hippopotamus of all known insular hippopotamuses. The extremely small size of the hippo is in favour of a Middle Pleistocene or perhaps even Early Pleistocene colonization.Van der Geer A., Lyras G., De Vos J., Dermitzakis M. 2010. Evolution of Island Mammals: Adaptation and Extinction of Placental Mammals on Islands. Wiley-Blackwell. At the time of its extinction between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago, the Cyprus dwarf hippo was the largest animal on the island of Cyprus. It was a herbivore and had no natural predators.

The collected bones are ground into a powder believed to have medicinal powers.

History Alfred, Lord Tennyson lived during the Victorian Era during the 1800s. This era is widely known for the Romanticism movement in the literary culture. Tennyson was often referred as one of the main representatives of poetry during the Victorian era due to his growing popularity both during and after his time. Romanticism was a reaction to The Enlightenment or the notion that human actions were guided by other forces. The movement as a whole emphasized feeling over thought, and was characterized by imagination, individualism, and freedom. Romantic poets often focused on the idea that nature is beautiful and that, to understand life, humans must appreciate nature. \\"The Eagle\\" shows Tennyson's appreciation of nature. Although Tennyson has a reputation of a quiet, polite Englishman among other literary figures, he was once part of a small group who traveled to the border of Spain to deliver money and messages to Spanish Revolutionaries. While he did eventually fall out of the project, he came to enjoy the Pyrenees Mountain Range. This mountain range on the border of France and Spain came to be his favorite place, along with the nearby valley called the Cauteretz. \\"The Eagle\\" was inspired by Tennyson's frequent travels to the Pyrenees. He frequently saw eagles, raptors, and other birds of prey circling above him in this area. In the poem, Tennyson opted to create an imaginary setting of cliffs by the sea, instead of the mountainside. Tennyson is known for his imagery and transcendental vantage points. Analysis Although iambic pentameter was the popular rhyme scheme of the time, Tennyson wrote this poem in iambic tetrameter. The end rhymes add to the lyrical sense of the poem and the soothing, soaring nature of eagle. This poem is one of Lord Tennyson's shortest pieces of literature. It is composed of two stanzas, three lines each. Contrary to the length, the poem is full of deeper meaning and figurative language. Often literary scholars believe the poem is short to emphasize the deeper meaning in nature itself, that the reader has to find themselves. Tennyson's use of alliteration in the words clasps, crag and crooked, in the first line is meant to sound like a melody and make it harder to pass over. This technique makes a reader stop and consider the meaning of the line; this also draws attention to the eagle, making it seem even more important than just a bird. He continually draws emphasis to the eagle, making it seem regal and better than the average human. This idea, of nature being better than humans, is part of Romanticism. Due to its title, the poem is generally considered an incomplete piece of work. However, some literary critics believe that the poem is, in fact, complete due to the overall symbolism within the poem. Scholars argued that the fragment is a symbol for the eagle due to the eagle \\"breaking away\\" from the mountain. They say that the fragment is vital to understanding the poem in the way that the mountain depicted is in fact the whole poem and the eagle, being a part of the mountains identity, is a loss when the eagle falls. The uncertainty of the poem being complete or incomplete reinforces the open ended question of what happens to the eagle at the end of the poem. Another theory surrounding the poem is that the eagle represents Christians. The Eagle was written in 1851, the same year the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851 was passed in England making it a criminal offense for anyone outside the Church of England to use any episcopal title. Tennyson may have written the poem to represent how Catholics were strong and could separate themselves from the English government. \\"He clasps the crag with crooked hands\\" could represent how the eagle, or Catholics, held onto what they once had, the support of the government. \\"Close to the sun in lonely lands\\" could represent how Catholics were made to be illegal and were alone. \\"The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls; He watches from his mountain walls\\" shows how the government needed Catholics, based on Tennyson's writing. The English government suffered and \\"crawls\\" and the Catholics stand there watching this collapse happen. \\"Like a thunderbolt he falls\\" represents how the eagle, or Catholics, needs to stay strong and separate themselves from the beliefs of the English government.

This implies that integral homology groups in all dimensions of X are isomorphic to the corresponding homology groups of a point. In other words, using the idea of reduced homology, :\\\\tilde{H}_i(X)=0, \\\\quad \\\\forall i\\\\ge 0. It is common to consider such a space as a space without \\"holes,\\" for example, a circle or a sphere is not acyclic but a disc or a ball is acyclic. This condition however is weaker than asking that every closed loop in the space would bound a disc in the space, all we ask is that any closed loop--and higher dimensional analogue thereof--would bound something like a \\"two-dimensional surface.\\" The condition of acyclicity on a space X implies, for example, for nice spaces--say, simplicial complexes--that any continuous map of X to the circle or to the higher spheres is null-homotopic. If a space X is contractible, then it is also acyclic, by the homotopy invariance of homology. The converse is not true, in general. Nevertheless, if X is an acyclic CW complex, and if the fundamental group of X is trivial, then X is a contractible space, as follows from the Whitehead theorem and the Hurewicz theorem. Examples Acyclic spaces occur in topology, where they can be used to construct other, more interesting topological spaces. For instance, if one removes a single point from a manifold M which is a homology sphere, one gets such a space. The homotopy groups of an acyclic space X do not vanish in general, because the fundamental group \\\\pi_1(X) need not be trivial. For example, the punctured Poincar√© homology sphere is an acyclic, 3-dimensional manifold which is not contractible. This gives a repertoire of examples, since the first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group. With every perfect group G one can associate a (canonical, terminal) acyclic space, whose fundamental group is a central extension of the given group G. The homotopy groups of these associated acyclic spaces are closely related to Quillen's plus construction on the classifying space BG. Acyclic groups An acyclic group is a group G whose classifying space BG is acyclic; in other words, all its (reduced) homology groups vanish, i.e., \\\\tilde{H}_i(G;\\\\mathbf{Z})=0, for all i\\\\ge 0. Every acyclic group is thus a perfect group, meaning its first homology group vanishes: H_1(G;\\\\mathbf{Z})=0, and in fact, a superperfect group, meaning the first two homology groups vanish: H_1(G;\\\\mathbf{Z})=H_2(G;\\\\mathbf{Z})=0. The converse is not true: the binary icosahedral group is superperfect (hence perfect) but not acyclic.

The STJ also has original jurisdiction over some cases. Its competence is described in Article 105 of the Brazilian Constitution of 1988. A Special Appeal (in Portuguese, Recurso Especial) can be made to this court when a judgement of a court of second instance offends a federal statutory provision or when second instance courts have issued different interpretations of the same federal statute. By rule, the STJ decides only questions of law, not any questions of fact and the probatory elements on the case, about which the Second Instance Courts give the last word. As in other superior courts in Brazil, STJ's justices are called \\"ministers\\" (), not to be confused with ministers from the executive branch. History The courtroom Prior to late 1988, Brazil had only the Supreme Federal Court (, STF) as the Court of last resort, which would hear all highest appeals of mostly any matters, including other Higher, National Courts. As demand on the Judiciary was becoming intense, with a growing number of suits and cases, largely the result of the accessibility generated by the multiplication of first instance Courts, the STF found itself in a critical situation of unmanageable volume of service, urging for a correcting measure. As the National Constitution Assembly started in 1987, one of the earliest projects to be included and eventually approved was the creation of a new National Court, to parallel with the already existing Superior Labour, Military and Electoral Tribunals, placing the STF on a higher degree. It was the beginning of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), to which were transferred most of the issues then heard by the STF. The STJ was physically placed on the building previously occupied by the Federal Court of Appeals ( , also called TFR, or ). The TFR was a stand-alone Tribunal mainly designed to hear all ordinary appeals from decisions by Federal Judges. Although having a parallel jurisdiction to second-instance State Courts, its judges were called \\"Ministers\\", denomination given to Justices from higher Courts. It was extinguished by the 1988 Constitution, which distributed all its competence to the new Federal Regional Courts (a total of five, placed around the national territory), with the Ministers from the TFR becoming the initial Justices of the STJ. The Superior Court of Justice had its competence slightly altered by Amendment 45/2004, which transferred to the Court cases like the homologation of foreign court orders.

Painted in vivid pink, blue, and green, the expression of the sailor is playful and primitive. The sailor's stylized face is a mask, a collection of angles and deep lines. An icon of Fauve portraiture, The Young Sailor II shows greater simplicity and more distortion than the first version of the painting. Contrary to the first version, the second uses more vivid colors which are more blended and distorted. The figure drawing is more succinct, and made up of fewer lines. The young man has a soft body- his legs lazily straddle widely, his head hangs at a small angle. He has a quick curve for a nose, and youthful lips. The whole figure is so logically condensed that it's hypnotizing. Recently established research indicates the model for Young Sailor II was an eighteen-year-old fisherman named Germain Augustin Barth√©l√©my Montarg√®s (1888‚Äì1938). Overall, between the flat, bold color planes and the simplified figure of the boy, Young Sailor II seems to be a more childlike expression of the first portrait. Many elements of the painting are not articulated totally, but implied, rather. The sailor's footwear is a good example. His booties or shoes are not very visible, it's not clear if he is wearing boots for work or leisure. But the decorative elements are there, simplified as they are. The sailor's hands are also a summation of figurative hands. Painted as large gloves of color, fingers are dashes, his palm is shown on his left hand in one deep v-shape. There is a major contrast between the still, mask-like quality of the sailor's face and the wild, frenetic brushstrokes of his clothing. Whereas the sailor's eyebrows, nose, and lips all are painted in concrete, heavy lines, his pants and sweater are composed of moving, wild painted curves and turns. The folds of the jumper (sweater) alone mimic the rushing, lapping waves of the sea from where the boy probably just returned. The sailor was painted in Collioure, during Matisse's \\"fauve summer.\\" He had been painting great self-portraits when he convinced an eighteen-year old fisherman to pose for him. When he returned to Paris, Matisse had both a drawing and a painting of the young man to show. The work Matisse brought back seemed to have been created in a whirlwind. The first version of the painting is more figurative, the second ‚Äì one of the greatest works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art- is more abstract and strategic. Alfred H. Barr Jr. saw in the sailor's face an expression of ‚Äúalmond-eyed charm verging on prettiness.‚Äù His theatrical, sweetly aggressive features set against a candy-pink background make this one of the most arresting portraits in the Metropolitan collection. It was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection, in 1998 (1999.363.41).

It is the sticky substance in bread wheat which allows dough to rise and retain its shape during baking. The same, or very similar, proteins are also found in related grasses within the tribe Triticeae. Seed glutens of some non-Triticeae plants have similar properties, but none can perform on a par with those of the Triticeae taxa, particularly the Triticum species (bread wheat, durum wheat, etc.). What distinguishes bread wheat from these other grass seeds is the quantity of these proteins and the level of subcomponents, with bread wheat having the highest protein content and a complex mixture of proteins derived from three grass species (Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops tauschii strangulata, and Triticum monococcum). Triticeae seed proteins fall into four groups:It is the sticky, glue-like properties of glutens from this taxa that are most useful in the food production industry. Grass storage proteins ‚Äì the Glutens. * albumins ‚Äì soluble in hypotonic solutions and are coagulated by heat * globulins ‚Äì soluble on 'isotonic' solutions * prolamins ‚Äì soluble in aqueous alcohol * glutelins ‚Äì are soluble in dilute acids or bases, detergents, chaotropic or reducing agents. Of these proteins the last two, prolamin (in wheat ‚Äì gliadin) and glutelin (in wheat ‚Äì glutenin) form the classically defined gluten components in wheat. Triticeae glutens are primarily important to a developing definition 'gluten-free' in dietary treatments for gluten sensitivity which are intended to exclude pathogenic proteins from the diet of susceptible individuals (namely coeliac disease). The poisonous motifs appear to be spread widely in Triticeae, but not other taxa, for most coeliacs. However all four proteins are involved in wheat allergies, and proteins from non-wheats may not be involved in certain gluten allergies, or in idiopathic sensitivities.

Wheat has three genomes (AABBDD) and it can encode for many variations of the same protein, even in the gliadin subcategories many types of gliadin per cultivar, X = genome (A, B, or D genome chromosomes (1 to 7)). The A and B genomes are derived from wild emmers wheat which in turn is a natural digenomic species that contains a Triticum monococcum- and Aegilops speltoides-like genome. The D genome is derived from the extant species Aegilops tauschii strangulatum. *Glutenins and gliadins on Chromosome 1 **short arm (Chromosome 1) *** œâ-gliadin ‚Äì (Gli-X1 ‚Äì A is null @ 84%, B (>8 alleles), D (>4 alleles)) *** glutenin, LMW ‚Äì (Glu-X3 ‚Äì A (>5 alleles), B (>7 alleles), D (>2 alleles)) *** Œ≥-gliadins, most ‚Äì (Gli-X3), homologous proteins exists in Barley. *** Œ≤-gliadins, few ‚Äì variants of Œ≥-gliadin that migrate with Œ≤-gliadins? ** long arm (Chromosome 1) *** glutenin, HMW (Glu-X1 ‚Äì A (>2 alleles), B (>8 alleles), D (>4 alleles)) *Gliadins on Chromosome 6 (A, B and D genomes) ** short arm (‚âà30 coding loci over A, B, D undeterminant alleles) *** Œ±-gliadin ‚Äì (Gli-X2) *** Œ≤-gliadins, most ‚Äì (Gli-X2) variants of Œ±-gliadin with alter isoelectric points. *** Œ≥-gliadins, few ‚Äì (Gli-X2) variants of Œ±-gliadin that migrate with Œ≥-gliadins? The genetic studies indicate that in wheat, each protein type can be encoded by several loci and several different alleles for each loci can be found in different genomes, allowing a great number of uniquely encoded isoforms. =Biochemistry of Triticeae prolamins and glutelinsChemical behavior= *Gliadins, an example of the prolamins in Triticeae, are separated on the basis of electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric focusing. ** Œ±-/Œ≤-gliadins ‚Äì soluble in low percentage alcohols. ** Œ≥-gliadins ‚Äì ancestral form of cysteine rich gliadin with only intrachain disulfide ** œâ-gliadins ‚Äì soluble in higher percentages of alcohol and acidic acetonitrile. *Cultivar glutelins in Triticeae ** Glutenin is 35-40% of wheat (Triticum aestivum) protein. ** Glutenin in wheat forms long covalantly interlinked polymers of two repeating subunits. *** High molecular weight (HMW) ‚Äì proline-less (Glu-1 locus) *** Low molecular weight (LMW) ‚Äì Œ±-gliadin-like polypeptide (Glu-3 locus) ** Barley (Hordeum) has two glutelins, soluble at high pH, precipitates at low pH. *** Œ±-glutelin (major component, HMW) ‚Äì cuts at 1 to 3% rel. saturation ammonium sulfate *** Œ≤-glutelin (minor component) ‚Äì cuts at 18% rel. saturation ammonium sulfate ** Rye (Secalin) has one glutelin *** HMW ‚Äì (equivalent of Barley Œ±-glutelin) *** LMW ‚Äì subspecies sylvestre has (Glu-R3) glutenin-like (Ssy1, Ssy2 and Ssy3 loci) As substrates for enzymes Tissue transglutaminase =Modification of glutamine= Prolamins and to a lesser degree glutelins are excellent substrates for deamidation particularly by mammalian tissue transglutaminases (tTG). Deamidation is a process in which the R-C0-NH2 portion of glutamines (or asparagine) is hydrolyzed to R-CO-OH forming glutamic acid or aspartic acid. In gliadin, the -QQP-, -QVP-, -QLP-, -QYP- tripeptides in the context of favorable adjacent peptides are readily deamidated. Most proteins have few or no such transglutaminase sites; however alpha gliadin has 13 such sites. Human tissue transglutaminase not only deamidates gliadin, but it also crosslinks itself to gliadin, which has immunological consequences. Gliadin also has a small peptide that appears to alter the distribution of transglutaminase in the gut but is not crosslinked, the mechanism of its 'innate' behavior is not clear. tTG also crosslinks gliadin to other proteins via these sites, generating anti-food responses, anti-self protein responses, and self-crossreactive responses to food proteins that result in secondary autoimmunities. The role of tTG in the extracellular matrix is to crosslink lysine side chains of proteins such as collagen to proteins, however glutens appear to infiltrate into the small intestine, interfering with this process and resulting in a false immune recognition of the matrix and surrounding cells as foreign, leading, ultimately, to the destruction of the intestinal mucosa. Seeds of certain plants may elicit the innate and cellular responses as a defensive response to overconsumption of seeds. =Proteolysis= While prolamins and glutelins are excellent deamidase and transaminase substrates the highly repetitive motifs, particularly polyproline/glutamine tracts, are often poor substrates for gastroentestinal endoproteases, such as those produced in the GI tract. One clear example is a 33-mer of Œ±-2 gliadin. Another digestion resistant region is a 25-mer which contains the innate peptide. The alpha gliadins, which bear these sites, specifically are poisonous to young rats when fed at concentrations higher than 1% and the addition of mannosidase inhibitors increases the sensitivity specifically to alpha gliadins. These properties of certain alpha-gliadins appear to have evolved to prevent long-term or dedicated consumption of certain wheat grasses by certain species. This is one of the ironic properties of wheat, since a major advantage of wheat is the amount of protein in the wheat, however, some of this is wasted to the gut flora (or host immune system) since it cannot be broken down. One suggested remedy to this problem are new enzymes that help specifically break prolamins in the stomach. This may prevent the onset of wheat related disease in susceptible individuals, but no such screening is currently effective and once the clinical state is reached most individuals are so sensitive to wheat gliadins that, effectively, complete digestion in the stomach would be required. Immunochemistry of Triticeae glutens The immunochemistry of Triticeae is important in several autoimmune diseases (see section on Human Disease), and gluten sensitivity and gluten allergy in general. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), Class II mediated presentation (HLA DQ), Class I meditiated stimulation of killer cells, and Antibody recognition. The DQ restricted class II mediated presentation of gliadin to T-helper lymphocytes appears to be the primary process involved in coeliac disease.  Triticeae glutens and industry  Glutens are an essential part of the modern food industry. The industry of wheat goes back to before the Neolithic period when people process grain berries (or corns) singley by hand. During the early phase of cultivation wheats were selected for their harvestability and growability under various climate conditions resulting in the first cultivars. This industry spread into many areas of western Eurasia during neolithization, carrying the more primitive cultivars. These grains were capable of being used for soups (speltiods) or tediously ground into simple flours and baked goods. During the second phase an Emmer wheat was produced that was an alloquadraploid species and this contained more gluten, making baking more efficient. This also spread during the neolithization but in places such cultivars were a minority. One variant of emmer wheat is called durum wheat and is the source of semolina flour, used in making pastas and other food pastes. Comparable varieties are found throughout Eurasia. Finally, emmers wheat was combined with a goat grass (Aegilops tauschii) to form allohexaploid bread wheat, which has a soft fine texture after rising and cooking. The industrial properties of this wheat are based in its glutens, glutens of high elasticity, high heat tolerance of other glutens or that change when subjected to heat to produce stronger polymers. =Comparing wheat gluten with corn (Zea) glutens= Corn is prepared by boiling in water with alkali then grinding, resulting in a de-skinned material called nixtamalized masa. Masa can be used for tortillas, tamales, chips and other products, but it must be used quickly because its glutens change rapidly and binding decreases rapidly. Masa does not store well and chemicals are added to enhance preservation at the expense of quality. In contrast the glutens in wheat have more adhesive properties that change when prepared in different ways. The glutenins, for example, stretch, but can also fix their shape at high temperatures, causing bread to maintain its characteristic rise. =Important Triticeae composites= When the flour is combined with water and yeast the dough can be risen and subsequently fixed by heat resulting in a hard outer shell with a soft palatable interior. This makes bread amicable for both transport and preserves the bread for several days (in dry conditions). Barley can be sprouted for a short period and roasted, the resulting malt can be ground for food or combined with bread yeast (currently a brewers variety) to produce beer and distilled spirits such as whiskey, vodka and sourdough malts. Adding mild acid to rye flour activates it for bread making (Sourdough breads used in northern Europe). Asian dumpling Adding egg to T. durum semolina flour can be used to make pastas, or without egg a pasta variant used to make Chinese dumplings. Wheat or semolina flour can be added other ingredients such as fish, meat or milk to create food pastes. Wheat can be further processed to a very fine flour and sifted, alternatively the glutens either can be extracted and readded to other products. While many seed glutens and food gums when combined with food starch, come close to creating the refined products of wheat flour and durum flour, no combination has yet come close to the qualities of these flours at a comparable price. Malted barley =Malting= Some triticeae cultivars, like barley, have relatively low protein values. This makes them more acceptable for brewing without wasting soil nutrients. Seed storage proteins in grass seeds (i.e., gluten in wheat) are designed to help the plant grow during its early life, and among the seed proteins are enzymes that convert starch to sugar.Beer These proteins are activated during sprouting and the starch around the endosperm is converted to sugars. Later the prolamins are broken down to provide the young seeds with a source of nitrogen and energy giving the Triticeae seedling a great boost during early life. Once the starch is converted to sugar it can be readily fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, first the sprouting process should be stopped. In order to do this, the partially sprouted grains are placed in a roasting oven and roasted until the sprouts are sterilized and dried. This process of sprouting and drying is called malting. Then the roasted sprouts are ground, rehydrated and fermented. This produces a crude beer. =Gluten deamidation= The deamidation potential for wheats is discussed above. Glutens are generated by the wheat starch industry. Glutens however are more difficult to handle once starch and other proteins are removed, for example, alcohol-soluble glutens cannot be mixed with dairy since the alcohol denatures and precipitates dairy proteins. Therefore, gluten is often modified for commercial use by deamidation by treatment with acid at high temperatures, or enzymatic treatment with deamidase or transglutaminases. The increased charge increases the hydrophilicity of gliadins, causing them to stretch out in solution. Deamidation of 20% of glutamine side chains to glutamate suffices to generate a soluble product. This renders gluten soluble enough without alcohol to mix with other products like milk.  Triticeae and human disease  Individuals who suffer from gluten-sensitive enteropathy/coeliac disease have an adverse reaction to the gluten in cultivars of Triticeae when eaten. In addition to bread wheat, rye and barley (which have similar glutens) are known to cause symptoms in coeliacs. Between 2 and 10% of gluten sensitive individuals are also sensitive to oats, but it is not clear how much of this is due to contamination of triticeae seeds in oats or allergic responses (versus intolerance). Therefore, when broadly applied the designation of gluten-free applies to foods bearing the seed storage proteins derived from Triticeae.

He was the CEO and founder of the multi-disciplinary design firm The Norsworthy Fund (2005-2010) as well as creator of N HOME, a line of bedding and home accessories developed in partnership with television shopping channel QVC (UK), which he presented on the channel from 2011-2014, making him the first black interior designer to have his own home design brand on a TV shopping network. Additionally, he is responsible for numerous design projects, including many iconic music videos, sets, interiors, and events. Norsworthy‚Äôs interdisciplinary practice is a fusion of fine art, video and multiple design disciplines. A graduate of Princeton University, he began his career working as a designer for the architect Michael Graves. His interest in the role of architecture in entertainment and pop culture led him to explore art direction and production design. Norsworthy is notable for his work as production designer for a number of iconic, genre-defining music videos and televised performances for artists such as Britney Spears, Missy Elliott, Salt-N-Pepa, Erykah Badu, Madonna, Destiny's Child, Busta Rhymes, Aretha Franklin, Jay-Z, and Sean Combs (P. Diddy). These projects encompass a two decade span in which Norsworthy designed award-winning films, videos, and commercials, working with well-known directors such as Matthew Rolston, Hype Williams and Spike Lee. He was elected and served on the New York Chapter Board of Governors for the Grammy Awards from 1999‚Äì2000. Norsworthy‚Äôs art has been exhibited in numerous galleries and institutions. Most significantly, his work was shown at the Studio Museum in Harlem as part of the groundbreaking exhibition \\"Harlemworld: Metropolis as Metaphor\\" organized by curator Thelma Golden in 2004. His piece, entitled \\"Reparation Tower, Harlem\\", was a full- scaled sales office for a luxury high-rise in the form of an upraised fist.

WTVML was originally developed by Ian Valentine and Patrick Sansom in a company called waptv. After demonstrating the ability to develop Interactive TV services using web infrastructures and XML, and successfully deploying them to existing TV set-top-boxes over dial up modems, the company was acquired by BSkyB. The technology was first used to launch Sky's interactive betting service on December 6th 2000, and later became the basis of a large number of \\"red button\\" channel portals and internet based interactive services. The format follows a strict XML syntax (DTD) that has been developed in response to multiple user requirements by BSkyB, and is now being enhanced by Miniweb Interactive. The format was standardized through ETSI as TS 102 322.ETSI Website WTVML has the potential to unify the Interactive TV content creation industry, which has been hampered by proprietary \\"middlewares\\" and a lack of browser standards. The fragmentation of technologies available to build Digital TV platforms has meant that typical web site operators have had no common content format available to them to allow them to develop their TV Site once, and deploy it unchanged across multiple networks and devices. Some newer set-top boxes (particularly IPTV devices) use various versions of HTML browsers. Many of these have proprietary TV extensions, and different deployment characteristics, which result in untested services being deployed unfaithfully or worse with run-time errors. Due to the need for explicit layouts, as well as other reasons, many designers attempting to create TV Style services using HTML browsers need to make extensive use of JavaScript, which has the result of further inhibiting interoperability, and requires manual testing of a service before it is deployed by the majority of networks, thus essentially closing a network from open internet access. WTVML services can be automatically and dynamically transformed into various forms of HTML/JS/CSS, making them compatible with traditional web browsers as well as WTVML native browsers, and allowing the network operator to manage his platform specific features independently from the standard used by the web site authors. WTVML follows a web 2.0 style model, in that complete applications are DTD driven, allowing TV Style services to be created without the use of Script.

An action-comedy, the film concerns a father and son who accidentally steal a painting by Rembrandt. A Danish/UK co-production, the film was directed by Jannik Johansen and written by Anders Thomas Jensen and Jannik Johansen. The film was premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Relation to real events On 29 January 1999, Rembrandt's \\"portrait of a lady\\" (as well as another painting by Bellini) was stolen from the poorly protected Nivaagaard Samlingen in Niv√• in Denmark. The depiction in the film of the level of security at that time is fairly accurate, as well as the involvement of bounty hunters as civilian agents in the case. Also, the persons involved were related as depicted, although the role of the father (Mick in the movie) was actually the uncle (of Tom in the movie).

Mourre, dressed in the habit of a Dominican friar and backed by his co-conspirators, chose a quiet moment in the Easter High Mass to climb to the rostrum and declaim before the whole congregation a blasphemous anti-sermon on the death of God, penned by Berna.Snarkout: to have done with the judgment of god!

The aftermath The action and the events leading up to and following it are described in detail in Michel Mourre's autobiography.Michel Mourre, In Spite of Blasphemy, John Lehmann, 1953; translated from the French by A.W. Fielding The authors of the action, young bohemians tied to Lettrism, an avant-garde movement surrounding Isidore Isou, were all arrested by the police, and thereby saved, in effect, from the furious mob that chased them from the church.Greil Marcus (1989) Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century, preview at Google books, pp.279-86 The only one held for any length of time was Mourre, himself a former Dominican friar and the instigator of the whole affair. As his fate was being decided, dozens of prominent voices from culture, the church and the state joined a debate in the newspapers on the merits or (more commonly) not, of the provocation. In particular Combat, an organ of the French Resistance, began with a commentary by its editor Louis Pauwels condemning the action; but a vehement letter in response by Andr√© Breton, attacking Pauwels for his \\"partial account,\\" and defending the actions, escalated the debate;Boucharenc, Myriam (2005) L'universel reportage, pp.94-6Breton, Andr√© (1950) Lettre a Louis Pauwels\\" sur le ¬´\\"scandale\\" de Notre Dame¬ª, in Combat, April 12, 1950, OC III, pp.1024-5 to it were devoted eight days of coverage and a running editorial forum amounting to a total of twenty-some articles by such figures as Jean Paulhan, Pierre Emmanuel, Maurice Nadeau, Messieur the Police Commissioner, le cur√© de Saint-Pierre de Chaillot, Gabriel Marcel, Benjamin P√©ret, and Ren√© Char. The police and the Church, for their part, unable to let the insult pass unpunished, nevertheless wanted to avoid amplifying it through a public trial. After a few days they brought in a psychiatrist of questionable integrity, who recommended locking Mourre away in an asylum. Participants in the Combat debate, attentive to the case, protested, and upon the intervention of a second psychiatrist, Mourre was released on 21 April. The scandal resonated into the heart of the Lettrist movement. Consistent with practices of agitation on which Isou had founded his movement in 1945, the Notre-Dame affair nevertheless put Isou's radicality, and that of his supporters, to the test. The action thus advanced a nascent rupture in the movement, between two blocs which could be called, respectively, \\"artistic\\" and \\"actionist,\\" a rupture which two years later would lead to a schism and formation of the Lettrist International. It was after Gil J. Wolman, Jean-Louis Brau, and Guy Debord, the principal agents of this schism, joined the Lettrist movement, siding with the actionist Ultra- Lettrist bloc still distinguished by the Notre-Dame Affair, and who, along with Ivan Chtcheglov and Berna, formed the LI. It was the LI, launched on the occasion of an intervention directed against Charlie Chaplin, that between 1952 and 1957 experimented with new forms of art and action that would lead to the Situationist International. The contributors to the Combat debate sought to diminish the importance of the Notre-Dame action by pointing out that it was not entirely without precedent, as, on 22 March 1892, young Blanquistes had interrupted mass, shouting \\"Long live the Republic! Long live the Commune! Down with the Church!\\" References Notes Sources * Combat. April 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 & 21, 1950. Paris. * Greil Marcus.

The game featured the #6 Orlando Predators (7-5) of the National Conference against the #1 Tampa Bay Storm (10-2), also of the National Conference. This would be the very first ArenaBowl to have the \\"War on I-4\\" rivalry featured in it. For the Predators, this was their third ArenaBowl appearance in their first five years of existence (having lost ArenaBowls VI and VIII). For the Storm, this was their fourth overall appearance (their second for Tampa Bay) with a chance to get three titles in five years. Game summary In the first quarter, Orlando made the opening move with WR/DB Barry Wagner getting a two-yard touchdown run, as well as a two-point conversion run. Tampa Bay responded with quarterback Jay Gruden completing a 10-yard touchdown pass to WR/LB Stevie Thomas, along with FB/LB Cedric McKinnon rushing into the end zone for the two-point conversion. The Predators responded with quarterback Pat O'Hara completing a four-yard touchdown pass to WR/LB Alex Shell, yet the Storm immediately answered with OS George LaFrance returning the kickoff 57 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, it was all Tampa Bay; Gruden and LaFrance hooked up with each other on a 3-yard and a one-yard touchdown pass to take the lead going into halftime. In the third quarter, Orlando drew closer as Wagner returned a blocked field goal three yards for a touchdown, yet the unfazed Storm went back to work with Gruden and Thomas hooking up with each other again on a 35-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT). In the fourth quarter, the Predators played some catch-up as OL/DL Flint Fleming got a 14-yard touchdown run, yet Tampa Bay put some distance between themselves and the Predators with Gruden getting a one-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak (with a failed two-point conversion) and WR/DB Tracey Sanders returning an interception 47 yards for a touchdown. Orlando got another touchdown with O'Hara completing a three-yard touchdown pass to Wagner with exactly one minute left, but there was no \\"Miracle Minute\\" for the Predators as the Tampa Bay Storm got their third ArenaBowl title in five seasons.

Before its 2009 merger with Nationwide, it was the largest building society in Scotland and the 12th largest in the United Kingdom based on total assets of ¬£3.3 billion at 31 December 2007. It was a member of the Building Societies Association. On 28 March 2009, reports indicated the Society was no longer viable, and would be put up for public sale, to be managed by the Bank of England. This process led to acquisition of the Society's branches, good loans and deposits by the Nationwide Building Society with the Bank of England assuming control of ¬£1bn in commercial lending and the Society's poorer- quality and shared ownership mortgages. The Dunfermline was fully integrated into Nationwide in June 2014. History A former branch of the Dunfermline in Inverness The Dunfermline was established in 1869 in the town of Dunfermline from which it took its name. It expanded throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and acquired over 20 other organisations including: the Stenhousemuir, Peebles, Fourth Fifeshire Investment Company, the Stirlingshire, and the Edinburgh and Paisley Building Society. A telephone banking service, Dunfermline Direct, was launched during Spring 1999. By the end of 2005, the Society had 34 branches and 38 agencies throughout Scotland. Around 20% of its business was generated outwith Scotland. The Society also had a large commercial lending book and was leading the way in investment in social housing. =2009 financial crisis= In the 6 months running up to March 2009 the Board explored various options to secure an injection of capital (between ¬£60m and ¬£100m) which would allow the Building Society to continue operating as an independent mutual building society. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) stated that such capital would not be possible. On 28 March 2009, reports indicated the building society was no longer viable, toxic assets would be stripped out and the remaining business put up for public sale, to be managed by the Tripartite Authorities (Bank of England, FSA and HM Treasury). BBC Scotland business editor Douglas Fraser broke the story, where a ¬£26m loss was announced in late March 2009. Around 500 jobs are at risk, where half are employed at its headquarters in Fife and half in the network of 34 branches. It was announced on 30 March that the Nationwide Building Society had bought the retail and wholesale deposits, branches, head office and most of the residential mortgage book of the Dunfermline, with the Bank of England assuming control of ¬£1bn in commercial lending. Dunfermline became a trading division of Nationwide. On 24 October 2013, Nationwide announced that Dunfermline Building Society would be merged with the company.

Within the state of Louisiana, the highway travels from the national southern terminus at I-10 in LaPlace to the Mississippi state line north of Kentwood. The route is located in the southeastern portion of Louisiana and parallels the older U.S. Highway 51 (US 51) corridor. While passing through the city of Hammond, I-55 intersects two of the state's major east‚Äìwest routes, I-12 and US 190\\\\. It also serves the smaller city of Ponchatoula, as well as the towns of Amite City and Kentwood. I-55 is a major highway through the New Orleans metropolitan area, the city being located east of the junction between I-10 and I-55. It also serves as an important hurricane evacuation route for the region. I-55 was opened in several stages beginning in 1960 with a bypass of Ponchatoula and Hammond. The southern of I-55, consisting of a twin-span viaduct through the Manchac swamp, was completed in 1979 and is one of the longest bridges in the world. Route description=Manchac swamp= The Manchac Swamp Bridge, which carries I-55 over the Manchac Swamp From the south, I-55 begins at an interchange with I-10 (exit 210) at the northern edge of LaPlace, an unincorporated community located about west of New Orleans. A pair of ramps accommodate traffic heading to and from the city with the remaining movements provided by exit 1, a nearby half-diamond interchange with US 51\\\\. The first of I-55 consist of a four-lane concrete viaduct known as the Manchac Swamp Bridge, which cuts through the thickly wooded swamp along the western shore of Lake Pontchartrain. For this entire stretch, I-55 is co-signed with US 51, and the latter's ground-level pre-interstate alignment serves as a frontage road along the northbound span. The structure is only shorter than the nearby Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, the world's longest continuous bridge over water, and both serve to connect the New Orleans area with its suburban outgrowth north of the lake. After , I-55 elevates higher to cross Pass Manchac, a short waterway connecting Lake Pontchartrain with Lake Maurepas that historically served as an international boundary during the 18th and 19th centuries. It is currently the boundary between Louisiana's St. John the Baptist and Tangipahoa parishes. The community situated along the pass is called Manchac and features a number of boat houses and fishing camps flanking the highway. About north of the Manchac exit, I-55 descends to ground level, and an exit primarily serving southbound traffic marks the end of the frontage road. =Tangipahoa Parish= I-55 immediately curves to the northwest while US 51 Bus. splits off straight ahead into the small city of Ponchatoula. The surroundings having transitioned from swampland to pine forest, I-55 skirts the western edge of Ponchatoula, which is served by a cloverleaf interchange with LA 22\\\\. US 51 departs from the interstate at the following exit, and both routes enter the larger adjacent city of Hammond. Shortly afterward, I-55 engages in a full cloverleaf interchange with I-12, a northern bypass of the New Orleans metropolitan area. Two further exits serve Hammond. The first connects to US 190, which parallels I-12 through the region and passes through downtown Hammond. The second connects to LA 3234 (University Avenue) and provides access to Southeastern Louisiana University. From Hammond northward into Mississippi, I-55 parallels US 51 and generally travels due north on an alignment approximately to the west. All further exits are diamond interchanges with rural east‚Äìwest state highways primarily connecting to the various communities along US 51\\\\. These include: LA 442 to Tickfaw; LA 40 to Independence; LA 16 to Amite City; LA 1048 to Roseland; LA 10 to Greensburg; and LA 440 to Tangipahoa. North of Tangipahoa, I-55 passes through the town of Kentwood and has its final exit in Louisiana, which connects to LA 38\\\\. later, the Louisiana Welcome Center provides a rest area and services for southbound drivers entering the state. Continuing northward, I-55 crosses into Mississippi and proceeds toward the cities of McComb and Jackson. =Route classification and data= I-55 alternates between a rural and urban interstate over the course of its route, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 41,800 vehicles in Hammond, staying between approximately 15,000 and 25,000 vehicles otherwise. The posted speed limit is . I-55 is a designated hurricane evacuation route for the New Orleans metropolitan area and southeastern Louisiana in general. A contraflow lane reversal may be instituted from I-12 northward into Mississippi to facilitate the movement of traffic out of the area. The entire I-55 frontage road (Old US 51) south of Ponchatoula is part of the Southern Swamps Byway in the state-designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. This byway also follows the route of LA 22 southwest from Ponchatoula through the Maurepas swamp to the town of Sorrento. The portion of I-55 within Tangipahoa Parish has been officially designated as the Congressman Jimmy Morrison Highway since 2003. During his lengthy term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Hammond native James H. Morrison (1908‚Äì2000) was responsible for securing 40% of Louisiana's Interstate Highway System and was instrumental in getting I-12 routed through the city. History=Planning and initial construction= Before the existence of I-55, the main traffic route connecting New Orleans with Jackson, Mississippi and Memphis, Tennessee was US 51\\\\. Beginning in the late 1930s, the US 51 corridor was included in preliminary plans for what would become the Interstate Highway System. Construction of the system was finally authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on June 29 of that year. The route was officially designated as I-55 on August 14, 1957 and was part of the of Interstate Highway initially allocated to the state of Louisiana. As the existing U.S. Highways were adequately handling traffic through rural areas in most cases, the Louisiana Department of Highways decided on a strategy to relieve traffic in urban areas first. A bypass around Ponchatoula and Hammond was listed by the department as one of ten priority projects and was therefore the first section of I-55 to be placed under contract. Completed in the fall of 1960 at a cost of $3.5 million, it was one of the first Interstate Highway segments to be opened to traffic in Louisiana. Spanning , the bypass was designed to connect seamlessly with US 51 at either end, facilitating the flow of traffic around the west side of both downtown areas and eliminating four right-angle turns. The construction of I-55 running northward from Hammond to the Mississippi state line, a distance of , was completely underway by the fall of 1964. It was the first roadway segment in Louisiana to be paved using an economical and time-saving method known as slip forming, or continuously poured concrete. A section of I-55 from Roseland, Louisiana to Magnolia, Mississippi was opened jointly by the two state highway departments on June 16, 1967. The within Louisiana cost $9.8 million. The resulting gap between Hammond and Roseland was opened in the fall of 1969 at a cost of $12.6 million. This completed the highway between the cities of Hammond, Louisiana and Jackson, Mississippi. =Manchac swamp= The southern portion of I-55 between LaPlace and Ponchatoula was constructed last. Building the highway through the Manchac swamp would be the most expensive and difficult project on the state's portion of I-55, as it had been for US 51 four decades earlier. When construction of the Interstate Highway System was authorized in 1956, the swamp section of US 51 was in the process of being entirely rebuilt on an improved embankment adjacent to the original 1927 roadbed, which was narrow and suffering from subsidence. As part of this project, the original bascule bridge across Pass Manchac was being replaced with a higher fixed span. The initial plans for I-55 called for utilizing the new US 51 roadbed and bridge upon completion, but since both were designed to accommodate two lanes of traffic, an additional two lanes would have to be added later to satisfy interstate standards. The new Pass Manchac Bridge was opened in August 1957, and the reconstructed two-lane US 51 was completed in stages between 1962 and 1964. In 1970, the final portion of I-10 connecting the future I-55 with New Orleans was nearing completion. This consisted of a twin-span viaduct across the LaBranche swamp and the Bonnet Carr√© Spillway. That year, construction began on a $14.5 million interchange between the two freeways. In November 1971, the Louisiana Department of Highways announced that the plans for I-55 had changed to consist of twin two-lane viaducts from the Manchac area southward with the existing ground-level US 51 serving as a frontage road alongside the northbound span. While greatly increasing the cost of construction, the elevated spans would not be subject to flooding and would require less maintenance in the long run. The frontage road would also allow the surrounding area to remain accessible to local hunters and fishermen. The highway department and local residents lobbied to have the entire route elevated on the basis that a ground-level roadway north of Manchac would negatively impact the swamp's ecosystem and also be unstable in the long term. Due to the cost element, this proposal was turned down by the Federal Highway Administration. In October 1974, however, the agency relented after overwhelming local opposition and an environmental impact survey were presented during a series of public hearings. Meanwhile, construction of the elevated I-55 had begun in November 1973. A canal was dredged through the swamp along the entire right-of-way, allowing pre-stressed concrete roadway segments to be floated in by barge from the contractor's plant across Lake Pontchartrain. On September 13, 1976‚Äîone month before the new Pass Manchac Bridge was placed under construction‚Äîa barge struck the parallel US 51 bridge, knocking a section of it into the water. Several vehicles plunged off the bridge, but the only fatality was ironically an employee of the construction firm building the I-55 spans who happened to be traveling on the highway at that time. After an initial estimate of six months, the bridge was repaired in half that time, aided by the proximity of the I-55 construction crew. It was reopened to traffic on December 17, 1976 at the same time the section of I-55 between I-10 and the Ruddock exit was ready for travel. The remainder of the distance north from Ruddock to Ponchatoula, including the new Pass Manchac bridge, was completed and opened to traffic following its dedication by Governor Edwin Edwards on May 25, 1979. With a length of , the elevated portion of I-55 became one of the longest bridges over water in the world. Its final cost was approximately $159 million, bringing the total construction cost of I-55 in Louisiana to about $181 million. =Worst road status and reconstruction= The first major repair project on I-55 was carried out during 1988 and 1989. It involved an $8.1 million reconstruction of much of the Ponchatoula‚ÄìHammond bypass, which was the oldest portion of the highway. Another project before the turn of the century was the addition of a diamond interchange at LA 3234 (Wardline Road) near Hammond, improving access to Southeastern Louisiana University. After almost two decades in the works, this project was completed in the fall of 1998. By the end of the 20th century, the concrete pavement on I-55 north of Hammond had significantly deteriorated, giving the highway a reputation as one of the worst in the state. Its appearance atop a 2010 Reader's Digest list of \\"The 7 Worst Roads in America\\" was reported in the local media. Between 2008 and 2011, a $79.3 million project was carried out that gave the entire stretch of I-55 from Hammond to the Mississippi state line a complete overhaul. This was accomplished by rubblizing the existing concrete surface to serve as a base for a new asphalt surface. Though shortening the life expectancy of the highway, this method had the benefit of being quicker and more cost-effective than replacing the concrete panels and would require less maintenance over time. Additionally, since I-55 is a designated hurricane evacuation route, the highway could be fully opened to traffic during construction within 48 hours' notice if needed.

Early life Colin Dunlop Wilson Rankin was born on 20 January 1869 at Galston, Ayrshire, Scotland, the second son of William Rankin, colliery manager, and his wife Jane, n√©e Anderson. He was educated at Galston Public School and Kilmarnock Academy. Rankin accompanied his family to Queensland when his father became manager of the Queensland Collieries Co. Ltd. at Howard (near Maryborough) in 1884. Rankin joined its staff and from 1886 the Queensland Defence Force. By 1890 he was assistant company manager, grew sugar at Tigh-na-Bienne at Isis, Queensland (near Bundaberg, north of Howard), and became a clerk and valuator with the Isis Divisional Board (1890‚Äì1899). Family life Rankin married Annabelle Davidson Thomson on 5 September 1906 at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Maryborough; they settled on his plantation. They had two daughters, Annabelle (born 1908)Queensland Registrar-General, Index of Births, Deaths and Marriages and Jean. Annabelle became the first woman to enter the Parliament of Australia from Queensland. The family lived in Brooklyn House in Howard (now heritage-listed). Boer War A major when the South African War broke out, Rankin volunteered for service and on 13 January 1900 sailed with the Second Queensland Contingent. He was appointed second-in-command of the First Australian Regiment of Mounted Infantry and saw action at Diamond Hill, Riet Vlei and elsewhere. Invalided to England, Rankin returned to Queensland in March 1901. In 1903 he was promoted lieutenant colonel of the Wide Bay Infantry Regiment, assuming command in 1906. Politics Rankin tried to enter the Queensland Legislative Assembly by contesting the Burrum in the 1899 Queensland colonial election. When the Shire of Howard was formed in 1903, he was elected as a council member and as shire chairman. In the 1904 election, Rankin stood unsuccessfully again in Burrum. On 14 May 1905, George Martin, the Labour member for Burrum, died. Standing as an independent candidate, Rankin won the resulting by-election on 17 June 1905 and entered the Queensland Legislative Assembly. He held the seat through the 1907, 1908, 1909, 1912, and 1915 state elections. Rankin promoted rural interests during his thirteen years in parliament. He became a council- member of the Australian Sugar Producers' Union. His membership of the Farmers' Parliamentary Union (Country Liberal Party from 1913), however, exacerbated disunity among government ranks. After unsuccessfully challenging Denham's leadership, Rankin was Secretary for Railways from 6 April 1915 to 1 June 1915, and then became deputy leader of the Liberal Opposition when Labor won the May election. His time in the legislative assembly when he lost Burrum in the 1918 Queensland state election on 16 March 1918 to Labour candidate Albert Whitford. First World War During the First World War Rankin served briefly in 1915 with the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt before appointment to command the 11th Brigade in the newly formed 3rd Division, as temporary brigadier general from 1 May 1916. On Salisbury Plain in England, he was dismissed by Major General John Monash as \\"incapable\\". He returned home in November, and retired with the honorary rank of colonel in February 1917. Later life In 1919, when his brother, William Charles Rankin, died he succeeded him as general manager of the Queensland Collieries. As managing director in 1924‚Äì1940, Rankin continued a tradition of paternal despotism. He had found the company in poor shape with a falling output and inadequate coal reserves; charges have also been made of 'intense exploitation, sub-standard conditions and hard-fistedness'. He courageously took out new leases in the Burrum district and opened new mines which helped the company to weather the Depression of the 1930s. Rankin died in a private hospital in Brisbane on 2 November 1940, survived by his wife and two daughters, and was buried with Anglican rites in Howard Cemetery. ReferencesBibliography * * W. J. E.

Early life and education Qin Liangyu was born in Zhongzhou (Âø†Â∑û), which is in present-day Zhong County, Chongqing, to ethnic Miao parents. Her father, Qin Kui (Áß¶Ëëµ), obtained the position of a gongsheng (Ë≤¢Áîü) in the civil service examination. He believed that girls should receive the same education as boys, so he made Qin Liangyu study history and the Confucian classics with her brothers. He also taught them martial arts. Qin Liangyu learnt martial arts more deeply than her brothers and became proficient in archery and horse-riding. She was also known for her skill in poetry. Marriage to Ma Qiancheng In 1595, Qin Liangyu married Ma Qiancheng (È¶¨ÂçÉ‰πò), the tusi and xuanfushi (ÂÆ£Êí´‰Ωø; \\"Announcing and Pacifying Commissioner\\") of Shizhu County, and accompanied him in minor battles against local warlords in the southwestern border of the Ming Empire. They had a good marriage and he often sought her advice. In 1599, when Yang Yinglong (Ê•äÊáâÈæç) started a rebellion in Bozhou (Êí≠Â∑û; present-day Zunyi, Guizhou), Ma Qiancheng brought 3,000 riders with him to suppress the revolt while Qin Liangyu brought an additional 500 to support her husband. They successfully quelled the rebellion and destroyed the rebel camps. In 1613, Ma Qiancheng offended Qiu Chengyun (ÈÇ±‰πòÈõ≤), an influential court eunuch, and ended up being arrested and imprisoned. He died in prison later. Qin Liangyu succeeded her husband as the xuanfushi of Shizu County. Those under her command were known as the White Cavalry (ÁôΩÊùÜÂÖµ). Resisting rebel forces in Sichuan In 1620, Qin Liangyu's elder brother, Qin Bangping (Áß¶ÈÇ¶Â±è), led 3,000 White Cavalry to Liaodong to resist invaders from the Manchu- led Later Jin dynasty. He was killed in action at the Battle of Hun River (Ê∏æÊ≤≥‰πãÊà∞). In 1623, Qin Liangyu assisted Ming forces in suppressing the She-An Rebellion in Sichuan and Guizhou led by She Chongming (Â•¢Â¥áÊòé) and An Bangyan (ÂÆâÈÇ¶ÂΩ•). In the following year, her elder brother, Qin Minping (Áß¶Ê∞ëÂ±è), was killed in battle by An Bangyan's forces. In 1630, when Later Jin forces besieged the Ming capital, Beijing, Qin Liangyu led forces from Sichuan to reinforce the capital. The Chongzhen Emperor showered her with praises in poetry and presented her with four poems as she passed through Beijing. In 1634, when Zhang Xianzhong's rebel army invaded Sichuan, Qin Liangyu and her son, Ma Xianglin (È¶¨Á••È∫ü), led their troops to attack the rebels, defeated them at Kuizhou (Â§îÂ∑û; present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing) and drove them away. In 1640, Qin Liangyu defeated another rebel force led by Luo Rucai (ÁæÖÊ±ùÊâç) in Kuizhou and Wushan. In recognition of her contributions to the Ming Empire, the Chongzhen Emperor appointed her as the Crown Prince's Guardian (Â§™Â≠êÂ§™‰øù) and awarded her the title \\"Marquis Zhongzhen\\" (Âø†Ë≤û‰æØ; lit. \\"Loyal and Chaste Marquis\\"). Later life and death The Ming Empire was overthrown in 1644 by rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, and its former territories were conquered by the Later Jin dynasty (later renamed to Qing dynasty). Some Ming loyalists formed a remnant state, the Southern Ming dynasty, in southern China to resist the Qing dynasty. Its nominal ruler, the Longwu Emperor, also granted Qin Liangyu a marquis title. Qin Liangyu controlled part of Shizhu County and her policy of agricultural self-sufficiency made her region attractive for refugees. She helped about 100,000 refugees to settle down in Shizhu. Qin Liangyu died in 1648 and was buried in present-day Yachun Village, Dahe District, Shizhu County, Chongqing. She was given the posthumous name \\"Zhongzhen\\" (Âø†Ë≤û; lit. \\"Loyal and Chaste\\") and was survived by her son, Ma Xianglin (È¶¨Á••È∫ü). Legacy Qin Liangyu's life, along with her weapons and armour, is showcased in a museum in Shizhu County, Chongqing. A statue of her is in the Ganyu Hall of the Shibaozhai in Zhong County (that was preserved during the Three Gorges Project).DiscoverYangtze Together with Hua Mulan, Liang Hongyu and He Yufeng, Qin Liangyu is one of the most well-known female warriors in China. In popular culture Qin Liangyu sometimes appears as a door goddess, usually in partnership with Mu Guiying.

He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball with the Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs from 1989-93. Known for his blazing speed and strong arm, he played several different positions, most often at shortstop and in center field. Minor leagues Yelding was a star athlete at Fairhope High School in Fairhope, Alabama and was later drafted in the 1st round of the 1984 MLB amateur draft out of Chipola College by the Toronto Blue Jays. He made an immediate impact with his speed and arm, stealing 93 bases and adding 19 outfield assists in his first 200 games with the Medicine Hat Blue Jays and Kinston Blue Jays. Because of his strong arm, he was moved to shortstop the following season with the Ventura County Gulls. Although he found success with the bat and on the basepaths, hitting .280 with 41 steals, he made 58 fielding errors. He divided the 1987 year between the Myrtle Beach Blue Jays and Double-A Knoxville Blue Jays, where he stole a combined 83 bases, though his fielding did not improve as he made another 59 errors. Despite being a liability in the infield, his prowess on the basepaths earned him a promotion to the AAA Syracuse Chiefs where he was moved to second base in an attempt to alleviate his fielding woes. Although his play in the field was still suspect, he did cut his season error total to 35 while hitting .250 and stealing 59 bases for the Chiefs. Major leagues=Houston Astros= On December 5, 1988 Yelding was selected by the Chicago Cubs from Toronto in the Rule 5 draft. He was waived by the Cubs and selected off waivers by the Houston Astros the following April. In order to satisfy the Rule 5 terms, the Astros were mandated to either keep Yelding on the major league club for the entire season or forfeit their rights to him. Faced with the dilemma of having a player not yet ready for everyday play on their roster, but not wanting to lose their rights to what they considered a future star, the Astros used Yelding primarily as a pinch hitter and pinch runner. He appeared in 70 games, but played the field in only 38 of them and recorded just 102 plate appearances. The Astros' patience with Yelding paid early dividends, as he became their full-time leadoff hitter in 1990 and finished second in the National League with 64 stolen bases. Though he improved and even showed flashes of brilliance in the field, his defense was still subpar though he did show his versatility by appearing at second base, third base, shortstop, and in the outfield. Unfortunately, 1990 would be his last full season in the major leagues. He missed half on 1991 due to injury and struggled when healthy. He had only 8 at-bats for the Astros in 1992, spending most of the season with the AAA Tucson Toros. On July 10, 1992, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Rich Scheid. He finished the 1992 season with the Vancouver Canadians before being released by the White Sox at the end of the season. He was signed by the Cincinnati Reds during the winter, but released during spring training in 1993 before being signed for the second time by the Chicago Cubs. =Chicago Cubs= Yelding was used by the Cubs primarily as a utility infielder and pinch hitter/runner. Although his fielding had greatly improved since his early days with the Astros (with two errors in 32 games at second base in 1993), he struggled with the bat, hitting .204. He missed a large part of the 1993 season due to injury, as well as the following year, in which he appeared in 29 games with the Iowa Cubs. He never appeared in another major league baseball game, although he did play in spring training as a replacement player for the Cleveland Indians during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike. Yelding spent 1995 and 1996 in the Indians and Seattle Mariners minor league systems between stints in independent leagues. He made one final comeback attempt in 1999, playing for two independent teams, before retiring for good.

Several different versions were made in the ancient world, with different editions of the Old and New Testament in five of the dialects of Coptic: Bohairic (northern), Fayyumic, Sahidic (southern), Akhmimic and Mesokemic (middle). Biblical books were translated from the Alexandrian Greek version. The Sahidic was the leading dialect in the pre-Islamic period, after the 11th century Bohairic became dominant and the only used dialect of the Coptic language. Partial copies of a number of Coptic Bibles survive. A considerable number of apocryphal texts also survive in Coptic, most notably the Gnostic Nag Hammadi library. Coptic remains the liturgical language of the Coptic Church and Coptic editions of the Bible are central to that faith.  Old Testament  Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele III, MS I B 18. Translators of books of the Old Testament into Egyptian dialects were naturally made from the Alexandrian Greek version (Septuagint), and there is no reason to doubt that they were translated at as early a date as the Gospels and Epistles, if not indeed before them. Portions of the Old Testament exist in each Egyptian dialect. In Sahidic, some Biblical books survived with complete text, as well as a large number of extant fragments representing most of the canonical books and certain of the deutero-canonical (the two Wisdoms, the Epistle of Jeremiah, and the Greek additions to Daniel).

The Sahidic was the leading dialect in the pre-Islamic period. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century , but most texts come from the 9th century and later. = Sahidic = The collection of manuscripts of Sahidic translations is often designated by copsa in academic writing and critical apparatus (\\"Sa\\" for \\"versio Sahidica\\" in BHS). The first translation into the Sahidic dialect was made at the end of the 2nd century in Upper Egypt, where Greek was less well understood. So the Sahidic is famous for being the first major literary development of the Coptic language, though literary work in the other dialects soon followed. By the ninth century, Sahidic was gradually replaced by neighbouring Bohairic, and disappeared. Knowledge of the Sahidic manuscripts was lost until they were rediscovered in the 18th century. In 1778 Woide issued a prospectus in which he announced his intention of publishing from Oxford manuscripts the fragments of the New Testament \\"iuxta interpretationem dialecti Superioris Aegypti, quae Thebaidica seu Sahidica appellantur\\". Another fragments were published in 1884 by √âmile Am√©lineau.E. C. Am√©lineau, Fragments coptes du Nouveau Testament dans le dialecte th√©bain, Recueil de travaux relatifs √† la philologie, V (1884), pp. 105-139.

Probably, it was made in the beginning of the 3rd century. It was a very literal translation; many Greek words, and even some grammatical forms (e.g. syntactic construction ŒºŒµŒΩ ‚Äî Œ¥Œµ) were incorporated to this translation. For this reason, the Bohairic translation is more helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text than any other ancient translation. It should also be noted that the Bohairic translation was influenced by several variables, including the other dialects, primarily Sahidic and Fayyumic. When the patriarchate moved from Alexandria to Cairo in the 11th century, Bohairic was the dominant language of the Coptic church. As the official dialect of the Coptic Orthodox Church, Bohairic seems to enjoy a strong relationship with mainly the other dialects, Egyptian Arabic and‚Äîas it was for several centuries‚ÄîGreek. The text is mainly Alexandrian, somewhat influenced by the Western text-type. The Bohairic translation is designated by copbo.

The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union have been credited with leading to a marked decrease in this form of terrorism.David C. Wills page 219 Brian Crozier, founder and director of the Institute for the Study of Conflict, has said that communism was the primary source of both state-sponsored and non-state terrorism.Brian Crozier page 203 History In the 1930s, the term \\"communist terrorism\\" was used by the Nazi Party in Germany as part of a propaganda campaign to spread fear of communism. The Nazis blamed communist terrorism for the Reichstag fire, which they used as an excuse to push through legislation removing personal freedom from German citizens.Conway pp17Gadberry pp7 In the 1940s and 1950s, various Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, witnessed the rise of communist groups engaging in terrorism. John Slocum claimed that communists in present-day Malaysia used terrorism to draw attention to their ideological beliefs,Slocum pp75 but Phillip Deery countered that the Malaysian insurgents were called communist terrorists only as part of a propaganda campaign.Phillip Deery. The Terminology of Terrorism: Malaya, 1948‚Äì52. Journal of Southeast Asia Studies, Vol. 34, No. 2 (June 2003), pp. 231‚Äì247. In the 1960s, the Sino‚ÄìSoviet split (between two communist states) led to a marked increase in terrorist activity in the region.Weinberg pp14 That decade also saw various terrorist groups commencing operations in Europe, Japan, and the Americas. Yonah Alexander deemed these groups Fighting Communist Organizations (FCOs),Alexander pp16Harmon pp13 and says they rose out of the student union movement protesting against the Vietnam War. In Western Europe, these groups' actions were known as Euroterrorism.Harmon pp58 The founders of FCOs argued that violence was necessary to achieve their goals, and that peaceful protest was both ineffective and insufficient to attain them.Drake pp102Sandler pp10 In the 1970s, there were an estimated 50 Marxist or Leninist groups operating in Turkey, and an estimated 225 groups operating in Italy. Groups also began operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom.Alexander pp51-52 These groups were deemed a major threat by NATO and the Italian, German, and British governments.Paoletti p202 Communist terrorism did not enjoy full support from all ideologically sympathetic groups. The Italian Communist Party, for example, condemned such activity.Richard Drake. Terrorism and the Decline of Italian Communism: Domestic and International Dimensions. Journal of Cold War Studies, Volume 12, Number 2, Spring 2010 1531-3298 Background While Vladimir Lenin systematically denounced the terrorism practiced by the Socialist Revolutionaries and opposed regicide, he also supported terror as a tool, and considered mass terror to be a strategic and efficient method for advancing revolutionary goals. According to Leon Trotsky, Lenin emphasized the absolute necessity of terror and as early as 1904, Lenin said, \\"The dictatorship of the proletariat is an absolutely meaningless expression without Jacobin coercion.\\" In 1905, Lenin directed members of the St. Petersburg \\"Combat Committee\\" to commit acts of robbery, arson, and other terrorist acts. Not all scholars agree on Lenin's position towards terrorism. Joan Witte contends that he opposed the practice except when it was wielded by the party and the Red Army after 1917. She also suggests that he opposed the use of terrorism as a mindless act but endorsed its use in order to advance the communist revolution. Chaliand and Blin contend that Lenin advocated mass terror but objected to disorderly, unorganized, or petty acts of terrorism. According to Richard Drake, Lenin had abandoned any reluctance to use terrorist tactics by 1917, believing that all resistance to communist revolution should be met with maximum force. Drake contends that the terrorist intent in Lenin's program was unmistakable, as acknowledged by Trotsky in his book Terrorism and Communism: a Reply, published in 1918. In the book, Trotsky provided an elaborate justification for the use of terror, stating \\"The man who repudiates terrorism in principle, i.e., repudiates measures of suppression and intimidation towards determined and armed counterrevolution, must reject all ideas of the political supremacy of the working class and its revolutionary dictatorship.\\" Trotsky's justification largely rests on a criticism of the usage of the term \\"terrorism\\" to describe all political violence on behalf of the Left, but not equally vicious political violence carried out by liberal or reactionary factions. Scholars on the Left argue that while it is a matter of historical record that communist movements did at times employ violence, the label of \\"terrorism\\" is disproportionately used in Western media sources to refer to all political violence employed by the left, while similarly violent tactics employed by the United States and its allies remain unscrutinized. Examples=Bulgaria= The St Nedelya Church assault on the 16 of April 1925 was committed by a group from the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). They blew up the roof of the St Nedelya Church in Sofia, Bulgaria. 150 people were killed and around 500 were injured. =Cambodia= The Cambodian genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge, which led to the death of an estimated 1.7 million to 2.5 million people has been described as an act of terrorism by Joseph S. Tuman.Tuman pp180 =China= Benjamin A. Valentino has estimated that the atrocities committed by both the Nationalist government and the Communists during the Chinese Civil War resulted in the death of between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people between 1927 and 1949.Valentino p88 In the late 1940s, the United States Department of State reported that after World War II, communist terrorism‚Äîincluding looting, massacres, and forced conscription into militias‚Äîin China surpassed the actions of Imperial Japan.Van Slyke pp752 =Indonesia= The Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) had been engaged in what perceived as an act of terrorism during a communist rebellion in 1948, as well as the failed coup attempt in 1965; the latter of which culminated in a sadistic anti-communist politicide and a subsequent regime change into a right-wing military dictatorship following the unrest. =The Philippines= The New People's Army (NPA) founded in 1969 has been described as the third largest terrorist group operating in the Philippines. The group carried out attacks between 1987 and 1992 before entering a hiatus. Between 2000 and 2006, they carried out an additional 42 attacks.Cox pp97 =Rhodesia= In Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980), during the Bush War of the 1970s, guerrillas operating in the country were considered communist terrorists by the government. The organisations in question received war materiels and financial support from numerous communist countries, and they also received training in several of those same countries, including the Soviet Union, China and Cuba. Both guerrilla armies involved in the war‚Äîthe Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), and the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) attached to the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU)‚Äîwere initially based in the Lusaka area of Zambia, so as to be within striking distance of Rhodesia.Windrich page 279 ZANU and ZANLA moved their bases to Mozambique's Tete Province around 1972, and based themselves there until the war's end in 1979. ZIPRA remained based in Zambia. In line with the Maoist ideology professed by its parent organisation, ZANU, ZANLA used Chinese Maoist tactics to great effect, politicising the rural population and hiding amongst the locals between strikes. While ZIPRA conducted similar operations to a lesser extent, most of its men made up a conventional-style army in Zambia, which was trained by Cuban and Soviet officers to eventually overtly invade Rhodesia and openly engage in combat against the Rhodesian Security Forces. This ultimately never happened. =Soviet Union= After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the use of terrorism to subdue people characterized the new communist regime. Historian Anna Geifman stated that this was \\"evident in the regime's very origins.\\" An estimated 17,000 people died as a result of the initial campaign of violence known as the Red Terror.Geifman pp21 Lenin stated that his \\"Jacobian party would never reject terror, nor could it do so,\\" referring to the Jacobian Reign of Terror of 1793-1794 as a model for the Bolshevik Red Terror.Marcus C. Levitt page 152-153 Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka (the Soviet secret police), widely employed terrorist tactics, especially against peasants who refused to surrender their grain to the government.Richard W. Mansbach page 336 Upon initiating the New Economic Policy (NEP) Lenin stated, \\"It is a mistake to think the NEP has put an end to terrorism. We shall return to terrorism, and it will be an economic terrorism\\".David Schmidtz page 191 =South Africa= During the apartheid era in South Africa, the government under the Afrikaner National Party deemed the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, communist terrorists. As a result, a series of laws were introduced by the government, such as the Suppression of Communism Act, which defined and banned organizations and people that the government considered communist. In 1967 the government promulgated the Terrorism Act, which made terrorist acts a statutory crime and implemented indefinite detention against those who were captured. =Vietnam= During World War II the communist Viet Minh fought a guerilla campaign led by Ho Chi Minh against the Japanese occupation forces and, following Japan's surrender, against the French colonial forces. This insurgency continued until 1954 as the Vietminh evolved into the Vietcong (VC), which fought against both the South Vietnamese government and American forces.Mockaitis pp23 These campaigns involved terrorism resulting in the deaths of thousands.Crenshaw pp503Pedahzur pp114 Although an armistice was signed between the Viet Minh and the French forces in 1954, terrorist actions continued.Freeman pp192 Carol Winkler has written that in the 1950s, Viet Cong terrorism was rife in South Vietnam, with political leaders, provincial chiefs, teachers, nurses, doctors, and members of the military being targeted. Between 1965 and 1972, Vietcong terrorists had killed over 33,000 people and abducted a further 57,000.Winkler pp17Forest pp82 Terrorist actions in Saigon were described by Nghia M. Vo as \\"long and murderous.\\" In these campaigns, South Vietnamese prime minister Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng was the target of an assassination attempt; in 1964 alone, the Vietcong carried out 19,000 attacks on civilian targets.Vo pp28/29 Infant victim of Dak Son massacre Historian and former U.S. State Department analyst Douglas Pike has called the Massacre at Hu·∫ø one of the worst communist terrorist actions of the Vietnam War.Lanning pp185 Estimates of the losses in the massacre have been cited as high as 6,000 dead.{Anderson, David L. The Columbia Guide to the Vietnam War. 2004, page 98-9}Brown pp163 The United States Army recorded as killed \\"3800 killed in and around Hu·∫ø, 2786 confirmed civilians massacred, 2226 civilians found in mass graves and 16 non Vietnamese civilians killed.\\"Krohn pp126 While some historians have claimed that the majority of these deaths occurred as the result of US bombing in the fight to retake the city, the vast majority of the dead were found in mass graves outside the city.T. Louise Brown pp163 Benjamin A. Valentino has estimated a total death toll of between 45,000 and 80,000 people between 1954 and 1975 from VC terrorism.Valentino p88 Douglas Pike also described the ƒê·∫Øk S∆°n massacre, in which the Vietcong used flamethrowers against civilians in ƒê·∫Øk S∆°n, killing 252, as a terrorist act.Lanning pp185-186 In May 1967, Dr. Tran Van-Luy reported to the World Health Organization \\"that over the previous 10 years Communist terrorists had destroyed 174 dispensaries, maternity homes and hospitals.\\"Rigal-Cellard pp229 Ami Pedahzur has written that \\"the overall volume and lethality of Vietcong terrorism rivals or exceeds all but a handful (e.g. Algeria, Sri Lanka) of terrorist campaigns waged over the last third of the twentieth century,\\"Pedahzur pp116 and that the VC used suicide terrorism as a form of propaganda of the deed.Pedahzur pp117 Arthur J. Dommen has written that the majority of those killed due to VC terrorism were civilians, caught in ambushes as they traveled on buses, and that the group burnt down villages and forcibly conscripted members.Dommen pp503 See also *Left-wing terrorism *Right-wing terrorism *Nationalist terrorism *List of designated terrorist organizations *Political violence *Revolutionary terror *Terrorism and the Soviet Union *State terrorism *Totalitarianism *Islamic terrorism ReferencesBibliography *Gellately, Robert.

After the frigate captured her she was sold and her new owners employed her as whaler. She visited the Galapagos islands in July 1823.Dalton (1990). In 1824, while under the command of John Palmer, she discovered Phoenix Island, later known as Rawaki Island (also Kanton Island). She is last listed in 1829. French privateer Ph√©nix was built in Bordeaux in 1809. In 1810 she was under the command of Jacques Fran√ßois Perroud, a notable French captain with a long history of privateering. Under Perroud's command, Ph√©nix made a number of captures. On 25 January 1810 the privateer Phoenix, of 20 guns and 110 men, belonging to Bordeaux, captured Donna Maria, Lunes, master, which had been sailing from Boston to Lisbon. However, on 9 February recaptured Donna Maria on 9 February; she arrived at Plymouth on 24 February.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4436 - accessed 18 November 2015. On 13 March, the English ship Chatham, which had sailed from Georgia with a cargo of rice and cotton, arrived at Paimb≈ìuf. Chatham was a prize to Phoenix, of Bordeaux.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4445 - accessed 18 November 2015. On 12 September 1810, Aigle captured Ph√©nix. Aigle was at at 11a.m. on 12 September when she sighted a strange sail coming towards her. The unknown vessel approached but as she got within about 9 miles of Aigle turned and sailed away from her. Aigle gave chase and after 13 hours and 130 miles succeeded in capturing her quarry. Captain Wolfe, of Aigle, was fulsome in his praise of Phoenix, her master, and crew. He described Phoenix as \\"nearly new, strong built, and Copper fastened.\\" She had outsailed four pursuers in the 50 days she had been out and Aigle only caught her due to a fortuitous gale of wind; on the way into Plymouth, the captured Phoenix always led Aigle. Perroud had exhibited superior seamanship until the wind enabled Aigle to come up. Lastly, Phoenixs crew was \\"the best Crew I ever saw, composed of strong, healthy, active, stout young Seamen.\\" Phoenix, of \\"18 Guns and 120 Men\\", arrived at Plymouth at the end of September.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4497 - accessed 18 November 2015. At about the same time Agenoria too arrived in Plymouth. Phoenix had on 24 August captured the American bark Agenoria, which had been sailing from New Orleans to Liverpool with a cargo of cotton, but had recaptured her. Phoenix had also captured, on 14 August, the English brig Unity, which had been carrying a cargo of fish from Newfoundland to Lisbon. British whaler Phoenix first appeared in the supplement to Lloyd's Register for 1811. Her owner's name is given as Gould & Co., and her master as William Pyke. Initially, her trade was given as Plymouth to London. Pyke received a letter of marque on 7 June 1811. In 1812 her master became \\"Parker\\", and her trade changed to London‚ÄìSouth Seas, that is she became a whaler.Lloyd's Register (1812), seq. no. P284. In 1812 her owner became Daniel Bennett, owner of several whalers, and she embarked for the South Seas whale fisheries in February 1812.Clayton (2014), pp.189-90. Phoenix returned to London in 1813 with 205 tons of sperm oil. She then sailed for the whale fisheries again, returning in May 1814, before leaving again in August. In 1815 her trade became Plymouth - London.Lloyd's register (1815), seq. no. P295. However, Captain R. Murray took command in 1815 while Phoenix was in the Australia and New Zealand grounds after Parker broke a leg. That year, Phoenix was recorded as being in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. By 1816 Parker was again master, and Phoenix was no longer armed.Lloyd's Register (1816), Seq. no. P309. Phoenix was reported to be at on 22 September 1817 on her way from London to the South Seas.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 5226. Lloyd's Register for 1821 gives Phoenix a new master with J. Bennett replacing Parker.Lloyd's Register (1821), seq. no. P266. Phoenix and Bennet were reported to be at on 18 November 1821 with 133 tons of sperm oil.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 5717. Then in 1823 Lloyd's Register shows Palmer replacing J. Bennet as master.Lloyd's Register (1823), seq. no. 296. William Dalton signed on to Phoenix as a doctor a year after qualifying in medicine, and shortly before she sailed in February 1823. He would go on to keep a journal of the voyage that has proved a useful source for a number of discoveries and observations. On 23 February 1824 Palmer discovered an island at that he named Phoenix Island. On 5 August Phoenix, Captain John Palmer, and , Captain Edward Reed, visited Kanton Island. Dalton named the island, at , Mary Ballcott's Island. In April 1825 Captain Reed transferred to Phoenix from Frances, which had rescued him and his crew after Mary had wrecked in January. Phoenix returned to England in November 1825. Fate Phoenix sailed on 5 December 1828. She was reported on 22 January 1830 to have been at Tahiti. Then James Colvin reported at Honolulu that Phoenix had been lost at Mounts Bay.British Southern Whale Fishery Database ‚Äì voyages: Phoenix. Phoenix is last listed in Lloyd's Register and in the Register of Shipping in 1829. The Register of Shipping has her master as W. Phillips. Bennett is still her owner and her trade is still London‚ÄìSouth Seas fishery.Register of Shipping (1829), Seq. ‚ÑñP323. Building a career One of her crew was Robert Clark Morgan, who rose through the ranks to become a captain of a whaling ship. On Phoenix he was an apprentice (June 1814 - June 1819), able seaman (June 1819 - September 1822), 2nd Mate (January 1823 - November 1825), and 1st Mate (May 1826 - September 1828). He then became master on Sir Charles Price, another Bennett whaler. Painting Phoenix has been immortalized in J. Steven Dews' painting \\"The Whaler Phoenix off Greenwich 1820\\".

However demand grew for the band to perform, and this they did, relying on banks of portable cassette recorders to provide their samples. This was enough of a success for their debut LP Year One (1982) to be composed entirely of live material. However, Craine left the band after the album's release. A remastered version of the album that also includes the first single was rereleased in 2007 as \\"Year One (Again)\\" by Hotbox Review =Another Miracle/Consider Museums 45= The single was recorded at MRS Studio in Houston at the beginning of 1980, with Bobby Ginsburg doing the engineering on an 8-track board.

Webb came equipped with lyrics for both songs while Craine had preworked the drum machine sounds and some synth sounds. Webb provided tape loops (the 'Don' and 'Adele' yells and screams denoted on the record sleeve) and Craine has said in previous interviews that he taped the climatic scene of the movie 'Attica' to provide the gunshots used at the end of 'Concentration Camps'. The tape loops were then 'treated' by running them through Craine's synth and the resulting output was duly recorded (Craine is alleged to have been a major Eno enthusiast). Webb and Craine enlisted guitarists Al Trazz (Plastic Idols) and Dan Workman To flesh out the initial sparse sound. While the Trazz parts were worked out and rehearsed in the studio, Workman's guitar tracks were improvised and done in one take in keeping with the band's initial Throbbing Gristle philosophy. Recording and mixing was done over two or three nights with no overdubbing or studio effects other than studio reverb supplied by Ginsburg. The cover illustration was done by Webb and the first pressing also included a self-addressed postcard showing the Houston Museum of Fine Art. Reviews were generally strong, including one that likened the band's sound to that of a 'stalking metronome'. Breaking their initial vow to never play live, Webb and Craine added Workman to the line-up and began to gig. After one such show, Bill Loner (Plastic Idols) declared the trio needed a bass player and he too was added to the band's ranks. =Tacky Souvenirs of Pre-Revolutionary America= In 1986 the band released their most famous work. Tacky Souvenirs of Pre-Revolutionary America comprised 14 tracks of the band's satirical lyrics overdubbed onto popular songs by the original artists. For example, the Beach Boys' \\"California Girls\\" was turned into \\"They Wish They All Could Be California Punks\\", a sideswipe at unoriginality in Punk Rock. There were also overdubs of tape loops and other sound effects. The lyric sheet carried the message \\"Home-taping is killing the record industry, so keep doing it.\\" The backing tracks were used without permission and the band soon faced legal threats from some of the original copyright holders. The album was listed in the British New Musical Express yearlist for 1987. =1990s= Despite the band's new-found cult status (which led to tours of the US West Coast and even Europe), financial and intra-band problems led to a split in 1990. One problem was that most record labels shied away from releasing their material after Tacky Souvenirs. However, in 1993 the band reconvened to work on a new album, Short CD (1995). Home Made Authority followed in 1998. Notes on gear A Korg Minipops drum machine was used in the early work. Factory presets could be overridden by forcing down two of the rhythm selections simultaneously to provide a hybrid version, a tactic often used by Webb and Craine. Dan Workman favored a Les Paul through a Roland amp. He also shouted into the guitar pickups for additional vocal effects. Bill Loner usually played a Gibson EB3 and also provided the saxophone tracks. Loner also played an Arp Axxe on occasion, notably on the Year One Bongoloid tracks. Jim Craine played an EMS Synthi AKS. This particular version was equipped with an audio- in which allowed Craine to run outside sound sources through the synth for treatment, usually sampled cassette tapes assembled by Webb. Craine occasionally played a Hagstrom 8-string bass and a modified Arp Pro Soloist and provided flute tracks on at least one Year One song. Extra electronic percussion was provided by using very early Boss drum pad triggers. In addition to providing the vocals, Perry Webb assembled tape loops that were then amplified and played through the house PA system. Webb also played a Telecaster copy on selected songs during live performances Discography * 1980: \\"Another Miracle\\"/\\"Consider Museums as Concentration Camps\\" (7\\" single) * 1981: Reset split LP with Hiroshima Chair; most of Culturcide's material later appeared on Year One.(Dogfood Production System) * 1982: Year One (LP)(CIA Records) * 1986: Tacky Souvenirs of Pre-Revolutionary America (LP)(no label) * 1991: \\"A Day at My Job\\"/\\"Mommy and I Are One\\" (7\\" single)(Nuf Sed) * 1995: Short CD (CD)(Double Naught) * 1998: Home Made Authority (CD)(Delayed) * Undated: \\"Santa Claus Was My Lover\\"/\\"Depressed Christmas\\" (7\\" single) * Undated: split single with Caroliner Rainbow; two untitled tracks.

Early years Shashikala Jawalkar was one of six children born in Solapur, Maharashtra to a Hindu Bhavsar Shimpi caste Marathi speaking family. By age 5, she had already been dancing, singing and acting on stage in many towns in Solapur district. When Shashikala was in her pre-teens, through ill luck, her father became bankrupt, and he brought his family to Bombay (now Mumbai), where they thought that Shashikala, the best-looking and most-talented among his children, could find work in movies. For some time, the family lived with friends and barely survived, while Shashikala wandered from one studio to another looking for work. She earned in bits and pieces till she met Noor Jehan, the reigning screen queen. Noor Jehan's husband Shaukat Hussain Rizvi, was making the movie Zeenat then, and included Shashikala in a qawwali scene. She worked with Shammi kapoor in film Daku (1955). She struggled on and got small roles in movies made by P. N. Arora, Amiya Chakravarti, and a few other producers. She got roles in V. Shantaram's Teen Batti Char Raasta (1953) and a few other movies. While in her early twenties, Shashikala met and married Om Prakash Saigal, who belonged to the Kundan Lal Saigal family, and had two daughters. Acclaimed supporting roles In 1959, she appeared in Bimal Roy's Sujata. In Tarachand Barjatya's Aarti (1962), starring Meena Kumari, Ashok Kumar, and Pradeep Kumar, Shashikala portrayed a negative role, eventually winning a Filmfare Award.

She played a negative character in Chhote Sarkar (1974) starring Shammi kapoor and Sadhana. While her female lead costars usually played roles of good-natured, modest, or pious women, Shashikala usually played either flighty and feisty bubbly women or vamps who plotted the downfall of others. Later in her acting career, she would typically play the role of a sister or mother-in-law. She performed in supporting roles in more than 100 films. Recent acting roles In the past ten years, she has performed in a few television serials, including Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai for Sony, Apnaapan for Zee TV, Dil Deke Dekho for Star Plus and Son Pari for Star Plus.

Alternate names: Bonconsigli, Giovanni; Il Marescalco; Marescalco Buonconsiglio; Il Marescalco.  Influences  Buonconsiglio was probably apprenticed in Vicenza to Bartolomeo Montagna by 1484. Getty Museum entry He painted in the style of Giovanni Bellini, but afterwards became a pupil of Antonello da Messina.  Works  In Vicenza, he painted a Pieta for the church of San Bartolomeo (now in the Musei Civici Vicenza), a Virgin and child with saints for Oratorio de Turchini. He was living as late as 1530 at Venice, for the churches of which city he painted numerous altar-pieces, many of which have unfortunately perished. Among his works are: Virgin and Child (1511) for the Montagnana Cathedral; a St. Catharine (1513) in Louvre; Portrait of a Woman; Madonna with six Saints (Venice, Gallerie dell'Accademia).

It follows the entire Sterling Highway through Soldotna to the junction with the Seward Highway north of Seward, where it meets the north end of AK-9. There it turns north and follows the Seward Highway to its end in Anchorage, and follows the one- way pairs of Ingra and Gambell Streets and 6th and 5th Avenues, continuing east on 5th Avenue to the beginning of the Glenn Highway. AK-1 follows the entire length of the Glenn Highway, passing the south end of the George Parks Highway (AK-3) near Wasilla and meeting the Richardson Highway (AK-4) near Glennallen.

Major intersectionsTok Cut-Off The Tok Cut-Off is a highway in the U.S. state of Alaska, running from Gakona (on the Richardson Highway, north of Glennallen), to Tok on the Alaska Highway. The road was built in the 1940s and 1950s to connect Tok more directly with the Richardson Highway. It was called a \\"cut-off\\" because it allowed motor travelers coming north on the Alaska Highway to travel to Valdez and Anchorage without going to Delta Junction and then traveling south on the Richardson Highway, taking off the trip. The 2002 Denali earthquake caused significant damage to the Cut-Off, particularly between mileposts 75 and 83 where major cracks and embankment slumping left the roadway fundamentally destroyed.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 9-11 is a songwriter, singer, guitarist and keyboard player from London, who has recorded both solo and as a member of the Television Personalities, 'O' Level, Teenage Filmstars, The Times, and Conspiracy of Noise. He also worked for Creation Records. He was born and brought up in Chelsea, London. Biography=Television Personalities= In 1977, singer/songwriter Ball and fellow London Oratory school-friend Dan Treacy formed the Television Personalities. Ball also formed 'O' Level with John Bennett, Gerard Bennett, and Dick Scully, releasing two singles in 1978. In 1979, he recorded as the Teenage Filmstars, along with fellow members of the Television Personalities, releasing three singles between 1979 and 1980. Ball and Treacy ('Slaughter' Joe Foster left the band prior to the recording of any material under the Television Personalities name) released And Don't the Kids Just Love It (1980) for Rough Trade Records. Following a brief parting with Rough Trade, they launched their own label Whaam! Records with Mummy Your Not Watching Me (1981), They Could Have Been Bigger Than the Beatles (1982) and And Don't the Kids Just Love It. The Whaam! record label was later renamed Dreamworld, following a legal dispute with George Michael. Ball, meanwhile, had formed a more permanent outlet for his music in 1981 with The Times, releasing the Pop Goes Art! album in 1982, and leaving the TV Personalities the same year, although he later returned in 2004, appearing on the album My Dark Places (Domino Records, 2005) and on parts of the albums And They All Lived Happily Ever After (Damaged Goods, 2004) and Are We Nearly There Yet? (Overground, 2007). =The Times= On leaving the Television Personalities, Ball concentrated on The Times, a band with an ever-changing line-up in which he remained the only constant member. Following Pop Goes Art!, from 1982 to 1986 the band released four further albums / mini-albums on Ball's own Artpop label. In 1986 Ball dissolved The Times to become an executive at Creation Records; however, in 1988 he began to release new material under the Times name, starting with the album Beat Torture. Three albums were also released by Ball under the name of the Teenage Filmstars (although the other members of the original Teenage Filmstars were not involved in any way), Star (1992), Rocket Charms (1993) and Buy Our Record Support Our Sickness (1995). In 2005, Ball reactivated his Artpop! label through Cherry Red, debuting with Here's To Old England!, a three-decade anthology of his work as The Times, Teenage Filmstars and 'O' Level. This was followed by comprehensive reissues of This Is London (2006) and I Helped Patrick McGoohan Escape (2006). The series continues late May 2007 with O' Level 1977 ‚Äì 1980 compilation, A Day in the Life of Gilbert & George and The Times' first recorded album, GO! With The Times!. =Solo career= Ball's first solo release was the L'Orange Mechanik album in 1989, featuring music inspired by the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. As a side-project to The Times, Ball released dance music records as the Love Corporation in 1990. Between that year and 1997, he released four albums under this name on Creation. He also collaborated with Richard Green as Sand on the 1991 album The Dynamic Curve, and with Phil Vane of Extreme Noise Terror as Conspiracy of Noise on the 1993 album Chicks with Dicks and Splatter Flicks. In 1995 Creation Records issued a two-disc compilation of Ball's material, Welcome to the Wonderful World of Ed Ball, covering all his material other than that released with the Television Personalities. Two albums of solo material were released to coincide with it, If a Man Ever Loved a Woman (1995) and Catholic Guilt (1997), followed by Why Do I Need A Gun I'm Chelsea (1999). For the first time on any of his projects, Ball found a promoter willing to support Catholic Guilt, which yielded two UK Top 75 chart singles, \\"The Mill Hill Self Hate Club\\" and \\"Love Is Blue\\".\\"Edward Ball\\", Chart Stats, retrieved 24 October 2010 Following the collapse of Creation in 1999 Ball was unsigned to any other label and disappeared from public view, to concentrate on experimental film documentaries about Simon Fisher Turner and London. In 2004 Ball rejoined the Television Personalities, but left soon thereafter.

Administratively, the region falls mainly within Lushnj√´ and Fier District. Other terms like Myzeqeja e Vog√´l (Small Myzeqe), Myzeqeja e Beratit (Berat's Myzeqe), or Myzeqeja e Vlor√´s (Vlora's Myzeqe) are used to point respectively to the Fier part of the region, and to tiny parts that fall into the adjacent districts of Berat and Vlor√´. It stretches 65 km north-south and 50 km east- west, with a total area of around 1350 square kilometers. The oldest population to inhabit the Myzeqe plain are the Albanian tribe of the Lal√´.  Etymology  The name of the region comes from the Medieval times, it is named after the ruling family of Muzaka (1280 ‚Äì 1600) which possessed the area. The toponym is first recorded as Musachia in 1417.  History  In antiquity, the Greek colony of Apollonia was founded near the coast. The site of Apollonia lay on the territory of the Taulantii, a cluster of Illyrian tribes that remained closely involved with the settlement for centuries and lived alongside the Greek colonists.. The Taulantii controlled much of the plain of Myzeqe in classical antiquity. In the Middle Ages, and was ruled by various Albanian noble families including the Skuraj and Muzaka families. At various times it was included in the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire, often with the local ruling families serving as vassals to the rulers of the realm. Plenty of Slavic language toponyms are present in Myzeqe. In the late 13th century the area came under the rule of the officially Catholic and French- tied Angevin Kingdom of Albania. At first, relations were bad between the kingdom's rulers and the local nobility, and at times the nobility, such Gjin Muzaka, collaborated with the Byzantines against the kingdom. However, over time the local house of Muzaka came to view the Angevin royal family of Albania as their allies and protectors especially as the threat of Serbian expansion increased, and became more loyal to them. They were given titles as the region became influenced by the Western style of feudalism. At the same time, the Angevins allowed the local rulers to keep their Orthodox faith. In 1318, Andrea I Muzaka became the first ever Orthodox Albanian to be the head general of the kingdom's army, and the Muzakas played a role in King Charles' battles against the Serbs. In other conflicts, the Muzakas sided again with Byzantium, with Andrea II Muzaka being honored for his service to the Byzantine cause in 1335. The remnants of Byzantine control over the region collapsed during the 1341-1347 Byzantine civil war, creating an opportunity which was taken by the Serbian ruler Stefan Dushan, at the expense of the Kingdom of Albania. In the middle of the 14th century, the region was conquered by Stefan Dushan for Serbia, but it did not take long for the Serbian Empire's control over the region to fragment as the local families reasserted control. Four decades later, the Battle of Savra (as one of the plains of Myzeqe was known in the Middle Ages) marked the ascendancy of the Ottoman Empire in the region. In the 15th century, the Muzaka family and other local Albanian lords joined Skanderbeg's League of Lezha to try to contain the growing dominance of the Ottomans, but after a long conflict, Myzeqe as well as wider Albania ended up decisively under Ottoman rule until the early 20th century. Some of the local Albanian rulers as well as some of the population ended up fleeing to foreign countries, but some of the rulers stayed and became integrated into the Ottoman power apparatus. In the 18th century, Ali Pasha of Tepelene, a descendant of the noble Muzaka family, built a large despotate spanning large swaths of Albania, Macedonia and Greece, and gained de facto independence for a time from the Ottoman power center. However, ultimately, Myzeqe as well as the rest of Southern Albania was once again brought back under Ottoman control. In the late Ottoman era, Myzeqeja had a high rate of malaria, as was generally true of wetter areas in the wider region during that time. In the 20th century, the region was included in newly independent Albania. The middle of the century brought massive changes to the region as large numbers of Cham Albanian refugees from Greece were settled in it, and its wetlands were rapidly drained and industrialized under Communism, turning it into the \\"granary\\" of Albania.  Population  The Lal√´ are a distinct Albanian tribe from the more populous Tosks and Labs. The medieval Muzaka family was related to this tribe as indicated by the name of its progenitor, Lal Muzhaqi. In the Ottoman period, other Albanian tribes moved to the plain of Myzeqe: the Tosks and Labs. Starting from the late 18th century, a small group of Aromanians from the region of Kor√ß√´ settled in the region as well. In the first half of the 20th century, refugees from Kosovo and the Sandzak also came in the region after it was annexed by Serbia and Montenegro and then included in Yugoslavia. These waves of settlement mark Myzeqe as the area where all Albanian subgroups: Gheg, Tosk, and Lab populations meet. Aside from the Vlachs established mainly in Divjake town, and some of the Fier villages and some Romani people practically all the inhabitants of Myzeqe are ethnic Albanians. All people from the region as called Myzeqar√´ (\\"People from Myzeqe\\") which is widely used on a geographical point of view. Myzeqe is notable in its religious makeup as one of the few fairly large regions of Albania where a majority of inhabitants remained Orthodox Christian throughout the Ottoman rule. In the nineteenth century, Fier became a economic and commercial centre of the Myzeqe plain which consisted of small settlements and villages populated by Aromanians, Orthodox Albanians and Muslim Albanians. \\"Fier developed into the main commercial and economic centre for the surrounding little settlements and villages on the Myzeqe plain, which were inhabited by Arvanitovlachs and, mainly, Christian and Moslem Albanians.\\" Around the era of Albanian independence, statistics show that around Fier, roughly 65% of the population was Christian, while in Lushnja the numbers of Christians and Muslims were comparable. During the 20th century, many Muslim- background Cham Albanians were settled in Myzeqe due to the Expulsion of Cham Albanians. Additionally, in Libofsh√´, some of the residents are Bosniaks who settled in the village in the early 1920s and have become linguistically assimilated.  Economy  This region is prominent for its agricultural potential, which was not always utilized. Most of today's fields were practically swamps and desolate lands until after World War II. This caused seasonal migration of the population. After World War II, the communist government launched massive campaigns for draining the area. Following the increase in agricultural potential, the region gained significant importance. Since then, Myzeqe has been called the \\"Albanian granary\\".

She discovered positive thinking, the laws of attraction, and how to find further success in life. Hence, she started doing research on the subject and the project of The Secret was born. The Secret According to Byrne's research, she claims that all great men in history knew about the laws of attraction, suggesting Abraham Lincoln, Ludwig van Beethoven, Winston Churchill and others. Furthering her research, she found current proponents of the laws of attraction include author Jack Canfield, entrepreneur John Assaraf, visionary Michael Beckwith, John Demartini, Bob Proctor, James Arthur Ray, Joseph Vitale, Lisa Nichols, Marie Diamond, and John Gray. Byrne found success with both the DVD and the book of The Secret.

In 1980, she smothered her five-month-old son, Ronald Winters III. In 2007, she drowned 23-month-old Ryan Rivers. She is also suspected of killing three siblings in childhood, setting a fire which killed two of her older children in 1979, and on the day prior to that killed a friend's three children. Per a plea bargain, she cannot be prosecuted for those. Early life In 1966, Winters' 10-year-old brother and 4 and 11-year- old sisters died from an apparent carbon monoxide leak in the family home. In 1979, Winters' first two children, 3-year-old Colleen and 20-month-old John, died in a fire in the family's Hyde Lake cabin in Theresa, New York. Investigators blamed an electrical defect. When her children's bodies were exhumed in March 2007, autopsies showed Colleen and John received blunt force head injuries before the fire had started. The day before the fire started at Winters' cabin, another fire started at Winters' friend's house in Hermon, New York, while her friend's three children were still inside. St. Lawrence County police re-investigated this fire in 2007. Winters was near at least seventeen fires since the 1979 ones, nine determined as arson. She pleaded guilty to criminal mischief in relation to two in 1981. A November 12, 1989 fire started in a Syracuse home where Winters was staying with her three children. She rescued her four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son, but lost her five- year-old daughter, who rescued herself. Murders On November 28, 2006, Ryan Rivers was found to be drowned at his grandparents' Pierrepont home, while Winters visited. She was indicted by a St. Lawrence County grand jury in August 2007 of second-degree murder, first-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child.. This prompted police to exhume Winters' son, Ronald Winters III, who died on November 21, 1980 in Otisco, New York, of supposed Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Based on their findings, police charged Winters with second-degree murder on March 28, 2007. On April 21, 2008, Winters pleaded guilty to manslaughter for drowning Rivers. Under the terms of the plea agreement, she also agreed to plead guilty in Onondaga County Court to first-degree manslaughter for smothering Winters. She was sentenced to 20 years for Rivers, and 8 to 25 years for Winters, to be served concurrently, with parole eligibility after 17 years. She is imprisoned at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility By pleading guilty, she avoided possible second degree murder convictions and multiple life sentences, as well as prosecution for the 1979 murders of Colleen and John Winters.  In media  Winters and her many crimes were featured on episode 8: A Trail Of Ashes & Bodies in Otisco, New York of the podcast Small Town Murder. A book that closely resembles the case and investigation into Winters was published under the title Teflon Shelly, written by Ron Ryan, Fire Investigator of the Onondaga County Department of Emergency Management and Chief of the Volunteer Fire Department who worked on the case.

In 2010, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Early life and family Pawnee Bill was born on February 14, 1860, in Bloomington, Illinois.

The family then moved to Wellington, Kansas, where Gordon developed a love for the West. By the age of 19, he was working on the Pawnee Indian agency in Indian Territory. In 1883, he was given the chance to work as the Pawnee interpreter with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. His work with the show was the origin of his nickname as \\"Pawnee Bill.\\"Shirley (2017). Wild West show Poster for Pawnee Bill's Historic Wild West. After courting for two years, Lillie married May Manning in 1886, a petite Quaker from Pennsylvania. She was younger than he, a graduate of Smith College, and the daughter of a wealthy Philadelphia physician. Her parents objected at first to their refined young daughter marrying a cowboy, but eventually they agreed to the union. In 1888, the Lillies launched their own Wild West show, which they called \\"Pawnee Bill‚Äôs Historic Wild West\\". May starred in the show as the \\"Champion Girl Horseback Shot of the West.\\" Their first season was a financial disaster. They re- organized as a smaller operation called \\"Pawnee Bill‚Äôs Historical Wild West Indian Museum and Encampment Show.\\" That show was popular and financially successful. Lillie added Jose Barrera to the cast; he was widely popular performing as \\"Mexican Joe\\". In 1907, Lillie hired performers from a variety of backgrounds. The show included Mexican cowboys, Pawnee, Japanese performers, and Arab jugglers. The ensemble debuted as \\"Pawnee Bill‚Äôs Great Far East Show.\\"Farnum; Bock (1992). In 1908, Pawnee Bill and Buffalo Bill joined forces and created the \\"Two Bills' show. That show was foreclosed on when it was playing in Denver, Colorado.Wheeler (2006). While Gordon Lillie had been on tour, May supervised their buffalo ranch, now known as Pawnee Bill Ranch. The Lillies completed work on their Arts-and-Crafts style home on Blue Hawk Peak in 1910. Later life Pawnee Bill invested in banking, real estate, and oil. He operated various business interests and dabbled in film making at his ranch. In 1930, May and Pawnee Bill opened Pawnee Bill‚Äôs Old Town near the ranch. They sold Indian and Mexican crafts, and featured annual rodeos. That enterprise burned to the ground in the 1940s and was never rebuilt. In 1936, the couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in Taos, New Mexico. In September of that year they attended a local celebration in Tulsa, Oklahoma. While driving back to their ranch that night, Pawnee Bill lost control of their vehicle. May died as a result of her injuries, and Pawnee Bill never fully recovered. He died in his sleep on February 3, 1942, at the age of 81 in his home outside of Pawnee, Oklahoma. Legacy The Pawnee Bill Ranch continues to exist, including a museum. The Pawnee Bill Memorial Rodeo is held annually, as is a version of Pawnee Bill‚Äôs Original Wild West Show.

For instance, it makes sense to let the mouse driver run at a very high priority to provide fluid mouse interactions. For long-term operations, such as copying, downloading or transforming big files the most important factor is to provide good user- feedback and not the performance of the operation since it can quite well run in the background, using only spare processor time.  Delays  Long delays can be a major cause of user frustration, or can lead the user to believe the system is not functioning, or that a command or input gesture has been ignored. Responsiveness is therefore considered an essential usability issue for human-computer-interaction (HCI). The rationale behind the responsiveness principle is that the system should deliver results of an operation to users in a timely and organized manner. The frustration threshold can be quite different, depending on the situation. The three steps are 0.1s, 1s, and 10s.  Solutions to improve responsiveness  Although numerous other options may exist, the most frequently used and recommended answers to responsiveness issues are: * Optimizing the process that delivers the output by eliminating wasteful, unproductive output from the algorithm or method by which the result is produced. * A decent process management system, giving highest priority to operations that would otherwise interrupt the user's work flow, such as typing, onscreen buttons, or moving the mouse pointer. Usually there is enough \\"idle time\\" in between, for the other operations. * Using idle time to prepare for the operations a user might do next. * Let the user do something productive while the system is busy for instance, writing information in a form, reading a manual, etc. For instance, in a tabbed browser, the user can read one page while loading another. * Deliver intermediate results, before the operation is finished. For instance, a web page can already be operated before all images are loaded, which will take up the idle time which would otherwise be spent needlessly. * If some waiting is inevitable, a progress indicator can significantly reduce frustration. For short delays, an animated icon might be sufficient. Longer delays are better covered with a progress bar, or, if possible, the system should provide an approximation of the time that an operation is going to take before starting it.

A deluxe version was released later in the year. The story follows a young Greek man named Claudius who is shipwrecked and rebuilds temple mosaics in order to gain the favor of the gods. The gameplay of Pixelus is a clone of the Japanese 2001 game Guru Logi Champ published for the Game Boy Advance.  Gameplay  The objective of Pixelus is to create specific images on a 16x16 grid using a limited number of tiles. Players must slide tiles across the grid and land them in specific locations to form an image. Areas where tiles must be placed are often not immediately accessible. For this reason, tiles must often be used to block other tiles, then removed and placed in other locations. During gameplay, players may choose to reset the puzzle, go back one move, and receive a hint. On completing a puzzle, players can receive gold, silver, or bronze medals based on how few moves they used.

Early life Gallagher was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and grew up in the suburban Hamilton Square section of Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey. He played in the Nottingham Little League and ‚Äî as a centerfielder ‚Äîled Steinert High School to the Central Jersey title in its group and then to the state title for that group. Early years Gallagher played college baseball at Mercer County Community College. Gallagher was originally drafted third overall by the Oakland Athletics in the January amateur draft, but did not sign. Five months later, the Cleveland Indians selected him eighth overall in the June secondary draft, and he signed. He spent seven seasons in the minors, batting .271 with 39 home runs and 316 runs batted in, when he attended spring training with the Indians in 1987. He was cut just at the end of Spring, but was immediately re-added to the major league roster when center fielder Brett Butler fractured his left middle finger in the home opener. In fourteen games in center field, Gallagher batted .111 with one double, one triple and one RBI. Upon Butler's return, he was optioned back to the triple A Buffalo Bisons. Shortly afterwards, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners for relief pitcher Mark Huismann. Despite batting .306 with 46 RBIs for the triple A Calgary Cannons, Gallagher did not fit into the Mariners' future plans, and asked for his release. Chicago White Sox Gallagher joined the Chicago White Sox as a non-roster Spring training invitee in , but again failed to make the major league roster, and was reassigned to triple A. He batted .336 with four home runs in 34 games with the Vancouver Canadians to earn a call up to the majors on May 13. In his first game for the Chisox, Gallagher went two for three with a triple, a walk two RBIs and two runs scored to lead his team to a 7-5 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. The following day, he hit a home run off Mark Eichhorn in the thirteenth inning for the walk off victory over Toronto. Gallagher continued his hot hitting, and became the White Sox starting center fielder for the remainder of the season. He batted .303 with five home runs and 31 RBIs as a rookie to be named the Topps Rookie All-Star center fielder in 1988 and finish fifth in American League Rookie of the Year balloting. He also developed into one of the top fielding outfielders in the American League. He led AL center fielders with a .994 fielding percentage and started four double plays in . An injury early in the season sidelined Gallagher. When he came back, he found that he had lost his starting job in center field to speedster Lance Johnson. He remained a fourth outfielder for the Sox until the Baltimore Orioles acquired him in a waiver deal on August 2. California Angels At the 1990 Winter meetings, he was dealt to the California Angels for two minor leaguers. Platooning with Junior Felix in center, Gallagher batted .293 with one home run and thirty RBIs. On May 19, 1991, Gallagher recorded his first and only 5 hit game going 5-5, clubbing five singles, versus his former team the Baltimore Orioles. On December 10, 1991, he joined his fourth team in a little over a year when he was dealt to the New York Mets for Hubie Brooks. New York Mets Gallagher was used primarily as a pinch hitter and late inning defensive replacement during his two season stay in New York City. On July 18, , Gallagher hit his only career grand slam against the San Francisco Giants' Michael Jackson. For the season, he hit a career high six home runs despite logging just 201 at-bats. On November 24, 1993, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for pitcher Pete Smith. Final years After just one season in Atlanta, Gallagher signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Phillies. After batting just .190 as a pinch hitter with the Braves, Gallagher went six for ten with four doubles pinch hitting for the Phillies. He was traded back to the first place California Angels shortly after the non-waiver trade deadline for minor leaguer Kevin Flora and a player to be named later. Though the Angels were interested in bringing Gallagher back for the season, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement. He ended up signing a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians with an invitation to Spring training. He was cut on March 22, and retired. Teaching the game Gallagher served as hitting instructor for the Eastern League's Trenton Thunder in and . He was a baseball coach at Notre Dame High School in Mercer County, New Jersey in , and Mercer County Community College in . While in the minors, Gallagher invented the \\"Stride tutor\\" to help batters regulate their strides. In , Gallagher opened the Dave Gallagher Baseball Academy. He and Mark Gola wrote an instructional book entitled The Little League Hitter's Journal (Little League Baseball Guide), released in . He currently serves as General Manager of the Trenton Generals of the American Collegiate Baseball League.

After spending nearly ten years in post-war Germany as Chief Protestant Religious Adviser in the High Command assigned especially to the task of deNazification during the occupation, he was deeply affected by the atrocities that had been committed during World War II, and thus dedicated his life to researching the Holocaust and bringing its tragic lessons in human rights to widespread public attention. In public meetings, on campuses and in churches, he raised one of the first voices of conscience in the post-war period, talking about the lessons of the Holocaust.Obituary http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/20090525_Rev__Franklin_H__Littell__scholar_of_the_Holocaust.html Littell is regarded by some as a founder of the field of Holocaust studies, having established at several institutions masters and doctoral programs devoted to study of the Holocaust (the latter at Temple University in 1976).

Studios in Chicago, Illinois, it was released on September 1, 1995 by his own label M.A.C.E. Music. Batio performed the majority of instruments on the release, as well as producing, engineering and mixing the album. Background and production Michael Angelo Batio began his solo career shortly after the break-up of his previous band Nitro, which featured lead vocalist Jim Gillette, in 1992. His debut solo album, No Boundaries, was recorded at M.A.C.E. Studios and mixed at Monsterdisc, both in his hometown Chicago, with Batio handling all production, engineering and mixing; Jason Rau mastered the album. All electric and acoustic guitars, bass, keyboards and percussion programming were performed by Batio, with Rob Ross contributing drums to \\"Rain Forest\\", \\"Science Fiction\\" and \\"2X Again\\". The album's title track, \\"No Boundaries\\", was originally written for one of Batio's instructional guitar videos, not for the album itself, with the guitarist claiming he \\"didn't even know the song ... would be popular\\". The video in question was the 1991 Metal Method production Speed Kills; the track was later featured on the video Speed Lives, which breaks down and teaches the song in 27 parts. Additionally, \\"The Finish Line\\" was featured on Speed Lives 3. Reception and legacy Quoting a review by critic Kevin Prowse, Guitar Nine Records noted that No Boundaries \\"has been heralded as one of the top ten instrumental guitar CDs of the 90s\\". Prowse praised the \\"mastery of various lead [guitar] techniques like speed picking, string skipping, arpeggios and cross string tapping\\" on display, and selected \\"Science Fiction\\", \\"Rain Forest\\" and \\"No Boundaries\\" as particular highlights on the album. In 2007, Batio released the album 2 X Again, which features remixed and remastered songs from No Boundaries and follow-up album Planet Gemini with re-recorded drums by Joe Babiak. From No Boundaries, all tracks except \\"Intro: This CD Is Dedicated to You\\" and \\"The Finish Line\\" were included. The guitarist's 2015 \\"career-spanning retrospective\\" compilation album Shred Force 1: The Essential MAB features \\"2X Again\\", \\"Rain Forest\\", \\"No Boundaries\\" and \\"Peace\\" (on digital versions only), all of which were originally released on No Boundaries.

Career Morales was originally signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free agent at the age of 17 in 1966. He went to the San Diego Padres in 1968 in that year's expansion draft, and spent several seasons going up and down in the Padres' farm system, finally becoming a semiregular in and . On November 7, 1973 Morales was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Glenn Beckert and minor league infielder Bobby Fenwick. Morales, who ended up playing seven seasons for the Cubs over two stints, 1973- and -1983, was a consistent and quiet outfielder who played all three outfield positions with above average speed and a good glove. He was known for his unusual \\"basket catch\\" style. Unless he was running when he caught a ball, he always made a two-handed basket catch, directly in front of his body, below the belt. At the time of the Beckert deal, Cubs general manager John Holland believed acquiring Morales was \\"in line with our movement for youth and speed\\" (Dozer, 11/13/73). In the same offseason, the Cubs also moved Ferguson Jenkins, and, at the time of this trade, speculation was that by acquiring Morales, Billy Williams would either be moved to first or traded. By trading Jenkins and Beckert, whose salaries totaled over $200,000, the Cubs payroll decreased. While Morales led the Cubs with 91 RBI during the season, his most promising season was for the 1977 Cubs. Along with Rick Reuschel, Bruce Sutter, and Manny Trillo, Morales represented the Cubs in the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in which Morales was plunked in the knee by Yankee pitcher Sparky Lyle. The hit by pitch, one of 28 in All- Star Game history, a subsequent back injury, and a broken finger from making a catch in center field all shortened the 1977 season for Morales. His injuries contributed to the Cubs decline that season, and Morales never seemed to be the same player. In the offseason between the 1977 and season, Cubs general manager Bob Kennedy traded Morales, Steve Swisher, and a player to be named later to the St. Louis Cardinals for H√©ctor Cruz and catcher Dave Rader. The Cardinals acquired Morales to improve the team's offense. Morales returned to the Cubs as a free agent before the 1981 season. The signing was considered a small one, as Morales signed a minor league contract to play for the Triple-A Iowa Cubs and made his final appearance for Chicago in 1983. In a 15 year, 1441 game major league career, Morales compiled a .259 batting average (1173-for-4528) with 516 runs, 95 home runs and 570 RBI. Post-playing career After the 1983 season, Morales immediately began his coaching career by becoming the Cubs roving minor league hitting and outfield instructor; he served in this position through 1986. From 1987‚Äì1990, he was a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers. After a twelve-year break from MLB, he became the Montreal Expos first base and outfield coach from 2002‚Äì2004. In 2006, he was a coach in Puerto Rico and with the Gulf Coast Mets. From 2007‚Äì2008, he was the first base coach for the Washington Nationals. In February 2009, he was named a coach for the St. Lucie Mets. As of 2019, Morales was running a baseball camp in Puerto Rico.

He served as the third Bishop of Salt Lake City (1926‚Äì1932) and the fourth Archbishop of San Francisco (1935‚Äì1961). Early life and education John Mitty was born in the Greenwich Village section of New York City, the son of John and Mary (n√©e Murphy) Mitty. He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Joseph's Church in his native city. In 1896, he enrolled at De La Salle Institute. He was orphaned at age fourteen. Mitty attended Manhattan College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1901. He then began his studies for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary at Dunwoodie in Yonkers. Priesthood On December 22, 1906, Mitty was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of New York by Archbishop John Murphy Farley. He continued his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree in 1907. The following year he received a doctorate in theology from the Major Pontifical Seminary in Rome. Following his return to New York in 1909, Mitty briefly served as a curate at St. Veronica Church in the West Village. From 1909 to 1917, he was a professor of dogmatic theology at St. Joseph's Seminary. One of Mitty's students at Dunwoodie was James Francis McIntyre. During World War I, he served as a chaplain in the U.S. Army, serving with the American Expeditionary Forces, 49th Infantry Division, and 101st Airborne Division in France. He served with two New York regiments that saw action in the 1918 Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Mitty was released from military service in 1919, and subsequently assigned as pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Highland Falls. In addition to his pastoral duties, he served as a Catholic chaplain at the United States Military Academy at West Point from 1919 to 1922. General Douglas MacArthur served as Superintendent of West Point, during Mitty's time as Catholic chaplain. In 1922, New York Archbishop Patrick Joseph Hayes named Mitty pastor of St. Luke Church in the Bronx. Episcopacy=Salt Lake City= On June 21, 1926, Mitty was appointed the third Bishop of Salt Lake City, Utah, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 6 from Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes, with Bishops John Joseph Dunn and Daniel Joseph Curley serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Bishop Mitty inherited a diocese deeply in debt. His predecessor had resorted to taking out new loans to pay the interest on previous debt, and left the diocese owing over $300,000. Mitty took control of the finances, focusing on improving the weekly offertory collection. When he left in 1932, the diocese was beginning to pay off its debts, and his successor was able to finish paying them off in 1936. =San Francisco= Mitty's vault at Holy Cross In 1932 Pope Pius XI appointed Mitty to be the coadjutor to the Archdiocese of San Francisco and named him titular archbishop of Aegina. Upon Archbishop Edward Joseph Hanna's retirement on March 2, 1935, Mitty succeeded as the fourth Archbishop of San Francisco, California. He was installed as archbishop and presented the pallium, the symbol of a metropolitan bishop, at a Pontifical High Mass at the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption in September of that year. Mitty worked to rebuild or establish Catholic institutions in the archdiocese. His first act as archbishop was to direct his installation gift from the clergy to restoring Saint Patrick Seminary. He had the archdiocese purchase the foreclosed upon St. Mary's College of California in 1937, and reopened the college in 1938. In the twenty six years of his episcopate, 84 parishes and missions were founded in the archdiocese, and over 500 building projects were completed. Mitty caused controversy when he called for a boycott of the San Francisco News for factually reporting that a priest of the archdiocese was arrested, plead guilty, and fined for drunk driving, calling the coverage anti-Catholic. He joined with several other American bishops and archbishops in criticizing the Moscow Declaration, particularly questioning the Soviet Union's motives. In 1951, Archbishop Mitty approved the establishment of the Western Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in San Francisco for the Western United States. He presided at the first investiture ceremony of the association in 1953. Archbishop Mitty died of a heart attack at Saint Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, California. He is buried in the Archbishops' Crypt at Holy Cross Cemetery, Colma, California. Archbishop Mitty High School in San Jose, California, is named for him.

He was a member of the Uruguayan National Party and was a revolutionary leader against the Uruguayan government. Early life He was born in Cerro Largo, Uruguay, the fourth of thirteen children of Brazilians Francisco Saraiva and Pulpicia da Rosa (his surname was later Hispanicized to \\"Saravia\\"). He was raised and educated mostly in the countryside, but he also had some higher education. At his father's death, the Saravia brothers inherited a vast estate, Estancia El Cordob√©s, in the department of Cerro Largo, on the frontier with the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul. Since the borders between Brazil and Uruguay were not clearly delineated, the Saravia brothers had very close ties to Rio Grande do Sul and its revolutionary movements. Aparicio Saravia began his military activities at a very young age. He is believed to have participated in the Revolution of the Lances (Revoluci√≥n de las Lanzas) (1870‚Äì1872), led by Timoteo Aparicio against the government of Lorenzo Batlle y Grau, the father of Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez, who would later be a political rival. In 1875, with two of his brothers, he participated in the Tricolor Revolution (Revoluci√≥n Tricolor) under √Ångel Muniz. In 1877, he married C√°ndida D√≠az, the niece of a Colorado Party leader; she had had to flee from home because her parents opposed the union. Federalist Riograndense Revolution Gumercindo Saraiva, Aparicio Saravia‚Äôs older brother, played a large role in the federalist revolution in Rio Grande do Sul. The Saravia brothers led a force of 400 Uruguayan lancers who carried a banner that read Defensor da lei (Defender of the Law), which had been used by Manuel Oribe at the Battle of Carpinter√≠a, which had led to the creation of the National Party. Gumercindo Saraiva died in 1894, and Aparicio Saravia took over the revolutionary forces with the rank of General. He and his Uruguayan volunteers fought at the Battle of Passo Fundo. Though the revolution began to fail by 1895, Aparacio Saravia not only earned the rank of General but also great prestige, as the newspapers in Montevideo had been covering his exploits. Leader of the Blanco Party The Peace of April (La Paz de Abril) was signed on April 6, 1872, ending the Revolution of the Lances. The Peace attempted to introduce cooperate between the Blanco and Colorado Parties, but nevertheless, tension remained during the presidency of Julio Herrera y Obes. The Blanco Party looked to Saravia for leadership. Aparicio Saravia on horseback Herrera y Obes was succeeded by Juan Idiarte Borda, which angered the Blanco Party, which felt excluded from the workings of government and believed that the Colorado Party had violated the Peace of April. In 1895, Aparicio Saravia went to Montevideo as a representative of Cerro Largo, and in November 1896, Aparicio Saravia began agitating for revolution. However, government troops moved against the revolutionaries, who dispersed as a result. In March 1897, Aparicio Saravia led a revolutionary force against the Uruguayan government at the frontier with Brazil at Acegu√°, while Diego Lamas led another force from Argentina at Colonia and Jos√© N√∫√±ez led another at Conchillas. Aparicio Saravia‚Äôs forces were defeated at Cuchilla del Arbolito, in Cerro Largo department. Saravia‚Äôs younger brother Antonio (called el chiquito Saravia) died in this battle. Idiarte Borda was assassinated by Avelino Arredondo, and Juan Lindolfo Cuestas attempted reconciliation with the Blanco Party at the Pact of La Cruz (Pacto de La Cruz) on September 18, 1897. Within two years Lindolfo Cuestas had ceded the Presidency to Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez on an interim basis. Aparicio Saravia served as an opposition leader in this time, and counted on the support of his own army. He served as a de facto, second leader of the country, with Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez heading the government at Montevideo, and Saravia leading revolutionary forces in the countryside. Saravia agitated for revolution once again, but a civil war was avoided by a diplomatic mission, which resulted in a new pact signed at Nico P√©rez on March 22, 1903. However, Saravia subsequently believed that the Pact of La Cruz had once again been violated, and war erupted in 1904 between the government forces and the saravistas or Saravians. There were battles at Mansavillagra (January 14), Illescas, Lavalleja department (January 15), and at Tupamba√© (June 24). The decisive battle, however, occurred at Masoller (September 10, 1904). Saravia was fatally injured at this battle after charging at the head of his troops. He was shot in the abdomen with a Mauser bullet; his companions managed to take him across the frontier to Brazil, to a ranch named Carovi near Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul. He lay in agony for 10 days, suffering from peritonitis, before dying from his wounds. With his death, the Saravian Revolution failed, and on September 24, 1904, the Peace of Acegu√° was signed, which finally brought stability to Uruguay. The Saravian Revolution was the last civil war in Uruguay's history. He was buried at the burial vault of the Brazilian family of Pereira da Souza but in 1921 his remains were moved by Luis Alberto de Herrera to the cemetery of Buceo in Montevideo. They were then moved to Santa Clara de Olimar, where he was buried next to his family.

Users could add people as friends, send them messages, and update their personal profiles to notify friends about themselves. Users were placed in networks based upon the domain name associated with the email address they used for registration. History In December 2002, Harvard students and friends Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra wanted a better way to connect with fellow students at Harvard and other universities. As a result, the three conceived of a social network for Harvard students named HarvardConnection, which was to expand to other schools around the country. In January 2003, they enlisted the help of fellow Harvard student, programmer and friend Sanjay Mavinkurve to begin building HarvardConnection. Sanjay commenced work on HarvardConnection but left the project in the spring of 2003 when he graduated and went to work for Google. After the departure of Sanjay Mavinkurve, the Winklevosses and Narendra approached Narendra‚Äôs friend, Harvard student and programmer Victor Gao to work on HarvardConnection. Gao, a senior in Mather House, had opted not to become a full partner in the venture, instead agreeing to be paid in a work for hire capacity on a rolling basis. He was paid $400 for his work on the website code during the second half of 2003, then excused himself thereafter due to personal obligations. =Mark Zuckerberg= In November 2003, upon the referral of Victor Gao, the Winklevosses and Narendra approached Mark Zuckerberg about joining the HarvardConnection team. By this point, the previous HarvardConnection programmers had already made progress on a large amount of the coding: front-end pages, the registration system, a database, back-end coding, and a way users could connect with each other, which Gao called a \\"handshake\\". In early November, Narendra emailed Zuckerberg saying, \\"We‚Äôre very deep into developing a site which we would like you to be a part of and ... which we know will make some waves on campus.\\" Within days, Zuckerberg was talking to the HarvardConnection team and preparing to take over programming duties from Gao. On the evening of November 25, 2003, the Winklevosses and Narendra met with Zuckerberg in the dining hall of Harvard's Kirkland House, where they explained to Zuckerberg the HarvardConnection website, the plan to expand to other schools after launch, the confidential nature of the project, and the importance of getting there first. During the meeting, Zuckerberg allegedly entered into an oral contract with Narendra and the Winklevosses and became a partner in HarvardConnection. He was given the private server location and password for the unfinished HarvardConnection website and code, with the understanding that he would finish the programming necessary for launch. Zuckerberg allegedly chose to be compensated in the form of sweat equity. On November 30, 2003, Zuckerberg told Cameron Winklevoss in an email that he did not expect completion of the project to be difficult. Zuckerberg wrote: \\"I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.\\" The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. \\"I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional.\\" On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: \\"Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set.\\" On December 10, 2003: \\"The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway.\\" A week later: \\"Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with.\\" On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading ‚ÄúHarvard Connection,‚Äù and this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was \\"completely swamped with work [that] week\\" but had \\"made some of the changes ... and they seem[ed] to be working great\\" on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the site thefacebook.com was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; he never mentioned registering the domain name thefacebook.com nor a competing social networking website, rather he reported progress on HarvardConnection, told them he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country. On February 6, 2004, the Winklevosses and Narendra first learned of thefacebook.com while reading a press release in the Harvard student newspaper The Harvard Crimson. According to Gao, who looked at the HarvardConnection code afterward, Zuckerberg had left the HarvardConnection code incomplete and non-functional, with a registration that did not connect with the back-end connections. On February 10, 2004, the Winklevosses and Narendra sent Zuckerberg a cease and desist letter. They also asked the Harvard administration to act on what they viewed as a violation of the university‚Äôs honor code and student handbook. They lodged a complaint with the Harvard Administrative Board and university president Larry Summers, but both viewed the matter to be outside of the university's jurisdiction. President Summers advised the HarvardConnection team to take their matter to the courts. The About section of the ConnectU website included this sentence, which was live on December 4, 2004: \\"We've cycled through several programmers, even one who stole our ideas to create a competing site, without informing us of his intentions.\\" Leaked instant messages Between November 29, 2003 and February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg exchanged a total of 52 emails with the HarvardConnection team and engaged in several in-person meetings. In this period, Zuckerberg engaged in multiple electronic instant message communications with people outside of the HarvardConnection team. On March 5, 2010, certain electronic instant messages from Mark Zuckerberg's hard drive were leaked. On September 20, 2010, Facebook confirmed the authenticity of these leaked instant messages in a New Yorker article.  The Winklevoss Chang Group  Screenshot of Connecthi.com (aka theyearbook.org) in February 2005 A partnership allegedly formed between i2hub, a popular peer-to-peer service at the time, and ConnectU (HarvardConnection). The partnership, called The Winklevoss Chang Group, jointly advertised their properties through bus advertisements as well as public press releases. i2hub integrated its popular software with ConnectU's website, as part of the partnership. The team also jointly launched several projects and initiatives, including: * Jungalu.com, an internet-based book exchange * StallScribbles.com, an online \\"anonymous confessions\\" board * Digital Flyers, a portal for purchasing advertisements to be placed on the various WCG sites and on i2hub * ConnectHi (also known as ConnectHigh and theyearbook.org), an effort to penetrate the high school social network \\"scene\\" * ConnectGroups, an initiative to provide clubs and organizations with a means for their members to communicate online with each other about their organizations * The Winklevoss Chang Representative Program, a sales representative program which WCG used to establish a presence on college campuses and to promote ConnectU and the other WCG properties * The Rep Center, an internet-based portal, accessible through ConnectU.com, providing a centralized location for the representatives of The Winklevoss Chang Representative Program to communicate and earn points (redeemable for prizes) by recruiting and signing up new users for all of WCG's properties * Social Butterfly, a feature added to ConnectU to allow users to consolidate their accounts at various social networking sites, such as Facebook, and make that information accessible through ConnectU * US Patent Application 20060212395, related to a method of purchasing of copyrighted computer files through affinity programs, such as using points from a credit card to purchase copyrighted movies. Lawsuits=Facebook lawsuits= Recording of oral arguments in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2004, ConnectU filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that creator Mark Zuckerberg had breached an oral contract to develop ConnectU and used their source code and idea to create TheFacebook.com. The suit alleged that Zuckerberg had copied their ideaMalcom A. Glenn, \\"For Now, Facebook Foes Continue Fight Against Site\\", The Harvard Crimson, July 27, 2007 and illegally used source code intended for the website he was hired to create. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group. It named among the defendants ConnectU, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, Divya Narendra, and Wayne Chang, founder of i2hub. A settlement agreement for both cases was reached in February 2008, reportedly valued at $65 million. This included buying the domain name ConnectU.com and shutting it down. In May 2010, it was reported that ConnectU was accusing Facebook of securities fraud on the value of the stock that was part of the settlement and wanted to get the settlement undone. According to ConnectU's allegations, the stock was worth $11 million instead of $45 million that Facebook presented at the time of settlement. This meant the settlement value, at the time, was $31 million, instead of the $65 million. On August 26, 2010, The New York Times reported that Facebook shares were trading at $76 per share in the secondary market, putting the total settlement value at close to $120 million. If the lawsuit adjusted the settlement to match the difference, the value would quadruple to over $466 million. In May 2011, after the Court of Appeals found against the Winklevosses, the twins announced that they would petition the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case. In June 2011 the Winklevosses, in a filing with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said that \\"after careful consideration,\\" they would not file their petition with the U.S. Supreme Court. In a new filing, the Winklevoss brothers and their business partner Divya Narendra asked the judge to investigate whether Facebook \\"intentionally or inadvertently suppressed evidence.\\" =Quinn Emanuel lawsuits= One of ConnectU's law firms, Quinn Emanuel, disclosed the confidential settlement amount in marketing material by printing \\"WON $65 million settlement against Facebook\\". Quinn Emanuel sought $13 million of the settlement as part of a contingency agreement. ConnectU fired Quinn Emanuel and sued the law firm for malpractice. On August 25, 2010, an arbitration panel ruled that Quinn Emanuel \\"earned its full contingency fee\\". It also found that Quinn Emanuel committed no malpractice. =The Winklevoss Chang Group lawsuit= On December 21, 2009, i2hub founder Wayne Chang and The i2hub Organization launched a lawsuit against ConnectU and its founders, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, seeking 50% of the settlement. The complaint says \\"The Winklevosses and Howard Winklevoss filed [a] patent application, U.S. Patent Application No 20060212395, on or around March 15, 2005, but did not list Chang as a co-inventor.\\" It also states \\"Through this litigation, Chang asserts his ownership interest in The Winklevoss Chang Group and ConnectU, including the settlement proceeds.\\" Lee Gesmer (of law firm Gesmer Updegrove, LLP) posted the 33-page complaint online. On May 13, 2011, it was reported that Judge Peter Lauriat had made a ruling against the Winklevosses. Chang's case against them could proceed. The Winklevosses argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the settlement with Facebook had not been distributed and therefore Chang had not suffered any injury. Judge Lauriat wrote, \\"The flaw in this argument is that defendants appear to conflate loss of the settlement proceed with a loss of rights. Chang alleges that he has received nothing in return for the substantial benefits he provided to ConnectU, including the value of his work, as well as i2hub's users and goodwill.\\" Lauriat also wrote that, although Chang's claims to the settlement are \\"too speculative to confer standing, his claims with respect to ownership in ConnectU are not. They constitute an injury separate and distinct from his possible share of the settlement proceeds. The court concludes that Chang has pled sufficient facts to confer standing with respect to his claims against the Winklevoss defendants.\\" On December 24th, 2014, summary judgment in favor of the Winklevosses was granted. Chang's suit sought a portion of the settlement via two independent arguments. The first, that he formed a partnership with the Winklevosses, was dismissed based on May 25, 2005, chat where the partnership was dissolved. The second, a memorandum of understanding granting him the option to acquire a fifteen percent stake in ConnectU, was ruled a contract claim against ConnectU, the corporation, not the Winklevosses, former shareholders.  In popular culture  The story of the relationship between ConnectU and Facebook is depicted in The Social Network, a film directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich.

Plot summary In the year 2087, Earth is nearly crime free and the artificial intelligence One True telepathically controls humans. The main character and first person narrator is forty-nine-year-old Currie Curtis Curran, a retired mercenary soldier and \\"cowboy hunter\\". He is recalled from retirement to capture \\"Lobo\\" Dave Singleton, the last of the \\"cowboys\\", people beyond the control of One True hiding in the Colorado wilderness. Currie's contact with One True is through a copy of the Resuna \\"meme\\", a \\"neurocode\\" program uploaded into the brain, and an implanted \\"cellular jack\\" radio device. In addition to communicating with One True, Resuna monitors its host's thoughts and emotions, provides everyday information and communication, downloads requested memories or skills, adjusts their physiology, and, when offered the spoken code phrase \\"let overwrite, let override\\", can assume control of its host's body, and erase memories. Resuna learns its host's preferences and habits, is friendly and communicative, and can even play chess with its host or engage in other pastimes. Ten years before, Currie was the leader of a team of cowboy hunters who captured Lobo's cowboy gang after a long pursuit in which several of the team were killed and several, including Currie, badly injured. During their final confrontation, Currie sees Lobo fall from a high cliff, apparently to his death. In his briefing by One True, Currie is shown the recorded memories of a mother and daughter beaten, raped, and robbed by Lobo days earlier. Although such emotions are normally kept in check by Resuna, Currie is allowed to feel revulsion and hatred of Lobo, to improve his performance as a hunter. One True explains to Currie that, to decrease his chance of being detected and evaded, he has been assigned to hunt Lobo alone. After goodbyes to his wife of 23 years, Mary, Currie is dropped of by diskster (a futuristic, automatically piloted hovercraft) with various high-tech equipment, including an advanced cold weather suit, shape-adjusting ski/snowshoes, and a shelter that self- assembles from collected carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen matter. Within days, Currie is captured by Lobo, awakening after many days unconscious from the severe blow to his head that incapacitated him in a comfortable, geothermally- heated underground lair, to discover his copy of Resuna no longer responding to his mental or spoken requests. Nursed back to health by Lobo/Dave, the two men exchange life stories, which are so similar they joke that they could be brothers. No longer controlled by Resuna and One True, Currie agrees to join Dave in an effort to hide from One True. About half of the book consists of Currie and Dave's telling of their personal and the Earth's general history. Among the details revealed are that the beatings and rapes shown to Currie were fabrications, and that the mother and child are actually Dave's wife and child, who were captured and \\"turned\\" by One True during the \\"Meme Wars\\", giving them false memories of their history, from which, during Dave's actual visit to them to obtain medicine and supplies, he was able to temporarily free them. Currie's search for Dave resulted in enough information being uploaded that they must abandon his lair and attempt to build another, while remaining undetected by One True's network of surveillance satellites. While caching supplies, Currie has a skiing fall, and, shaken up and angry, reflexively says \\"let overwrite, let override\\", to find himself immediately calm. A little later, he realizes that after saying the trigger phrase, he was unconscious and under the control of his Resuna for several minutes, during which time it/he carelessly left a trail visible to satellites, and, he assumes, Resuna uploaded information to One True, though he is still unable to make the usual mental contact with Resuna. Hurrying to their old lair to warn Dave, he discovers in a previously unexplored room there a suspended animation device, unmentioned in Dave's story, and beyond anything he could have constructed himself. Dave informs him that, while he was unconscious, Dave used various means to burn out his cellular jack, assuring that even if his Resuna reactivated, it would be unable to contact One True, and promising to tell him the omitted parts of his story after they have fled to safety. After abandoning the first lair, while the two work to excavate their new one, Dave tells more of his life story. As Dave reaches its conclusion, Currie realizes that his disabled Resuna is not due to his head injury, but due to Dave uploading an additional meme, \\"Freecyber\\". Although designed during the Meme Wars to disable other memes, principally One True, Dave's story explained that every version of Freecyber had \\"mutated\\" into as controlling a meme as the ones it was intended to fight. Enraged, Currie attacks Dave, and is on the verge of killing him when Dave shouts \\"let overwrite, let override\\", disabling Currie, and flees. Upon regaining consciousness, Currie finds his Resuna fully functional, though still unable to contact with One True. He pursues Dave, arriving at the original lair to discover him already captured by a large team of hunters. Making no effort to fight or hide, Curry joins them, and returns to his home and civilization. Back in civilization, a cellular jack is installed in Dave's head, but One True is unable to load a functioning Resuna in his brain. Currie's Resuna is behaving atypically, indicating to he and it that it has become a true, human-like person. He neither requests nor is compelled to have his burnt-out jack repaired, and demands to be allowed to speak with One True via eyes and ears. One True speaks with him, explaining that his Resuna is an experimental version designed to interact with Freecyber, and that his mission was planned to result in his capture in order for One True to obtain a \\"wild copy\\" of the last generation of Freecyber for its research. As a learning AI, One True explains, it is dissatisfied with its lack of true human empathy and the lack of freedom accorded humans under the present scheme, and seeks to change it, without allowing human society to return to its previous warring, suffering state. The story closes a few years later, with Dave, his wife Nancy, Currie, and Mary listening to Dave's daughter Kelly give a philosophical speech at her high school graduation, while Currie, his cellular jack repaired, converses with One True about Kelly's speech, the reluctance of many people to replace their old, more controlling version of Resuna with new ones, and the nature of the human experience. Reception Gary K. Wolfe described Candle as \\"a novel that genuinely turns on the quality of its ideas, familiar as some of those ideas may be. . . . [T]he fact that Candle turns out, in the end, to be a philosophical novel with a stimulating debate at its center ought not to be held against it. Barnes is at least asking us to look the seductive surface of one of SF's moist popular current buzzes and examine what the idea of memes might actually tell us about matters of freedom and human nature.\\"\\"Locus Looks at Books: Reviews by Gary K.

As the Bauhaus' only female master she created enormous change within the weaving department as it transitioned from individual pictorial works to modern industrial designs. Her textile work is thought to typify the distinctive style of Bauhaus textiles. She joined the Bauhaus as a student in 1920, became a junior master in 1927 and a full master the next year. She was dismissed for political reasons in 1931, two years before the Bauhaus closed under pressure from the Nazis. The textile department was a neglected part of the Bauhaus when St√∂lzl began her career, and its active masters were weak on the technical aspects of textile production. She soon became a mentor to other students and reopened the Bauhaus dye studios in 1921. After a brief departure, St√∂lzl became the school's weaving director in 1925 when it relocated from Weimar to Dessau and expanded the department to increase its weaving and dyeing facilities. She applied ideas from modern art to weaving, experimented with synthetic materials, and improved the department's technical instruction to include courses in mathematics. The Bauhaus weaving workshop became one of its most successful facilities under her direction. Early life St√∂lzl was born in Munich, Bavaria. She attended a high school for the daughters of professionals, graduating in 1913. She began her studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts) in 1914, where she studied glass painting, decorative arts and ceramics under the well known director Richard Riemerschmid.Baumhoff Anja. Gunta St√∂lzl In 1917 St√∂lzl's studies were interrupted by the ongoing war and she volunteered to work as a nurse for the Red Cross, behind the front lines until the end of World War I in 1918. Upon her return home she re-immersed herself in her studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich, where she participated in the school's curriculum reform. It was during this time that St√∂lzl encountered the Bauhaus manifesto. Having decided to continue her studies at the newly formed Bauhaus school, St√∂lzl spent the summer of 1919 in the glass workshop and mural painting classes of the Bauhaus to earn her trial acceptance into Johannes Itten‚Äôs preliminary course. By 1920, St√∂lzl had not only been fully accepted into the Bauhaus school, but had received a scholarship to attend.Sigrid Wortmann Weltge. Bauhaus Textiles: Women Artists and the Weaving Workshop. Thames and Hudson, 1993. () Student life African Chair with Marcel Breuer Within St√∂lzl‚Äôs first year at the Bauhaus, she began what she referred to as the ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs department‚Äù, which due to the underlying gender roles within the school, eventually became synonymous with the weaving workshop. St√∂lzl was very active within the weaving department and was immediately seen as a leader among the pack. At the time, the department was putting emphasis on artistic expression and individual works that reflected the teachings and philosophies of the painters who served as Bauhaus masters. The Weimar Bauhaus had a very relaxed atmosphere that was almost wholly dependent on the students teaching themselves and one another. Unfortunately, Georg Muche, who was the head of the weaving workshop at the time, had very little interest in the craft itself. He saw weaving and other textile arts as ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs work‚Äô and thus was of very little help with the technical processes involved. This meant the students were left to their own devices to figure out all technical aspects of a craft most had little experience working in. Due to this set-up, it is important to look at the Weimar era works visually as opposed to technically.College of the Atlantic.Women Artists In 1921 St√∂lzl and two of her friends made a trip to Italy to view the art and architecture they had studied for further inspiration. After passing her journeyman's examination as a weaver and taking courses in textile dyeing at a school in Krefeld, St√∂lzl was able to reopen the previously abandoned dye studios. It was becoming obvious that she was giving direction to the other students, though unofficially, as neither Muche, the form master nor Helene B√∂rner, the crafts master, could really teach and promote the students in technical aspects. In 1921, St√∂lzl collaborated with Marcel Breuer on the African Chair - made of painted wood with a colorful textile weave. The first official Bauhaus exhibition took place in September 1923 in the Haus am Horn building. The building itself, primarily designed by Georg Muche, was a simplistic, highly modern cube structure made largely of steel and concrete. Each room of the house was designed around its specific function and had specially made furniture, hardware etc., which had been produced in the Bauhaus workshops. The weaving workshop participated by creating rugs, wall hangings and other objects for various rooms all of which won favorable reviews. With this exhibition, Walter Gropius released an essay titled ‚ÄòArt and Technology ‚Äì A New Unity' which seemed to have a great impact on the women of the weaving workshop. Despite the favorable reviews of their works, the women began to move away from the pictorial imagery and traditional methods they had been working with up to this point and began working abstractly, attempting to make objects more in line with Kandinsky‚Äôs teachings of the ‚Äòinner self‚Äô. Bauhaus master Wall hanging \\"Slit Tapestry Red/Green\\" 1927/28 Gunta St√∂lzl textiles on a Marcel Breuer chair (1922) In April 1925, the Weimar Bauhaus closed and reopened in Dessau in 1926. St√∂lzl, who had previously left the Bauhaus upon graduating to help Itten set up Ontos Weaving Workshops in Herrliberg, near Zurich, Switzerland, returned to become the weaving studio's technical director, replacing Helene B√∂rner, and work with Georg Muche, who would remain the form master. Although she was not officially made a junior master until 1927, it was clear both the organization and content of the workshop were under her control. It was obvious from the start, the pairing of Muche and St√∂lzl was not enjoyed by either side, and resulted in St√∂lzl running the workshop almost single-handedly from 1926 onward. The new Dessau campus was equipped with a greater variety of looms and much improved dyeing facilities, which allowed St√∂lzl to create a more structured environment. Georg Muche brought in Jacquard looms to help intensify production. He saw this as especially important now as the workshops were the school's main source of funding for the new Dessau Bauhaus. The students rejected this and were not happy with the way Muche had used the school's funds. This, among other smaller events, instigated a student uprising within the weaving department. On March 31, 1927, despite some staff objections, Muche left the Bauhaus. With his departure, St√∂lzl took over both as form master and master crafts person of the weaving studio. She was assisted by many other key Bauhaus women, including Anni Albers, Otti Berger and Benita Otte. St√∂lzl began trying to move weaving away from its ‚Äòwoman‚Äôs work‚Äô connotations by applying the vocabulary used in modern art, moving weaving more and more in the direction of industrial design. By 1928, the need for practical materials was highly stressed and experimentation with materials such as cellophane became more prominent. St√∂lzl quickly developed a curriculum which emphasized the use of handlooms, training in the mechanics of weaving and dyeing, and taught classes in math and geometry, as well as more technical topics such as weave techniques and workshop instruction. The earlier Bauhaus methods of artistic expression were quickly replaced by a design approach which emphasized simplicity and functionality. St√∂lzl considered the workshop a place for experimentation and encouraged improvisation. She and her students, especially Anni Albers, were very interested in the properties of a fabric and in synthetic fibers. They tested materials for qualities such as color, texture, structure, resistance to wear, flexibility, light refraction and sound absorption. St√∂lzl believed the challenge of weaving was to create an aesthetic that was appropriate to the properties of the material. In 1930, St√∂lzl issued the first ever Bauhaus weaving workshop diplomas and set up the first joint project between the Bauhaus and the Berlin Polytex Textile company which wove and sold Bauhaus designs. 1In 1931 she published an article entitled ‚ÄúThe Development of the Bauhaus Weaving Workshop‚Äù, in the Bauhaus Journal spring issue. St√∂lzl's ability to translate complex formal compositions into hand woven pieces combined with her skill of designing for machine production made her by far the best instructor the weaving workshop was to have. Under St√∂lzl's direction, the weaving workshop became one of the most successful faculties of the Bauhaus. Dismissal The school was constantly under attack as the Nazi Party gained more power, and the school's sacrifices to remain open were beginning to break its own ideology. During Mies van der Rohe‚Äôs directorship there was intense pressure from the community for St√∂lzl to be let go. Van der Rohe required her resignation in 1931, not due to incompetence but because of the surrounding political atmosphere. The students were so opposed to this unjust action they dedicated an entire issue of the school newspaper to St√∂lzl upon her dismissal. The Dessau campus of the Bauhaus was closed in 1932 by the Nazis, and the Bauhaus itself, which had moved from Dessau to Berlin, officially dissolved, by vote of the faculty, on 19 July 1933. After the Bauhaus After leaving the Bauhaus in 1931, St√∂lzl returned to Zurich where she and her partners Gertrud Preiswerk and Heinrich- Otto H√ºrlimann, also former Bauhaus students, created a private handweaving business called S-P-H Stoffe (S-P-H Fabrics). The business floundered and closed soon after, in 1933, due to financial difficulties. St√∂lzl became a member of the Schweizerischer Werkbund in 1932 and in 1934 \\"Das Werk\\", the Werkbund's official magazine, profiled her career. It was also in 1934 that St√∂lzl received a major commission to make curtains for the Zurich cinema. In 1935, St√∂lzl and her former partner Heinrich-Otto H√ºrlimann took another crack at business together and opened S&H; Stoffe. By 1937, St√∂lzl became the sole owner of Handweberei Flora (Hand Weaving Studio Flora) and had joined the Gesellschaft Schweizer Malerinnen, Bildhauerinnen und Kunstgewerblerinnen (Society of Swiss Women Painters, Sculptors and Craftswomen). During the following decades, both the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Busch- Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts acquired pieces of St√∂lzl's work while she continued to work at her hand weaving business, creating mainly textiles for interior design. In 1967 St√∂lzl dissolved her business and devoted all her time to tapestry weaving, a large shift in focus. It was also in 1967 that the Victoria and Albert Museum acquired her designs and samples, resulting in major national and international collections. St√∂lzl died in 1983 in Zurich.

At that time it was one of the six biggest NHS trusts in England with a budget of over ¬£600 million per annum and 12,000 staff. It treats in excess of 1 million patients per annum, delivers 10,000 babies a year and provides the largest emergency service (admissions and ED attendances). It has one of the best records in the country for cardiac care and also specialises in kidney disease, cancer and vascular surgery. Its research programmes in cardio-vascular science, stroke medicine and diabetes are internationally renowned. It was originally led by Philip Hammersley CBE (Chairman, 2000‚Äì06), Dr Peter Reading (Chief Executive, 2000‚Äì07) and Dr Allan Cole (Medical Director, 2000‚Äì10). In May 2008 new chief executive, Malcolm Lowe-Lauri, joined the trust from Kings College Hospital. John ADLER has been CEO since 2013. Facilities In 2015, Interserve won ¬£300m contract to manage trust buildings over 7 years but the deal was ended in April 2016 after it was issued with a warning over poor cleaning standards. In March 2018 the trust agreed to create a wholly owned subsidiary to run its facilities management services which will increase salaries, spend ¬£2m on cleaning and recruit more maintenance staff. About 1700 staff will be affected and about 200 will get a pay rise. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ University Hospitals of Leicester achieved the highest possible ranking for service quality from the Healthcare Commission five years running - '3 Stars' in 2003/04 and 2004/05 followed by 'Excellent' from 2005/06 to 2007/08. This was the best five year record of any multi-specialty teaching trust in England, and followed a remarkable turnaround from zero stars in 2002/03 (associated with an administrative error relating to waiting lists for minor surgery), which the Leicester Mercury described as 'zeros to heroes'. In 2007/08, the Trust maintained its excellent rating for Quality of Service issued by the Healthcare Commission. In 2008/09 the rating slipped to 'Good'. In October 2013 as a result of the Keogh Review the Trust was put into the highest risk category by the Care Quality Commission. The Trust predicted a deficit of ¬£39.8m in 2013-14, the largest of any in England. The emergency department at Leicester Royal Infirmary is the busiest single unit in the country. It covers a population of 1.4 million. From 2014 to 2015 admissions rose by 12%. The trust has reduced its average length of stay by 7%, which has, in part, compensated for the increased admissions. Performance on the target of seeing 95% of people who attend accident and emergency departments within four hours has improved since January 2015. When it was inspected by the Care Quality Commission in November 2015 it was found to be chaotic and unsafe, with the nurse in charge of insufficient seniority. In May 2017 the trust declared a critical incident after patients faced extreme delays in its new ¬£48m emergency department and bed occupancy at Leicester Royal Infirmary was running at 97%. It has reached a record of 805 attendances in a single day. In October 2017 the trust had 500 nursing vacancies. More than half of the trust‚Äôs 440 nurses from EU countries had left. It was proposed to replace some registered nurse posts with a nursing associate. In January 2018 18% of patients needing admission from A&E; had to wait more than four hours for a bed - an improvement in the Trust's performance against other NHS hospitals compared with previous years. In November 2018 it was reported that the trust was having severe problems running the Intensive Care Unit at Leicester General Hospital because of problems with staff recruitment and retention. It proposed to move the unit to an 11 bed extension at Glenfield Hospital and open a six bed ICU annex at Leicester Royal Infirmary. A number of cancer patients had surgery cancelled due to lack of intensive care beds. Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce of Macmillan Cancer Support said, ‚ÄúIt is unacceptable that some people living with cancer are experiencing last-minute cancellations for surgery for nonclinical reasons. These people will have prepared both practically and emotionally for their operation, and this news will cause additional stress and upset at an already difficult time. We worry that these cancellations in Leicester are just one example of similar challenges faced by NHS trusts across the country, and symptomatic of a system which is underfunded and understaffed. This must not become the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô.‚ÄùNHS bed shortages cause late cancellation of cancer surgeries The Guardian Staff relations Staff were banned from drinking tea or coffee in outpatient clinic reception areas in October 2014 by Michelle Scowen, matron for clinical support and imaging because it gave the wrong impression to staff and the public that clinic staff were not working as hard as they might be.

He was born in East Boston, Massachusetts.  Chicago Cubs  Merullo (left) with Johnny Pesky, 2008 Merullo played shortstop for the Chicago Cubs for seven years in the major leagues in the 1940s. He appeared in three games during the 1945 World Series against two-time MVP Hal Newhouser, pitchers Virgil Trucks, Tommy Bridges, and slugger Hank Greenberg of the Detroit Tigers, who defeated the Cubs in seven games in the Series, the last one the Cubs played in until . With the death of Andy Pafko on October 8, 2013, Merullo was the last surviving member of the 1945 team, as well as being the oldest living former member of the Cubs. Merullo's major league career began in 1941, and in 1942-45 he won the shortstop job, with Stan Hack playing third base and Merullo's roommate, Phil Cavarretta, at first. In 1946, Billy Jurges, Bobby Sturgeon and Merullo shared the shortstop position until Merullo regained the position in 1947. During this period, Merullo was known to have the quickest throwing arm in baseball. Merullo's time with the Cubs caused him, in later years, to be a frequent subject of Chicago columnist Mike Royko's annual Cub Quiz.  Scout  After retiring from professional baseball, Merullo was chief scout for the Cubs from 1950‚Äì72, signing, among others, relief pitcher Moe Drabowsky. He left the Cubs in 1973 to join the then-fledgling Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau, where he served until his retirement at the age of 85 in 2003.  Personal life  Merullo had four sons, the eldest is nicknamed \\"Boots\\" because Merullo famously made four errors in a single inning having been informed by the club's owner, Philip Wrigley, that his wife had just delivered.

Lundgren played football and baseball for the University of Illinois Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and played eight seasons of Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. In eight years with the Cubs, he compiled a record of 91 wins and 55 losses. His best season was 1907 when he won 18 games, pitched 207 innings without allowing a home run, threw seven shutouts, and gave up only 27 earned runs in 28 games. His 1.17 earned run average was the second lowest in the Major Leagues, and his average of 5.652 hits allowed per nine innings was the lowest in the Major Leagues. Control problems held him back from greater renown. The Atlanta Constitution in 1913 summarized Lundgren's strengths and weaknesses: \\"He had everything including speed to burn green hickory and an assortment of curves that would keep a criptograph specialist figuring all night but he was wild as a March hare in a cyclone and couldn't locate the plate with a field glass.\\" After retiring as a player, Lundgren became a coach. He was the head baseball coach and assistant football coach at the University of Michigan from 1914 to 1921. He was the head baseball coach and assistant athletic director at the University of Illinois from 1921 until his death in 1934. Lundgren's baseball teams at Michigan and Illinois won eight Big Ten Conference baseball championships, a total exceeded by only three other coaches in Big Ten history. Early years Lundgren was born in Marengo, Illinois in 1880. His father, Pehr Hjalmar Lundgren, was born in √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden, emigrated to the United States in 1868 and worked as a house painter, contractor and interior decorator. His mother, Delilah (Renwick) Lundgren, was born on a farm outside Marengo. His father purchased a farm north of Marengo, where the family lived until 1900. Lundgren graduated from Marengo High School in 1898. He was the oldest of four children, having a younger brother, Franz Emil, and two younger sisters, Eva and Alma. University of Illinois Lundgren enrolled at the University of Illinois Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1898, studied civil engineering, and graduated in 1902. As a senior, he published a paper titled, \\"Comparative strength of gravel and broken-stone concretes\\". While at Illinois, he played at the halfback and fullback positions for the Illini football team for three years. He was also a pitcher for the Illini baseball team from 1899 to 1902 and was the team captain in 1902. Chicago Cubs Lundgren with the Cubs The Chicago Cubs saw Lundgren pitch in an exhibition game between the Illinois college team and the Cubs. The Cubs gave Lundgren a tryout, and he made his Major League debut for the Cubs on June 19, 1902, shortly after completing his studies at the University of Illinois. One sports writer noted that \\"the Cubs had a new pitcher, and the world lost a civil engineer.\\" In his rookie season, Lundgren pitched 17 complete games (in 18 appearances) and had an earned run average of 1.97. Lundgren pitched for the Cubs from 1902 to 1909 and compiled a 91‚Äì55 (.623) record and career earned run average of 2.42. During his best years, from 1904 to 1907, he compiled a record of 65‚Äì27. The Cubs won three straight pennants in 1906, 1907, and 1908 and World Series championships in 1907 and 1908. During the 1906 and 1907 seasons, Lundgren compiled records of 17‚Äì6 and 18‚Äì7. In 1907, Lundgren pitched 207 innings without allowing a home run, threw seven shutouts, and gave up only 27 earned runs in 28 games. His 1.17 earned run average was the second lowest in the Major Leagues (trailing teammate Jack Pfiester who had a 1.15 ERA), and his average of 5.652 hits allowed per nine innings was the lowest in the Major Leagues. However, he did not pitch in any of the Cubs' World Series games. His earned run average jumped from 1.17 in 1907 to 4.22 in 1908. He appeared in only two games for the Cubs in 1909, pitching his last Major League game on April 23. At the end of April 1909, the Cubs placed Lundgren on waivers for a price of $1.50. Lundgren's biggest weakness as a pitcher was lack of control. Even in 1907, his best year, Lundgren averaged 4.0 walks per nine innings pitched. In 1909, he averaged 8.3 walks per nine innings before being released. A profile of Lundgren published in 1913 by The Atlanta Constitution discussed his strengths and weaknesses: > \\"He had everything including speed to burn green hickory and an assortment > of curves that would keep a criptograph specialist figuring all night but he > was wild as a March hare in a cyclone and couldn't locate the plate with a > field glass. ... He had a strange hold on the art of steering the ball away > from the plate that would make Wild Willie Donovan and Cy Seymour look like > a brace of pikers who had been touched for their meal tickets.\\" Lundgren was called \\"the best cold-weather pitcher in the profession\\" by the Reach Baseball Guide. He developed a reputation for pitching well in the spring and fall, but not faring as well during the hot summer months. While pitching for the Cubs, he worked in the off-season as a draftsman from 1902 to 1904 and as a dairy farmer after 1904. In the summer of 1909, Lundgren appealed from a decision by the Cubs management to deny him a share of the team's $10,000 World Series bonus for 1908. In June 1909, he won what was described as \\"a moral victory\\" when a non-binding decision was entered, declaring the exclusion of Lundgren to be unjust. Minor leagues Lundgren, 1919 After his Major League Baseball career ended in April 1909, Lundgren played minor league baseball for several years. In the spring of 1909, several teams expressed interest in Lundgren. Bill Armour, manager of the Toledo, Ohio team, reportedly lost interest because of Lundgren's reputation as a cold- weather pitcher: \\"Armour, however, discovered that Lundgren is a good man in the spring and fall, but during the hot months, when his services would be most in demand, he is unable to stand the strain.\\" The Cubs sold Lundgren to Brooklyn, and Brooklyn farmed him out to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Eastern League for the 1909 season.(\\"Carl Lundgren, the Cub's castoff, is pitching good ball for Joe Kelley's Toronto team.\\") However, he was suspended in June 1909 by Toronto manager Joe Kelley. A newspaper account on the suspension noted: \\"Lundgren is not in shape for a hard game, and the Toronto Club does not intend to pay him a big salary to get into shape when he's not half trying.\\" In August 1909, he was reported to be \\"pitching independent ball around Chicago.\\" During the 1910 season, he played for the Hartford Senators in the Connecticut State League, compiling a record of 6‚Äì3. At the end of the 1910 season, The Hartford Courant wrote: \\"Lundgren was regarded as the ablest pitcher in this league last season and he outclassed the other boxmen.\\" Lungren also played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1910, compiling a 1‚Äì4 record. In November 1910, he was sold to Topeka in the Western League. In 1911, he played for the Troy Trojans in the New York State League, compiling a 13‚Äì12 record in 31 games. He ended his playing career in 1912 with the Hartford Senators, compiling a record of 6‚Äì3 in 16 games. In what appears to have been Lundgren's last professional baseball game, he pitched a shutout against the Bridgeport Orators on September 10, 1912. There were newspaper reports in June 1913 indicating that Lundgren had a tryout with the Mobile team in the Southern League and that he had signed with the Atlanta Crackers or the Charleston Sea Gulls, but no record has been found of his playing for those teams.(Carl Lundgren, who in 1908 was a cog in that grand Chicago Cub machine, has just caught on for a trial with the Mobile club, of the Southern League.\\") Coaching career Lundgren as assistant football coach, 1919 In March 1912, Lundgren was hired to assist Boileryard Clarke in coaching the pitchers at Princeton University in 1912. After a short stint with Princeton, Lundgren returned to the field as a player with Hartford in June 1912. In January 1913, the University of Iowa expressed interest in hiring Lundgren as its baseball coach, but it appears that the deal fell through after the Iowa Board of Athletics was asked to meet his salary demands. In February 1913, he was also interviewed, but not hired, for the position of manager of a baseball team in Keokuk, Iowa.(reporting on hiring of George Manush) In August 1913, he was hired by the University of Michigan to succeed Branch Rickey as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. He was the baseball coach at Michigan from 1914 through 1920, compiling a record of 93‚Äì43‚Äì6. Lundgren developed several Major League players at Michigan, including George Sisler, who became one of baseball's greatest players. He was also an assistant football coach at Michigan under the legendary football coach, Fielding H. Yost. In his final three years at Michigan (1918‚Äì1920), Lundgren's baseball teams won consecutive Big Ten Conference championships with records of 9‚Äì1, 9‚Äì0 and 9‚Äì1 in conference play. While coaching at Michigan, Lundgren worked in the off-season as a traveling salesman. In June 1920, Lundgren left Michigan to become the baseball coach at his alma mater, the University of Illinois. He was Illinois' baseball coach for 14 years until his death in 1934. His Illini teams won Big Ten championships in 5 of Lundgren's 14 years as coach and tied for another. Lundgren also served as the assistant athletic director at Illinois under George Huff. Lundgren's Michigan and Illinois baseball teams won eight Big Ten Conference baseball championships. Only three coaches have won more Big Ten baseball championships‚ÄîGeorge Huff of Illinois, Dick Siebert of Minnesota, and John Anderson of Minnesota. Personal life Lundgren married S. Maude Cohoon in September 1904. He died in August 1934 of a heart attack at age 54.

Orion the Hunter is star lore created by the ancient Greeks. Star lore or starlore is the creating and cherishing of mythical stories about the stars and star patterns (constellations and asterisms); that is, folklore based upon the stars and star patterns. Using the stars to explain religious doctrines or actual events in history is also defined as star lore. Star lore has a very long history; it has been practiced by nearly every culture recorded in history, dating as far back as 5,500 years ago. It was practiced by prehistoric cultures of the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods as well. Orion and Scorpius One example of star lore is the inventing of the story of Orion the Hunter and the Scorpius the Scorpion by the ancient Greeks. This ancient culture saw a very startling pattern of bright stars in the winter sky that, from their point of view, resembled a mighty hunter, which they named Orion. During the summer, they saw another startling pattern of bright stars that resembled a scorpion. They noticed that the constellations of Orion and the scorpion were positioned at opposite ends of the sky and were never seen in the sky simultaneously. As one constellation rose above the eastern horizon, the other was setting below the western horizon, and when either one was high in the sky, the other was completely absent. The ancient Greeks felt compelled to explain this phenomenon by composing a story or myth based on the two constellations. The story was that Orion was a mighty and proud hunter who was stung by a scorpion. Orion died of the scorpion's sting and was placed among the stars by the gods. Although the scorpion was destroyed by the gods in vengeance for killing Orion, it was also placed among the stars. In order to prevent Orion and the scorpion from quarreling and fighting with each other in the sky, the gods placed Orion and the scorpion at opposite ends of the sky, and in opposite seasons, so that both of them can never be seen in the sky at the same time. Andromeda Another example of star lore is the story behind the constellation Andromeda, also known as \\"the chained woman\\". Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of Ethiopia, King Cepheus and Cassiopeia. The story goes that because Cassiopeia bragged so much of Andromeda's beauty to the Nereids, daughters of Poseidon, that they complained to their father, who sent a sea monster to destroy the coast of Ethiopia. Cepheus consulted an oracle for assistance and learned that the only way to save his lands was to sacrifice his daughter to Poseidon's monster.* Andromeda: the Chained Woman Andromeda was chained to a rock and left for the sea monster. Perseus, the hero of the story who had just killed the Gorgon Medusa found Andromeda in her distress and immediately, the two fell in love. Perseus asked for her name and refused to leave until he knew it, talking to her until she gave in. Andromeda told him her name, her country, and the reason for her imprisonment on the rock. He then consulted with Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and they decided that if Perseus rescued Andromeda from the sea monster, he could marry her. The story of how he then defeats the monster varies. Ovid describes his killing of the monster as a drawn out bloody battle. Other sources say that Perseus killed the sea monster with the aid of Medusa's head, turning the monster to stone. Andromeda and Perseus were married soon after,* Andromeda despite already being promised to her uncle, Phineus. At the wedding, Phineus and Perseus got into an altercation, and Perseus turned Phineus to stone using Medusa's head. The constellation is said to have astrological influences as well. It is said that any man born at the same time Andromeda is said to rise from the sea will be one without mercy; he will be emotionally unmoved even in the presence of grieving parents. The constellation also influences the birth of the executioner, a man who will kill swiftly for money and kill willingly. Sources describe men born with the rise of Andromeda as one who would feel nothing if faced with Andromeda chained to her rock, just as Perseus did and fell in love with the girl.* Andromeda: the Chained Woman Draco The Draco is another example of star lore. In Roman mythology, the constellation is representative of Ladon, the dragon that guarded the golden apples inside the garden, Hesperides. The tree was a wedding gift to Hera when she and Zeus were married, and she planted it on Mount Atlas. Hera tasked the Hesperides to guard the tree and put Ladon around the tree as well to ensure that the Hesperides would not steal the apples. In some sources, Ladon is called the child of Typhon and Echidna, who was half woman and half viper, and had hundreds of heads. In other versions of Ladon's story, the number of heads he had is not at all mentioned and he is described as the offspring of Ceto and Phorcys, two sea deities.* Draco Constellation Contrastingly, in Roman mythology, Draco was one of the Titans who waged war on the Olympic gods for ten years. He was killed by Minerva in the battle and thrown into the sky.* Draco Constellation  See also  * Dog days References * Star Lore: Prehistoric Skywriting * Star Tales ‚Äì Ian Ridpath * Andromeda: the Chained Woman * Andromeda * Draco Constellation Category:Astronomical myths Category:Ancient astronomy Category:Stars Category:Folklore ","title":"Star lore"},{"id":"10357807","text":"Dix Township is one of twelve townships in Ford County, Illinois, USA.

History = First formation = After the end of the Second World War, the Soviet High Command (Stavka) reorganized its troops on the territories it liberated from the Nazi occupation and now occupied. Stavka Directive Nr 11097 on 10 June 1945 created several new formations, known as Groups of Forces, equivalent to military districts but located outside the Soviet Union. The Central Group of Forces was created around that time from the 1st Ukrainian Front to control troops in Austria and Hungary, and did so from 1945 until 1955, when Soviet troops were withdrawn from Austria after the Austrian State Treaty was agreed. Its first commander was Marshal of the Soviet Union Ivan Konev. On its creation it consisted of the 4th, 5th, and 7th and 9th Guards Armies, the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, the 7th and 10th Breakthrough Artillery Corps, 3rd and 4th Guards Tank Armies, the 2nd Air Army, and the 18th Tank and 7th Guards Mechanized Corps.Stavka Directive No. 11096 Headquarters was at Baden bei Wien. During the summer of 1945, 7th and 9th Guards Armies were withdrawn back to the Soviet Union. By the end of the summer, the corps directly subordinated to the group had been withdrawn. In August 1946, the 4th Guards Army was withdrawn to the Odessa Military District. On 20 March 1947, the 5th Guards Army was disbanded. In May 1947, the 3rd and 4th Guards Mechanized Armies (former 3rd and 4th Guards Tank Armies), now reduced to mobilization divisions, were transferred to the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany. In February 1949, the 2nd Air Army was renumbered as the 59th. In June 1955 the group included the following units.Georgy Zhukov, Transcript of October (1957) Plenum of the CPSU and other documents. - M .: MF \\"Democracy\\", 2001. / Note Zhukov on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Austria.

Until that time, no Soviet troops were permanently garrisoned within Czechoslovakian territory. The Central Group of forces had a total strength of about 85,000 and included 28th Army Corps headquarters (Olomouc, Czechoslovakia, 8.1968 - 7.1991), moved forward from Chernovtsy in the Carpathian Military District. Forces included two tank divisions, three mechanized infantry divisions, three missile brigades, an artillery brigade, and an airborne assault brigade. Four of the five Soviet ground divisions in Czechoslovakia were stationed in the Czech lands (15th Guards Tank Division at Milovice, 18th Guards Motor Rifle Division at Mlad√° Boleslav, 48th Motor Rifle Division at Vysok√© M√Ωto, and 31st Tank Division at Brunt√°l), while one was headquartered in Slovakia (the 30th Guards Motor Rifle Division at Zvolen). Group headquarters was located in Milovice (38 km northeast of Prague). Also at Milovice was the 131st Mixed Aviation Division, which arrived from Ivano-Frankovsk in the Ukrainian SSR in August 1968.Michael Holm, 131st Mixed Aviation Division, accessed October 2011 Organization of Central Group of Forces as of 1988 Following the end of the Cold War, the force was withdrawn as follows: * 28th Army Corps headquarters to Kemerovo, Siberian Military District * 15th Guards Tank Division to Chebakul, Volga-Ural Military District * 18th Guards Motor Rifle Division to Kaliningrad, Baltic Military District * 30th Guards Motor Rifle Division to the 5th Guards Tank Army/5th Guards Army Corps, Byelorussian Military District, and reduced to a storage base * 31st Tank Division to the Moscow Military District and later amalgamated with 47th Tank Division as 3rd Motor Rifle Division * 48th Motor Rifle Division - it remained in Czechoslovakia until 1990 when it was the first Division to depart (between February and May 1990).Craig Crofoot, Central Group of Forces Version 3.0.0, MicroArmorMayhem. 1996 Jane's Intelligence Review information indicated the division had been moved to Smolensk in the Moscow Military District where it was later disbanded. Russian forum information ( and following) indicates that it was actually withdrawn to Chuguyev in Ukraine using the same garrison as the disbanded 75th Guards Tank Division. It appears that there wasn‚Äôt enough space for the entire Division, so the 210th MRR was attached to the 18th Guards Motor Rifle Division. The remainder of the division departed for Ukraine, with the last arriving by May 1991. By then, it had been decided that in order to avoid the restrictions on the CFE Treaty, certain elements of the Soviet Army would be transferred to other non-MOD armed forces. Whole units were transferred to the KGB. When the last of the 48th arrived in Chuguev, the entire Division was transferred to the Directorate of Instruction for Special Purposes KGB by June 1991. Regiments included the 265 –≥–≤., 1335 –º—Å–ø, 353 –æ—É—á–±, 31 –æ—Ä–±, 813 –æ–±—Å, 88 –æ—Ä–≤–±, 409 –æ–±–º–æ, 34 –æ–º–µ–¥–±, 99 –æ–∏—Å—Ä, 348 –æ—Ä—Ö–∑. To replace the loss of the 210th MRR, the 255th Guards MRR was formed for the division, probably from what was left of the 75th GTD. From 1992 the government of Ukraine took command of the division, and they later redesignated it the 6th Division of the National Guard of Ukraine. It was eventually in the 1990s reorganised as a brigade. * 185th Guards Rocket Brigade moved to Balkanabat * 442nd Rocket Brigade was withdrawn from Hvƒõzdov, Ralsko, Czechoslovakia, where it had been formed in September 1987, to Shuya in Russia, in May 1990. * 5th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade moved to Shuya * 238th Separate Helicopter Regiment moved to Kalyniv * 490th Separate Helicopter Regiment moved to Tula * 91st Engineer-Sapper Regiment moved to Okhtyrka * 233rd Separate Radio Engineering Regiment moved to Novosibirsk The Group was formally disbanded on 19 June 1991.Michael Holm, CEntral Group of Forces  Commanders  * 1968-72 : Colonel-General Aleksandr Mayorov, * 1972-76 : Colonel-General Ivan Tenishchev, * 1976-79 : Colonel-General Dmitri Sukhorukov, * 1979-80 : Colonel-General Dmitry Yazov, * 1980-84 : Colonel-General Grigory Borisov, * 1984-87 : Colonel-General Viktor Yermakov, * 1987-91 : Colonel-General Eduard Vorobyev.

The club was established as a home for blues musicians, although today it books predominantly indie rock acts and local groups. History The Blind Pig opened in 1971. Tom Isaia and Jerry DelGiudice created it as a European- influenced cafe, complete with espresso/cappuccino, a unique and varied food menu, including home made soups, Italian biscotti, crostini, a full wine and beer list, and top-notch Blues entertainment. The partners renovated an old downtown Ann Arbor building and named the combined cafe/club after illegal after-hours gathering places, referred to by the slang term blind pig, another name for a speakeasy.Though a newspaper article refers to the use of the name as a term for a police officer who looks the other way at illegal alcohol sales. DelGiudice started the still-operating Blind Pig Records recording label in 1975 to showcase music by many of the groups who performed regularly at the club. Isaia and DelGiudice sold the venue in 1979 to Dave Whitmore,Land Contract Sale, as recorded in Washtenaw County records who in turn sold to Roy and Betty Goffett three years later. They doubled the club's space by renovating the rear portion of the building, opening the 8-Ball Saloon on the lower level and moving the stage to the more spacious main floor. The expansion made the venue more conducive to crowd-heavy rock shows and has hosted acts such as Joan Baez, Bo Diddley, George Thorogood, 10,000 Maniacs, Sonic Youth, Soul Asylum, Soundgarden, The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Since then, the Blind Pig has attracted a steady stream of up-and- coming acts, hosting shows almost every night all year round. Trivia * In 1989, a then little-known Nirvana performed a sold-out show at the Blind Pig, thanks in large part to Soundgarden, who recommended the band during its sold- out performance a week prior. In a televised MTV interview years later, they cited the Blind Pig as their all-time favorite venue to play.

His emergence formed part of the Second Muslim Civil War and the faction he led stood in opposition to the Umayyad Caliphate, which controlled Syria and Egypt, and the caliphate of Abd Allah ibn al- Zubayr, which controlled the Hejaz and Iraq. Early life and career Najda was born in circa 655 and belonged to the Banu Hanifa subtribe of the Banu Bakr, resident in the Yamama (central Arabia).Dixon 1969, p. 298. As a young man, he already wielded considerable influence among the Kharijites of the Banu Hanifa in his home region. In 680, he launched a rebellion in the Yamama against the Umayyad Caliphate, roughly coinciding with the Umayyads' suppression of Husayn ibn Ali's revolt during the Battle of Karbala.Rubinacci 1993, p. 858. During the 683 Umayyad siege of Mecca, where the anti-Umayyad opposition leader Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr was holed up, Najda and his horsemen came to Ibn al-Zubayr's aid.Wellhausen 1927, p. 165. Following the lifting of the siege, Ibn al-Zubayr declared himself caliph and Najda and other Kharijite leaders left for Basra. There, under the leadership of the Kharijite leader Nafi ibn al-Azraq, they confronted the army of their erstwhile ally, Ibn al- Zubayr, who sought to capture the city in 684 after its Umayyad governor had been ousted. The city and its Arab garrison ultimately recognized Ibn al- Zubayr's suzerainty and the Kharijites relocated to nearby Ahwaz. Leader of the Kharijites in Arabia Political differences emerged between Najda and Nafi, leading the former to defect and return to the Yamama, where the Kharijites were led by Abu Talut Salim ibn Matar. Abu Talut had seized Jawn al-Khadarim, a massive agricultural tract in the Yamama that was previously owned by the Banu Hanifa but seized by the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I (), and distributed among his followers its lands and the 4,000 slaves Mu'awiya had sent to till the lands.Dixon 1969, p. 297. In 685, Najda and his retinue intercepted at Jabala a Mecca-bound caravan from Basra and distributed the loot among his Kharijite partisans in Jawn al-Khadarim, whom he also advised to continue utilizing the slaves they captured to work the fields after they had been freed from this labor. His actions and advice brought him distinction among the Kharijites of the Yamama and when he proposed to be their leader, he gained their unanimous support, including from Abu Talut, who stepped down. Thenceforth, the Kharijite movement in Arabia at the time was named the Najdat after Najda. Not long after he became leader, Najda launched a raid against the Banu Ka'b, a branch of the Banu Amir, in Bahrayn (eastern Arabia) and landed a heavy blow to them at the Battle of Dhu'l-Majaz, seizing the corn and dates that the Banu Ka'b had looted from a nearby market.Rubinacci 1993, p. 859. Najda's victory signaled the start of a series of victories that would ultimately give him control over most of Arabia to the detriment of Ibn al- Zubayr, who proved incapable of confronting the Kharijites. In 686, he returned to Bahrayn, this time attacking the Banu Abd al-Qays tribe, which opposed the Kharijites. With the assistance of the Azd tribe, he slew or captured many Abd al-Qays tribesmen in Qatif, where he headquartered himself afterward. Najda's increasing strength and control of Bahrayn and the Yamama threatened the contiguity of Ibn al-Zubayr's caliphate by blocking the routes between his headquarters in Mecca and his key province of Basra. Ibn al- Zubayr's son, the governor of Basra, Hamza, attempted to rollback Najda's gains in Bahrayn by dispatching against the Kharijites a 14,000-strong army led by Abd Allah ibn Umayr al-Laythi.Dixon 1969, pp. 298‚Äì299. However, Najda and his men ambushed and scattered the Zubayrid force in 686.Dixon 1969, p. 299. After his victory against the Zubayrid army, Najda dispatched his lieutenant Atiyya ibn al-Aswad al-Hanafi to capture Oman from its chieftains Abbad ibn Abd Allah al-Julandi and his sons Sa'id and Sulayman. Atiyya succeeded, held the region for a few months then left it to his deputy, a certain Abu'l-Qasim, but the latter was soon after killed by Sa'id and Sulayman, who with local support recaptured Oman. Ties between Najda and Atiyya became frayed, possibly as a result of the former's unequal distribution of pay and communications with the Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, who controlled Syria and Egypt. By 687, Najda had conquered northern Bahrayn, forcing the Banu Tamim of Kazima to pay tribute.Dixon 1969, p. 300. In the ensuing months, he entered Sana'a in Yemen and sent his deputy Abu Fudayk to Hadhramawt; both places gave their allegiance to Najda and paid him tribute. By dint of these territorial gains, Najda became more powerful in Arabia than Ibn al-Zubayr, whose power in the peninsula was thereafter confined to the Hejaz (western Arabia).Wellhausen 1927, p. 200. Najda's growing influence prompted Abd al-Malik, who was preoccupied with domestic and external crises, to appeal for Najda's support and recognition of his caliphate. Abd al-Malik offered the Kharijite leader the formal governorship of the Yamama and a pardon for the bloodshed and financial losses he caused in Arabia if he would recognize Abd al-Malik as caliph.Dixon 1969, p. 300. Najda rejected the offer, but maintained friendly relations with the Umayyad caliph. Abd al-Malik achieved his goal, according to historian Abd al-Ameer Dixon, who held that by approaching Najda, Abd al-Malik sought either win him over and temporarily utilize him against Ibn al-Zubayr or, should be unsuccessful in this regard, to at least drive a wedge between Najda and his partisans.Dixon 1969, pp. 300‚Äì301. Najda led his partisans to the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca in June 687, attending alongside the partisans of Ibn al-Zubayr and Abd al-Malik.Dixon 1969, p. 301. According to Dixon, this demonstrated Ibn al-Zubayr powerlessness to prevent Najda from entering his capital city and that \\"Najda was equal in power\\" at the time to both Abd al-Malik and Ibn al-Zubayr. At the conclusion of the Hajj, Najda attempted to head north to capture Medina, but abandoned the campaign out of religious concerns; Medina's pro-Zubayrid defenders had made preparations to resist such an attack and their leader, Abdallah ibn Umar, was held in high regard by the Kharijites. Instead, Najda approached Ta'if, near Mecca, where its leader 'Amir ibn Urwa ibn Mas'ud al- Thaqafi gave Najda his allegiance. Najda relocated to nearby Tabala, assigned al-Haruq al-Hanafi governor of Ta'if, Sarat and Tabala (all in the Hejaz), and charged Sa'd al-Talayi' to collect tribute from the Banu Hilal tribe of Najran, before returning to his headquarters in Bahrayn.Dixon 1969, pp. 301‚Äì302. Upon his return to Bahrayn, he ordered that food provisions destined for Mecca and Medina be blocked to pressure Ibn al-Zubayr; he rescinded the order following appeals by pious individuals, notably Abd Allah ibn Abbas.Dixon 1969, p. 302. At the peak of Najda's power, divisions among his Kharijite partisans ultimately led to his downfall. Domestic opposition regarding Najda's friendly ties to Abd al-Malik, unequal distribution of military pay and favorable treatment to his associates despite their religious offenses culminated with Abu Fudayk killing Najda in Bahrayn in 691/92.Dixon 1969, pp. 302‚Äì303.

It became largely irrelevant for commercial fingerprint providers once the U.S. National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) introduced the free, but public Proprietary Fingerprint Test (PFT I, II and III, running from 2004 to present). Once the NIST test was available, all of the major commercial fingerprint vendors switched to the NIST test and ceased paying to participate in the FVC. The FVC tests that followed in 2006 and later were populated by largely anonymous participants and researchers. A few opportunistic commercial vendors who for reasons known only to them, did not participate in the public NIST test, instead took the opportunity to participate in FVC test, then touted the fact that they ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the cadre of anonymous participants. It is important to look at the participants that a vendor ‚Äúbeat,‚Äù and decide if the vendor is being deceptive. Another deceptive practice has been the use, by anti-fingerprint competitors, of FVC accuracy averages to characterize all fingerprint products‚Äô performance and accuracy as inferior to their alternative biometric modality. How FVC is operated: A subset of fingerprint impressions acquired with various sensors was provided to registered participants, to allow them to adjust the parameters of their algorithms. Participants were requested to provide enroll and match executable files of their algorithms; the evaluation was conducted at the organizers‚Äô facilities using the submitted executable files on a sequestered database, acquired with the same sensors as the training set. The organizers of FVC are: * Biometric System Laboratory (University of Bologna) * Pattern Recognition and Image Processing Laboratory (Michigan State University) * Biometric Test Center (San Jose State University) * Biometric Recognition Group - ATVS (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid) Each participant can submit up to one algorithm to the open and light categories. The first, second and third international competitions on fingerprint verification (FVC2000, FVC2002 and FVC2004) were organized in 2000, 2002 and 2004, respectively. These events received great attention both from academic and industrial biometric communities. They established a common benchmark, allowing developers to unambiguously compare their algorithms, and provided an overview of the state-of-the-art in fingerprint recognition. Based on the response of the biometrics community, FVC2000, FVC2002 and FVC2004 were undoubtedly successful initiatives. The interest shown in previous editions by the biometrics research community has prompted the organizers to schedule a new competition for the year 2006. In 2006 there were: * Four new databases (three real and one synthetic) * Two categories (open and light) * 53 participants (27 industrial, 13 academic, and 13 independent developers) * 70 algorithms submitted (44 in the open category and 26 in the light category)  Aim  * Continuous advances in the field of biometric systems and, in particular, in fingerprint-based systems (both in matching techniques and sensing devices) require that performance evaluation of biometric systems be carried out at regular intervals. * The aim of FVC2006 is to track recent advances in fingerprint verification, for both academia and industry, and to benchmark the state-of-the-art in fingerprint technology. * Further testing, on interoperability and quality related issues, will be performed in a second stage, after the competition is completed. * This competition should not be viewed as an \\"official\\" performance certification of biometric systems, since only parts of the system software will be evaluated by using images from sensors not native to each system. Nonetheless, the results of this competition will give a useful overview of the state-of-the- art in this field and will provide guidance to the participants for improving their algorithms. Categories * Two different sub-competitions (open category and light category) will be organized using the same databases. * Each participant is allowed to submit only one algorithm to each category. * The open category has no limits on memory requirements and template size. For practical testing reasons, the maximum response time of the algorithms is limited as follows: the maximum time for each enrollment is five seconds and the maximum time for each matching is three seconds. The test will be executed under Windows XP Professional O.S. on PC Intel Pentium 4 - 3.20 GHz - 1.00 GB RAM. * The Light category is intended for algorithms conceived for light architectures and therefore characterized by low computing needs, limited memory usage and small template size. The maximum time for enrollment is 0.3 seconds and the maximum time for matching is 0.1 seconds. The test will be executed under Windows XP Professional O.S. on PC Iintel Pentium 4 - 3.20 GHz - 1.00 GB RAM. The maximum memory that can be allocated by the processes is 4 MB. The maximum template size is 2 kB. A utility will be made available to the participants to test if their executables comply with the memory requirement. Databases One of the most important and time-consuming tasks of any biometric system evaluation is the data collection. Organizers have created a multi-database, containing four disjoint fingerprint databases, each collected with a different sensor technology. * Four distinct databases, provided by the organizers, constitute the benchmark: DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4. Each database is 150 fingers wide and 12 samples per finger in depth (1800 fingerprint images). Each database is partitioned in two disjoint subsets A and B: ::* subsets DB1-A, DB2-A, DB3-A and DB4-A, which contain the first 140 fingers (1680 images) of DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4, respectively, are used for the algorithm performance evaluation. ::* subsets DB1-B, DB2-B, DB3-B and DB4-B, containing the last 10 fingers (120 images) of DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4, respectively, will be made available to the participants as a development set to allow parameter tuning before the submission. * During performance evaluation, fingerprints belonging to the same database will be matched against each other. * The image format is BMP, 256 gray-levels, uncompressed. * The image size and resolution vary depending on the database (detailed information is available to the participants). * Data collection in FVC2006 was performed without deliberately introducing difficulties such as exaggerated distortion, large amounts of rotation and displacement and wet and dry impressions (as it was done in the previous editions), but the population is more heterogeneous and also includes manual workers and elderly people. The volunteers are simply asked to put their fingers naturally on the acquisition device, but no constraints were enforced to guarantee a minimum quality in the acquired images. The final datasets were selected from a larger database by choosing the most difficult fingers according to a quality index, to make the benchmark sufficiently difficult for a technology evaluation. Performance evaluation For each database and for each algorithm: * Each sample in the subset A is matched against the remaining samples of the same finger to compute the false non match rate (FNMR) (also referred as false rejection rate - FRR). If image g is matched to h, the symmetric match (i.e., h against g) is not executed to avoid correlation in the scores. The total number of genuine tests (in case no enrollment rejections occur) is: ((12*11) /2) * 140 = 9,240 * The first sample of each finger in the subset A is matched against the first sample of the remaining fingers in A to compute the false match rate (FMR) (also referred as false acceptance rate - FAR). If image g is matched to h, the symmetric match (like h against g) is not executed to avoid correlation in the scores. The total number of impostor tests (in case no enrollment rejections occur) is: ((140*139) /2) = 9,730 Although it is possible to reject images in enrollment, this is strongly discouraged. In fact, in FVC2006, as in FVC2004 and FVC2002, rejection in enrollment is fused with other error rates for the final ranking; in particular, each rejection in enrollment will produce a \\"ghost\\" template which will not match (matching score zero) with all the remaining fingerprints. For each algorithm and for each database, the following performance indicators are reported: * REJENROLL (Number of rejected fingerprints during enrollment) * REJNGRA (Number of rejected fingerprints during genuine matches) * REJNIRA (Number of rejected fingerprints during impostor matches) * Impostor and Genuine score distributions * FMR(t)/FNMR(t) curves, where t is the acceptance threshold * ROC(t) curve * EER (equal-error- rate) * EER* (the value that EER would take if the matching failures were excluded from the computation of FMR and FNMR) * FMR100 (the lowest FNMR for FMR<=1%) * FMR1000 (the lowest FNMR for FMR<=0.1%) * ZeroFMR (the lowest FNMR for FMR=0%) * ZeroFNMR (the lowest FMR for FNMR=0%) * Average enrollment time * Average matching time * Average and maximum template size * Maximum amount of memory allocated The following average performance indicators are reported over the four databases: * Average EER * Average FMR100 * Average FMR1000 * Average ZeroFMR * Average REJENROLL (average number of rejected fingerprints during enrollment) * Average REJMATCH (average number of rejected fingerprints during genuine and impostor matches) * Average enrollment time * Average matching time * Average template size (calculated on the average template size for each database) * Average memory allocated (calculated on the maximum amount of memory allocated for each database) Participants * Participants can be from academia, the industry, or independent developers. * Anonymous participation will be accepted: participants will be allowed to decide whether or not they want to publish their names together with their algorithm‚Äôs performance. Participants will be confidentially informed about the performance of their algorithm before they are required to make this decision. In case a participant decides to remain anonymous, the label \\"anonymous organization\\" will be used, and the real identity will not be revealed. * Together with their submissions, participants will be required to provide some general, high-level information about their algorithms (similar to those reported in FVC2004, see [R. Cappelli, D. Maio, D. Maltoni, J.L. Wayman and A.K. Jain, ‚ÄúPerformance Evaluation of Fingerprint Verification Systems‚Äù, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis Machine Intelligence, January 2006]). Whilst this required information will not disclose industrial secrets, since it is a very high level description of the approaches, it could be of interest to the entire fingerprint community. * Organizers of FVC2006 will not participate in the contest.

The series, consisting of 80 episodes of 90 seconds each, is one of the best- funded entrants into the world of original programming designed exclusively for online video. The show generated revenue through sponsorships, by selling some of the clothing worn by the characters, and by carrying advertising for Hairspray. The series premiered April 1, 2007 on MySpace, and supplemental scenes can be seen on MySpace as each of the characters has a MySpace page that includes blogs, Vlogs, and comments between the characters. According to the Financial Times, it marks MySpace's boldest push into original video content. The series was also distributed on YouTube, Veoh, and on an original Prom Queen website. The first season ended on June 20, 2007, with over 15 million views of the episodes during the original 12-week run, and has been viewed by over 40 million people to date. A 15-episode spinoff series, Prom Queen: Summer Heat, debuted on August 27, 2007. On May 7, 2008, a Japanese remake of the series, titled Tokyo Prom Queen, began airing in a similar format. On October 20, 2008, Michael Eisner confirmed that a third season of \\"Prom Queen\\" would be produced. A DVD of the series was released on October 8, 2008; it included behind-the-scenes footage and audio commentaries from the cast and creators of the series. In July 2009 it was announced that a follow- up series was being filmed, entitled Prom Queen: The Homecoming. Starting July 4, 2010, 'Homecoming' began to air on Citytv, a Canada-based television website. Four episodes were released each Monday. \\"Homecoming\\" connected 'Sam Has 7 friends' with 'Prom Queen' and primarily focused on the character, Sadie Simmons. 'Homecoming' ended with a cliffhanger, suggesting another season would appear. In October 2012, \\"Homecoming\\" debuted in the United States (along with the original \\"Prom Queen\\" and \\"Sam Has 7 Friends\\") on The CW's website. As of November 2014, the first season can be seen for free on YOUTUBE, at the channel promqueentv. The episodes contain their original edits, without being pasted together as they had been on THE CW website.

After Edwards' death, the property was said to have passed in 1877, via a 99-year lease, to the brothers John and George Cruger, with the understanding that it would revert to his heirs after the lease expired. Apparently, this never happened. It is alleged that the Crugers were wardens of Trinity Church, an Episcopal Church‚Äîtoday, one of New York City's biggest land owners. Maybe everything was tangled in a muddle of colonial Manhattan land giveaways. But, according to family lore, the whole tract wound up in Trinity's hands. Trinity indeed got a large slice of the land that seems to be described in the Edwards family account. But the church got the last of the ground in 1705, all of it directly from Queen Anne, according to a church pamphlet published in 1955, at a time when Trinity was bedeviled by Edwards family claims. The legend has since proved persistent, and indeed some high-profile claims of rightful ownership to the fortune, now estimated to be worth around 650 billion dollars. The most recent of these was a claim from a Cleoma Foore, whose research led to the foundation of the 'Pennsylvania Association of Edwards Heirs', a body funded by donations in a bid to finally prove that they were entitled to the vast fortune through direct ancestry. This fund attracted around $1.5m at its peak, but no firm evidence was forthcoming. Indeed, the end result was an embezzlement case tried at the federal court in Pittsburgh before Chief Judge Donald E. Ziegler in 1999. More recently, this ancient claim has been the subject of many multimedia productions including books, TV shows and radio reports and a 1998 primetime UK TV show called 'Find a Fortune' and hosted by Carol Vorderman among others, attempting to shed new light on the topic. A document held at the Glamorgan Record Office in Cardiff, Wales, entitled \\"THE EDWARDS MILLIONS\\" outlines the case as it stood in 2002, with claims and counter claims further muddying the issue.\\"THE EDWARDS MILLIONS\\", Glamorgan Record Office entry, April 2002 Tales of unscrupulous lawyers and fraudulent claims have also hampered attempts by amateur researchers to get to the truth. Finally, the introduction of the 'Statute of Limitations' in NY State, which sets a time limit for all claims, to be commenced within fifteen years of the expiration of a lease, appears to have all but buried the claim with the death of Robert Edwards himself. The only document that could prove the matter would be the original of the 99-year lease signed over to the brothers Cruger, but that would now be statute barred.

It has been the leader in the speed control market for competitive water sports since its conception in 1995. The widespread use of Perfect Pass in the Ski Boat Industry, has resulted in colloquial usage Perfect Pass in reference to similar speed controls products. It is commonly compared to Cruise control systems in cars. Perfect Pass A Perfect Pass system has been used in breaking and setting every water ski World Record.\\"2007Tournament Water Ski Rules, Edited by: Robert K. Corson, Chairman of the IWSF Tournament Council, Retrieved on: November 28, 2006, Version 1.0 Products Perfect Pass supplies three speed control systems. The Wakeboard Pro model is designed to maintain speed for wakeboarding and is their top selling model. The Digital Pro is designed as a speed control for 3-event water skiing and wakeboarding. The Perfect Pass Cruise model is for recreational use. Both the Digital Pro and Wakeboard Pro model have been superseded by the Star Gazer GPS speed control unit. Design Perfect Pass is a closed loop speed control system that maintains speed by using input settings to control many external variables such as crew and rider weight, wind adjustment, and rpm. The output of which controls a servo motor which takes over control of the throttle when engaged. Competitors Perfect Pass had few competitors in the high performance speed control market from 1995 to 2007, Accu-Ski provided a competitive product but did not successfully gain any significant market share and through the late 1990s and early 2000s Perfect Pass became a manufacturer OEM option on tow boats from Malibu, Mastercraft, Correct Craft, and many of the wakeboard boat brands. However in the mid 2000s a competitor arrived in the form of Zero Off which introduced a GPS satellite technology to control speed and boat path information and communicating directly with the engine management computer. Zero Off was designed along with Engine Management company E-Controls Technology which had recently begun providing ECU's tuned for Tow Boat engine management. Perfect Pass also released a drive-by-wire variant of its new Star Gazer GPS cruise control system which could communicate directly with the ECU. Zero Off and Perfect Pass each controlled patents on the technology utilized in their products which resulted in an agreement in May 2008 in which Perfect Pass agreed to not provide units for drive-by-wire boats newer than 2008 model year and that Zero Off in turn would not provide speed control units for boats with mechanically operated throttle units. The effect of this agreement is Perfect Pass lost its ability to be provided as an OEM option which is now controlled by Zero Off. Another brand Ride Steady by Hydrophase has also entered into the market. Options Due to the design as a speed control for Competitive Watersports Perfect Pass has introduced options to make its Star Gazer product more competitive with Zero Off for owners of older Mechanically Throttled boats, these include the Z-Box which has accelerometers and helps the Star Gazer to emulate the pull of the Zero Off Product as well as GPS upgrades for older units which lacked GPS input. Perfect pass continues to provide customer service and update the Star Gazer product as well as provide options for owners of boats with out E-Controls Engine Management systems.

Dr. Kevin T. Kelly (born 27 June 1933) was a British Roman Catholic priest and moral theologian. Kelly was born in Crosby, just north of Liverpool, England on 27 June 1933, to Patrick and Winifred Kelly from Northern Ireland. Kelly has been a pioneering priest and theologian, nurturing a compassionate approach to Catholic morality from the 1960s down to the present day. In his academic and pastoral work, he has tackled some of the most pressing issues facing the Church today - human conscience, HIV-AIDS, divorce and second marriage, bioethics, sexual ethics and pastoral theology in general. After formative years at the Upholland Senior Seminary, Lancashire, where he would later return to work, Kelly was further educated at Fribourg University, Switzerland and at the Gregorianum University, Rome. At Fribourg he completed a doctorate in moral theology and in Rome he gained a licentiate in Canon Law. The author of seven books and well over a hundred articles and chapters elsewhere, he has worked tirelessly in urban parishes and academic settings alike, from the very outset of his priestly calling. He began his academic career at St Joseph's Seminary, Upholland, England (1965-75), during which time he also served as a visiting lecturer at the University of Manchester, looking after the students of Ronald Preston, and further honing his ecumenical vision and commitment. Kevin embarked upon that tireless combination of being both an academic moral theologian at one and the same time as being a pastor at the ‚Äòcoal face‚Äô, when he was appointed to serve as assistant priest at St Clare's Parish in Liverpool from 1963 to 1965. In 1975 Kelly became the founding director of the Upholland Institute, a centre and professional team for adult Christian education and in-service training for clergy. In this role he initiated pioneering educational and formational programs. Kelly would bring in visiting lecturers such as Bernard H√§ring and Charles E. Curran. Here Kelly worked tirelessly to involve the laity, women as well as men, in the Institute's many courses and activities. Thus putting into action the ecclesial vision of Vatican II. In 1980 Kelly was a visiting fellow at St Edmund's College, University of Cambridge where pressing pastoral and ethical questions concerning divorce and second marriage preoccupied much of his research. During this time he also embarked on a tour of countries where major ethical challenges were being responded to through grass roots activism and the newly emerged liberation theology. His travels took him to India, the Philippines and Peru. Kevin then played a leading role in the experimental \\"Team Ministry\\" that was in the new town of Skelmersdale, serving from 1981 to 1985. The \\"Thatcher Years\\" of government were pressing times for the northern regions of England in particular. The early optimism that followed the founding of this new town soon turned to harsher realities for many in this part of the country. This innovative, dynamic and yet most challenging appointment left Kelly with many ideas he wished to explore in those hours of the week he gave over to his continuing academic studies. These questions pursued him so much that he eventually took leave to take up a Research Fellowship at Queen's College, Birmingham, where he completed his pioneering book on bioethics (1985-86). Kelly did not put his pastoral ministry on hold for very long, and he was back in parish ministry at Our Lady‚Äôs, Eldon St., in inner-city Liverpool as soon as 1986, continuing there until 1998. This full- time ministry was actually carried out in only half of Kelly‚Äôs \\"real\\" time as he soon began a regular commute to London, where he had been asked by Jack Mahoney to teach at Heythrop College, the specialist theology and philosophy college of the University of London. Kelly soon found himself covering much of the moral theology at Heythrop and utilising his train journeys to great effect as a makeshift study. Kevin continued this bi-locatory dual-existence from 1986 until 1993. Kelly‚Äôs most recent educational attachments came at Liverpool Hope University, first of all as a part-time lecturer in Christian Ethics at its former incarnation as the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education between 1993 and 94. He then returned when it became a university college to be Senior Research Fellow (again part-time) between 1996 and 98. Finally, he was elevated to Emeritus Senior Research Fellow status in 1998. Kelly has contributed to research initiatives, conferences and international gatherings on almost every continent of the world. His researches and pastoral antennae have also taken him on numerous further visits to places such as the United States, Canada, Ireland and Continental Europe. In 1967, he was a co- founding member of the Association of Teachers of Moral Theology. In 1995, Kevin visited Thailand and the Philippines, taking part in an Asian theological consultation on the challenges of HIV/AIDS, and interviewing many people in connection with research for his forthcoming book on the subject, particularly to inform his reflections on the impact of these conditions upon women and upon how the position of women in society exacerbated the dilemmas posed by HIV/AIDS. In 1997, Kelly was also a co-founding member of the International Catholic Theological Coalition for HIV/AIDS Prevention, and, in 1999, he spent the summer in Zimbabwe and Zambia, helping to run two National Winter schools in the former which sought to educate people on the moral and pastoral issues concerning the care of those whose lives are affected by HIV/AIDS. Whilst there he sought out further experiential research opportunities through visiting partners of the UK Catholic aid agency (CAFOD) responsible for the care of AIDS orphans and also for AIDS home-care initiatives. His pastoral achievements, however, were yet to take a further turn after his inner-city work and weekly sessions in the \\"library on wheels\\" that the train to and from London became for him. Kelly‚Äôs doctoral dissertation explored the work of Anglican moral theologians of the 17th century, and his ecumenical sensitivity and commitment, as indicated, have been amongst the most constant features of his life and career. Kelly took up the post as Catholic Pastor of the Ecumenical Anglican and Roman Catholic church of St Basil‚Äôs and All Saints , at Hough Green near Widnes. Liverpool Hope University announced that they will be awarding Kevin Kelly an honorary Doctorate at its graduation ceremony in 2007 and The Centre for the Study of Contemporary Ecclesiology has honoured Kevin Kelly by awarding him its very first Honorary Fellowship for his services to the church, to pastoral care, to moral theology, to ecumenism and to the wider community in general.

TrackIR tracks head motions with up to six degrees of freedom (6DOF) in later models, allowing handsfree view control for improved game immersiveness and situational awareness. Head position and orientation are measured by a purpose-built video camera, mounted on top of the user's monitor, which observes invisible infrared (IR) light (hence the name) reflected or emitted by markers on a rigid model worn by the user. TrackIR software is used to access and control the camera, as well as adjust tracking and manage game profiles. The ratio of actual head movement to virtual head movement can be changed, allowing the virtual head to turn 180 degrees whilst the user still looks at the monitor. NaturalPoint have maintained the possibility of TrackIR eventually entering the video game console market. History The original TrackIR product was an affordable assistive technology device used for Windows cursor control. An early customer provided feedback to NaturalPoint that the product could be used in some flight simulators. This prompted NaturalPoint to re-brand the original device as SmartNav and launch a new TrackIR with improved gaming features to specifically target the flight simulation market. TrackIR was embraced by PC flight simulation enthusiasts who saw it as a better alternative to a joystick hat switch for view control. The technology used in SmartNav and TrackIR was later extended to another brand called OptiTrack, creating a more affordable professional motion capture solution. Between 2002 and 2005, five different TrackIR camera models were released with steadily improving specifications. Frame rate doubled and resolution increased substantially, resulting in more responsive and accurate tracking. In 2003 the NaturalPoint President (also the principle hardware engineer) described these improvements to the original TrackIR as, \\"not critical for flight and driving sims, but very important to other types of games like first person shooters.\\" The TrackIR 3 was split into a cheaper standard model and a more expensive PRO model but the cheaper model was abandoned for the next version, TrackIR 4:PRO. The TrackIR 4:PRO departs from the previous models' clamshell case with a new slim compact design, not much bigger than the diameter of a golf ball. It has a wider field of view than its predecessors and a new base so it can be attached to flat panel displays. The TrackIR 5 was introduced in early 2009 with a similar design as the TrackIR 4:PRO. It features a wider field of view and higher resolution tracking sensor than previous models. TrackIR interface with games The proprietary TrackIR interface has become the de facto standard for view control in PC games and simulations and is only intended for use with TrackIR products. As NaturalPoint convinced more developers and games to support it, other devices inspired by the TrackIR have sought to access the same view control and been successful in reverse engineering the interface. This has allowed non-TrackIR devices to be used for view control, including common video devices like webcams. Early on NaturalPoint updated the interface to require validation using text strings copyrighted by NaturalPoint, and only granted permission for use of the strings to game and simulation developers. This meant other applications wishing to use the interface without approval from NaturalPoint would have to risk potentially violating NaturalPoint's copyright. Proponents of third party head tracking devices which rely on the TrackIR interface for support in many titles believe the text strings are exempt and fall under fair use for the purposes of interoperability. In October 2008 NaturalPoint changed the TrackIR interface and began encrypting the data stream sent to some new titles. Third party devices which had reverse-engineered the previous TrackIR interface were rendered incompatible with these new game titles due to the encryption. The older TrackIR-1 and TrackIR-2 products that use software drivers which are no longer maintained are also incompatible with titles using the new encrypted interface. As of 20140610, the protocol version 5 has again been reverse-engineered, providing support for possibly all titles using the NPClient protocol. Supported games As of 2009 there are around 100 TrackIR Enhanced games that can natively use TrackIR cameras for view control with up to six degrees of freedom. Criticisms=TrackIR 4 Pro= Some reviewers found the TrackIR 4 Pro with TrackClip Pro bundle to be expensive at the $200‚Äì$220 price, while still considering it a worthwhile purchase for serious simulation users. As of June, 2009 the bundle is available for $120. Additionally, one review noted that the TrackIR 4 Pro runs at a temperature which they consider higher than normal when it is actively tracking. =TrackClip PRO= Some reviewers found the TrackClip PRO to have loose joints, be less durable than desired, and one was disappointed that it was unable to be positioned on the right side of the head, while still recommending the product.

The battle took the form of a surprise Chadian raid against the Libyan Maaten al-Sarra Air Base, meant to remove the threat of Libyan airpower, that had already thwarted the Chadian attack on the Aouzou Strip in August. The first clash ever held in Libyan territory since the beginning of the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, the attack was fully successful, causing a high number of Libyan casualties and low Chadian casualties, also contributing to the definitive ceasefire signed on September 11 among the warring countries. Background In 1983, Libyan troops invaded Chad in support of the rebel Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) fighting against the Chadian government led by Hiss√®ne Habr√©. French military interventions had limited the Libyan-GUNT advance to the 16th parallel (the so-called Red Line), freezing the situation on the ground until 1986, when the bulk of the GUNT forces turned against their Libyan patrons. Habr√© seized upon the opportunity to turn the tide against his enemy, and ordered his troops in December to attack Libyan positions in northern Chad.K. Pollack, 382‚Äì390 Starting in January 1987 with Fada and continuing with B'ir Kora and Ouadi Doum, the Chadian National Armed Forces' (FANT) commander-in-chief Hassan Djamous reported a series of key victories that forced Libyan forces to fall back on the Aouzou Strip.K. Pollack, 390-394 Ignoring French pleas for restraint, Habr√© assumed a militant attitude towards the Libyan occupation of the Aouzou Strip; his troops successfully took Aouzou on August 8, but were repulsed on August 28, partly due to French refusal to provide air cover for Habr√©'s attempt to regain Aouzou.S. Popper, The Economic Cost of Soviet Military Manpower Requirements, 147S. Nolutshungu, Limits of Anarchy, 222 Attack Before the final Libyan assault, Habr√© had withdrawn Hassan Djamous and most of his veteran troops, planning to let them rest for a new offensive that would finally secure the Strip. Habr√©, judging by the decisive role played by close-range Libyan air strikes in the setback at Aouzou, concluded that Libya's greatest advantage was its ability to conduct endless air strikes. To remove this threat, Habr√© ordered Djamous to take 2,000 troops and destroy the main Libyan airbase in southern Libya, Maaten al-Sarra, 60 miles north of the Chadian-Libyan border.D. Vanderwalle, A History of Modern Libya, 148 Habr√© may also have been encouraged in this raid by French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand's public declaration on September 3 that the Red Line was obsolete and thus French troops in Chad would no longer be bound by it.S. Nolutshungu, 224‚Äì225 Chad made military preparations for what seemed to be an attempt to retake Aouzou. Instead, encouraged by the United States, which supplied satellite intelligence, the FANT attacked Maaten al-Sarra on September 5, taking the Libyans by surprise, and apparently the French as well, who reacted by refusing to provide intelligence or logistic support. Djamous's troops were careful to follow the wadis, thus not exposing themselves, and they also took advantage of careless Libyan patrolling and security, intending to take the airbase's garrison and its defenders by surprise. To confuse the Libyans, the FANT forces first proceeded north and northwest in Libyan territory, then turned east and descended upon Maaten al- Sarra; as a result, the Libyan officers took them for reinforcements and attempted to join them. Notwithstanding the defenders' 2,500-strong garrison, tank brigade, artillery, and extensive fortifications, the Chadian troops rapidly overcame the Libyan forces and assumed control of the base, starkly revealing the unpreparedness of the Libyan military. While the FANT's losses were minor, Libya suffered staggering casualties, with 1,713 Libyans killed, 300 taken prisoner and hundreds of others forced to flee into the surrounding desert. The Chadians then proceeded to demolish all the equipment they could not carry back, including 70 tanks, 30 APCs, 8 radar stations, a radar scrambling device, numerous SAMs, and 26 aircraft‚Äîincluding 3 MiG-23s, 1 Mi-24, and 4 Mirage F.1; they also tore up the base's two runways. Then, traveling without lights beneath the moon and stars, the FANT column withdrew to Chadian soil on September 6, and the Chadian government declared that the battle \\"must be written in gold letters in the great book of victories.\\" Aftermath Gaddafi's first reaction was to place the blame for the defeat on the French, challenging their position in Chad. A couple of days after Djamous' raid on Maaten two Tu-22 were dispatched, one to attack N'Djamena, the Chadian capital, and other to Ab√©ch√©; the air raid was unsuccessful, as the Tupolev attacking the capital was shot down by a French Army Hawk SAM battery, while the second plane was forced to return to Libya without dropping its bombs. Libya's reaction to the downing was to publicly accuse the Maaten raid of being a \\"combined Franco-American military action\\", and added that France and the United States were \\"behind the aggression against Libya.\\" While the United States did not conceal its satisfaction for the Libyan defeat, a US official adding that \\"We basically jump for joy every time the Chadians ding the Libyans\\", France reacted differently, with the Defence Minister Andr√© Giraud expressing \\"deepest regrets\\" over the escalation. The French appeared to have judged the battle of Maaten al-Sarra even too successful for Habr√©, giving way to concerns that the battle was only the first stage of a general invasion of Libya, a thing that France wanted to avoid at all costs; therefore, on September 11, Mitterrand pressed Habr√© in agreeing to a ceasefire with Gaddafi, the Libyan leader accepting due to internal demoralization and foreign hostility. While the ceasefire was subject to many minor violations, it substantially held, thus putting an end to the Chadian- Libyan conflict.S. Nolutshungu, 222‚Äì223 However, the defeat also fostered in Gaddafi a simmering animosity against France and the United States, which led to Libyan support for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York over Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988 and UTA Flight 772 from Chad to Paris over Niger on September 19, 1989. Further tensions between Gaddafi and France eventually led to France and its NATO allies intervening in the 2011 Libyan Civil War with the 2011 military intervention in Libya, which ended in Gaddafi's death and the total defeat of his regime.

Unlike other fully fashioned knitting, where the shaped pieces must still be sewn together, finished complete knitted garments do not have seams. The knitting machines' computerized instructions direct movement of hundreds of needles to construct and connect several tubular knitted forms to create a complete garment in a single production step. The complete garment system's advantages lie in 1) a further reduction in materials beyond even fully fashioned production by eliminating seam allowances and 2) faster time to market by eliminating the need for sewing any components. These factors increases cost-effectiveness (especially important when using high-performance materials such as aramids for composites). One might also argue that cutting down on wasted by-product selvage makes complete garment better for the environment. Two companies manufacture complete garment knitting machines: Shima Seiki and Stoll. Examples of structures that are most often made with the complete garment technique are clothing (sportswear to sweaters) or technical textiles (car seat covers which also incorporate additional structural elements such as metal and plastic fasteners, composite preforms). The machines can produce a variety of topologies that were more difficult or impossible to create with knitting machines before, including: connected tubes, circles, open cuboids, and even spheres (for helmet shells and other preforms). Complete garment knitting requires two needle beds for three- dimensional structures (such as clothing). As is the case with all fully fashioned knitting, machines require individual single needle selection (through electronic control) and presser feet (to hold down formed loops). Note: Aspects of complete garment knitting such as changing the fabric width or diameter and connecting two sides of the structure together are also possible with a single needle bed for two-dimensional or 'flat' structures‚Äîand are achieved by: # Changing knit structure (e.g. rib to interlock) # Varying the structural elements (stitch length, weft insertion, knit, tuck, float) # Shaping through loop transfer # Wale fashioning by 'needle parking' # Segmented takedown for varying rates of takedown across the width of the fabric Category:Knitting ","title":"Complete garment knitting"},{"id":"10358723","text":"The Vagabond King is a 1930 American Pre-Code musical operetta film photographed entirely in two-color Technicolor. The plot of the film was based on the 1925 operetta of the same name, which was based on the 1901 play If I Were King by Justin Huntly McCarthy. The play told the story of a renegade French poet named Fran√ßois Villon. The music of the film was based on a 1925 operetta, also based on the play If I Were King by McCarthy. The operetta is also titled The Vagabond King with music by Rudolph Friml and lyrics by Brian Hooker and W.H. Post. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction. Plot The story takes place in France in the Middle Ages. King Louis XI of France (O. P. Heggie) (reigned 1461-1483), hoping to enlist the French peasants in his upcoming battle against the Burgundians, appoints Fran√ßois Villon (Dennis King) king of France for one day.

Paramount attempted to change the film's title to If I Were King and also had some new songs composed for the film. When Friml was made aware of the new songs, he sued the studio. As a result, Paramount changed the title back to The Vagabond King and paid Friml $50,000 to allow for the use of non-original songs. Preservation For many years, the film was seen only in black-and-white prints made for television release in the 1950s. At one time even the black-and-white prints were considered irretrievably lost.

It was first mass-produced in 1916 and was installed in a variety of aircraft. It was the only German autocannon to see service in the air during the war. The Becker also served as the pattern for the famous Swiss-built Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, which is in service to this day, and in a later form, was the original inspiration, through the Swiss design after World War I, for the World War II German Luftwaffe's MG FF (Maschinengewehr Fl√ºgel Fest, \\"fixed wing-mount automatic ordnance\\") 20 mm autocannon design. History=Design and development= The original design was based on the 19mm Becker Cannon cartridge by the Conder brothers at Stahlwerke Becker of Reinickendorf, Germany. Development commenced in 1913 and was therefore already advanced when the War Ministry issued a specification in June 1915 calling for an aircraft cannon of under 37 mm caliber and 70 kg weight capable of firing a 10-round burst. Tests commenced shortly thereafter with the weapon mounted in a Gotha G.I, but proved unsatisfactory. Despite this, the potential of the gun was such that Spandau arsenal was engaged to help develop and fine-tune the design, leading to a production contract for 120 Becker Type M2 guns in June 1916. In addition to the orders for aircraft guns placed with Becker, Spandau and MAN also received a contract to build Becker cannon for the Army. The Spandau works developed the gun further producing it as the Spandau Type 3 20mm cannon, which was heavier and had a slower rate of fire at 250 rpm. Oskar Ursinus operating a 20mm Becker cannon in the front cockpit of a Gotha G.I =Operational use= The main types to utilise the Type M2 were large, twin- engined aircraft, initially of IdFlieg's \\"G\\"-class Grossflugzeug category: the Friedrichshafen G.III bomber and AEG G.IVk ground-attack machine. Tests in smaller, single-engined aircraft were not so successful, but were carried out extensively through the rest of the war, commencing with an Albatros J.I in December 1917. Due to the gun's operating principles, it could not be synchronised, and this posed an immediate problem for its installation in this type of aircraft. The solution adopted after the tests with the Albatros J.I was to mount the gun at an angle to fire downwards. Fitting the gun to a fighter with a pusher configuration was another obvious solution, and trials were carried out with an Albatros D.VI. Other intended installations were for an AGO S.I and the Hansa (Caspar) D.I, but these were not carried out before the Armistice. Some rigid airships of the Imperial German Navy, such as the most modern Zeppelin L 70 (LZ 112), were armed with the Becker cannon. Total production figures are not known, but were in excess of 539 (111 by Becker and 428 by MAN); a total of 362 were surrendered to the Allies. =Postwar use and patterns= The patent for the gun was bought by SEMAG (Seebach Maschinenbau Aktiengesellschaft) in 1921, who continued development with a more powerful cartridge as the SEMAG L. After the collapse of SEMAG Oerlikon took over the SEMAG assets in 1924, marketing improved versions as the Oerlikon F, Oerlikon L and Oerlikon S. Bolivia bought eight 20mm Semag rifles. During the Chaco War, seven were captured by the Paraguayans. Description The Type M2 was a slim weapon working on the principle of advanced primer ignition blowback. It weighed only 30 kg. It was fed by a somewhat awkward, curved box magazine, available in versions that held 10 or 15 rounds; the latter weighed another 5 kg. As the rate of fire was 325 rounds per minute, this magazine could be emptied very quickly. The muzzle velocity was 490 m/s, which was low compared to the rifle-calibre machine guns of the period such as the German MG 08, but a respectable performance compared to other automatic cannon of the period, such as the Vickers QF 1 pounder pom-pom.

He earned a world reputation for his series of in-depth studies of the interrelationship between sea power and the development of the British empire. In 1929, Graham married Winifred Emily Ware (1907‚Äì1990), with whom he had a son. They divorced in 1950 and he married Constance Mary Greey, with whom he had two daughters and a son.

Graham Academic, military, and naval career On his return from Germany in 1930, Graham was appointed instructor and tutor in history at Harvard University, where he remained until 1936, when he received an appointment as assistant professor of history at Queen's University. There, he was quickly promoted to associate professor, and then full professor. For 1940‚Äì41, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship that resulted in Graham's first major book that showed his shift of research interests to British naval history: Sea Power and British North America, 1783- 1820. Toward the end of 1941, he joined the Canadian Army, but quickly shifted to the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve and was appointed an instructor lieutenant commander to teach entering officers at Royal Roads Military College. While teaching there, Graham was able to get first-hand experience of the war at sea, by spending time during academic breaks on board Canadian destroyers in the Atlantic and in torpedo boats at Dover. Following the allied landings in northern France in 1944, Graham was returned to the Canadian Army as a major, and served with the historical section of the Canadian Army Overseas in London. Graham's military assignment to London was the event that led him to stay in Britain for the remainder of his career. After demobilisation, he was appointed lecturer in history at Birkbeck College, London, and in 1949 was elected to succeed Professor Vincent Harlow as Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London. Gerald Graham served as Rhodes Professor for 29-years until his retirement at the age of 67 in 1970, when he was appointed professor emeritus. While in that academic post, Graham specialised in teaching the history of the British Empire in the period 1880‚Äì1932 and in British colonial history. He travelled and lectured widely through the Commonwealth. In addition to his teaching, he worked closely with the Royal Commonwealth Society, to which he had initially been elected in 1928, later becoming a Life Fellow and Vice-President. He was a member of its Library Committee from 1948 to 1955, its Imperial Studies Committee in 1952‚Äì57, and chairman of its Academic Committee, which awarded the Walter Frewen Lord Prize for the best postgraduate essay in imperial history. In addition, revived the Society's monograph series, Imperial Studies, and he edited volumes XXII (1961) through XXIX (1970) of the series. Similarly in working with the Oxford University Press, Graham served as general editor of its West African History series, most of which became the standard works on this field. In 1963‚Äì64, Queen's University, Belfast honoured Graham by inviting him to deliver the Wiles Lectures, which were published the next year by Cambridge University Press as The Politics of Naval Supremacy. In 1967, Graham delivered the Reid Lectures at Acadia University, which were published as Tides of Empire: Discursions on the Expansion of Britain Overseas. Immediately after Graham's retirement in London, he returned to Canada for two years as to serve as visiting professor of military and strategic studies at the University of Western Ontario in 1970‚Äì1972. After this appointment, Graham returned to his permanent home in England at St Leonards-on-Sea, where he died at the age of 85 in 1988. Published works A complete bibliography of Graham's historical writings for the years 1930 to 1972 was compiled by George Metcalf and published in Graham's festschrift: Flint and Williams, eds., Perspectives of Empire (1973).

Marcello Mastroianni gives a sensitive, finely judged performance as Enrico, a struggling journalist in the Rome of 1945. He receives a phone call informing him that his younger brother Lorenzo (Jacques Perrin) has died. Enrico recalls their long and difficult relationship; he was brought up by their poor, but warm-hearted grandmother (Sylvie), Lorenzo was raised as a gentleman by a wealthy local aristocrat. Reunited in the Florence of the 1930s, Enrico becomes his spoiled brother's keeper, forever haunted by a sense of guilty and responsibility towards a man he both hates and loves. Beautifully photographed by Giuseppe Rotunno, this austere, deeply felt masterwork has been acclaimed as one of Zurlini's greatest achievements.

It can be simply called power gain. In a broadside array, the array gain is almost exactly proportional to the length of the array. This is the case provided that the elements of the antenna are not spaced to a point at which large radiation side lobes form in other directions and that the array length exceeds one or two wavelengths. The power gain of a broadside array is nearly independent of the number of broadside elements as long as both of these conditions are met. The two main types of array gain when combining signals are average power of combined signals relative to the individual average power and the diversity gain related to the probability level of outage. The diversity gain is dependent on spatial correlation coefficients between antenna signals.Andersen, J.B.; , \\"Array gain and capacity for known random channels with multiple element arrays at both ends,\\" Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on , vol.18, no.11, pp.2172-2178, Nov 2000 Applications In radio astronomy because of background noise from modern communications it is difficult to achieve a good signal to noise ratio. Even for strong astronomical radio emission it is typical for SNR levels to be below 0 decibel. To counter this problem exposure of the antenna to the source over large periods of time are needed just as in visible sky viewing. Array gain is done by using multiple, even dozens of radio receivers to collect as much signal as possible. Robots equipped with antenna arrays have better communication using array gain to eradicate dead spots and reduce interferences.Hambling, David. \\"Robots fall into line with the help of sparse array antenna.\\" New Scientist 207 (2010): 22.

The bravery and discipline shown by British troops which included a detachment of the 43rd under the command of Lieutenant Girardot during the ship-wreck received much publicity in England and abroad. King Frederick of Prussia ordered that the story of the bravery shown during the sinking of the troopship be read out to each regiment of his army as an example of devotion to duty.Newbolt, p. 156 =Indian Mutiny= The 43rd moved from South Africa to India arriving at Madras in January 1854.Levinge, p. 272 The regiment assisted in putting down the Indian Mutiny from 1857 to 1859.

The regiment returned to England in February 1866.Levinge, p. 292 =Later history= For the next fifteen years the regiment was mainly stationed abroad with only brief periods spent in the UK. The major operation it was engaged in during this time was in the suppression of the rebellion by the Moplahs in Southern India in 1873.Newbolt, p. 165‚Äì168Booth, p. 80‚Äì81 As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 43rd was linked with the 53rd (Shropshire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 21 at Copthorne Barracks in Shrewsbury. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) to form the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry (which became the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry in 1908).

Miami Edison is an inner-city school. , it is known for historically having the largest Haitian-American student population of any Miami-Dade public school.Winerip, Michael. \\"New Influx of Haitians, but Not Who Was Expected\\" (Archive).

History Miami Edison Senior High School had its humble beginnings in a small palmetto-thatched hut inhabited by spiders, beetles, 10 pupils, and one teacher. After this tropical edifice burned to the ground in 1895, the activities were moved twice, finally being established in a rickety, four-room structure in 1897. During the brief tenure of Principal Ernest Roller, only the common subjects and agriculture were taught. At this time, the forerunner of the Parent Teacher Association, the \\"Mother's and Teacher's League\\" was formed; its aim was to further the general welfare of the student body. This organization became the oldest PTA of service in Dade County when the name was changed in 1918. In 1915 after the destruction of the old building by a violent windstorm, the long-cherished dream of Dr. J. G. DuPuis, A. N. Fallensen, and E. N. Webb, trustees, was realized as Dade County Agricultural High School came into existence. Mainly through their efforts, a land grant was secured and the new building was erected. Professor A. C. Alleshouse became principal in 1917, and was succeeded in 1920 by W. O. Lockhart. Being accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools made it necessary to secure a principal with a degree; J. N McArthur became principal until his transfer in 1923, when Jesse G. Fisher accepted the position. Even in these years of instability, the school continued to grow, as two wings were added in 1922 and five years later the first cafeteria was installed. Many school organizations came into being at this time to keep pace with the extension of the building. This rapid growth continued as the impetus given to athletics by the employment of the first regular coach brought the clamor for a gymnasium. The school board proceeded to erect the addition, but due to lack of an architect, the bleachers soon became the victim of the hurricane of 1936. The repaired building remained until the present middle school was constructed on the site. In 1928, the present building was completed and into it moved 892 students and a faculty of 32, marking the beginning of the junior and senior high system. New additions included the Home Economics building, and the only boat-building class in the United States. In the following years, the school auditorium, the shops and the field house were added. In 1931 came a strong demand to change the school's name. Under the influence of Principal Fisher and Henry Filer, then chairman of the school board, suggested names were submitted to the student body. The recent death of America's great inventor, Thomas A. Edison, proved to be the deciding factor. Thus, in October 1931, Dade County Agricultural High became Miami Edison Senior High in his honor. Soon after, this new name was immortalized as Frances Deen set to music the words of Marjorie Weatherup's \\"Alma Mater\\". In 1949, at the death of Julian Daniel, his great character, service, and leadership were honored by the establishment of the Julian Daniel Award and by the presentation of Key Club's annual scholarship. Robert A. Wilson became principal upon Fisher's retirement in 1950, and under his leadership, the extracurricular program was expanded. Interested not only in academics, Miami Edison has for years also earned the reputation of being recognized a leader in all fields of athletics. The Red Raiders have shown their superiority in football, for they often dominated the strongest league in Florida, the Big Ten Conference. The varsity is proud of the fact that the Orange Bowl Stadium was dedicated by an Edison team playing Coral Gables in 1938, and has since remained the home of the Red Raiders. The pride and spirit of the students in all endeavors were shown when a strong Student Council and Inter-Club Council were organized in the 1930s. Through their efforts, the Honor Code, regarded as the basis of the \\"Edison spirit\\", was adopted in 1939. The Miami Edison \\"Red Raiders\\" symbol was originally a human skull with crossbones below it. The Coat of Arms was installed in the patio in 1958 and the \\"Little Red Devil\\" replaced the skull and crossbones as the symbol of their spirit. In 1955, William B. Duncan became principal and has been able, through the efforts of an outstanding faculty, the support of community resources, and the motivation of the students, to set in motion those changes emphasized in the nation for a rededication to quality education for every student according to his ability. During his administration, the \\"Operation Amigo\\" program found its beginning in the United States in the halls of Miami Edison in January 1962. The chance to take in Peruvian students in cooperation with the Miami Herald was a complete success. For the prominent part Edison played in this now nationwide program in hemispheric understanding, Duncan became the first North American to be awarded the \\"Alfonso Ugarte\\" medal for intercultural friendship. Thus, from humble beginnings in 1885 to the advent of a prominent high school in 1915, Edison has expanded from a tiny thatched hut to a present extensive structure; from a faculty of one to over 100; from a student body of 10 to over 2200; and from a school of agriculture to one with diversified courses. The prevailing school spirit, standards of integrity, and ideals of scholarship and sportsmanship have reigned supreme throughout the years. These ideals of Miami Edison have helped to mold many outstanding personalities, but no man lives without leaving his mark in some way, and Miami Edison is rich in all these - her sons, daughters, and those who cherish her name.Adapted from the 1964 Miami Edison Beacon [written by Ed Shumard, class of 1943) article graciously contributed by the Miami Edison Over the Hill Gang. After 1964 Miami Edison Senior High has seen many changes in recent years. Reflecting the population shifts of the region, Edison went from having a predominantly white student body in the early 1960s to an almost completely African-American one by the time the senior high moved to its present building in 1979. The 1980s had a further shift in population, with the influx of Haitians making the present student body predominantly Haitian- American. No more principals have been like Jesse Fisher, who stayed at Edison almost 30 years (1923‚Äì1950), or William Duncan, who lasted almost 20 (1955‚Äì1973). Most Edison principals now stay for 3‚Äì5 years (as is the case district-wide). Following Duncan, the school had these principals: Judith Greene (1973‚Äì1977), Piedad Bucholtz (1977‚Äì1979), Frank deVarona (1979‚Äì1983), Craig Sturgeon (1983‚Äì1992), Willa Young (1992‚Äì1995), Gloria Evans (1995‚Äì1998), and the current principal, Santiago C. Corrada. The Haitian students coming to Miami-Dade County during the 1980s and 1990s were mostly low-income, and high school-aged students generally attended Miami Edison High School. Because of overcrowding, two new wings (S and T) and a legion of portables have been added over the years. The mascot has changed again. The Little Devil is out, making way for the Pirate, for which students and staff voted during the 1997-98 school year. Edison students are still great achievers in sports. The girls' basketball team won the state championship in 1995 and 2001. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake occurred, the MDCPS expected a large influx of students to Miami Edison. Ultimately, only six earthquake survivors enrolled there, with other students enrolling at other high schools.

This game was invented by Lord Dunsany in 1942. A similar game is called Horde Chess. Rules Black's setup is the same in regular chess; White's army consists of 32 pawns, filling ranks one through four, as shown in the diagram. Rules are the same as in regular chess, with the following exceptions: * Black moves first. * Only Black's pawns have the two-step option on their first move. * Black wins by capturing all 32 white pawns, while White wins by checkmating Black. Other rules are the same as in regular chess. For example, pawns promote on the final rank, and stalemate occurs if White's pawns run out of moves. Horde chess Horde chess is identical to Dunsany's chess, with the following differences: * Black's pieces are 32 pawns, occupying ranks five through eight, but with pawns on d4 and e4 instead of d8 and e8. * White's pieces are identical to regular chess. * As in regular chess, White moves first. * Black's pawns on rank seven have the two-step option of regular chess. =Horde variant= A Horde variant uses the opening setup shown in the diagram. In this variant, White's pawns on the first and second ranks may advance one or two steps, provided that the path in the file is free. Unlike in regular chess, this does not have to be the pawn's first move. The Lichess website has support for this variant.

Also known as Eamon de Longphort, he was a member of the fifth Seanad √âireann, the upper house of the Irish Parliament, in the 1940s. Family and education Edward Longford was the elder son of Thomas Pakenham, 5th Earl of Longford, and Mary, Countess of Longford, n√©e Child-Villiers. He was the only one of the Pakenham children on whom his mother doted, apparently because he would succeed to the earldom on his father's death and because he was always in delicate health. As a pupil at Eton College (where he twice received the Wilder Divinity Prize) he succeeded to the earldom when his father was killed in action at the Battle of Gallipoli on 21 August 1915. He became an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford, and met his future wife, Christine Patti Trew, an Oxford \\"undergraduette\\". They were married on 18 July 1925. He died without issue and was succeeded by his younger brother Frank. Politics and religion He was an Irish Nationalist since his days at Eton, taking inspiration from the Easter Rising in 1916 and the Russian Revolution of 1917. He learned Irish and adopted the name Eamon de Longphort. His political views made him unpopular at both Eton and Christ Church, where he was famously put in \\"Mercury\\", the pond containing a statue of Mercury in Tom Quad. He was an Anglo-Catholic who never left the Church of Ireland. On 13 November 1946 he was nominated by the Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera as a member of 5th Seanad √âireann, filling a vacancy caused by the death of Professor William Magennis. He was not re- appointed to the 6th Seanad. Theatrical and literary activities Lord Longford became Chairman of the Gate Theatre in Dublin in 1930 and continued to work for the theatre until 1936, when he founded the Longford Players. His plays include Ascendancy, The Melians, The Vineyard, and Yahoo (about Jonathan Swift). An excellent linguist and Classical scholar, he translated Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, Le Malade Imaginaire, L'√©cole des femmes, Tartuffe, and Le Barbier de S√©ville (from French) and Agamemnon and Oedipus Rex (or Oedipus Tyrannus) (from Greek) and adapted the novella Carmilla for the stage. He often collaborated with his wife, Christine, with whom he was also responsible for redecorating Pakenham Hall, now Tullynally Castle, in Chinese style. Pakenham Hall was often the scene of gatherings of Oxford-educated intellectuals such as John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh, and Maurice Bowra. Lord Longford also had several volumes of poetry published, some at the expense of his mother when he was still at Eton, but he is not considered to have been a very good poet. Lord Longford is buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin. Publications *Aeschylus, The Oresteia of Aischylos, trans. Edward Longford and Christine Longford (Dublin: Hodges, Figgis; Oxford: B. H.

The route travels north-south from an interchange with PA 309 located in the Cedarbrook neighborhood of Cheltenham Township in Montgomery County north to another interchange with PA 309 located northeast of Telford in Bucks County. PA 152 is known as Limekiln Pike for most of its length. From the southern terminus, the route passes through suburban areas to the north of Philadelphia, serving Dresher, Maple Glen, and Chalfont. North of Chalfont, PA 152 runs through rural suburbs of Philadelphia before reaching Silverdale. Past here, the road continues northwest through Perkasie, where it turns southwest and passes through Sellersville before reaching its northern terminus. What is now PA 152 was originally Limekiln Road, a road built to transport lime from area kilns. The road was a turnpike between the 1850s and 1917. The route was first designated in 1928 to run from U.S. Route 611 (US 611) in North Philadelphia to PA 113 in Silverdale. PA 152 was extended north to US 309 in Sellersville in 1946, replacing the former routing of PA 413 between Perkasie and Sellersville. By 1960, the southern terminus of the route was cut back to its current location. PA 152 was extended west to end at PA 309 near Telford by 1970.  Route description = Montgomery County = PA 152 northbound past PA 73 in Glenside PA 152 begins at an interchange with the Fort Washington Expressway (PA 309) in the community of Cedarbrook, located in Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County about north of the Philadelphia city line. From this interchange, the route proceeds northeast on four-lane divided Easton Road, passing to the east of Arcadia University and to the northwest of Cheltenham High School. PA 152 turns north onto Limekiln Pike and intersects PA 73 (Church Road), crossing the Tacony Creek and running through residential and business areas in Glenside as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane before losing the turn lane as it passes through the community of Edge Hill. The route curves northeast and comes to a bridge over SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line, where it enters Abington Township. Immediately after the bridge, PA 152 turns northwest at an intersection with Mt. Carmel Avenue and Edge Hill Road to remain along Limekiln Pike, making a curve back to the north a short distance later at a junction where Mt. Carmel Avenue heads northwest. The road continues north into Upper Dublin Township. PA 152 passes through a golf course before reaching an intersection with Jenkintown Road and Fitzwatertown Road in the community of Fitzwatertown, where it turns northwest and crosses Sandy Run. PA 152 heads north through areas of homes with some businesses before curving northeast and coming to an intersection with Susquehanna Road. Here, the route turns northwest and crosses under Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276) as a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. Immediately after the Pennsylvania Turnpike bridge, Susquehanna Road splits to the northwest and PA 152 continues north along Limekiln Pike, passing businesses in Dresher. The road becomes two lanes again and continues northwest through residential neighborhoods, running through Jarrettown. PA 152 curves to the north and reaches the community of Maple Glen, where it crosses Norristown Road and PA 63 (Welsh Road). At the intersection with the latter, PA 152 enters Horsham Township and continues to an intersection with Butler Pike. Farther north, the route crosses Park Creek and the Power Line Trail. In the community of Prospectville, the road comes to an intersection with PA 463 (Horsham Road). Past this intersection, the route continues north between a cemetery to the west and a golf course to the east before heading through a mix of farmland, woods, and homes. PA 152 intersects Lower State Road and turns northeast, running along the border between Montgomery Township to the northwest and Horsham Township to the southeast and crossing the Little Neshaminy Creek. PA 152 turns north and fully enters Montgomery Township, which is in the North Penn Valley region, coming to an intersection with County Line Road in the community of Eureka. Here, the route turns northwest to briefly follow County Line Road. = Bucks County = PA 152 northbound past US 202 Bus. in Chalfont Past County Line Road, PA 152 continues north along Limekiln Pike, leaving the North Penn Valley region and entering Warrington Township in Bucks County. The route comes to an intersection with US 202 and the US 202 Parkway Trail before it curves to the northwest. After crossing Upper State Road, PA 152 enters New Britain Township and continues north past homes. PA 152 curves northwest soon after and enters the borough of Chalfont. The route intersects US 202 Bus. and turns northeast to form a concurrency with that route on Butler Avenue, crossing the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and heading into a business district. PA 152 splits from US 202 Bus. by turning northwest onto Main Street. The road passes homes and commercial development, coming to a bridge over SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line east of the Chalfont station. PA 152 curves north before it runs along the border between New Britain Township to the west and Chalfont to the east. PA 152 fully enters New Britain Township and becomes Limekiln Pike again, heading into a mix of agricultural and wooded areas with some homes and passing through the community of Newville. In Newville, the route intersects Creek Road and New Galena Road, both of which head northeast to provide access to Peace Valley Park. The road curves northwest and continues into Hilltown Township. At the intersection with Hilltown Pike, PA 152 turns northeast to remain along Limekiln Pike before turning northwest in the community of Hilltown. Following this, the route heads through the community of Mount Pleasant. Farther northwest, the road enters the borough of Silverdale and becomes Baringer Avenue, passing homes and coming to an intersection with PA 113 (Main Street). At this point, PA 152 turns southwest to form a wrong-way concurrency with PA 113 on Main Street before splitting from that route by turning northwest onto Walnut Street. The route leaves Silverdale for Hilltown Township again and runs through areas of residential subdivisions. Farther northwest, the road enters the borough of Perkasie and continues past more residences and businesses. PA 152 turns southwest onto Constitution Avenue and passes a park before entering the borough of Sellersville and becomes Park Avenue. PA 152 turns south onto Main Street and crosses into West Rockhill Township. PA 152 turns west onto four-lane undivided State Road before changing over to a divided highway as it comes to a bridge over the Bethlehem Line railroad line that is owned by SEPTA and operated by the East Penn Railroad. After the bridge, PA 152 crosses through a mix of fields and development before reaching its northern terminus at an interchange with the PA 309 freeway. Past the northern terminus, State Road continues southwest as State Route 4035, an unsigned quadrant route, toward the borough of Telford. History PA 152 northbound past PA 63 in Maple Glen PA 152 was originally built as Limekiln Road in 1693. This road was used to transport lime from kilns in Upper Dublin Township. The road was maintained by adjacent property owners. In 1850, the Limekiln Turnpike Company was created to improve the roadway through the collection of tolls, boasting tollhouses at each end of the village of Dreshertown (now Dresher). The toll collection and tollhouses along the Limekiln Pike were abolished and removed in 1917. When Pennsylvania designated legislative routes in 1911, what is now PA 152 did not get a route number. In the original 1928 routing, PA 152 stretched from the Stenton Avenue and Broad Street (US 611) intersection via Ogontz Avenue in the Oak Lane neighborhood of North Philadelphia to PA 113 in Silverdale. At this time, the entire route south of Chalfont was paved. The segment within Perkasie and Sellersville known as Walnut Street, Constitution Avenue, and Park Avenue was signed as PA 413 from South Perkasie Road to Main Street (then US 309). By 1940, PA 152 was paved north of Chalfont. In 1946, the northern terminus was moved to US 309 in Sellersville, replacing the segment of PA 413. From the late 1940s to before 1960, the southernmost segment on Easton Road from US 309 to Arcadia University was signed as US 611 Alternate. By 1960, the southern terminus was moved to its current location at US 309 (now PA 309) in Cheltenham Township. The northern terminus was moved to its current location at the PA 309 interchange near Sellersville by 1970.  Major intersections  PA 152 Alternate Truck  Pennsylvania Route 152 Alternate Truck is a truck route bypassing a weight-restricted bridge over SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line in Cheltenham Township, on which trucks over 15 tons and combination loads over 20 tons are prohibited.

The mosque is depicted on the obverse of the Iranian 200 rials banknote. History The 12th-century mosque is still in use today. It was first built under Ala'oddoleh Garshasb of the Al-e Bouyeh dynasty. The mosque was largely rebuilt between 1324 and 1365, and is one of the outstanding 14th century buildings of Iran. According to the historians, the mosque was constructed in the site of the Sassanid fire temple and Ala'oddoleh Garshasb commenced building the mosque. The previous mosque was constructed by order of Ala'oddoleh Kalanjar in 6th century A.H., however the main construction of the present building was done by order of \\"Seyyed Rokn al-Din Mohammad Qazi\\". Specifications The mosque is a fine specimen of Persian architecture. The entrance to the mosque is crowned by a pair of minarets, the highest in Iran, dating back to the Safavid era and measuring 52 meters in height and 6 meters in diameter. The entrance is decorated from top to bottom in tile work. Within is a long arcaded courtyard where, behind a deep-set south-east iwan, is the sanctuary chamber. This chamber, under a squat tiled dome, is exquisitely decorated with tile mosaic: its tall tiled Mihrab, dated 1365, is one of the finest of its kind in existence. On two star-shaped sgraffito tiles are the name of the craftsman and the date of construction of the Mihrab. One of the amazing attributes of the Jame Mosque of Yazd is that the lighting system is obtained indirectly by the reflection of light from the white plaster of the dome and the walls.

The first president of IEL, Frank Sobey, was paid an honorary salary of $1/year and was instrumental in attracting new companies to the province throughout the 1960s. IEL began with a $23 million start-up investment from the government and received a mandate to build industrial parks and lease space to companies, though through an aggressive pursuit of outside investment. IEL quickly began building and financing plants for companies that were willing to move to the province. By 1968, 60 firms had benefited from the program, producing 10,000 new jobs and $40 million in provincial revenue. Some of these companies included: * Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB of Sweden, which built a large integrated pulp and finished paper mill in Point Tupper. * Michelin of France, which eventually built three tire manufacturing plants in Granton, followed by Bridgewater and Waterville. * Volvo Personvagnar AB of Sweden, which built the only Volvo car assembly plant in North America in Dartmouth, which later moved to Halifax (see: Volvo Halifax Assembly) * Scott Paper Company of the United States, which built a kraft pulp mill in Abercrombie. * Clairtone a Canadian consumer electronics company IEL was at its zenith during the 1960s as it played an important part in modernizing and diversifying the province's economy.

(renamed Pontoffel Pock & His Magic Piano for the sing-a-long videocassette release) is an animated musical television special written by Dr. Seuss, directed by Gerard Baldwin, produced by DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises, first aired on ABC on May 2, 1980. This was one of the final productions done at DePatie‚ÄìFreleng as the studio would be sold to Marvel Comics and become Marvel Productions in 1981. The songs are by Joe Raposo. The special was nominated for an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Animated Program\\" the first year that award was given. The story has been noted for its satirical critique of capitalist structures. Plot Pontoffel Pock accidentally confuses the \\"Pullum\\" and \\"Pushum\\" controls for a device that places pickles into jars, wreaking havoc at the dill pickle factory and prompting the owner to deny him of work. Now having been denied of a job, Pontoffel returns alone to his dilapidated house and wishes that he could \\"get away from it all\\". He is immediately visited by McGillicuddy, a representative of the \\"Amalgamated Do-Gooding Fairies\\" who says: \\"Pontoffel Pock, your wish has been heard, and your wish has been granted.\\" McGillicuddy and his fairy associates, Humboldt and Higby (and later on, Hoikendorf), give him a magical flying piano that takes him anywhere in the world. To do so, Pontoffel Pock plays these six very simple notes (C, C, C, D, D#, E) and then chooses a destination by pressing one of many differently-colored buttons, which fly him to his destination. The first place he goes to is Groogen (based on Switzerland). Pontoffel recklessly flies through Groogen, scaring the locals (\\"Groogenites\\") out of their wits and causing a flugelhorn to get damaged. In a measure of self-defense, he is attacked by their \\"Goomy Gun\\", which fires multi-colored paint, that turns his piano yellow and causes its motor to lose power. He plummets downward, but at the last second Pontoffel \\"twitches the Homing Pigeon Switch\\" that sends him and the piano home. When he gets home, McGillicuddy at first attempts to take the piano back for Pontoffel's failure, calling him a \\"show-off\\" and a \\"smart-aleck\\", but eventually relents and gives Pontoffel a second chance. The piano's next destination is Casbahmopolis (based on The Middle East), where Pontoffel falls in love with a girl named Neefa Feefa, a famous \\"eyeball dancer\\" who dislikes her job of dancing for the King and, like Pontoffel, wants to \\"get away from it all\\". He infiltrates the King's palace to rescue her and is pursued and surrounded by the palace guards, one of whom breaks the Homing Pigeon Switch such that Pontoffel cannot take Neefa Feefa home with him. When he decides to travel somewhere else, he loses control of the piano and Neefa Feefa slips off into the guards' clutches. Having lost his sense of direction, Pontoffel starts pushing random buttons, sending him to several different places (which are based on many real places such as the North Pole, the Congo region, Spain, Waikiki, Africa, Japan, and others, including Seuss's birthplace of Springfield, Massachusetts) in the hope of returning to her. Meanwhile, McGillicuddy gets worried, having not heard from Pontoffel in a long time, so he enlists the help of all of his fairy associates to fly all over the world, looking for him by song: \\"Pontoffel Pock, Where The Heck Are You?\\" Finally remembering the right button, Pontoffel goes straight to Neefa Feefa, only to crash-land into the tower where she is being kept prisoner and destroy the piano. Neefa Feefa voices a wish to \\"get away from it all\\", just as Pontoffel had earlier, which comes to the attention of the fairies who appear to grant her wish. They are escorted home together, and for proving himself, Pontoffel is somehow finally hired at the pickle factory, along with Neefa Feefa. Outside, a rainbow appears as the Fairies fly the worn-out piano away.

In 2005, they changed their strategy and pooling their last $14,000, they targeted fitness instructors using direct marketing via videos and TV infomercials; their effort was quite successful with 450 people signing up for an initial $300 fee and a further $30 a month to become licensed Zumba instructors. The fitness routine became popular nationally and the Zumba Instructor Network grew; they then branched into direct video sales. As of 2010, Zumba Fitness is in 50,000 locations in 75 countries. In 2012, Insight Venture Partners and the Raine Group made an investment. In 2013, Inc magazine estimated the value of the company at $500 million. By 2015, according to Perlman, there were 14 million Zumba students in 186 countries. Bolstered by steady fee income, they expanded the brand into music collections, clothing, footwear, and video games (altogether about 50% of revenues are from ancillary products).

Better known by its acronym, NCEAS (pronounced ‚Äún-seas‚Äù) opened in May 1995. Funding for NCEAS is diverse and includes supporters such as the U.S. National Science Foundation, the State of California, and the University of California, Santa Barbara. NCEAS supports cross-disciplinary research that analyzes and synthesizes existing data to address major fundamental issues in ecology and allied fields,Center Seeks Synthesis to Make Ecology More Useful - Science Vol.275 no.5298 pp. 310-311 (1997) and encourages the application of science to natural resource management and public policy decision making. To facilitate synthetic analysis, NCEAS advances new techniques in mathematical and geospatial modeling, dynamic simulation, and visualization of ecological systems through its Ecoinformatics program. Since its inception, the Center has hosted over 5,000 individuals and supported roughly 500 research projects, which have resulted in more than 2,000 publications in 300+ different journals.Products of NCEAS Research In addition, NCEAS engages graduate students and grade school children through a variety of outreach and education programs. Mission NCEAS‚Äô core mission is to foster synthesis and analysis, and promote effective collaboration among researchers to alter how science is conducted. This mission includes 3 goals: * Advance the state of ecological knowledge through the search for general patterns and principles in existing data * Organize and synthesize ecological information in a manner useful to researchers, resource managers, and policy makers addressing important environmental issues * Influence the way ecological research is conducted by promoting a culture of synthesis, collaboration and data sharing Research programs Research at NCEAS focuses on three key areas: Core Ecology, Ecoinformatics, and Conservation and Resource Management. * Core Ecology - the primary research area funded by NCEAS, which includes a broad range of topics in ecology and allied fields. * Ecoinformatics ‚Äì research dedicated to the development and dissemination of technological tools that facilitate analysis and synthesis in ecology. * Conservation and Resource Management ‚Äì research focused on areas such as conservation biology and the explicit application of science to natural resource management and policy decision making. Supported research NCEAS supports four main research activities focused on synthesizing existing data: * Working groups - 4 to 20 cross-disciplinary individuals periodically meet at the Center and work together on a specific collaborative research project. * Postdoctoral researchers - early-career scientists who reside at NCEAS for 2‚Äì3 years to carry out synthetic research.Breaking with tradition - Nature vol.446 (pp. 226-228) * Center fellows ‚Äì researchers on sabbatical from their home institutions who reside at the Center to focus on a research topic within NCEAS' scope. * Distributed graduate seminars ‚Äì seminars that enable students and faculty from nationally or globally distributed universities to remotely collaborate on a research project.Qualified Thumbs Up for Habitat Plan Science Science Magazine vol.19 no.5346 (subscription required) NCEAS research is funded primarily through a competitive review process. Whether collaborative groups or individuals, scientists submit a proposal with research objectives, and the NCEAS Science Advisory Board determines which merit support.Review Process and Conflict of Interest Education and outreach In addition to its research activities, NCEAS carries out a number of outreach initiatives to increase public understanding of science, to foster interest in ecology and technology professions (particularly among groups underrepresented in science) and to engage with the local community. NCEAS also offers education and training programs at all levels of sophistication, from elementary school through undergraduate and graduate studies, to continuing education of professional scientists.Education and Outreach Overview One notable outreach and education program at NCEAS is Kids Do Ecology, which engages elementary- age children in the science of ecology. The program consists of two parts: a bilingual website and classroom projects, in which NCEAS scientists work with students in local classrooms to carry out ecological experiments based on the scientific method. History and funding The origin of the center can be traced to the perception among ecologists that important research themes span wide regions and long time periods. For example, research on marine fisheries must consider information from wide stretches of the ocean, and studies of long-lived forest communities must span decades. Recognizing that research in such areas cannot be accomplished by a single scientist working at one location, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recognized the need for a center whose mission was to foster synthetic research using existing data. In 1994, the NSF solicited proposals to build such a center, and the University of California, Santa Barbara was awarded $12.5 million to establish and operate the center for five years. Subsequent grants were awarded to UC Santa Barbara to continue NCEAS in 2001 ($16.6 million) and 2006 ($18.5 million). By 2005, ISI Essential Science Indicators recognized that NCEAS ranked #22 out of 38,000 institutions worldwideNational Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) Thomson Reuters InCites Institutions publishing in ecology and environmental science, in terms of scientific impact. Based on the experience with NCEAS, NSF launched a wider program of synthesis centers, including the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS).Mathematical biology centre launched - Nature News 455(11) (2008) Similar efforts based on the NCEAS research approach have been undertaken internationally as well, such as the Australian Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) and the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution. In all, more than 18 centers have been modeled on the NCEAS approach.Pioneering Center Ponders Future as NSF Pulls Out Science Magazine vol.332 no.6032 (subscription required) Additional support, in particular funds directed toward the Conservation and Resource Management program, comes from federal and state agencies, private foundations, and non-governmental organizations.Disclosure of NCEAS Funders‚Äô Roles NCEAS Directors William W. Murdoch initially served as the NCEAS director, followed by O.J. Reichman who directed the center from 1997 to 2007.

Life Jeanne was born on Nov. 6, 1596, in Roanne, in the Diocese of Lyons, in France. She was the daughter of Jean Ch√©zard, a French army officer and nobleman, and his wife, Jeanne Chaurier, whose first four children were stillborn or had died as infants. Jean was baptized the same day in St. Stephen's Church. Two small children who came to the door begging were her godparents. As she grew in her spirituality, she was drawn especially to Mary, the Mother of the Incarnate Word, to St. Joseph and to Michael the Archangel.\\"Venerable Jeanne Chezard de Matel, an apostle of the Incarnation\\", Today's Catholic, April 10, 2009, Archdiocese of San Antonio, Texas In 1608, at the age of 12, Jeanne was permitted to make her first Communion. In her teens she lived an active social life, loving parties, dancing, fun and laughter. In 1616, her father wanted her to marry, but Jeanne felt that God was calling her to religious life, but she was not clear. At one time, she thought she had a Carmelite vocation, and she later considered joining the Ursulines. It also appears from her writings that she pondered becoming a member of the Visitation and Franciscan orders. During her twenties, she spent six years trying to discern her vocation. Jeanne was endowed with the gift of infused contemplation and had vivid experiences of God‚Äôs presence. On July 2, 1625, at age twenty-nine, guided by her spiritual directors, Jeanne began the work of founding the Order of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament with two companions in Roanne, but soon moved to Lyon. At the early stages, she thought of naming the Order after the Lamb of God, whose peace would bring about ‚Äúa gentle, peaceful relationship between God and our soul.‚Äù Yet in prayer and discernment, Jesus is said to have revealed to her that the name of the Order was to be only ‚ÄúIncarnate Word, for in this is expressed all of who I am.‚Äù Monseigneur de Miron, the Archbishop of Lyon, died unexpectedly after having occupied the archepiscopal See for only two years. His successor, Cardinal Alphonse-Louis du Plessis de Richelieu, brother of the famous Prime Minister under Louis XIII, maintained an unwavering opposition to Mother de Matel's foundation. Confronted with the dispositions of the new archbishop, Mother de Matel's situation became both difficult and critical. Many women joined Jeanne with a desire to live a religious life. During these years Jeanne sought consent to found the Order in Roanne, Lyons, and Paris. While waiting for church approval to establish the new group as an order, the community established boarding schools for girls. Throughout her life, both personally and as a foundress, Jeanne encountered opposition, criticism, and other difficulties. She even delayed fulfilling her desire to take the habit and take religious vows to establish the Order. It was only on her deathbed that Jeanne's desire was realized. Against all odds, Jeanne de Matel received the habit of the order she had founded and made her religious profession, a few hours before her death in the early morning of September 11, 1670. Sisters of the Incarnate Word She established four foundations of the Order in France: Avignon (1639); Grenoble (1643); Paris (1644); and Lyon (1655).\\"The Life of Venerable Jeanne Ch√©zard de Matel\\", Congregation of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament, Houston, Texas Additional monasteries were established at Anduze (1697) and Roquemaure (1697). During the French Revolution the Incarnate Word houses shared the fate of all religious houses throughout the country, and were suppressed by the Decree of 1790.\\"A Brief History of the Order\\", Sisters of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament, Corpus Christi, Texas The Sisters who survived persecution were dispersed. Many struggled to remain faithful to their commitment to the Incarnate Word, protecting the relics and writings of Jeanne, and the other guiding documents of their Order. In 1817 the Order was re-established in the village of Azerables, France. On March 23, 1852, responding to the request from Bishop Odin of Texas, Sr. Claire Valentine, Sr. Ange Barre, Sr. Dominic Ravier and Sr. Ephrem Satin traveled from Lyon to Texas to serve in the field of education. After a 3-month voyage and 7 months in Galveston learning English and Spanish, the Sisters landed at then Point Isabel in the middle of January, 1853, and traveled to Brownsville. Houses were also founded in Cleveland, Ohio and Mexico. The Order helped establish another Order, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word. Venerable On March 7, 1992, Pope John Paul II declared that she had lived a life of heroic sanctity and accorded her the title, Venerable. Legacy The Sisters of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament of Victoria, Texas, along with Sister Congregations in Corpus Christi, Texas and Houston, Texas, and Cleveland, Ohio, and with many sisters in Mexico, now serve in the Americas, Europe, and Africa. They serve primarily through ministries of prayer, Christian education, and health care, according to the needs of the Church today.

Missense mRNA molecules are created when template DNA strands or the mRNA strands themselves undergo a missense mutation in which a protein coding sequence is mutated and an altered amino acid sequence is coded for.  Biogenesis  A missense mRNA arises from a missense mutation, in the event of which a DNA nucleotide base pair in the coding region of a gene is changed such that it results in the substitution of one amino acid for another. The point mutation is nonsynonymous because it alters the RNA codon in the mRNA transcript such that translation results in amino acid change. An amino acid change may not result in appreciable changes in protein structure depending on whether the amino acid change is conservative or non-conservative. This owes to the similar physicochemical properties exhibited by some amino acids. Missense mRNAs may be detected as a result of two different types of point mutations - spontaneous mutations and induced mutations. Spontaneous mutations occur during the DNA replication process where a non-complementary nucleotide is deposited by the DNA polymerase in the extension phase. The consecutive round of replication would result in a point mutation. If the resulting mRNA codon is one that changes the amino acid, a missense mRNA would be detected. A hypergeometric distribution study involving DNA polymerase Œ≤ replication errors in the APC gene revealed 282 possible substitutions that could result in missense mutations. When the APC mRNA was analyzed in the mutational spectrum, it showed 3 sites where the frequency of substitutions were high. Induced mutations caused by mutagens can give rise to missense mutations. Nucleoside analogues such as 2-aminopurine and 5-bromouracil can insert in place of A and T respectively. Ionizing radiation like x-rays and Œ≥-rays can deaminate cytosine to uracil. Missense mRNAs may be applied synthetically in forward and reverse genetic screens used to interrogate the genome. Site-directed mutagenesis is a technique often employed to create knock-in and knock-out models that express missense mRNAs. For example, in knock-in studies, human orthologs are identified in model organisms to introduce missense mutations, or a human gene with a substitution mutation is integrated into the genome of the model organism. The subsequent loss-of-function or gain-of-function phenotypes are measured to model genetic diseases and discover novel drugs. While homologous recombination has been widely used to generate single-base substitutions, novel technologies that co-inject gRNA and hCas9 mRNA of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, in conjunction with single-strand oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor sequences have shown efficiency in generating point mutations in the genome.  Evolutionary implications = Non-synonymous RNA editing = Substitutions can occur on the level of both the DNA and RNA. RNA editing- dependent amino acid substitutions can produce missense mRNA's of which occur through hydrolytic deaminase reactions. Two of the most prevalent deaminase reactions occur through the Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme (APOBEC) and the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA enzyme (ADAR) which are responsible for the conversion of cytidine to uridine (C-to-U), and the deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), respectively. Such selective substitutions of uridine for cytidine, and inosine for adenosine in RNA editing can produce differential isoforms of missense mRNA transcripts, and confer transcriptome diversity and enhanced protein function in response to selective pressures.

He earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts from Seoul National University in Oriental Painting. He also studied at Rhode Island School of Design where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting in 1994. Then, in 1997, he received a Master of Fine Arts in sculpture from Yale University. Suh currently has live-in studios located in London, New York City, and Seoul. Suh was named the Wall Street Journal's Innovator of the Year in Art in 2013. He represented Korea at the Venice Biennale in 2001.  Early life  His father, Suh Se-Ok, was a famous artist who led a 1960s art movement to combine traditional ink paintings with new meanings and concepts from the abstract art movement that was happening in the West. Suh grew up in Seoul and after failing to get the grades needed to become a marine biologists, he applied for art school. After receiving a master's degree in traditional Korean painting, he moved to the United States to continue his painting education in 1991. Immigrating to the United States affected how Suh interpreted home and created an overarching theme in his works where he explores space and how we interact with it. This can be seen in his piece, \\"Home Within Home Within Home Within Home Within Home\\" which is a silk replica of his childhood home, as well as his piece \\"Fallen Star\\" that featured a traditional Korean home crashing into a building on the UC San Diego campus. Moving to the US removed the association Suh had to his father, \\"I felt relieved when I went to the States, I felt much more freedom\\". It allowed him to make his own work and not be compared to his father.  Influences  Suh's work has a central focus on architecture, space, and identity. His early work blended into the gallery space and was barely discernible to the viewer as art. His most famous works are made of nylon or silk skillfully sewn into forms that represent spaces in Suh's life to scale.

He succeeded Ildebrand in this capacity. He assisted in a church council called by Pope Agatho in Rome in 680 and in 681 attended the Third Council of Constantinople against the Monothelites. Biography He was born in the village of Vandano, near Cerreto Sannita, then part of the Duchy of Benevento, toward the end of the papacy of Gregory the Great.Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints, vol. II, D. & J. Sadlier, & Company, 1864 At that time, Benevento had recently (in 590) been captured by Arian Lombards from the Trinitarian Romans. According to the ninth century vitae, he received a Christian education, and spent a good deal of time studying the Christian scriptures. He took holy orders as soon as allowed to do so, and was immediately employed by the local bishop as a preacher, a task for which he had considerable talent. Shortly thereafter, he was made the curate of St. Basil's Church in nearby Morcone, where his preaching was not well received by indifferent parishioners only nominally Christian. He continued his calls for reform but eventually returned to Benevento, where he was welcomed back by those who remembered him from earlier.Staley, Tony. \\"Making a chalice from a gold snake\\", The Compass, Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin, 17 February 2012 At the time, the people of Benevento still entertained some idolatrous superstitions, including veneration of a golden viper and a local walnut tree. The local Lombard prince, Romuald I son of the Arian Lombard King Grimoald I, was himself involved in these activities. Barbatus regularly preached against them only to be ignored. Later, he warned the people of the city of the great trials they would soon suffer at the hands of the East Roman Emperor Constans II and his army, who shortly thereafter landed in the area and laid siege to Benevento. The people, in their fear, renounced the practices Barbatus had criticized. He then cut down the tree the locals had worshipped, and melted the viper into a chalice for use in the church. Barbatus himself was responsible for a practical form of resistance to Constans. In 1903 the foundations of the Temple of Isis were discovered close to the Arch of Trajan in Benevento, and many fragments of fine sculptures in both the Egyptian and the Greco-Roman style belonging to it were found. They had apparently been used as the foundation of a portion of the city wall, reconstructed in 663 under the fear of an attack by Constans, the temple having been destroyed by order of Barbatus to provide the necessary material. The presiding bishop of Benevento, Ildebrand, died during the siege, which ended as Barbatus had foretold, with the defeat of Constans. After the withdrawal of the invaders, Barbatus was made bishop on March 10, 633 and continued his efforts to eliminate superstition. In 673 Duke Romuald placed the grotto of St. Michael at Gargano under the care of Barbatus.Arnold, John Charles. The Footprints of Michael the Archangel: The Formation and Diffusion of a Saintly Cult, c. 300-c. 800, Springer, 2013, In 680, he assisted in a council held by Pope Agatho, and took part in the sixth general council held in Constantinople in 681 regarding the Monothelites.

The series takes place in the fictional city of Daikoku, a hotbed of AR development with an emerging citywide virtual infrastructure. It follows a group of children as they use AR glasses to unravel the mysteries of the half real, half Internet city, using a variety of illegal software tools, techniques, and virtual pets to manipulate the digital landscape. Denn≈ç Coil, in development for over a decade, is the series directorial debut of Japanese animator Mitsuo Iso. It premiered on NHK Educational TV on May 12, 2007. Due to the animators involved in its production and its unusually high-profile television broadcast time slot, Denn≈ç Coil was highly anticipated. An English dub titled Den-noh Coil was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Maiden Japan in June 2016. Plot In 2026, eleven years after the introduction of internet-connected augmented reality eyeglasses and visors, Y≈´ko Okonogi moves with her family to the city of Daikoku, the technological center of the emerging half-virtual world. Y≈´ko joins her grandmother's \\"investigation agency\\" made up of children equipped with virtual tools and metatags. As their research turns up mounting evidence of children who have been whisked away to the mysterious \\"other side\\" of reality, they find themselves entangled in a conspiracy to cover up the dangerous true nature and history of the new technology. Setting and themes=Technology= Denn≈ç means \\"computer\\" and is analogous to the archaic English term \\"cyberbrain\\". In the series, the word is used to differentiate between virtual and real, e.g. \\"cyber cat\\". The title of the show itself, Denn≈ç Coil, refers to a dangerous separation of one's digital self from the physical body. Yasako uses her augmented reality eyeglasses and ear monitors. The children access the virtual world through Internet-connected visors, which they refer to as megane, the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The visors allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their visors from their eyes. The visors also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment. =Interaction with the virtual world= Interaction with the virtual world is handled in a similar fashion to contemporary video games. Software tools are visually represented as tactile tools (e.g. a fishing rod) which occupy 3D virtual space and must be manipulated by hand. Sophisticated tools include metatags, visually represented as o-fuda (paper talismans), and efficacious chalk circles called ang≈ç, meaning \\"code\\", which have a variety of effects. Virtual objects such as pets cannot be recalled or reset; when a pet runs away, it must be chased and caught in 3D space. Virtual objects and pets are also susceptible to a form of \\"death\\" by data corruption or deletion. For a virtual object or pet to be deleted from cyberspace, it can be attacked by a virtual weapon, such as Searchmaton's beam weapons. While users of denn≈ç eyeglasses cannot be physically harmed by virtual weapons, their costly personal data and virtual possessions can be damaged. Searchmaton, the maintenance and antivirus bot of Daikoku, is constantly on the lookout for illegal objects and damaged space, which includes corrupted or obsolete space, computer viruses, and the forbidden pets and tools that the protagonists own. The virtual side of Daikoku is shown as an emerging space, requiring some maintenance. In the first episode, the virtual dog Densuke falls into an obsolete virtual space at a physical construction site. Due to a version mismatch between the dog and the space, Densuke finds himself glitching and destabilizing in the environment. Eventually Searchmaton reformats the obsolete space. It is also shown that the virtual space represented in Daikoku is tied to the city's electronic infrastructure. In one scene, Fumie Hashimoto uses a metatag to control a traffic light. The underground virtual currency of Daikoku is known as meta, which is equivalent to the Japanese yen, and is traded in the form of \\"metabugs\\". The market value of a metabug can change according to its supply and demand. It is explained that a metabug represents a special kind of software bug, and from their unique properties they can be refined into tools or metatags by skilled craftsmen. Metabugs, which are especially abundant in the city of Daikoku, can only be unearthed in damaged or corrupted spaces. Metabugs are also a target of deletion for Searchmaton. Despite being a computer environment, the virtual side of Denn≈ç Coil has a tangible and sometimes organic design, with much of the interaction requiring physical effort in 3D space. In order to hack into a corrupted virtual space in Daikoku, Fumie Hashimoto handles a software spray can loaded with so-called \\"black bug spray\\". A virus on the run from Searchmaton leaves behind a (virtually) tangible, evaporating black trail of raw \\"denn≈ç substance\\". The virtual dog Densuke uses his nose to follow the trail. However, denn≈ç eyeglasses do not grant the user the ability to \\"feel\\" the virtual world. Therefore, using software tools and playing with virtual pets requires some degree of active make-believe from the user. Densuke explores an abandoned space. A special type of rogue virtual organism known as \\"illegals\\" populate the damaged and obsolete spaces of Daikoku City. The protagonists sometimes hunt special forms of illegals in the hope of collecting valuable metabugs. Illegals, originating from \\"the other side\\", sometimes become lost and isolated in the city and express a desire to return to their \\"homeland\\". Some humanoid illegals known as Nulls can whisk people away to \\"the other side\\" by inducing \\"denn≈ç coil\\"‚Äîa comatose state where the victim is trapped in VR. =Infrastructure of the virtual world= In order to spatially synchronize virtual space and real space, users of internet-connected denn≈ç eyeglasses constantly upload the status of physical space to the virtual infrastructure. In the fifth episode, the protagonists encounter a sparsely visited junkyard of buses on the fringes of wireless internet connectivity. Due to obsolete AR data, the buses are depicted by denn≈ç eyeglasses as being in far better condition than they actually are. The characters sometimes exploit the discrepancies of desynchronization when dealing with metabugs and illegals. The AR world is filled with mysteries of and ghostly tales about children losing their soul to \\"the other side\\", a supposed ghostly realm of VR hidden in the AR environment. The protagonists continually gain a clearer picture of the true nature of the glasses and cyberspace throughout the series. It is eventually revealed that the glasses form a two-way brain-computer interface known as Imago, first used in experimental medical treatments. However, there are substantial health risks in prolonged use of the interface, and the interface itself presents the possibility of a coma or brain death through the \\"denn≈ç coil\\" phenomenon. At the same time, an experiment gone awry gave birth to Michiko, a digital life form that assumed control of Coil Domain‚Äîreferred to in rumors as \\"the other side\\". Due to their inability to erase Coil Domain, Megamass opted to instead create a new layer of augmented reality space on top of Coil Domain, where the influence of Michiko and Imago was lessened in order to minimize the occurrence of denn≈ç coil. Much information regarding Coil Domain, Imago, Michiko and denn≈ç coil has been aggressively covered up by the technology conglomerate, Megamass. =Themes= A recurring theme throughout the series is the depiction of torii, which are traditional Japanese gates that symbolically mark the transition from the profane to the sacred, either as actual infrastructure (virtual or real) or in chalk patterns drawn by characters in the series. Episode three opens with the monologue, \\"According to rumors in the industry, there are hidden functions in the [denn≈ç] glasses that are better left unmentioned\\". It is also rumored among children that one can \\"lose their soul\\" by venturing too far into obsolete space. Some children possess an extra sensitivity which allows them to perceive sounds and voices emanating from obsolete space, metabugs, and so on. Much of the AR environment is steeped in urban legends and ghostly tales, and the series highlights the special intuition, extra sensitivity and sense of closeness that the children have to the emerging AR world. PSA web graphic, \\"Searchmaton is our friend\\". It is shown that the virtual side of Daikoku is heavily regulated and restricted by the Searchmaton software, therefore the children of Denn≈ç Coil are circumventing those regulations through their mischievous adventures and their trade of \\"illegal\\" software tools and pets. Fumie Hashimoto describes Searchmaton as a powerful piece of software that, despite its blunt strength, is easily fooled due to its predictable behavior and unbalanced priorities. She also laments how it shows no leeway by destroying even the most harmless of virtual toys and pets. Beginning with episode six, the show often highlights the lack of nuance and the divide of understanding between the overprotective adult administrators and the child protagonists regarding the regulation of the emerging digital frontier. According to the series director, Mitsuo Iso, a major theme in Denn≈ç Coil is the distance between the characters, such as Y≈´ko's inability to feel the fur of her own virtual pet, in addition to all the relational tensions and divides of understanding between the characters in the series. In Iso's translated words, it conveys how \\"there will always be a distance between people, and even between things that seem within ones' reach. And that one must walk down a long, thin and winding road before they reach one's heart. There are tons of obstacles. It's in fact like the roads in towns of old.\\" Characters ; : : Nicknamed Yasako, which is another reading of ÂÑ™Â≠ê meaning \\"gentle girl\\". With her sister Kyoko and her two parents, Yasako moves to the city of Daikoku to live with her grandmother, Megabaa. Yasako is a sweet and passive girl who follows the lead of Fumie, who eventually initiates her into Megabaa's Coil Cyber Detective Agency as its eighth member. Yasako has been to the city of Daikoku seven years ago for her grandfather's funeral. A pair of denn≈ç eyeglasses and the virtual pet Densuke were left to her as a memento. During her time in Daikoku, she coincidentally wandered into the Coil Domain where she befriended a young boy with the codename 4423. After Yasako returns to live in Daikoku, her hazy memories of that enigmatic friendship gradually return to haunt her. Her father Ichir≈ç works at a Dennou technology company, Megamass, which deploys Searchmaton in Daikoku. Her birthdate is October 12, 2015. ; : From left to right: Daichi, Yasako, Fumie, and Isako. : Nicknamed Isako, which is another reading of ÂãáÂ≠ê meaning \\"brave girl\\", Yuko Amasawa is a powerful type of hacker known as an who is able to manipulate the electronic infrastructure through sophisticated chalk patterns. Rumored to have familial ties to an AR technology company, Isako uses a Brain-Computer Interface to interact with the virtual world‚Äîa function hidden inside the hardware of AR visors and eyeglasses. Isako is, on the surface, extremely arrogant and antisocial, perceiving human relationships strictly as hierarchies of power and manipulation. Isako relentlessly chases special illegals in order to collect kirabugs. She is secretly driven to this task in the hopes of finding her brother in \\"the other side\\". Her birthdate is April 4, 2015. ; : : She is the little sister of Yasako. She is young and childish and often gets in the way of danger. She shows a number of fixations; the most common one is the repeated use of the word \\"poop\\" when pointing at people and other items of interest (Daichi can even decode her \\"poop poop\\" language). ; : : Fumie is the seventh member of the Coil Denn≈ç Investigation Agency. She befriends Yasako almost immediately, and has a quick-witted, playful nature. She is an experienced hacker and an adept user of metatags, and makes use of her digital pet, Oyaji, in her investigations. ; : : Akira is the youngest member of the Daikoku Hackers' Club. He agrees to spy on the Daikoku Hackers for his older sister, Fumie, by joining their ranks as a double agent. Akira makes use of his digital pet \\"Micet\\", which he illegally patched to unlock its video recording feature. ; : Haraken and his aunt, Tamako. : Nicknamed Haraken. He is the president of the Biology Club, and is the Coil Denn≈ç Detective Agency's fifth member. The polar opposite of Fumie, he is shy, reserved, and secretive, especially of his personal connection to Searchmaton. Haraken is personally vested in researching internet viruses and illegals on behalf of Kanna Ashihara, his childhood friend, who died by traffic accident under mysterious circumstances in the previous year. He is secretly tormented by the idea, that a part of Kanna may still exist somewhere on \\"the other side\\". He begins to have feelings for Yasako but is distracted by Kanna's Incident. ; : : Tamako is Haraken's aunt. As a consultant for Daikoku's Cyberspace Administration, she holds authority over the programming of Searchmaton and is responsible for its highly aggressive behavior. She is especially intent on preventing Yuko Amasawa from accomplishing her mission to summon a portal to Coil Domain. However Tamako herself is well-versed in hacking and the crafting of metatags, and she often oversteps her authority in investigating the protagonists' activities. Her fervent pursuit of making augmented reality a \\"safe place\\" stems from her re-opening the portal to the other side in her early days of hacking, thus initiating the constant battle between obsolete and new space. ; : : Daichi is the founder and leader of a group of pranksters at school called the Daikoku Hackers' Club. Hot-headed and quick to take offense, he holds an ongoing love/hate rivalry with Fumie stemming from early childhood. With the appearance of Isako, Daichi quickly finds himself defeated and cast out of his own group after challenging her. While often perceived as a troublemaker, Daichi is tagged by his awkward friend, Denpa, who holds him in high regard for befriending him in the face of school harassment. Daichi is, somewhat ironically, a constant target of Kyoko's antics. He has a crush on Fumie but she is oblivious to her feelings even though she actually cares for him. ; : : Sanae, also known as Megabaa (Specs Granny in the English dub), whose nickname stems from the Japanese words for and , is the owner of the Cyber Candy Shop Megasi-ya. Megasi-ya also sells software and metatags. Megabaa is the primary craftsman of metatags in Daikoku, and is an expert software programmer. She is also Yasako's grandmother, and the head of the Coil Denn≈ç Detective Agency. Her cunning frugality terrifies Yasako among other characters.

He is a former acquaintance of Tamako Harakawa, and a collaborator in Isako's quest to open the door to the \\"other side\\". His ultimate aim is to bring down the Megamass company. ; : : The younger brother of Nekome. He is jealous of Isako and mercilessly bullies her, but takes a liking to Yasako and becomes split between his loyalty towards his brother and his desire to protect her. He has a modified pink micet named .Japanese Limited Edition DVD 8 booklet ; : Searchmaton, for short, is a bot and antivirus software deployed by the Cyberspace Administration of Daikoku. Its task is to debug and maintain the virtual side of the city. Its secondary function is to seek out and disable illegal AR devices, software, and viruses, making it a menace to the characters of the series. Searchmaton can deploy up to four spherical drones to aid in its task. While Searchmaton can patrol the city streets freely, it is prohibited to enter private property such as houses, and other spaces such as temple grounds and schools, because they lie outside of the responsibility of Daikoku's Cyberspace Administration. The protagonists utilize this and other predictable aspects of Searchmaton's behavior to escape its grasp. Searchmaton, striking terror into the hearts of children, is ironically painted with a smiley face and punctuates its violent attacks with the cute catch phrase which Yasako's father had a part in developing. Tamako often hijacks Searchmatons for use as her personal digital henchmen. They are later replaced by the upgraded Searchmaton 2.0 in the form of cubes which have upgraded weapons and shielding, and can combine like the Q-chan to perform wide area re-formatting. Since the 2.0s are under government jurisdiction they can enter areas inaccessible to Searchy including shrines, and also private property when authorised. ; : A mysterious illegal who resides in Coil Domain.

There are many short films produced by individual filmmakers, and about five feature films in Bahrain's history. There are a number of theaters in Bahrain showing a mix of Indian, American and Arabic movies. Bahrain also has a cinema club established in 1980, and the Bahraini Film Production Company, established in 2006 to support the Bahraini film industry. History The first attempt to create a movie theater in Bahrain was in 1922, on the initiative of Bahraini businessman Mahmood Al Saati. He imported a projector and set up a makeshift cinema at a cottage on the north coast of Manama. The first official cinema was established by Abdulla Al Zayed and associates in Manama, in 1937. The cinema had no air-conditioning or heating system so the cinema was moved to an open-roofed building during the winter season with one of the walls being used as a screen. In 1939, the founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, visited the cinema while on a diplomatic visit with the then-Hakim Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa. During the 1930s and 1940s, films were in black and white with the majority of them being predominately Egyptian as well as some American films. Westerns and the Tarzan films were reported to have been very popular in the country. Initially, the introduction of cinemas drew criticism from elderly citizens who stated that it \\"would destroy traditional values\\". Charles Belgrave, an adviser to the Bahraini government at the time, wrote in his memoirs that the older Bahraini population opposed the cinema because \\"they thought that young people would gamble and steal to raise money for a cinema ticket\\". During the pan-Arab era of the 20th century, Egyptian films enjoyed immense popularity in the country. Establishment of cinemas In the early 1940s, the Bahrain Petroleum Company opened a cinema in Awali for its staff. The cinema moved to a different building in Awali in 1958, but finally closed in 1991. In the 1950s and 1960s, eight new cinemas opened in Bahrain, including the Pearl Cinema, Al Hamra Cinema, Al Nasr Cinema and Awal Cinema, all of which were established in Manama. The first cinema to open in Muharraq was Al Jazira Cinema in 1955 and it is still in use today. The first modern-style cinema to open in Bahrain was the Delmon Cinema at the Gosi Complex in 1996, but it has since closed. The trend for modern-style cinemas was continued by the Bahrain Cinema Company, which opened cinema complexes at Seef Mall in 1998 and in Saar in 2000 respectively. An independent cinema, Dana Cinema, was opened at the Dana Mall in Manama, in 2002. A 20-screen cinema complex was constructed in the Bahrain City Centre, the largest such cineplex in the Middle East. In July 2015, the country's first IMAX theatre was opened in Seef Mall Muharraq under Novo Cinema. Other cinema companies entered the Bahraini market in the 2010s, such as Mexican company Cinepolis in January 2019.

It was first raised in 1685 by the Earl of Peterborough as the Earl of Peterborough's Regiment of Horse by merging four existing troops of horse. Renamed several times, it was designated the Queen's Regiment of Dragoon Guards in 1746 as it evolved into a dragoon unit. (Dragoons described a force of highly mobile mounted infantry equipped with lighter, faster horses and carrying firearms) and later named the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) in 1767 to reflect the custom of its soldiers riding only bay horses. The regiment served as horse cavalry until 1937, when it was mechanised with light tanks. The regiment became part of the Royal Armoured Corps in 1939. After service in the First and Second World Wars, the regiment amalgamated with the 1st King's Dragoon Guards in 1959 to form the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards. History=Early history= Battle of Aughrim, July 1691 The regiment was raised in 1685 as the Earl of Peterborough's Regiment of Horse when James II expanded his army after the Monmouth rebellion. Peterborough was a Catholic who remained loyal to James and was replaced by Edward Villiers on 31 December 1688. During the Nine Years' War, it served as Villiers Regiment in Ireland between 1689-81, fighting in the battles of the Boyne and Aughrim. At Aughrim, it was ordered to cross a bog under heavy fire, prompting French general the Marquis de St Ruth to shout \\"It is madness, but no matter, the more that cross the more we shall kill;\\" he was decapitated by a cannon ball shortly thereafter.Richards, p. 26 When the Treaty of Limerick ended the war in Ireland in October 1691, the regiment returned to England.Richards, p. 27 Brigadier-General Richard Leveson became Colonel on 19 January 1694 and as Leveson's Regiment of Horse it was based in Flanders until the Treaty of Ryswick ended the war in 1697. It escaped disbandment by being placed on the Irish establishment; Leveson died in March 1699 and Daniel Harvey took over as Colonel. During the War of the Spanish Succession Harveys Regiment moved to Portugal in March 1704 to support the Allied campaign in the Iberian Peninsula. In July 1710 it fought at the Battle of Almenar but in December was overwhelmed by superior forces at Brihuega, the survivors being taken prisoner. In recognition of its involvement in suppressing the 1715 Jacobite rising it changed names to The Princess of Wales's Own Regiment of Horse and after Caroline of Wales became Queen in 1727 The Queen's Own Regiment of Horse. After the 1745 Jacobite rising it changed titles again to The Queen's Regiment of Dragoon Guards in 1746 then 2nd (The Queen's) Regiment of Dragoon Guards in 1751. During the Seven Years' War, it fought at Corbach and Warburg in July 1760 and then captured several French regiments at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in June 1762. After starting to ride on bay horses, the regiment were renamed as the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) in 1767. In an incident during the Peninsular War, a single squadron of the regiment, under Major Robert Craufurd, attacked and defeated a unit of 150 French troops; the regiment was not present at the Battle of Waterloo.Richards, p. 28 The regiment next saw action when a squadron under Major Piercy Smith charged the rebels at the capture of Lucknow in March 1858 during the Indian Rebellion.Richards, p. 29 It suffered heavy losses in an action at Leeukop in March 1902 during the Second Boer War. =First World War= Troops of the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) on the march approaching Hardecourt Wood, 18 September 1916. The regiment, which had been was stationed at Aldershot at the start of the war, landed in France as part of the 1st Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Cavalry Division, part of the Expeditionary Force, in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. The regiment took part in the Great Retreat in August 1914, the Battle of Le Cateau in August 1914, the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, the Battle of Messines in October 1914, the First Battle of Ypres in October 1914, the Battle of the Somme in Autumn 1916, the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, the Battle of the Scarpe in August 1918 and in the final advance of Autumn 1918. =Inter-war= The regiment was renamed the Queen's Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards) in 1921. The regiment served as horse cavalry until 1937, when it was mechanised with light tanks. The regiment became part of the Royal Armoured Corps in 1939. =Second World War= The Queen's Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards) advance through the Gabes Gap, Tunisia, 7 April 1943 At the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939, the regiment was in England, assigned to the 2nd Light Armoured Brigade (serving alongside the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers and the 10th Royal Hussars) of the 1st Armoured Division. In May 1940, the Bays went to France and was heavily engaged on the Somme during the Battle of France. In mid June, with the collapse of French resistance, the regiment was evacuated to England through the port of Brest. The regiment was deployed to the Middle East in November 1941, equipped initially with the Crusader tank, and took part in the Battle of Gazala in May 1942, where its men were in action for 19 days, a record for an armoured regiment in the Western Desert. The regiment also took part in the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942, the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, the Battle of the Mareth Line in March 1943 and the Tunisia Campaign in May 1943. The regiment was deployed on the Italian Front in May 1944: its men took part in the Battle of the Argenta Gap in April 1945 during the final offensive of the Italian Campaign. =Post war= After the war, the regiment remained in northern Italy, at Pegi on the River Isonzo, and then moved to Egypt in June 1947 before returning to Dale Barracks in Chester in October 1947. The regiment moved on to Bad Fallingbostel in Germany in 1949, before returning to Tidworth Camp in September 1954 and then deploying to Aqaba in Jordan later in the year. It deployed to Libya in February 1956 and then returned to Perham Down in August 1957 before transferring to Northampton Barracks in Wolfenb√ºttel in 1958.

He began his professional career in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 2003, and played with the Dodgers from 2006 until 2014, the San Diego Padres in 2015 and 2016 and the Atlanta Braves in 2016 and 2017 before returning to the Dodgers for the 2018 season, and briefly playing for the Cincinnati Reds in 2019. He has been named to three All-Star teams and has won two Gold Glove Awards (2009 and 2011) and two Silver Slugger Awards (2009 and 2011). The Dodgers selected Kemp in the sixth round of the 2003 MLB draft. After four seasons in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut in 2006. He did not become a full-time player until 2008, when he took over as the starting center fielder for the Dodgers. In 2011, Kemp led the National League in runs scored (115), total bases (353), OPS+ (171), WAR (7.8), home runs (39), and runs batted in (126). Additionally, he became the first player to finish in the top two in both home runs and steals since Hank Aaron in 1963. Early life and education Kemp was born in Midwest City, Oklahoma, the son of Carl Kemp and Judy Henderson, who never married. He was raised in Oklahoma by his mother, a registered nurse, and grandmother. When he was 13, his mother had another son, Tyler, who was born prematurely and died at age one. Kemp attended Midwest City High School in Oklahoma, where he was a standout in basketball and baseball. He was teammates with Shelden Williams on the varsity basketball team that won the state title two years in a row, and the team was ranked third in the nation at one point. Kemp himself was an All-City selection, and averaged 20 points a game. Kemp received a scholarship offer to play college basketball for the Oklahoma Sooners. Kemp, along with Williams and three other teammates, were accused of raping a 19-year-old woman at the time of a high school all-star basketball tournament on January 20, 2002, at the Columbus, Ohio Hyatt hotel. The players were suspended from the team during the investigation. However, the woman did not press charges, and the district attorney opted to not pursue the matter due to a lack of evidence. Kemp was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 6th round of the 2003 MLB draft, and signed with the team on June 5, 2003, for a $130,000 signing bonus. Minor leagues Kemp started his professional career for the Gulf Coast Dodgers in 2003 and followed that up with stints with the Columbus Catfish in 2004 and the Vero Beach Dodgers in 2004‚Äì05. At Columbus and Vero Beach, Kemp improved his power numbers. After hitting just a single home run in 43 games, Kemp became more of a power hitter.

His promotion was spurred by an effort to provide regular rest for center fielder Kenny Lofton and the often injured right field All-Star J. D. Drew. Kemp made his major league debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 28, 2006, against the Washington Nationals. He got his first career major league hit that same game, a single off of Jon Rauch. He hit his first Major League homer on June 1 in his second Dodger Stadium at-bat off the Philadelphia Phillies' Gavin Floyd. He homered in three straight games from June 1‚Äì3 against the Phillies and homered twice on June 11 off Colorado Rockies starter Aaron Cook. He also became the first Dodger and fifth major league player to hit four homers in his first 10 days with the team. After his fast start, Kemp slumped and hit only .234 with no homers from June 14 through July 13, when he was reassigned to the AAA Las Vegas 51s. He returned to the team when rosters expanded on September 1. In his second stint in the Majors, Kemp struggled. He batted just .156 with a .182 on-base percentage and a .250 slugging percentage in September and October combined.

Kemp hit his first career post-season home run on October 7 in his first at-bat of the 2009 NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals. After the season, Kemp was selected as a recipient of both the Gold Glove Award and the Silver Slugger Award.

On June 1, Kemp hit his first career walk-off home run against the Arizona Diamondbacks off of relief pitcher J. C. Guti√©rrez, giving the Dodgers the only run of the game. Kemp described his first career walk-off home run as \\"a great feeling\\". However, he slumped badly in the second half of the season and finished with a .249 batting average, 28 home runs, 89 RBIs, and 19 steals while playing in all 162 games for the first time in his career. He also broke his own single-season Dodger record for strikeouts, with 170. Kemp was the subject of some criticism in 2010 from General Manager Ned Colletti, who called him out publicly early in the season for poor baserunning. Kemp had several embarrassing gaffes on the base paths during the season, and was caught stealing 15 times. With runners in scoring position, he hit seven home runs and drove in 61 runs in 160 at bats. However, he struck out 49 times and batted just .225 in that spot. Against right-handed pitching, he batted just .233 with a .299 on-base percentage, to go along with 22 home runs and 69 RBIs, as opposed to a .295 average against left-handed pitchers. Kemp hit home runs in five straight games to end the season, the first major league player to accomplish that feat and the first Dodger since Shawn Green in the 2001 season to hit homers in five consecutive games. The only other Dodgers to homer in five consecutive games are Roy Campanella (1950), Adri√°n Gonz√°lez (2014‚Äì15), and Joc Pederson (2015). 2011 After his much publicized problems on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived at spring training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes hoped they would be high percentage steals. At the end of the season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement. On April 17, Kemp hit his second career walk-off home run, doing it in the ninth inning off of St. Louis Cardinals closer Ryan Franklin, on a 2‚Äì2 count that gave the Dodgers a 2‚Äì1 victory.\\" In a game against the Atlanta Braves five days later, Kemp hit his second walk-off home run of the season, this time in the 12th inning off of Braves pitcher Cristhian Mart√≠nez. After being one of the league leaders in home runs, stolen bases, RBIs, and batting average during the first half of the season, Kemp was voted as a starter for the National League squad in the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Arizona. He also accepted an invitation to participate in the Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game. Kemp in August 2011 The day before the All-Star Game, Giants' manager and 2011 NL All-Star Manager, Bruce Bochy, announced his decision to bat Kemp third in the line up. Explaining his decision, Bochy said about Kemp, \\"He's a guy with speed, power, a guy that can beat you with a base hit or a long ball. He's what you call a complete player ‚Äì tremendous defender, but more so in the 3-hole, he can do so many things for you. He's so dangerous.\\" Kemp, with a single and a walk, became the first Dodger to reach base twice in an All-Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996. Kemp hit his 30th home run of the season on August 26, and in the process became the second Dodger player of all time to hit at least 30 homers and steal at least 30 bases in the same season (30‚Äì30 club). The only other one was Ra√∫l Mondes√≠ in the 1997 and 1999 seasons. He picked up his 40th stolen base on September 17, becoming the 18th Major Leaguer and first Dodger in history to hit at least 30 homers and steal at least 40 bases. Kemp also scored his 100th run of the season, making him just the 10th L.A. Dodger to score 100 runs and have 100 RBIs in a season, and the first since Jeff Kent in 2005. He hit his 35th home run on September 21, making him the 14th Major Leaguer (and first since Alfonso Soriano in 2006) to hit at least 35 home runs and steal at least 35 bases in a season. On September 20, the Dodgers announced Kemp was selected by his teammates as the recipient of the 2011 Roy Campanella Award, which is given annually to the Dodger player who best exemplifies the spirit and leadership of the late Roy Campanella. He also won the NL Player of the Week Award for the week of September 19‚Äì25, 2011 after he hit .423 (11 for 26) with nine runs scored and three home runs during that week. Kemp wound up hitting 39 home runs in 2011 with 126 RBIs, leading the league in both categories, the first Dodger to do so since Dolph Camilli in the 1941 season. He also led the league in runs scored (115), total bases (353), OPS+ (171), and WAR (10.0). He finished second in slugging percentage (.586), OPS (.986), extra base hits (76), and stolen bases (40, tied), and third in batting average (.324) and outfield assists (11). He also led the National League in power-speed number (39.5).Yearly League Leaders & Records for Power-Speed #  Baseball-Reference.com Kemp also extended his games played streak to 364 games, as he played in every game of the season. He was the first player to finish in the top two in both home runs and steals since Hank Aaron in the 1963 season.

Later, it was revealed that Braun had tested positive for elevated testosterone and baseball attempted to suspend him, but lost on appeal. A survey of baseball writers revealed that if the MVP vote was retaken, with knowledge of Braun's positive test, then Kemp would have won. Braun was eventually suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal. Kemp publicly stated that he believed Braun should be stripped of his MVP Award from that season. After the season, Kemp signed a franchise record 8-year, $160 million contract extension. After signing his extension, he predicted that he would become the first player in history to have a 50‚Äì50 season. 2012 Kemp started the 2012 season by winning the National League Player of the Week award for the opening weekend. He hit two home runs and drove in eight RBIs during the opening series against the San Diego Padres. He was also the first Dodger to record three consecutive multi-hit games to start the season since Adri√°n Beltr√© did it in the 2000 season. This was the third time he had won the award, and second consecutive as he had won it the final week of 2011 as well. On April 10, Kemp became the first LA Dodger to have an RBI in the first five games of the season since J. D. Drew in the 2006 season and, counting the end of the previous season, he had nine straight games with an RBI, tying Roy Campanella (1955 season) and Augie Galan (1944 season) for the Dodgers franchise record. Kemp also won the Player of the Week award for the second week of the season, which, combined with winning the award in the last week of 2011, made him the only player to ever win three consecutive awards. He was also only the second player to win the award twice to begin the season, the other being Tony Armas for the 1981 Athletics. Kemp hit 12‚Äì22 with 4 HRs and a 1.182 slugging percentage, leading the club to its best 10-game start since 1981. Kemp hit his 10th home run of the season on April 25, tying Gary Sheffield's club record for homers in April set in the 2000 season. He broke Sheffield's record with a walk-off homer against the Washington Nationals on April 28.Gurnick, Ken. (April 29, 2012) Kemp's walk-off homer caps Dodgers' rally. Losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com.

Kemp was placed on the disabled list on May 14 because of a hamstring injury, ending his streak of 399 consecutive games played, which was the longest in the majors at the time. After his DL stint, he promptly re-injured his hamstring two days later while running the bases, and returned to the DL. Despite missing about 2 months with injuries, Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As he was still on the disabled list, Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home Run Derby for the second straight year, hitting one home run in the Derby. Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13, after missing about two months with his hamstring injury. Kemp's injury woes continued as he crashed into the outfield wall at Coors Field in Colorado on August 28, and injured both his knee and his shoulder. He continued to play despite the injuries. He finished the season batting .303 with 23 home runs and 69 RBIs in 106 games. His 9 stolen bases were his fewest since his first season. After the season, Kemp underwent surgery on his sore shoulder to repair a torn labrum and some minor damage to his rotator cuff. He was told that he wouldn't be able to swing a bat again until January. 2013 Kemp recorded his 1,000th career hit on May 12, 2013, against the Miami Marlins. However, Kemp struggled out of the gate in 2013, subsequent to his shoulder surgery in the offseason. On May 27, Kemp went 0-for-5 with 4 strikeouts, and was booed heavily by the majority of the Dodgers crowd. Teammate Adri√°n Gonz√°lez said that Kemp was \\"trying too hard for the team and the fans.\\" On May 29, Kemp injured his right hamstring in a game. He left during the seventh inning, and did not return to the game. Kemp was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 30. He spent time rehabbing at Camelback Ranch, the Dodgers spring training home, and was close to returning when he suffered a setback on June 9. Kemp returned to the Dodgers on June 25, after missing 24 games. In that game, Kemp made a game-ending catch while reaching over his shoulder, robbing the Giants' Marco Scutaro of a hit. He returned to the disabled list on July 8, after experiencing pain in his surgically repaired shoulder. He returned from the DL again on July 21 against the Washington Nationals, and was 3 for 4 with a home run and a double in the game. However, he injured his ankle in a play at home plate in the ninth inning of the game. After initially expressing optimism that the injury was not serious, he again was placed on the 15-day DL on July 24. Reacting to criticism of his string of injuries, Kemp said: \\"I'm not made of glass.\\" Kemp's ankle injury took a lot longer to heal than had been expected, and the team reported that they hoped to get him back in September. However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated. A few days later, he experienced tightness in the same hamstring he had hurt earlier in the year, and the Dodgers shut him down indefinitely. He eventually rejoined the Dodgers lineup on September 17, and had four hits (including two doubles) in four at bats. He played regularly in an attempt to get his timing back before the playoffs. However, he was a late scratch from a game on September 28 because of soreness in his ankle. An MRI the following day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing bone in his ankle. Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems for the rest of his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone. He appeared in only 73 games in 2013, due to his various injuries. He hit .270 with 6 home runs and 33 RBIs, and a .395 slugging percentage. With the Dodgers crowded outfield situation, Kemp was the subject of much trade speculation after the season. His agent, Dave Stewart, publicly stated that he expected Kemp to be traded during the off-season. However, Stewart later remarked that the team had assured him that it would not be making such a trade. 2014 On September 19, 2014, Kemp homered on this swing in support of Clayton Kershaw's 20th victory. Recovering from various injuries, Kemp sat out most of spring training and only started playing in minor league rehab games after the Dodgers left for their season-opening series in Australia. He began the season on the disabled list, and rejoined the Dodgers for their home opener in April. Kemp struggled defensively in center field during the first couple of months of the season, a problem that came to a head after a particular bad series for him against the New York Mets in mid-May. Manager Don Mattingly was openly critical of his outfield play following the series. Immediately afterward, the Dodgers made Andre Ethier the starting center fielder, and informed Kemp that he would be moving to left field. However, he was kept out of the lineup for five straight games as he was learning the new position, and was vocally unhappy about it. After playing in left for several weeks, he was moved to right field, a position he had not played regularly since 2009. He was more comfortable in right which led to the Dodgers moving Yasiel Puig to center field. The last week of July, he hit five home runs in six games to win Player of the Week honors for the fifth time in his career. He also won Player of the Month for September, when he hit .322 with nine homers and 25 RBI. For the season, Kemp hit .287 with 25 homers and 89 RBI in 150 games. He was second among NL outfielders in errors, with seven.2014 National League Fielding Leaders  Baseball-Reference.com =San Diego Padres= San Diego Padres in 2015 On December 11, 2014, he was traded to the San Diego Padres along with Tim Federowicz and $32 million in cash for Joe Wieland, Yasmani Grandal, and Zach Eflin. The trade was not finalized until December 18 due to the Padres expressing some concerns over a physical which revealed Kemp had severe arthritis in both hips. The Padres attempted to renegotiate the deal after the physical but the Dodgers refused, and the deal was consummated as originally conceived. 2015-16 San Diego Padres in 2016 Kemp played his first game with the Padres during opening day on April 6, 2015, against his old team, the Dodgers. During that game, Kemp drove in the only 3 runs for the Padres, as the team lost to the Dodgers 6-3. On August 14, 2015, on the road against the Colorado Rockies, Kemp became the first player in the Padres' 7,444-game history to hit for the cycle. In the first inning, he hit a 2-run home run to center, followed by a single and a double. He finished with a triple to center field in the top of the 9th inning, scoring Yangervis Solarte from first. He finished the night 4-for-5.

Nickname Kemp's nickname is \\"The Bison.\\" During the second major league game of Kemp's career, on May 29, 2006, he stole second base in the fourth inning, after which Atlanta Braves television announcer Don Sutton said he looked \\"like a big buffalo running around the bases.\\" The observation was appropriate due to Kemp's imposing size ‚Äì the Dodgers' roster listed him at 6' 4\\" tall and 225 pounds ‚Äì and surprisingly fast foot-speed. The word \\"buffalo\\" was modified to \\"bison\\", by the commenter D4P on Jon Weisman's Dodgers blog, Dodger Thoughts, as it is a more proper term for the North American mammal to which the moniker refers. It wasn't until the next day when the starting lineup did not include Kemp that baseball writer Eric Enders, also commenting in Dodger Thoughts added the capitalized article in front of the animal, completing the nickname, writing \\"So much for looking forward to watching The Bison tonight.\\" The nickname also refers to Kemp's Oklahoma roots. The bison is the official state animal of Oklahoma.

He served as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Thorp assumed the position of chancellor on July 1, 2008, succeeding James Moeser, and, at age 43, was noted at the time as being among the youngest leaders of a university in the United States. At the time of his selection as chancellor, Thorp was the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and a Kenan Professor of chemistry at the university. Thorp is a 1986 graduate of UNC; he later earned a Ph.D in chemistry from California Institute of Technology, and was a postdoctoral associate at Yale University. In September 2012, Thorp announced his intention to resign effective 30 June 2013, and to return to teaching in the Chemistry department at UNC, following a scandal involving the NCAA. Shortly thereafter, in February 2013, he announced his decision to leave the University and take up the job of provost at Washington University in St. Louis. Thorp took over as provost on July 1, 2013, replacing Dr. Edward Macias. Thorp left Washington University St. Louis on July 15, 2019. On Monday, August 19th, 2019, Thorp was announced as the new editor-in-chief of the renowned Science Magazine. Early life and education Thorp's father, Herbert Holden \\"Herb\\" Thorp (d. 1996), was a native of Rocky Mount, North Carolina. He was an attorney who earned an undergraduate degree from UNC in 1954 and a law degree - also from UNC - in 1956. His mother, Olga \\"Bo\\" Thorp (n√©e Bernardin, b. 1933), a 1956 UNC graduate, is a native of Columbia, South Carolina; her parents were Italian immigrants who died when she was 15. Both of Thorp's parents were involved in creating Fayetteville Little Theater, now known as the Cape Fear Regional Theater, in 1962. Herb Thorp was its first president, and Bo Thorp was its creative director for 50 years until stepping down in April 2012. Thorp's parents moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1960, and Thorp was born there on August 16, 1964. He spent much of his youth involved with the theater, performing in productions led by his mother, and met his future wife, Patti Worden, in 1974 at the theater. He attended St. Patrick Catholic School, a private middle school. He is remembered as a good student who finished the algebra textbook by Thanksgiving, and a geometry book the following Easter. In the summer of 1981, at age 17, while studying guitar at Boston's Berklee College of Music, Thorp won first place and a $500 prize in a northeast regional competition to solve a Rubik's Cube puzzle. His motivation for entering the competition was to earn money to buy jazz records. Winning the competition also earned him a trip to the national competition, which was aired on the television program That's Incredible! He placed fifth in that national competition, and again won first place in a regional competition the following year, in Charlotte, North Carolina. After graduating from Terry Sanford High School in 1982, Thorp attended the only university he had applied to, the University of North Carolina. He was a pre-medical student initially, and later turned to chemistry and academia, earning a BS degree in 1986. He completed doctoral work in three years (instead of the normal five) at the California Institute of Technology in 1989, earning a Ph.D under Harry B. Gray at the age of 24. He completed post-doctoral work at Yale in 1990. In 1991, Thorp began teaching as an associate professor of chemistry at North Carolina State University. Research and entrepreneurship Thorp was awarded a Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1991 by the National Science Foundation, which provided $100,000 of research funding annually for five years. Later in 1991, Thorp was one of 20 people awarded a grant by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; the $500,000 fellowship was for research on compounds used in genetic therapy. Both grants were for research to develop cancer and AIDS drugs as alternatives to chemotherapy. In 1996, Thorp co- founded biotechnology company Alderaan Diagnostics, later renamed Xanthon, Inc., to commercialize a technology he co-developed. The technology involved using electricity to test compounds that could later become new drugs. It was intended to turn a process that previously took months into an electronic process that would instead take hours. In 2001, Thorp was recognized by Fortune Small Business as a Small Business Innovator for the work that led to the founding of the company. Xanthon raised several rounds of venture capital, totaling $25 million, before folding in 2002, after technical glitches had delayed release of its commercial product and it could not find further funding. In 2005, Thorp co-founded Viamet Pharmaceuticals, another biotechnology company, to develop treatments for cancer and other diseases. It raised $4 million in venture capital funding in 2007, and an additional $18 million in 2009. Thorp is no longer involved in operation of the company. Thorp is a member of the scientific advisory board of Ohmx, a biotechnology firm based on technology developed by his doctoral mentor, Harry B. Gray. He was previously a venture partner at Hatteras Venture Partners, co-founded by his brother Clay. He gave up that role after being named chancellor of UNC in 2008, and his equity stake in the firm was transferred to a blind trust. Thorp is a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. University of North Carolina Thorp returned to his alma mater in 1993 to teach, rising from visiting assistant professor to professor in six years. In 1998, he received a Tanner Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. In 2001, Thorp became the director of the Morehead Planetarium, part of UNC. That fall, he co-led a student focus group responsible for exploring and providing feedback on the University's consideration of a branch campus of the Kenan‚ÄìFlagler Business School in Qatar. In 2005, he was named a Kenan Professor and chair of the chemistry department of the College of Arts and Sciences. He led the 2005 committee that selected the book as recommended reading for that fall's incoming freshmen, Blood Done Sign My Name: A True Story, by North Carolina native Timothy B. Tyson. He became the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 2007, after a nationwide search. One year later, he was named chancellor of the University after being nominated by Erskine Bowles, president of the University of North Carolina System, and unanimously chosen by the Board of Governors. In 2013, Thorp resigned the position of Chancellor amid allegations of widespread academic fraud, which were later outlined in Wainstein Report. The Wainstein Report describes the findings of an independent investigation conducted by former federal prosecutor Kenneth Wainstein. It describes abuses spanning over 18 years, which included ‚Äúno-show‚Äù classes that had little to no faculty oversight. Approximately half of the enrollees in these classes were athletes. Music Beginning with his first theater appearance at age 3 in Carnival!, Thorp has been involved with many aspects of performance. He worked in lighting for productions at the theater company directed by his mother, and later took on the music. He took piano and guitar lessons and formed a garage band as a teenager. While doing post-doctoral work, he wrote some music for the Yale Cabaret and a musical production for the River Renaissance on the Cape Fear River. He has written several musicals and has played piano with his local church. He has also played with Equinox, a local jazz band. In 1998, Thorp was the musical director for a performance of The Sound of Music, in which his wife played Maria von Trapp, and as a result, missed the ceremony at which the Tanner award recipients were recognized. Awards and publications Thorp was named a Distinguished Young Alumnus in 2002 by the UNC General Alumni Association. In 2010, Thorp wrote a book on entrepreneurship called \\"Engines of Innovation\\". With his co-author Buck Goldstein, they insist that the world's biggest problems can be solved through innovation at large research universities. They also created a website to encourage innovation on college campuses. Personal Thorp has been married to the former Patti Worden, a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and Yale University, since 1991. They have two children. He has a younger brother, Clay, who is also a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In 1924 his father's regiment moved back to Tidworth Camp, Wiltshire until he was demobbed in 1927, and the Webb family moved to William Webb's native Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire. Leonard Webb attended Long Crendon County School until the age of 14 with the idea of trying for a place as a pilot in the RAF.

The relief work he and his staff faced was a monumental task of feeding tens of thousands of former prisoners, reducing the mortality rate and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Burying the bodies became an overwhelming task. The British forced SS guards to remove and inter the corpses in mass graves, but soon bulldozers were used to complete the task. =Post World War II= Later on in life, he was also the mayor of Thame from 1975 to 1979.

The extensions may be made from several materials including mink, silk, synthetic, human or horsehair. The main method of applying the extensions is by using a cyanoacrylate adhesive to apply the extension(s) to the natural lash 1-2 mm from the base of the natural eyelash, never making contact with the eyelid. History In 1879, James D. McCabe wrote The National Encyclop√¶dia of Business and Social Forms, where, in the section \\"Laws of Etiquette,\\" he stated that eyelashes could be lengthened by cutting the ends with a pair of scissors. Other beauty books, such as My Lady's Dressing Room (1892) by Baronne Staffe and Beauty's Aids or How to be Beautiful (1901) by Countess C also state that the trimming of eyelashes along with the use of the pomade Trikogene benefit eyelash growth. Countess C also suggested that eyelashes can be given extra length and strength by washing them every evening with a mixture of water and walnut leaves. In 1882, Henry Labouch√®re of Truth reported that \\"Parisians have found out how to make false eyelashes\\" by having hair sewn into the eyelids. A similar report appeared in the July 6, 1899 edition of The Dundee Courier which described the painful method for elongating the lashes. The headline of which read, \\"Irresistible Ey es May Be Had by Transplanting the Hair.\\" The article explained how the procedure achieved longer lashes by having hair from the head sewn into the eyelids. In 1902, German-born hair specialist and noted inventor Charles Nessler, (aka Karl Nessler or Charles Nestle) patented \\" A New or Improved Method of and Means for the Manufacture of Artificial Eyebrows, Eyelashes and the like\\" in the United Kingdom.A New or Improved Method of and Means for the Manufacture of Artificial Eyebrows, Eyelashes and the like. British patent GB000190218723A, submitted August 26, 1902, approved November 6, 1902. By 1903, he began selling artificial eyelashes at his London salon on Great Castle Street. He used the profits from his sales to fund his next invention, the permanent wave machine. A permanent wave machine was commonly called a perm that involves the use of heat and/or chemicals to break and reform the cross-linking bonds of the hair structure. In 1911, a Canadian woman named Anna Taylor patented false eyelashes in the United States. Taylor's false eyelashes were designed using a crescent-shaped, strip of fabric. the fabric had tiny pieces of hair placed on them.ARTIFICIAL EYELASH. Anna Taylor, Ottawa. Ontario. Canada. Serial No. 607,810. US994619. Filed February 10, 1911. Another noted inventor of eyelash extensions is Maksymilian Faktorowicz, a Polish beauty guru and businessman, who founded the company Max Factor. In 1916, while making his film Intolerance, director D.W. Griffith wanted actress Seena Owen to have lashes \\"that brushed her cheeks, to make her eyes shine larger than life.\\" The false eyelashes which were made from human hair was specifically woven piece by piece by a local wig maker. The eyelashes were adhered using spirit gum, commonly used for affixing wigs. One day Owen showed up to sit with her eyes swollen nearly shut, her costar Lillian Gish, wrote in her memoir. By the 1930s, false eyelashes were becoming more acceptable for the average woman to wear. This shift in cultural opinion was largely due to the influence of film actresses, that were seen wearing them on screen. Featured in Vogue, false eyelashes had officially become mainstream and given the \\"Vogue\\" stamp of approval. In the 1960s, false eyelashes became the centerpiece of makeup. During this era, eye makeup that gave women big doll- like eyes was very common. They achieved this look by applying false eyelashes on both the top and bottom eyelashes. Models like Twiggy, helped popularize this trend and is often associated with it. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can.\\" These included false eyelashes, which were among items the protestors called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. In 2008, Aesthetic Korea Co., Ltd. began to manufacture products as semi-permanent eyelashes became popular in Korea. Since then, several similar companies have started to set up, which has had a considerable impact on neighboring countries, including China and Japan. However, due to South Korea's annual rise in labor costs, many manufacturers have moved from South Korea to China or Vietnam. In 2014, Miami-based Katy Stoka, founder of One Two Cosmetics, invented the magnetic false lash as an alternative to those that utilize glue. Today magnetic eyelashes are becoming more and more common, with many mainstream brands like Ardell and To Glam, offering more affordable options. However, these are false eyelashes and not eyelash extensions.  Types and style of lashes  Originally false lashes were made of acrylic resin; however, over time the materials have improved and nowadays false lashes are made of a special plastic fiber called Polybutylene Terephthalate (PBT). PBT is heated and then molded into the desired lash shape. Lashes that are made from this material are strong and have a natural glossy sheen. Moreover, they also retain their curl better. False eyelashes and semi-permanent eyelash extensions both enhance the length and volume of eyelashes, although they differ in various ways. Classic lashes are a 1:1 ratio of one extension applied to one natural lash. Hybrid lashes are classic lashes and volume fan lashes mixed together. Volume lashes are 2-6 thin eyelash extensions that make a fan shape to allow for a look of full fluffy lashes. Mega volume lashes are 10 or more super-thin eyelash extensions. Pre-made fans are ready-made volume eyelash extensions. They are arranged on the sticker strip for easy pick-up and quick application. Hybrid Lashes - The hybrid set involves both classic individual eyelash extensions and volume fans mixed together for the ultimate in fluffy, textured lashes. Also referred to as a ‚Äòmixed set‚Äô, they offer a thicker, denser look than classic lashes, but without the uniformity and softness of a typical Russian volume set. = Temporary false lashes = Temporary false lashes are applied with temporary lash glue and are not designed to be worn when showering, sleeping or swimming. The lashes come as individuals, clusters, and most commonly, lash strips. The magnetic lashes work by placing the magnetic false lash between one's eyelashes, thereby sandwiching in natural eyelashes with the magnetic eyelashes. When using a glue method, you smear the glue on the false lash, let it settle in for 30 seconds and then press it against the top root of your eyelashes until the glue has dried enough.  Process  In the United States, eyelash extension services can range from $30 to $500, depending on: * The number and type of lashes being used * The skill level of the cosmetician orAesthetician * The venue where the extensions are applied Because an average person might have anywhere from one hundred to two hundred lashes per eye, it can take from one to three hours to attach a full, new set. The amount of lashes one can put on varies upon the existing natural eyelashes. Because we lose natural eyelashes every day the eyelash extensions usually last between 3‚Äì4 weeks and during that time period, natural lashes start falling out or thinning. Maintaining a full set of eyelashes requires a refill every 2‚Äì3 weeks or a partial set every four weeks. If done correctly, there should be no damage to the natural lashes. It is important to find a trained professional to preserve lash growth and reduce the chance of eye complications.  Training and certification  Professionals trained in Lash Artistry go by various titles including \\"Lash Technicians,\\" \\"Lash Artists,\\" and \\"Lash Stylists.\\" There are different companies that provide training and certification for a potential Eyelash Extensions Technicians. In the United States, each state individually regulates this industry. Some states require either a Cosmetology or Esthetician License and some states have a certificate or license just for Lash Technicians. In the UK, the Guild of Professional Beauty Therapists accredit courses for the safe application of semi-permanent individual eyelash extensions. The value of the course content can be judged by the number of CPD (Continued Professional Development) points out that the course is awarded.

Leadbeater played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club as a middle-order batsman from 1966 to 1979, although he preferred to open the innings.Williamson, Martin, Cricinfo Profile, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 26 September 2008. His promise went largely unfulfilled; his average of 25.34 in 147 first-class matches (the norm for a county cricketer of the period was around 30.00), scoring just one century.Ward, John (2005). Barrie Leadbeater: a profile, CricketArchive. Retrieved on 25 September 2008. The highlight of his playing career was a man- of-the-match winning 76 in the 1969 Gillette Cup Final, a match in which he was not expected to play. Leadbeater broke a finger in the County Championship game the day before, and would have been omitted had Geoffrey Boycott not suffered a worse injury. Leadbeater said: > \\"I almost forgot about the fact that I had a broken finger. Then when it > came to lunchtime, I was changing my clothing because of perspiration, and > ate my lunch in a jockstrap and left batting glove! I couldn‚Äôt get the glove > off because my finger had swollen. I can't get m' breath!\\" Leadbeater posted a top score of 90 in 106 one day games. Leadbeater was touted by Colin Cowdrey (amongst others) as a future Test match cricketer. However, batting lower down the order and a shin injury in 1970 meant that Leadbeater failed to score enough runs to impress the selectors. Leadbeater standing during his final first-class gameLeadbeater was to receive a benefit season from Yorkshire, but was released from the county the season before. This came as a surprise to Leadbeater, who had agreed to become the Second XI captain earlier in the season. This responsibility then went to Colin Johnson. Leadbeater was released from the county, finding out whilst in the local golf club. After being released from Yorkshire in 1983, Leadbeater immediately became a well-respected umpire on the first-class English circuit, umpiring four One Day Internationals during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Leadbeater was the third umpire in two Test matches, in 1993 and 2000. He umpired one further ODI ‚Äì seventeen years later at Trent Bridge in 2000. He retired from first- class umpiring at the mandatory age of 65 in September 2008, his final game being the match between his beloved Yorkshire and Somerset at North Marine Road, Scarborough.

The end of the ravine opens onto the North Saskatchewan River valley near the west end of Cloverdale on the opposite bank from downtown. Geography The creek begins in rural sloughs just south and east of Anthony Henday Drive (just south of its junction with Highway 14 and to the south-east of the Meadows community), and flows northward to an outfall near 92 Avenue between the neighborhoods of Strathcona and Bonnie Doon. Large segments of the creek were diverted into culverts during the 1960s and 1970s including a section that runs underneath the Davies/Coronet Industrial areas in the city's south-east. The lower reaches of the creek were diverted to a tunnel and concrete outfall structure north of 88th Avenue. The outfall emerges on the east bank of the North Saskatchewan River several meters above the river at approximately 95 Avenue. It is clearly visible from the James MacDonald Bridge. The city has begun public consultations on re-establishing the natural, surface flow (\\"daylighting\\") the downstream reach of Mill Creek.  History  The creek is named after a flour mill that was established by William Bird in 1878. The ravine was once home to part of the Edmonton, Yukon & Pacific Railway line. The line ran from the Canadian Pacific line at about 67 Avenue, across 99 Street, and down into Mill Creek Ravine. The rail-line went down through the ravine and out across the Low Level Bridge. The railway carried passengers and also served ravine industries -- a brickyard, a coal mine and two meat packing plants. Gainer's meat packing plant, a large scale meat packing facilit, was once located on the western edge of the ravine at 79 Avenue.Mill Creek Ravine pedestrian bridgeIn 1954 most of the railway through the ravine was abandoned, with only the section serving the meat packing plant, running from 79 Avenue to the CPR line, remaining in use. This section was abandoned by 1980. In the early 1980s the City of Edmonton converted the railway right of way betweeen 67 Avenue to the river, into a bicycle and walking path. Four wooden railway trestles were in use for the bicycle path for decades but three have now been replaced by modern bridges. The largest of these, the Mill Creek Trestle at 76 Avenue, was recognized as a Municipal Historic Resource in 2004 and still stands. In 1988 the Edmonton Historical Board erected a plaque in Mill Creek Park commemorating the railway. Local residents and nature enthusiasts fought successfully to prevent the City from installing a freeway through the ravine in the 1960s and 1970s.Bonnie Doon Community League, Memories of Bonnie Doon, 2019 The city has begun public consultations on re-establishing the natural, surface flow (\\"daylighting\\") the downstream reach of Mill Creek, north of 88th Avenue. The Mill Creek Outdoor Swimming Pool, located in the ravine at 8200 - 95A Street, is a popular summertime destination. Other nearby attractions include the Argyll Velodrome and BMX course and the Muttart Conservatory.  Notable events  On July 4, 1908, two people drowned in Mill Creek in isolated incidents, two hours apart from each other. Both drownings occurred at the same location, where the creek connected with the North Saskatchewan River. In 1996 Hisaya Okymia, a young boy, drowned in the creek, near the heritage trestle bridge.

It is from Millais's Aesthetic phase, when he was influenced by the work of Frederic Leighton and James McNeill Whistler. The painting depicts Esther, the Jewish wife of the Persian king Ahasuerus, as she prepares to enter the presence of her husband. As she is uninvited, she risks death, but does so to inform him of a plot against the Jews. Millais borrowed the Yellow Jacket, a gown given to General Gordon by the Chinese emperor after his defeat of the Taiping rebellion. In order to create a culturally unspecific effect, he turned it inside out, producing the abstract patterns visible in the painting.Millais, J.G., The Life and Letters of John Everett Millais, vol. 1, p. 384. Millais creates a dramatic visual effect by vivid contrasts of colours, setting the deep blue of the curtain against the yellow dress and the white columns. The minimising of the narrative aspect of the scene is also in line with the Aestheticist approach of the artists he is imitating and challenging. Esther is depicted adjusting pearls in her hair, as she prepares to place her crown on her head. This gesture is derived from paintings by Titian, whose techniques of colouring Millais imitates, along with the modelling of the face and the characteristic \\"Titian blonde\\" hair. This also compares with the lush red locks of Millais's earlier picture The Bridesmaid and with some contemporary works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Millais's biographer Marion Spielmann wrote that the painting was \\"the most modernly treated of Millais's early works...more consonant in its strong harmony with the audacious brilliancy of the present day [1898] than the more solid strength of forty years ago.\\"Speilmann, M, Millais and his Works, Blackwoods, 1898, p. 70.

The process of relearning how to walk is generally facilitated by Physiatrists or Rehabilitation medicine (PM&R;) consultants, physical therapists or physiotherapists, along with occupational therapists and other allied specialists. The most common cause for gait impairment is due to an injury of one or both legs. Gait training is not simply re-educating a patient on how to walk, but also includes an initial assessment of their gait cycle - Gait analysis, creation of a plan to address the problem, as well as teaching the patient on how to walk on different surfaces. Assistive devices and splints (orthosis) are often used in gait training, especially with those who have had surgery or an injury on their legs, but also with those who have balance or strength impairments as well. Gait training can be useful for people with the following conditions: *Amputation and after Prosthetic fitment *Osteoarthritis *Muscular dystrophy *Cerebral palsy *Stroke * Polio * Spinal cord injury *Parkinson's disease *Multiple sclerosis * Brain and spinal cord injuries * After surgery * Sports injury Although gait training with parallel bars, treadmills and support systems can be beneficial, the long-term aim of gait training is usually to reduce patients' dependence on such technology in order to walk more in their daily lives.  Gait Cycle  A gait cycle is defined as the progression of movements that occurs before one leg can return to a certain position during walking, or ambulation. One example of a full gait cycle is the period it takes for a foot to leave the ground until the same leaves the ground again. An understanding of a normal gait cycle and how it progresses is crucial to determining how much assistance a patient needs in order to return to functional ambulation. How long the gait cycle lasts depends on multiple factors, such as age, walking surface, and walking speed. Stance and swing phases of the right lower extremity gait cycle. The gait cycle is studied in two phases - Swing and stance phase. Each of these is further divided based on the positioning of the foot during these phases. Any gait training addressing a gait abnormality starts with a proper gait analysis. Observational, video, electromyographic and force plate techniques are few of them for assessing different parameters of gait. The cheapest way consists of observational combined with a video gait analysis, but more quantitative analysis can be done with integrating force vectors from a force plate and joint angle motion data incorporated through myoelectric sensors. Basically, kinetic and kinematic analysis are done for gait, the former consisting of the forces resulting in and from walking and latter consists of describing the visible components such as joint angles and distances covered. The gait consists of a series of repetitive movements of the whole body during locomotion and is studied considering that each gait cycle repeats over itself, which is almost correct considering normal subjects. The basic two phases are swing and stance phases, depending on whether the leg is free to swing or is in contact with the ground during the phase of gait studied. = Stance = The stance phase begins when the foot first makes contact with the ground (initial contact), and the weight of the body is borne by that limb. This phase is approximately 60% of the gait cycle and takes about 0.6 seconds to complete at a normal walking speed. Included in the stance phase are another four intervals, which are: load response, midstance, terminal stance, and preswing. Load response occurs when the body weight is borne by the single foot while the other foot begins to lift off the ground to start its swing phase. At midstance the body is supported fully by one leg and the other is no longer in contact with the ground. During terminal stance body weight is still supported on one leg, however the heel of that leg is beginning to lift off, and the center of gravity is in front of the foot still in contact with the ground. Finally at preswing the toe of the stance foot comes off the ground, and the weight is now transferred to the leg that was previously in the swing phase. = Swing = The swing phase occurs when the foot is not in contact with the ground, and constitutes about 40% of the gait cycle. There are three intervals to this phase: initial swing, midswing, and terminal swing. During initial swing, the foot is lifted off the floor. Next it moves into midswing, when the lower leg is straight and is perpendicular to the floor. Finally, at the terminal phase, the foot comes back into contact with the floor again and restarts the cycle beginning in initial contact of the stance phase.  Assistive Devices  Assistive devices (ADs) are given to patients who have difficulty maintaining a regular gait cycle or balance due to an injury to one or both of their legs. Other factors that would necessitate use of an AD include loss of perception in the legs, weakness of the legs, pain while walking, and a history of falling, among other indications. Not only does an AD provide extra support, it can also protect the injured leg and prevent it from being further aggravated due to weight bearing requirements. Different ADs are assigned to each patient depending on the severity of their condition and how much extra support they need provided. The following list presents the ADs from the least supportive to the most supportive. * Straight cane * Lofstrand crutches * Axillary crutches * Walkers * Parallel Bars  Weight Bearing Status  The type of gait that a patient is instructed in is based on their weight-bearing status, or how much of their body weight can be supported on their legs, coordination, and strength. There are different levels of weight-bearing status that is determined by the physician. The weight-bearing status of a patient generally changes as treatment progresses, but each progression needs to be approved by the physician. In many cases the easiest way to monitor a patient's weight bearing status is to use two scales, one under each foot, and to adjust the weight on each foot until the injured foot is supported the desired amount of weight. There are four different weight- bearing statuses. * Non-Weight Bearing (NWB) * Touch-Down Weight Bearing (TDWB) or Toe Touch Weight Bearing (TTWB) * Partial Weight Bearing (PWB) * Weight Bearing as Tolerated (WBAT) In NWB, the patient is not allowed to bear any weight on their injured leg. For TTWB, the amount of weight placed on the leg is defined in many ways, such as being approximately 20% of body weight, being 10 to 15 kg of weight, or being equal to or less than a weight that would crush eggshells. The portion of weight that is allowed to be borne on the injured leg in PWB is generally given as a percentage, such as 25% or 50%, however with a percentage the amount of weight that is supported changes as the person's weight changes as well. In WBAT the person is allowed to bear as much weight as pain allows, provided that the pain level does not become difficult to tolerate.  Gait Training Using Assistive Devices  There are multiple possible gait patterns that can be taught to the patient, and the one that is taught depends on the patient's capability and coordination. Parallel bars may be used to help with gait training, especially in the early stages when a patient is first learning or re-learning to walk. They involve a person walking between two handrails to support themselves, often with the therapist either helping to support the patient or physically moving the patient's legs. A gait belt is also utilized by the physical therapist in order to support the patient and to prevent them from falling or placing too much weight on the injured leg. = Two-Point Gait Pattern = The two-point gait pattern closely imitates a unaffected gait pattern, but includes the use of two crutches or two canes with one on either side of the body. In this pattern one crutch and the leg opposite to the crutch is moved in unison. For example if the right crutch is moved forward, then the left leg would advance with it. This gait pattern requires a high level of coordination and balance. Another two-point gait pattern is the modified two-point pattern. In this pattern there is only use of one crutch or cane on the side opposite to the injured leg, therefore there can not be any weight bearing restriction but is more used to provide extra balance. For this pattern the AD is move simultaneously with the injured leg. = Three-Point Gait Pattern = A three-point gait pattern can be used with patients who are NWB, however requires a much higher energy output and requires the patient to have good balance as well as strong upper limbs. A walker or two crutches must be used, as this pattern can not be performed with the use of a single cane. For this pattern the AD is advanced first, then the uninjured leg is moved up as the body is supported on the AD. The uninjured leg can either be brought up to be level with the AD (swing to) or brought up to be ahead of the AD (swing through). There is also a modified three-point gait pattern which can be used with patients who are PWB on their injured leg but full weight bearing (FWB) on their uninjured leg. This pattern also requires the use of 2 crutches or a walker, but is slower and more stable than the three-point gait pattern. In the modified pattern, the AD is advanced first, followed by the injured leg that has a PWB status, then finally the uninjured leg is moved up. Similarly, a four-point gait pattern has also been described. Just as in the three-point gait pattern the patient may use a swing to or a swing through pattern. = Stairs = Ascending Stairs  Two crutches or a cane can be used to ascending a flight of stairs. Although a walker may also be used, it is not recommended to be used to climb stairs longer than 2 or 3 steps. If the patient is using two crutches, then both crutches are held in one hand while the other hand grips the handrail. If there is no handrail or if it the two crutches can not be held in one hand, both crutches may be used without use of the handrail, although this method is not recommended for taking more than 2 or 3 steps. The order of events goes: uninjured foot, crutches or cane, injured foot. This process is repeated until the patient reaches the top of the stairs.  Descending Stairs  Just as in ascending stairs, two crutches or a cane may be used to descend a flight of stairs, and use of a walker is not recommended for climbing more than 2 or 3 steps. Both crutches should be used if the handrail is unstable or if the two crutches are not able to be held securely in one hand. The crutches or cane descends to the first step, then is followed by the injured leg, then finally the uninjured leg. This process is repeated until the bottom of the stairs is reached.  Other Applications  Body-weight support (BWS) systems or unweighting devices are starting to become more and more popular and have been the subject of much study. BWS systems can be used prior to the patient gaining adequate motor control or having sufficient strength to fully bear weight. The patient will wear a specialized trunk harness with adjustable straps, which attach to an overhead suspension system. The harness and its attachments support a certain amount of the patient‚Äôs body weight. Gait training techniques that utilize a BWS system appear to be promising in their ability to improve and possibly restore walking function, as demonstrated in individuals suffering from incomplete spinal cord injuries. A BWS system can be used on a treadmill or over ground for gait training. Body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) enables individuals with motor deficits that have rendered them incapable of completely supporting their own body weight to practice and experience locomotion at physiological speeds. Depending on the severity of the person's impairment, one or more physiotherapists may be present to assist in maintaining the patient‚Äôs appropriate posture and moving their legs through as kinematically physiological a gait pattern as possible. Recently, electromechanical devices such as the Hocoma Lokomat robot-driven gait orthosis have been introduced with the intention of reducing the physical labour demands on therapists. This system uses a computer-controlled exoskeleton to repeatedly and consistently guide lower-limb movements, making BWSTT a more feasible option for long-term and widespread use. Another device category, so-called end-effector gait trainers, activates the human gait pattern over moving foot-plates as opposed to an orthosis. The German society for Neurorehabilitation has recently recommended end-effector devices for gait rehabilitation after stroke due to current medical evidence. Treadmill training, with or without a body-weight support, is an emerging therapy and is being used with stroke patients to improve kinematic gait parameters. These patients often present with significant gait deviations and body weight- supported treadmill training can provide an intense repetitive practice of a more natural gait pattern. Literature continues to emerge examining the influence treadmill speed may have on the improvement of gait patterns and functional independence. Research has shown that a greater gain in independent walking ability is seen in hemiparetic stroke patients who participate in structured speed-dependent treadmill training compared to conventional training. Improvements in gait parameters included walking speed, cadence, stride length and Functional Ambulation Category scores.Functional Ambulation Category In speed-dependent treadmill training, belt speed is increased to the maximum-achievable speed the patient can maintain for 10 seconds without stumbling, followed by a period of recovery. If the patient were capable of maintaining the speed safely and comfortably during the 10-second bout, it would then be increased by 10% in the next attempt, following the same work and recovery procedures. Research has shown that this form of gait training demonstrates a more normal walking pattern without the compensatory movements commonly associated with stroke.

It is situated two miles (3 km) east of Boscastle just outside the village of Lesnewth. The building dates from the early 17th century, originally just a two-room house. It served as a pig sty for a significant period before being converted back into a cottage by Mike Raven, a BBC Radio 1 DJ. Raven bought the property in 1973, bringing it up to date and building an extension on the side. Penpol is a house built in the early 17th century, originally with just two rooms and a passage between them, probably a parlour and kitchen. It is largely build of granite rubble, with a slate roof. There is a 20th-century single story extension added to the house. The whole building was designated as a Grade II listed status on 20 July 1987. History Penpol was once home to Churton Fairman, better known as Mike Raven a well-known radio DJ who presented on various pirate radio stations and on BBC Radio 1. In 1973, Penpol lay derelict and had been used as a pig-house for many years. Fairman bought the building and converted it into a functioning cottage for himself and his wife, Mandy. There he turned his hand to sculpture, creating stone and wood carvings until he moved in 1980. The house Penpol is a Grade II listed cottage, having been added to the listed buildings register on 20 July, 1987 as a \\"particularly unspoilt seventeenth century house\\". The property has been considerably altered over the years but was originally erected in the mid-seventeenth century. It is built from rubble stone and has a cement-washed slated roof with gable ends and projecting chimney-stacks on each end. The front of the house has three nearly symmetrical windows and there are signs that there was a porch at one time. All the windows on the front of the house date from the twentieth century, with only the main door frame still with a seventeenth century lintel. At the rear, there are two seventeenth century lintels for windows, but one has been blocked up. The house has two rooms with a passage between, each heated by a fireplace with a granite lintel. The wall to the left of the passage is substantial but the partition to the right has been removed and the rear door blocked up. The beams supporting the upper floor are slightly chamferred and roughly cut. The left room has a twentieth century extension at the back. The staircase is probably twentieth century but occupies the same position as the original staircase. The upper floor and attic were not available for inspection at the time of listing.

With Willie Brown, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he is considered to be the originator or one of the earliest proficient exponents of Bump and run coverage, by which a defensive back impedes progress of the wide receiver by body contact, a style that was followed by later Oakland cornerbacks, such as Lester Hayes. The strategy appeared so successful in the eyes of NFL rule- makers that, to help the offense, the rules were changed in 1974, 1977, and 1978, with each rule change favoring the receiver over the defender (see Penalty (American football).) In 1974, the most severe rule change regarding pass receivers and defenders was enacted. This rule stipulated that a player could only make contact one time beyond 3 yards of the line of scrimmage. In 1977, the rule was amended to aid the pass receivers yet again. Starting that season, a defender could only make contact with a receiver one time overall, whether it be within 3 yards of the line of scrimmage or further downfield. In 1978, the rule was amended to aid the pass receivers yet again. Starting that season, a defender could make contact with a receiver only one time, and within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage. If the defender made contact with a receiver 6 yards or more from the line of scrimmage, it was now considered pass interference, even if the ball was not yet in the air.

Its notable products include the M601 turboprop. The company is based in Prague, Czech Republic. It has been a subsidiary of GE Aviation since July 2008. History Josef Walter founded the company in 1911 to make motorcycles and motor tricycles. It started to make automobiles in 1913: initially its own models, and later the Fiat 508, 514, 522 and 524 under licence. By 1926 Walter was Czechoslovakia's fourth-largest car maker by sales volume. In 1929 it still held fourth place, and production peaked at 1,498 cars for the year. By 1932 Walter production had slumped to 217 cars for the year. The figure recovered to 474 in 1933, but fell again to 102 in 1936 and to only 13 in 1937. Walter ceased car production in 1954. Walter Standard 6 From the early 1920s Walter also manufactured BMW aircraft engines under license, as well as its own family of air-cooled radial piston engines. In the 1930s Walter also made Bristol Jupiter, Mercury and Pegasus engines under licence, and then created its own in-line inverted air-cooled four- and six- cylinder engines, and in 1936 an air-cooled inverted V12. Walter aircraft engines were used by the air forces of 13 countries before World War II. During World War II Walter made Argus engines under license for Germany. Manufacture of the BMW 003 turbojet was put into preparation, but none were produced. The Walter plant survived the war intact and in 1946 the company was nationalized as Motorlet n.p. It made Soviet-licensed piston engines, and in 1952 began manufacturing the Walter M-05 jet engine. This was the Soviet Klimov VK-1 engine, based on the Rolls-Royce Nene, which powered the MiG-15, and was exported to many countries. The company made a series of Soviet- designed engines during the 1950s and 1960s, though piston engine production was closed and transferred to Avia in 1964. In 1995, the company was privatised as Walter a.s., and in 2005 the aviation engine division became Walter Aircraft Engines. In July 2006 it was acquired by the Czech investment firm, FF Invest. In March 2007 it was announced that Walter Aircraft Engines would merge with Avia's aero-engine division. The company was also merged with the precision casting company PCS. In September 2007, it was announced that the company's assets (which do not include its current facility in Prague) would be purchased by GE Aviation. The transaction was completed in July 2008. GE's interest in Walter has to do with the former's desire to compete more aggressively with Pratt & Whitney in the small turboprop market; Pratt & Whitney holds a commanding market share there. Walter builds the M601 engine, which GE hopes to refine and position against Pratt & Whitney's PT6. Walter currently builds 120 M601 engines per year; GE intends to increase production, by 2012, to 1,000 engines per year. However this was never attained, as in 2019, GE Aviation Czech is producing under 100 M601s and H-Series.

His name does not occur among the officers or generals of Alexander the Great (336-323 BC) during the lifetime of that monarch, though it is incidentally mentioned by Phylarchus in terms that would seem to imply that he then already occupied a distinguished position. The first occasion on which he appears in history is 315 BC, when he was appointed by his brother to the chief command of the forces dispatched to Cyprus, where they were destined to co-operate with the fleet of Seleucus, and with Nicocreon, king of Salamis. By their combined efforts, they soon reduced all the cities of Cyprus to subjection, with the exception of Citium; and that also, it would appear, must have ultimately submitted. Menelaus now remained in the island, which he governed with almost absolute authority, the petty princes of the several cities being deposed, imprisoned, or assassinated on the slightest symptom of disaffection. He still held the chief command in 306 BC, when Demetrius Poliorcetes arrived in Cyprus with a powerful fleet and army. Unable to contend with this formidable antagonist in the open field, Menelaus drew together all his forces, and shut himself up within the walls of Salamis, which he prepared to defend to the utmost. But having risked an action under the walls of the town, he was defeated with much loss; and Demetrius pressed the siege with his wonted vigour. Menelaus, however, succeeded in burning his battering engines; and by the most strenuous exertions, made good his defence until the arrival of Ptolemy himself, with a powerful fleet, to the relief of the island. In the great sea-fight that ensued, Menelaus sent a squadron of sixty ships to assist Ptolemy; but though these succeeded in forcing their way out of the harbour of Salamis, they came too late to retrieve the fortune of the day; and the total defeat of the Egyptian fleet having extinguished all his hopes of succour, he immediately afterwards surrendered the city of Salamis, with all his forces, both military and naval, into the hands of Demetrius. The conqueror, with characteristic magnanimity, sent him back to Egypt, accompanied by his friends, and carrying with him all his private property. In the 280s, he served as the first eponymous priest of the cult of Alexander.

The state's geological features have impacted the course of settlement, development, commerce and industry over the past four centuries. New Jersey has four distinct physiographic provinces. They are: (listed from the south to the north) the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province, the Piedmont Province, the Highlands Province, and the Ridge and Valley Province. Coastal Plain View north from the fire tower on Apple Pie Hill in Wharton State Forest, Tabernacle Township, New Jersey The largest province in the state encompasses the southeast part of the state below the fall zone from Trenton to Woodbridge. It contains a large wedge of unconsolidated sediments that have been deposited since the Cretaceous Period. These sediments continue off-shore as far as the continental shelf edge in the Atlantic Ocean. Topography is relatively flat with a few hills of erosion resistant sediments containing gravel or iron-sedimented sands.http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/enviroed/freedwn/psnjmap.pdf The province is divided further into three subprovinces. One is the Lowland section, which comprises flat, frequently inundated areas of tidal marshes, back bays, and barrier islands. This section generally follows the coastline, Delaware Bay, and Delaware River. The intermediate upland section comprises raised areas inland and is best suited for farming and other agriculture. The sands of the coastal plain have been mined for foundry sand and sand used for glass making. Finally, the upland section is home to the New Jersey Pine Barrens and Fort Dix. Glauconite is commonly found in this section, especially around Freehold Township, New Jersey.Orndorff, R.C., et al., (1998). Bedrock Geologic Map of Central and Southern New Jersey. United States Geological Survey, Scale 1:100,000. Piedmont A majority of the rocks in this province are a part of the Newark Supergroup. They include the Passaic Formation, the Lockatong Formation, the Stockton Formation, and the igneous rocks basalt and diabase. In New Jersey, more basalt flows are evident with several named formations including the Hook Mountain Basalt, the Preakness Basalt, and the Orange Mountain Basalt. Diabase is prominently displayed along the Hudson River in the Palisades Sill. These rocks were deposited during the rifting of Pangea during the Triassic and Jurassic Periods. Much of the northern segment of this region was glaciated and the resultant shaping help to form New York and Newark harbors. A small portion of the Pennsylvania Piedmont Highlands called the Trenton Prong extends into New Jersey through Trenton and are mostly Ediacaran and Cambrian aged rocks, that includes the Wissahickon Formation. The Manhattan schist exists in New Jersey, largely below New York harbor and in the vicinity of Bayonne and Jersey City. Highlands The Highland Province consists of the remnants of a billion year old mountain range that stretched from Newfoundland to Mexico on the edge of the North American continent and was created in the Grenville Orogeny. To the east of the Kittatinny Valley is the Highland province. A narrow fault of Hardyston Quartzite separates the Kittatinny Valley from the Highlands. Igneous and metamorphic rock from the Late Precambrian and Early Paleozoic era, make up the Highlands. Kittatinny and Franklin formation, along with Hardyston Quartzite are in the Highlands. The New Jersey Highlands geology is complicated due to complex patterns of folds, faults and intrusions. The Highland Province has the Wawayanda Mountains which has an elevation of 1448 at two peaks; Sparta Mountain, elevation 1232: Pochuck Mountain, elevation 1194, north of Lake Pochung; Hamburg Mountain, elevation 1495 east of Lake Wildwood. This section contains some the oldest rocks in New Jersey and is largely a mix of Pre-Cambrian granites and gneisses and lower Paleozoic clastic and carbonate rocks. The harder granites and gneisses produce steep sided hills and mountains since they are relatively resistant to erosion. There are two small klippes in the southern part of this province, the Jutland klippe south of Musconetcong Mountain and the Peapack klippe in southern Morris County. There are numerous active and abandoned mines in this area because of its rich mineral wealth. Iron, zinc, and marble were all important minerals mined from the New Jersey Highlands. Franklinite is a mineral first described at Sterling Hill Mine. Green Pond Mountain in Northern Passaic County and into western Morris County is a slice of Lower Cambrian to Middle Devonian rocks that are collected in a half graben and are detached from the Valley and Ridge sequence. These rocks have always been described separately from the rocks in the Valley and Ridge, but have been cross-correlated to those rocks. Ridge and Valley Looking east from the ridge of Kittatinny Mountain in Walpack Township The smallest province in the state, it is confined to the northwest corner of the state. The Kittatinny Valley is a part of the Great Appalachian Valley and contain some of the oldest rocks of the province known as the Matinsburg shale created during the Ordovician period. At the edge of this valley is the Kittatinny Ridge which is from 1500 feet to 1800 feet. The ridge goes in a northeast-southwest axis. Beyond this ridge, there are series of rolling hills and small ridges underlain by Silurian and Devonian aged rocks. The Kittatinny Ridge was created about four hundred million years ago when a small continent that was long and thin collided with proto North America. The strike caused folding and faulting which cause the Silurian Shawnagunk conglomerate which is made mostly of quartz, to rise out of a shallow sea. The heat from pressure caused the quartz to bend, and silica melted the quartz granules together along with other stone. Millions of years of erosion from rain, wind, snow, ice shaped the mountain and valley to its present configuration. The Wisconsin glacier which started to form around 21,000 BC and started to melt in 13,000 BC left boulder fields, end moraines and a terminal moraine which starts north of Belvidere and goes east to just south of Great Meadow and continues east to just north of Budd Lake and continues east to Denviile where it goes southeast toward Morristown and goes around the south end of Great Swamp. The Delaware River is deflected by ridges and travels generally southwest, along the strike of the upturned beds of shale sedimentary rock. The Delaware flows in a riverbed of glacial till in the Minisink and Walpack buried valleys, formed from erosion of softer bedrock, then passes through the Delaware Water Gap in Kittatinny Mountain, a continuation of Blue Mountain in Pennsylvania. The buried valleys extend beyond the riverbed and stretch across the state from Pennsylvania to New York. The limestones in this area also exhibit karst topography, including sinkholes and small caves.

(archived from the original on 2008-07-07) The immigration of Mexicans to the Philippines dates back to the Spanish period. Migration from Mexico has been important since the Spanish period and when the Philippines was trading with this country during the Viceroyalty of New Spain, Mexican mestizos mixed with the inhabitants of the islands, similar to the amount of Spain and the United States, numbering up many names of Spanish origin.Mexicana muerta en Filipinas Mexican Filipinos are ethnically diverse. They can be Mexicans of European descent, Indigenous peoples of Mexico, mixed-race or members of any other group. History Mexican immigration to the Philippines mainly occurred during the Hispanic period. Between 1565-1821, the Philippines were in fact administered from the Viceroyalty of New Spain's capital, Mexico City. During this period trans- Pacific trade brought many Mexicans and Spaniards to the Philippines as sailors, crew, prisoners, slaves, adventurers and soldiers\\"In 1637 the military force maintained in the islands consisted of one thousand seven hundred and two Spaniards and one hundred and forty Indians.\\" ~Memorial de D. Juan Grau y Monfalcon, Procurador General de las Islas Filipinas, Docs.

Similarly the route brought Filipinos, Filipino-born Spaniards and other southeast Asian groups to Mexico. The Philippines and Mexico were part of the Spanish Empire, an experience that left a deep imprint on both societies. Once Spain began its long period of decline in the nineteenth century, the Philippines and Mexico came under the sphere of influence of the emergent colossus of the north, the United States. According to an opinion piece in La Opini√≥n, it describes Mexico being a subordinate and fearful neighbor of American interventions and the Philippines a Spanish territory subject to the designs of Washington, D.C. During the Spanish period, the islands formed part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, coupled with other areas of the Pacific Ocean such as the Marianas and the Caroline Islands and during a short period in northern Taiwan. The Spaniards made trade routes from Mexico to the Philippines, the main ports of Mexico today to start their starting points were Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta with their final destination to Manila, the current capital of the Philippines. The Spanish ships on these routes were known as the Manila galleons. After the arrival of Mexican immigrants to the Philippines, they belonged to different ethnic groups such as indigenous and mestizos and Creoles who mainly mixed with the local population, which also increased the number of descendants with Spanish surnames. The construction of the military fort of Zamboanga counted with the help of these Mexican immigrants who had already settled in the islands. The Mexican legacy in the Philippines, consisting of marriage between the Spanish and the indigenous culture of origin (Maya and Nahuatl), has been marked in these islands. Many words that originated from Nahuatl, a language spoken by the descendants of the indigenous Mexican Aztecs, have influenced some local languages of the Philippines. After the spread of Catholicism in the islands, Mexican immigrants also brought the sacred image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, installing it in a temple of Intramuros in Manila, also declaring her patroness of the Philippines. Currently, the entrance of the Philippines in the APEC has strengthened ties with Spanish-speaking countries, including as Mexico, where the islands share a common history and other Spanish-speaking countries such as Peru and Chile.

It was serialized in Square Enix's Gangan Powered and later moved to Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan, when the magazine was closed. The motif of the story was inspired by Chinese wuxia drama and novels. The world view is rooted in Chinese folklore and history, as well as having an element of fantasy. Plot=Manga= A period piece, J≈´shin Enbu features Taitou, a young man who hates the empire that rules at the time, with his sister Laila as they learn of a mysterious power Taitou holds, unbeknownst to him. Taitou is the incarnation of a mysterious star that grants him a huge amount of power that he has yet to fully master. Joining them is Ryuukou, who has power similar to Taitou, just more honed. After Taitou's coming of age ceremony, which required him being beaten by Ryuukou, he is given the Kenkaranpu, described as a conqueror's sword, which Taitou is not even capable of drawing. Soon after, he and Laila are greeted by a man named Shimei, who wants to take the sword. After a quick exchange of blows, Shimei explains the source of Taitou's power - the star Hagun, one of the most powerful Hokushin-Tenkun. When Shimei uses his own sword's power to cause Laila to stop breathing, Taitou becomes so angry he releases Hagun's power, draws Kenkaranpu and pins Shimei to the wall by throwing the Kenkaranpu through his stomach. He then turns to Ryuukou and attacks. Despite his best efforts, Ryuukou cannot overcome Hagun's power. It is only a resuscitated Laila's intervention (along with a nasty head butt) that brings Taitou to his senses. However, they all soon learn that Shimei had escaped with the sword. At midnight, Taitou sneaks out to recover the sword. As he leaves, Ryuukou and Laila quickly join him on his journey. As they travel, they come to the canal town of Jousei. While they're there, Ryuukou attempts to teach Taitou how to control his ki, and with it, the power of his star. When you don't refine and focus the power, it exits the body any way it can, leaving the body covered with cuts from the power exiting. But Taito is too impatient to learn Ryuukou's way, who was trained by monks. The three are living in an inn in the refugee section of town, right next to the canal. It starts raining hard, and Ryuukou worries about the levee walls holding. At the inn, the three meet Koyou, a handsome ship captain, who does ladies make-up for entertainment. As they talk, the city officials close the inner canal gates to protect their harbor, not caring that it puts the refugee section in danger of being flooded. When the refugees try to enter the city for safety, they are refused access, even as the levee bursts right into the section. Taitou tells Ryuukou to break the flood gates to release the pressure, because he can control his ki. He does so, but is still dangling over the water when a downed tree hits a bridge, breaks it, and heads towards him. Taitou, in a reckless attempt to save his friend, leaps from the gate walls and smashes the debris, unfortunately forgetting to attach himself to something, and so falls into the canal. Ryuukou jumps in after him, and pulls him onto a floating piece of wood, where he then starts to berate him for almost sacrificing himself, saying he should have left him. Taitou is explaining that he could not abandon a friend like that, when their piece of wood hits an obstruction and disintegrates. Taitou starts to drown, and Ryuukou finds the current too strong for him to carry both of them as he is, and Taitou glimpses the symbol of a star on his chest before he falls unconscious. Later, Taitou finds out that Laila had found Koyou, the man from the inn, and had gotten his help in saving the two. He then rounds on Ryuukou, asking why he had been hiding that he was one of the Hokushin-Tenkun. Ryuukou just felt like the right time never came up, revealing the his star is \\"Bukyoku\\", the star right next to \\"Hagun\\". They are joined by Laila and Koyou, who directs their attention to his \\"modest ship\\", a massive barge he calls \\"Touga\\". He then loads all the refugees onto it, promising to take care of them. By this time Shimei has reached the capital and Shogun Kiero Hakuhou, who he then presents with the Kenkaranpu. Much of the storyline revolves around the revelations of an ancient prophecy concerning the Stars, which relate to the seven stars in the Big Dipper constellation, being given human form at a time of crisis for humanity. Although all seven of the Stars are superhuman fighters, two of them are known as the Noble Spirits, and according to destiny will fight each other to take control of the Empire. As the various Stars identities are revealed, they appear to ally themselves to either Keiro (whose star is Tonrou) or Taitou (whose star is Hagun). Because of the cruelty of the previous rulers of the Empire, and many corrupt officials still in power, Keiro has chosen to act with the prophecy and try to become Emperor himself. Taitou, although briefly considering this, ultimately rejects the prophecy entirely, choosing to forge his own destiny. The other Stars are Ryuukou, who grew up in the same village as Taitou; Hosei, who trained under a strong woman warrior who had learned much about the prophecy of the Stars; Koyou, who spends most of the story on his barge ship; Rinmei, a woman who loves Ryuukou and has anger management issues; and Shoukakou, a mysterious man in the capital city who at first seems to be working for Keiro. The story also involves dealing with grief, loss, responsibility, and starting over even when you feel the weight of your sins means you cannot take another step. =Anime= In the anime, Shogun/General Keiro under cover of dark tries to steal the Kenkaranpu from Tian Long temple. In doing this he massacres dozens of the ascetic monks that were living out their vows of protection and love behind the Tian Long temple's walls, but also, Keiro is confronted by the plucky Taito for the first of their 4 face offs over the 26 episodes. There are some differences between the plot of the manga and the anime, including which characters live or die, who fights when and where, and how the final battles play out. For example, in the anime, Keiro actually manages to absorb Shimei inside of himself, and gains supernatural powers, controlling Ryuukou against his will and turning some people into demons. Although the overall impact of the battle between Keiro and Taitou is largely the same in both the manga and the anime, the fine details are not. Also, in the manga, there appears to be seven years between the end of the battle between Keiro and Taitou and the final scenes. In the anime, there's an unspecified time skip, but the characters don't appear to have aged significantly, so it wouldn't seem to be as long as seven years. Characters=The Two Celestial Deities (‰∫åÂ§©Á•ûÂ∞ä)= ; : :The main protagonist. A 16-year-old youth. He is very headstrong, does not like losing, and though reckless is quite a skilled fighter. He opposes the officials in order to protect the people and his companions. He also has a habit of repeating himself when flustered or angry. The relationship he has with his sister Laila (not related by blood) changes as they both begin to get feelings for one another; when out of control only she can control him back to normal. :He has the Hokushin-Tenkun mark of Alkaid, Hagun (Á†¥Ëªç), on his right shoulder which mean he is the incarnation of the war and celestial god alkaid. He is also part of the law enforcing organization, Seiryutou (ÈùíÈæçÂÖö, Blue Dragon Group), which is based at Lotus Temple at Taishan. The group take care of events from rebel raids to violence inflicted by officials. The group overestimated their strength and took on Keirou and in the end lost most of their people. Tait≈ç, seeking revenge for his comrades, left on a journey to train up. :In the manga, the Kenkaranpu (Ë≥¢ÂòâÁàõËàû) was to be given to Tait≈ç on his coming of age ceremony by Sonnei but it was seized by Shimei, turning the journey to that of the recovery of the sword. In the anime, the sword was taken by Keir≈ç after a fight between Tait≈ç and the general during the former's invasion of the temple. :Tait≈ç meets the emperor later on in the anime and it is revealed that Tait≈ç is the older brother of the emperor and that they were separated because Tait≈ç bore the 'Hagun' mark. ; : :35 years old. He has the Hokushin-Tenkun mark of Dubhe, Tonr≈ç (Ë≤™Áãº), on his left shoulder which means that he is the incarnation of the war and celestial god dubhe. A general of the imperial army and the leader of the Black Wolf Party. He aims to be the emperor of the Ken Empire. :In the anime, he forced his way into Lotus Temple with his troops to retrieve the sacred sword Kenkaranpu. It is said that the one who unsheathe it will get the right to rule as Emperor. To get the sword many monks and Seiryutou members were killed. While in both the anime and the manga, Keirou chooses to kill everyone in the Empire, in the manga it is because he believes the prophecy means that mankind must die, whereas in the anime, he becomes more or less a demon himself and kills because he feels he is not bound to human laws or mercy. =The Five Divine Warriors (‰∫îÁ•ûÈóòÂ£´)= ; : :The 18-year-old bearer of the Mizar, Bukyoku (Ê≠¶Êõ≤), mark. Uses a staff in battle. He is the adopted son of a master from another temple of the Rikka Sect, Ryuushou Moukan. His original name is Keik≈ç and Keir≈ç is his real father. Ry≈´k≈ç is a serious person who expects highly from himself. He has a bad sense of direction. The Bukyoku mark is at his right pectoral. He is in love with Rinmei. :In chapter 9 of the Manga, Ry≈´k≈ç faces off against Keir≈ç to allow Tait≈ç, who is not match for Keir≈ç at this time, a chance to escape. After the battle with Keir≈ç, Ry≈´k≈ç meets up with Tait≈ç, in chapter 10, and has apparently switched his support from the Hagun (Tait≈ç) to the Tonr≈ç (Keir≈ç) and supports his campaign to usurp the Emperor. Later, his support is questioned by Keir≈ç, so as a test, Keir≈ç ordered Ry≈´k≈ç to carry out the death sentence of his adoptive father, Ryuushou Moukan. After doing so, Ry≈´k≈ç has a crisis of loyalty and seems to fall into a bottomless despair. ; : :The 17-year-old bearer of the Phecda, Rokuson (Á¶ÑÂ≠ò), mark. The archer of the group, a carefree and hot-headed person. He is attracted to Laila. The Rokuson mark is at the back of his right hand. His weapon is the Soutenkyuu, a bladed bow that can also be divided and used as twin bladed swords. :In the manga, from chapter 10‚Äì14, H≈çsei becomes the main support for Tait≈ç after they both believe that Ry≈´k≈ç is dead and after Ry≈´k≈ç abandons them for his father, Keir≈ç. In chapter 14, H≈çsei finally gets revenge for his master by defeating and \\"killing\\" Shimei, but is mortally wounded in the battle. He dies in Tait≈ç's arms. Shimei then takes control of his corpse to try to kill Laila, and Laila is forced to destroy the corpse, apologizing to H≈çsei as she does so. Years later, Laila wears his necklace and still visits his grave. :In the anime, however, Hosei is not killed by Shimei, and witnesses Taitou's battle with Keirou, and is shown talking with Laila at the end of the series while looking at the multitude of stars above their village home. ; : :The 22-year- old bearer of the Merak, Monkoku (ÊñáÊõ≤), mark. The leader of a group of sea bandits. Although a big, lively and rough person, he has skillful fingers and has interest in cooking and make-up. He wields an eight-section staff. He also seems to have a paralyzing fear of heights. The Monkoku mark is at his neck. ; : :The 24-year-old bearer of the Alioth, Renj≈ç (ÂªâË≤û), mark. He is the teacher of the current emperor Taigatei. Usually seen smiling and basically a calm person, yet under that exterior he is actually a tactician who resorts to any means to keep the Ken Empire going. Any action he undertakes is usually for the good of the Ken Empire. The Renjou mark is at his right palm. In the anime, it is revealed that he is actually afflicted with some sort of fatal disease, and expects to die soon. But in the manga, he believes that both Hagun and Tonrou are disastrous for humankind, and works for peace. ; : :The 20-year-old bearer of the Megrez, Komon (Â∑®ÈñÄ), mark. In love with Ryuukou but she hates his unsociable attitude. She cooks for the temple Ry≈´k≈ç is from. She is concerned that she looks older than her age. She is the type that becomes scary when angry. The Komon mark is at her right thigh. In the anime, she fights with Ryuukou, but in the manga, she does not go to the final battle, because she is pregnant with Ryuukou's son. =Others= ; : :14 years old. Tait≈ç's little sister (not by blood). She is the daughter of S≈çei, the leader of Seiryut≈ç. She is often seen quarreling with Tait≈ç and has generally won every time they have quarrelled. The only person who can stop Tait≈ç when he acts recklessly. After her father's death, in chapter 11 of the manga, She has a moment of crisis, aided by Shimei and his sword, in which she blames Taitou, until she realizes later that he is not to blame for the deaths that are happening around her. She has to fight Shimei when he possesses Housei's corpse, and in the battle it is revealed she is a descendant of the shaman who controlled the stars- hence her ability to control Taito. She uses this power to defeat Shimei for good. Later, she becomes chief of the village in her father's stead. ; : :The 16-year-old Emperor of the Ken Empire. Good-hearted and has no self thought. He would like to change the Empire into a better place, yet he does not have much power - in reality members of his court govern the Empire. He and Tait≈ç are twins, with Taigatei being the younger brother. The brothers were separated when they were about three, but while Taitou remembers that he was taken away from his original parents and brother, neither he nor Taigatei are aware of their relationship until others reveal it to them. He promises to Taitou to become a good Emperor who helps the people of his empire. ; : :A follower of Keir≈ç. One of the primary antagonists, he is a sorcerer who manipulates many people from behind the scenes all for the purpose of seeing \\"people die.\\" He holds the demon sword of all seeing eye, Banshoushimei (Ëê¨Ë©≥Âè≤Êòé) and is able to use spells. \\"Shimei\\" is who ever holds the Banshoushimei. He has had three separate bodies in the Manga. He possesses the body of H≈çsei Meitoku in an attempt to kill Laila Seiren and take her body, but Laila destroys him for good, cutting the Banshoushimei in half. ; : :Tait≈ç's and Laila's father. A former member of the Imperial Army, now leader of Seiryutou. After having roamed the Empire, his master Sonnei asked him to settle down at Lotus Temple. He is killed by Shimei. ; : :The elderly High priest of Lotus Temple (the headquarters of the Rikka Sect[ÂÖ≠‰ºΩÂÆó]) and former master of Souei. A master of the gaiden technique (Â§ñ‰ºùÊ≥ï) who is well known in the Empire. Has a weakness for women. ; : :A subordinate of Keir≈ç. A quiet and unsociable person. In the anime, he is Taki's real father, and is killed while protecting Taki and Taigatei from Keiro. In the manga, he survives. ; : :Keir≈ç's adopted daughter who entered the Court as a princess candidate. A quiet and sweet-natured girl. She and Taigatei are in love and they eventually marry. ; : :Originally from a foreign country but stowaway to the Ken Empire. She was then picked up by Keirou and now serves him loyally. Now a court lady attached to the Emperor where she guides the weak-willed Emperor to follow Keirou's wishes. She distrusts Ryuukou and Sh≈çkaku, despite their claims to serve Keirou. In the anime, Sh≈çkaku deducts, apparently correctly, that she is in love with Keirou. ; : :Hosei's teacher who also subsequently taught Tait≈ç the different ways of using Soukih≈ç, Gaiden for weaponry and Naiden for strengthening the human body. Extremely knowledgeable and well read. Killed in a confrontation with Shimei. Shimei addressed her as Chisenkyuu (Êô∫Ê≥âÁéñ), indicating some kind of prior relationship. In Volume 5, it seems that Koei was a disciple of Shimei when the spirit lived inside a woman's body, and Shimei tried to kill Koei then before assuming the body he inhabits for most of the series. ;Mo Han : Production The origins of Hero Tales came from a work by doujin group \\"Dennou Sanzoku Bukando\\"(ÈõªËÑ≥Â±±Ë≥äÊ≠¶Êº¢Â†Ç) called \\"Shishi Juushin Enbu\\"(ÁçÖÂ≠êÁç£Á•ûÊºîÊ≠¶).

Self-Changing Gears designed, built and licensed transmissions for various applications including light and heavy road vehicles, military, marine, and rail vehicles as well as motor racing cars. Ownership changes Following the death of Walter Wilson in 1957, his son A.Gordon Wilson took over the running of the company until his retirement in 1965. The original company Improved Gears Ltd was incorporated on 28 December 1928, and this later became Self-Changing Gears (SCG). The company moved a number of times in the early years, and in 1938 settled in premises at Lythalls Lane, Coventry. During the war, additional premises were used at Burbage, Leicestershire. In 1935, Siddeley sold his interests in Armstrong Siddeley (including Self-Changing Gears) to Hawker Aircraft forming Hawker- Siddeley. In 1951 Leyland Motors bought into the company, resulting in each party owning one-third of the company, and in 1957 Leyland bought-out Hawker- Siddeley's shares in the company, thereby gaining control. Railway applications Many of British Railways' first generation diesel multiple units and shunting locomotives had gearboxes made by Self-Changing Gears. Examples include British Rail Class 100, 03 and 04; some of these are still in use on heritage railways. The name Self-Changing Gears is sometimes confusing: the gearboxes are not fully automatic, selection of gear ratio remains a manual choice, but the gear-changing and any clutch control needed is automated. The gearboxes were used in conjunction with a fluid coupling so no clutch pedal was needed. Gearboxes installed in locomotives built by the Vulcan Foundry for the Drewry Car Company were designated \\"Wilson- Drewry\\".http://www.enuii.com/vulcan_foundry/photographs/Pre%20EE%20Diesel/vulcan%20drewry%200-6-0%20diesel%20shunter.pdf Bus applications The bus manufacturing industry was a major customer of the company. Buses on city work need to start and stop every minute or less, and the effort required with a manual gearbox was substantial. In addition, for most of the period when these transmissions were dominant buses still had unassisted steering, and the overall effort needed without assistance was fatiguing. From about 1935 to 1960, buses by AEC, Daimler, and sometimes Bristol, Guy and Leyland offered Preselector gearboxes, either as an option or as standard. London buses invariably used this transmission, along with other cities. Country area buses still commonly retained manual transmissions as they did not have the requirement of constant stopping and starting at bus stops. The London specification included compressed air operation of the change-gear pedal, where others used unassisted operation. Around 1960, the bus industry was changing from traditional vehicles with engine at the front and driver in a small separate cabin alongside, to entrance at the front alongside the driver, and the engine and gearbox remotely mounted under the floor or at the rear. SCG devised the semi-automatic gearbox, under their brand name \\"Pneumocyclic\\" as an advance. It had the same gearbox principle, but instead of pre-selecting a gear and then separately operating a change- gear pedal, both functions were combined and operated from a small lever alongside the steering wheel, the driver merely moving this to the next gear and the transmission responding accordingly. The mechanism was operated either by air pressure or low-voltage electrics, although the physical gearshifting in the gearbox was nearly always by air pressure, (some vehicles used high pressure hydraulics, notably BMMO vehicles). This style of transmission was also widespread in UK buses, from a range of manufacturers, until different types came onto the market in the 1980s. A further advance was the fully automatic gearbox, which still used the same principles but shifted gears automatically. This was pioneered on the AEC Routemaster, and later spread, although not widely, to other vehicle types.

The members of this genus, known as the butterfly orchids or fringed orchids, were previously included in the genus Orchis, which is a close relative (along with the genus Habenaria). They are distributed throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are terrestrial and have tubercules.  Etymology  Louis Claude Richard chose the name Platanthera for this genus; it comes from the Greek and means \\"broad or wide anther,\\" referring to the separation of the base of the pollinia in the type species of the genus. Richard felt that this characteristic distinguished the genus Platanthera from both the genus Orchis and the genus Habenaria. However, today the defining characteristics of the genus are generally accepted to be the absence of both stigmatic processes (typical in Habenaria) and ovoid root-tuberoids (characteristic of both Habenaria and Orchis). Still, P. nivea, P. clavellata and P. integra all have stigmatic processes, showing the limitations of morphological characteristics in defining this clade.  Description and habitat  Species of Platanthera are perennial terrestrial herbs, erect in habit. The roots are fasciculate and typically fleshy and slender, although they may be somewhat tuberous; if tuberous they are lanceolate to fusiform and not ovoid. The leaves are generally fleshy and range from oblong or ovoid to lanceolate. Leaf shape often varies with the lower leaves more ovoid in shape, progressively becoming more lanceolate as they progress up the scape; floral bracts, if present, are lanceolate to linear. The base of the leaves typically sheathes the stem. The inflorescence is terminal and solitary, and the flowers form a cylindrical spike that ranges from sparse to dense. The flowers are typically resupinate, and often showy and colorful. The petals and labellum are typically entire, but in a number of North American species they may be fringed or edentate; in this group of species the labellum is also often deeply lobed or auricuate. The seed capsules are cylindrical and ridged. These terrestrial orchids develop in a wide range of soil types and habitats, from strongly basic soils to deeply acidic bog soils, from forest openings and in clearings within the forest to open tundra. In all cases they require moist soils and are not found in dry or desert locations. While their fleshy tuberculous roots can store water, allowing them to survive temporary drought, they cannot survived extended drought. Platanthera may be distinguished from Orchis and Habenaria by the absence of stigmatic processes, and the absence of ovoid roots. Some Platanthera species are pollinated by mosquitoes.  Species  Many species can cross-fertilise, resulting in great morphological variety and complicating classification. The type species is Platanthera bifolia. More than 400 species, subspecies, and varieties have been described, and a 1997 study estimated around 85 species were clearly defined, though these quantities vary considerably between evolving classification systems, and naturally change as specimens are reanalyzed or newly acquired. \\"Species of Platanthera occur in North America, Asia, Europe, North Africa, Borneo, and Sarawak. Major centers of diversity are found in North America and East Asia.\\" These include 52 species from temperate Asian countries (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan), 13 species from tropical Asian countries (Burma, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines), 37 species from North America north of Mexico, 7 species from Europe.

REs may be classified as thermal (lower energy) or relativistic. The study of runaway electrons is thought to be fundamental to our understanding of High-Energy Atmospheric Physics. They are also seen in tokamak fusion devices, where they can damage the reactors. Lightning Runaway electrons are the core element of the runaway breakdown based theory of lightning propagation. Since C.T.R. Wilson's work in 1925, research has been conducted to study the possibility of runaway electrons, cosmic ray based or otherwise, initiating the processes required to generate lightning. Extraterrestrial Occurrence Electron runaway based lightning may be occurring on the four jovian planets in addition to earth. Simulated studies predict runaway breakdown processes are likely to occur on these gaseous planets far more easily on earth, as the threshold for runaway breakdown to begin is far smaller. High Energy Plasma The runaway electron phenomenon has been observed in high energy plasmas. They can pose a threat to machines and experiments in which these plasmas exist, including ITER. Several studies exist examining the properties of runaway electrons in these environments (tokamak), searching to better suppress the detrimental effects of these unwanted runaway electrons. Computer and Numerical Simulations This highly complex phenomenon has proved difficult to model with traditional systems, but has been modelled in part with the world's most powerful supercomputer.

For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from Mexico and the Philippines as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon assisting Spain in its trade between Asia and the Americas. Some of these sailors never returned to the Philippines. Most settled in and integrated into the Mexican society. In the late 19th and early 20th century some Filipinos came to Mexico as refugees from Spain during Francisco Franco‚Äôs dictatorship. These Filipinos were descendants of Filipino and Filipino mestizo settlers who entered Spain after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Smaller waves of Filipino migration to Mexico took place in the late 19th and 20th centuries after the Philippines was annexed by the U.S. during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898‚Äì1900. A number of Filipino farm laborers and fishermen arrived to work in the Mexican west coast. These areas included the Baja California, Sonora and Sinaloa, while some had awaited to enter the United States to reunite with family members in Filipino American communities in California, and elsewhere. Mexican immigration law continues to grant special status for Filipinos. Their descendants are found in communities particularly in the state of Guerrero, and Colima. Most of these individuals are mixed blood peoples, and trace half or a quarter of their ancestry and origin back to the Philippines during the Manila-Acapulco Galleon period.

It is a desirable district, with comparatively quiet streets and many well-preserved commercial and residential buildings dating from the 18th century and earlier. Housing there is expensive relative to the rest of the city. The Wiehre is bordered on the west by the Rheintalbahn Karlsruhe-Basel, on the north by the Dreisam, on the east by the Waldsee (another district of Freiburg), and on the south by a wood known as the Sternwald am Bromberg and the village of G√ºnterstal (which also belongs to Freiburg). The G√ºnterstal Landstrasse, which begins at the St. Martin's Gate in the ancient town wall, bisects the Wiehre. The Wiehre itself consists of 421 Oberwiehre, 422 Mittelwiehre, 423 Unterwiehre-Nord and 424 Unterwiehre-S√ºd. History The name \\"Wiehre\\" comes from \\"Wehre\\", which referred to the dikes erected near the Dreisam, in the area later known as the Oberwiehre, in order to gain arable land from the floodplain. ‚ÄúDie Wiehre‚Äù is mentioned as a placename in a communication (1008 C.E.) from King Heinrich II to the Bishop of Basel. In this area was located the village of Adelshausen, which because of its exposed position before the city walls was frequently plundered and finally destroyed altogether. The Wiehre was already incorporated into the rapidly growing city of Freiburg in 1825. In addition to agricultural buildings, a small commercial and artisans‚Äô district grew along the Dreisam, along with a small brewery. With the economic upturn of the Archduchy of Baden in the middle of the 19th century, as a rising middle and upper-middle class required space for homes, the Wiehre began to develop into a posh residential district. Among the residents were pensioners from North Baden and the Ruhr, which at that time was much afflicted with cholera epidemics, and the wealthy established second homes in Freiburg, where the water was comparatively well protected. These influential residents are responsible for the spur line (H√∂llentalbahn) which bisects the district. The train was also used by the Ganter Brewery, which was erected in 1888 on the site of an oilpress, and which grew into the largest brewery in South Baden. In 1899, two landmarks of the town were erected: the Johanneskirche (Catholic), which because of its impressive appearance is called the \\"Wiehredom,\\" and the second Evangelische Church in Freiburg, the Christuskirche. The Loretto Hill, which reaches into Freiburg, began to be heavily built over at the beginning of the 20th century, including impressive villas and a private hospital. Up until the 1920s, the streets were extended southwards, and the Wiehre with them. The H√∂llentalbahn tracks began to be seen as an obstacle, and were removed 1933-34, marking the present southern boundary of the Wiehre. The old trainstation still exists, now in use as a caf√© and culture-center. During the Nazi era, the Wiehre was the center of a minor resistance. The underground group met in a private home near the Christuskirche, to lay plans for a post-Hitler Germany. The Wiehre emerged from the Second World War relatively unscathed; only homes near the Old City were damaged. After the war, the dramatic increase in motor traffic required the expansion of the Schwarzwaldstra√üe into a major artery, although the Wiehre retained most of its traditional architectural character. Life in the Wiehre Primarily because of the high prices for rent and real estate, the Wiehre is primarily a residential area for academics and the upper middle class. The majority of living spaces consists of villas, townhouses, and apartment buildings with spacious accommodations. Within the Wiehre are many shops, especially eco-alternative boutiques, as well as other shops and pubs. A farmer‚Äôs market is held weekly at the old Wiehrebahnhof. The main shopping street is the rather heavily trafficked G√ºnterstalstra√üe, which connects Freiburg with Schauinsland; traffic has been somewhat reduced in recent years by the creation of a network of one-way streets. While several student associations maintain tradition-rich dwellings in the Wiehre, the district remains the dream of many Freiburgers. Infrastructure The Alter Wiehrebahnhof on Urachstra√üe, formerly the Freiburg-Wiehre train station The reception building of the new station at the Freiburg-Wiehre H√∂llentalbahn of 1934 The Wiehre is connected by the H√∂llentalbahn to Freiburg and Titisee. Additionally, the town is served by numerous bus-routes, and the streetcars connect the Wiehre with the Old City of Freiburg, with G√ºnterstal and Vauban. Schools include the Walter- Eucken-Gymnasium, the Rotteckgymnasium, the Turnsee-, Loretto- and Lessingschule as well as the Waldorfschule. Additionally there is the Gertrud- Luckner-Gewerbeschule and the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr ausl√§ndisches und internationales Strafrecht. At the foot of the Loretto Hill is one of the largest hospitals in the city, the Catholic Loretto-Krankenhaus. Next to it is the Loretto Baths, an old public pool with a still-treasured \\"Damenbad\\".The old train station contains a small cultural center, where the communal cinema has often been recognized for the excellence of its programs; it has been home as well since 2003 to the Literaturforum S√ºdwest.

Roger Corman was the executive producer, and it was originally released on the Showtime cable network as part of the Roger Corman Presents series. The film concerns the comic book-style adventures of Darcy Walker, a police detective whose secret identity is the Black Scorpion, a superhero vigilante for justice. The Black Scorpion does not have any actual super powers, but like Batman, she fights evildoers with a combination of martial arts, great agility and strength, and many technological devices, including a high-powered, specially equipped car. Also like the Batman TV series of the 1960s, Black Scorpion is a work of camp, using deliberately exaggerated and unrealistic characters and events to comic effect. Black Scorpion was followed by a 1997 sequel, Black Scorpion II: Aftershock. In 2001, the Sci-Fi Channel aired a Black Scorpion TV series that starred Michelle Lintel in the title role. Black Scorpion was turned into a comic-book series, published digitally by Devil's Due Digital. There was also a one-off Legend of Isis / Black Scorpion comic published by Bluewater Productions. Premise Darcy Walker (Severance), a police detective, becomes the Black Scorpion, a costumed crime fighter, after her father is murdered.

Critical reception TV Guide said, \\"The heroine of this 1995 Roger Corman Presents Showtime movie ‚Äì the direct-to-video goddess Joan Severance ‚Äì wears a black bustier, spike-heel thigh-high boots, a mask, and practically nothing else. This could very well have been the entire pitch that got this movie made. If that is all you're looking for, then Black Scorpion more than delivers.... The mood of the film swerves from straight-forward police noir themes to cartoony superhero action. Given the hackneyed dialogue, and Severance's wooden delivery of it, the best thing about this film just might be its beautifully haunting theme music.\\" In DVD Talk, Scott Weinberg wrote, \\"Black Scorpion is a scrappy, silly, low-budget Batman Returns rip-off that freely admits that it's a scrappy, silly, rip-off. That alone doesn't make it a good expenditure of one's time, but it's nice to see a campy little schlock- fest that at least respects the movies it's stealing from.... For what it is, which is a downright ridiculous take on the super-hero schpiel, Black Scorpion is actually pretty entertaining. And for all its broad (and periodically inane) silliness, it's a B-flick that delivers what it promises, with a whole lotta Severance on the side.\\" In Cinema on the Rocks, Ziggy Berkeley said, \\"What's not a distraction, amazingly enough, is the script. As it turns out, it's not just the fact that Black Scorpion is a comic-book heroine movie that makes it easy to ignore the plot holes and improbabilities. It's also that the rest of the story is so solid. Lines like the above-noted science problem are actually self-aware; generally, the dialogue's great, even sharp. The humor/drama train is ridden with wonderful precision. The pace is perfect. Bottom line, Black Scorpion is fun. But it's not just fun; it's well-crafted fun. Pick it up. You won't be sorry.\\" In Cinema Crazed, Felix Vasquez wrote, \\"While no one will ever claim Black Scorpion is a masterpiece of contemporary action film-making, it sure is a lot of fun and has that fun at the charge of Joan Severance, who is leggy, busty, and absolutely enticing when dressed as her rogue character.... Black Scorpion is admittedly a cheesy and absolutely campy hero origin tale that takes advantage of the C grade special effects and acting from the cast and delivers a romp that is something quite satisfying to sit through and never goes too over the top.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * *Black Scorpion comic book from Devil's Due Digital. *Black Scorpion at Letterbox DVD Category:1995 television films Category:1995 films Category:1990s action comedy films Category:1990s superhero films Category:American television films Category:English-language films Category:American superhero films Category:American vigilante films Category:Superhero comedy films Category:American films Category:Superheroine films Category:1990s vigilante films Category:Films scored by Kevin Kiner ","title":"Black Scorpion (film)"},{"id":"10361129","text":"Black Scorpion II: Aftershock, also known as Black Scorpion II: Ground Zero, is a 1997 action comedy film directed by Jonathan Winfrey and starring Joan Severance as a crime fighting superhero.

Most other turboshafts in this power bracket have a centrifugal unit as a final compressor stage. As a result, the blades at the rear of the compressor are very small (less than 0.5in high) and extremely thin. # compressor handling at part speed is facilitated by several rows of variable stators at the front part of the unit.

Among the beliefs of the Najdat were: * The belief that the existence of a caliph or any other ruler is not necessary in religion - if members of society are able to maintain relations based on religious principles, then they may not need a ruler. * Allowing the concealment of their true beliefs, if they were in territories where the Sunnis dominated. * Sinning Muslims were not excommunicated as unbelievers. The Najdat believed that they could be forgiven by Allah - only he who persisted in his sin and repeatedly committed it, could be accused of unbelief. History Najda revolted in Yamamah, following the death of Husayn ibn Ali in 680. In 683 he allied his cause with the anti-caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, helping to lift the Umayyad siege of Mecca. In 684 Najda went to Basra and, led by Nafi ibn al-Azrakh, participated in the Kharijite rebellion against the governor Muslim ibn Uways, who was about to attack the city. The Azariqa withdrew to Ahwaz, but Najda separated and returned to Yamama. In 685, after some particular successes, the Kharijites recognized Najda as their leader. In 686 he went to Bahrayn and settled in Qatƒ´f, which he made the Najdat capital. After a failed attempt to capture Basra, Najda conquered Oman but was driven out by a local revolt, passing Oman to the two sons of Abbad ibn Abd-Allah. In 687 a group led by Atiyya ibn al-Aswad split up and headed to Sistan where they founded their own Kharijite branch. In the same year, Najda invaded Yemen and seized it, including Sanaa, and his lieutenant Abu-Fudayk conquered the Hadramaut. The Najdat now controlled the most peripheral areas of the caliphate and therefore most adequate to avoid the oppression of caliphate forces. The Najdat then began their conquest of Hejaz where, after the defeat of Abd Allah ibn al- Zubayr, they suffered an attack from Muhammad's cousin Abd Allah bin Abbas. Here they blocked supplies to Mecca and Medina and isolated Taizz, but did not want to attack the holy villages. At this point the Najdat dominated almost all of Arabia. However, an ideological split severed their ranks, between those who favored the continuation of the fight against the Umayyad \\"usurpers\\" and those who were in favor of a treaty with Damascus. Subsequently, some of Najda's supporters began to object to certain beliefs of his and rebelled against him. The intransigents, led by 'Atiya al-it Hanafƒ´, took refuge in the Iranian region of Helmand, assuming the title of Atawiyya, while some more radical Najdat, led by Abu Fudayk, murdered Najda himself in 691 and took his place. They later tried to fight against the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. In 692 Fudayk repelled a caliphate attack from Basra, but they were eventually defeated by the caliphate in 693, at the battle of Mushahhar. The free territory of the Najdites collapsed, although some of the supporters of Najda still remained faithful to his teachings. For some time, Najdism continued to exist, remaining in practice until the 11th century. References * Ali-zade, A. A.

The English translation by Gertrud Mander was published in 1982 by Century in London. In the same year the novel obtained the Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis (Kurd La√üwitz award). The first US edition was published in 1984 by St. Martin's Press (the same translation, copyright 1982). The computer game Original War (2001) is freely based on the novel. Plot The book is structured into three parts. The first part describes several anomalous ancient artifacts that turn out to be remnants of modern era items: a part of a pilot's breathing apparatus worshipped for centuries as a Catholic saintly relic, a clearly recognizable trace of a Jeep discovered during archaeological works on Gibraltar, found in the same layer as an early hominid skeleton, and an equally old grenade launcher of a model just introduced in the US Army. William W. Francis, an ambitious officer of the US Navy, becomes convinced that time travel is possible and manages to launch a secret project to develop a technological device able to transfer people and materiel through time. The second part describes the project \\"Chronotron\\", the successful implementation of a time machine, which is at first able only to move things into the past. It is believed that time transfer into the future will be solved soon. The American administration decides to move oil pumping machinery 5 million years into the past, set it up on oil deposits in the Near East, and transport the oil through the then dried-up Mediterranean Basin to the shores of the North Sea, where reverse time machines will push it to the modern era. The massively expensive project is kept strictly secret. Objections of scientists that time transfer into the future may be just a dream, that the project could exhaust the country in a new arm race, and that the history of humankind may be irreversibly changed, are ignored. The third part introduces Steve Stanley, a military pilot picked up to participate in the project. His task is to protect the installations and specialists transferred into the past. Stanley successfully descends into the prehistoric Mediterranean. He is surprised to arrive in the middle of an all- out war, where newcomers are chased by nuclear artillery. He learns that the plan went completely wrong: isolated groups of Americans were scattered through time more widely than calculated, the reverse time transfer is impossible, and worst of all, Arabs had discovered the plan and decided to strike back by sending their own soldiers into the same period to destroy the American expedition. Stanley meets people who arrived from various different futures, including one where the United States is limited to the east of the Mississippi and Mexico is the superpower. Most of the time travellers, unable to adjust to life without modern amenities and having no practical skills, have been evacuated to a base on Bermuda, and the rest try to fend off attackers and to rescue unsuspecting newcomers. Overall, the situation seems hopeless and the handful of modern humans have no chance to set up a new civilization.

The following year, he went to Paris to study Asiatic cholera, a disease that was then epidemic in the French capital. Canstatt's study of the disease, published in 1832, attracted the attention of the Belgian government, which commissioned him to take charge in establishment and management of a cholera hospital. He remained in Brussels until 1838, afterwards returning to Regensburg in order to practice ophthalmology. The same year he was appointed physician to the provincial law court at Ansbach, where he stayed until 1843. Following the death of professor Adolph Henke (1843), he was appointed to the chair of pathology at the University of Erlangen. In 1846, he was stricken with tuberculosis, and believing that a change of climate would be beneficial, he relocated to Pisa.

Guard formed the Singers as an attempt to return to the Trio's earlier roots in folk music. The Singers lasted about six months before disbanding. During that short period the group released one album, Dave Guard & The Whiskeyhill Singers, and recorded a number of songs for the soundtrack of How the West Was Won, but only four of these were used in the movie. History Although The Kingston Trio had quickly risen in three years from smoky gigs in the San Francisco peninsula's college town fraternity houses, bistros and bars to San Francisco's prestigious hungry i and Purple Onion, and then on to become nationally and internationally well known, accepted, and successful, Guard felt that by 1961 the Trio's musical style had become fixed and predictable, and its performances increasingly commercial. The Trio, Guard reportedly felt, had lost touch with the folk music roots that brought him to form The Calypsonians, which he had formed with Nick Reynolds and the group which had morphed into The Kingston Quartet and then finally with Bob Shane back from Hawaii into the Quartet's successor, The Kingston Trio. Guard also had concerns and conflicts with the way the Trio's publishing earnings were being handled.Ritchie Unterberger's liner notes for Collector's Choice CD, Dave Guard & The Whiskeyhill Singers Those issues, combined with underlying, long simmering resentments and ego clashes between himself and his Trio colleague, former Punahou School classmate Shane over control and leadership of the now successful group that the three had formed, led Guard to finally leave the group. Shortly thereafter Guard formed the Whiskeyhill Singers with another Punahou high school friend, Cyrus Faryar, and the Trio's bassist and musicologist David \\"Buck\\" Wheat. In line with Guard's intention to return to folk music, with its frequently uninhibited enthusiasm and vocal harmonies, Faryar suggested the group bring in an acquaintance of his, Judy Henske, to provide a female balance to the male harmonies, and in so doing, move definitively away from the Kingston Trio's male-only vocal format. Guard agreed, and the Whiskeyhill Singers, with Henske as female lead developed their own, often innovative, folk music mood, style, and sound. Despite the group's intent to return to folk music along the lines of Pete Seeger's The Weavers, Guard's and Wheat's long association with the Trio and its musical style inevitably had an influence on the Singers' own musical style and arrangements. Complicating matters was the fact that the Trio's rollicking and successful performing style of uninhibited enthusiasm was also taken directly from Weavers-style folk music, leading to criticism that the musical style of the Singers was more \\"Trio-like\\" than being an original style of their own. At the time that it disbanded, Guard said that The Whiskeyhill Singers had posted a loss of $10,000. = How the West Was Won= The producers of the MGM film How the West Was Won had approached The Kingston Trio to sing folk songs on the soundtrack for the movie. But learning Guard was beginning a new group, they felt the Whiskeyhills' sound, not as commercially slick, better suited their production. They performed several folk songs, \\"The Erie Canal\\", \\"900 Miles\\", \\"The Ox Driver\\", \\"Raise A Ruckus Tonight\\" (along with The Ken Darby Singers, as the general chorus behind Debbie Reynolds). Judy Henske sang lead with the Singers on \\"Careless Love\\" and soloed as the unknown singer on \\"A Railroader's Bride I'll Be\\". Cyrus Faryar can be heard performing solo on the track \\"Wanderin'\\" and Dave Guard on \\"Poor Wayfarin' Stranger\\". The film was nominated for the Academy Award in 1962 for the best Motion Picture Soundtrack. Originally they recorded the main title tune. But once this small group of singers were placed on a soundstage, recording before the full MGM Studio Orchestra, the experience was somewhat overwhelming. The full choir finally performed the song over the opening credits.  The group = Dave Guard = Dave Guard is considered to be a very important figure of the folk music scene of both the 1950s and 1960s. The Kingston Trio is credited with creating and popularizing eclectic folk and neo-folk music, a form that is now being called \\"world music\\". = Buckwheat = David \\"Buck\\" Wheat was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1922. Lived for many years in Sausalito, California, part of the \\"Beat\\" generation. He was a well-known jazz guitarist and bass player with the big dance bands and in 1957 recorded with the Chet Baker Trio on \\"My Funny Valentine\\" and \\"Embraceable You\\". He is best known as the bass accompanist for The Kingston Trio. = Cyrus Faryar = Like Dave Guard, Cyrus Faryar attended Punahou School, graduating in 1953. By 1957 Faryar's avant garde interests led him to establish a \\"beat\\" style coffee house in Honolulu. Popularized first in San Francisco's Broadway section, Faryar's Greensleeves coffee house was, like those popularized first by San Francisco's beat generation in the Broadway section of the city, a gathering place for local musicians, poets, and writers. Faryar was contacted by Dave Guard about joining a new group, later to become the Whiskeyhill Singers, before Guard's final appearances with the Trio. He had been performing his solo act at Scottsdale Arizona and received a telephone call from Guard saying that he was leaving the Trio and would arrange to meet with him and Buckwheat when The Kingston Trio was performing a scheduled date at Tempe a few weeks later. By that time Faryar had closed Greensleeves, left Honolulu, and established himself in San Diego, California. Faryar agreed, having known Guard from their Punahou days together, and having appeared with him in various school drama and musical productions. = Judy Henske  Liz Seneff = Liz Seneff (aka Elizabeth Seneff-Corrigan) joined The Whiskeyhill Singers in July 1962 after Judy Henske departed the group. Her tenure was brief, as Dave Guard was already seeking a home in Sydney Australia and he moved there in October 1962 after winding-up the group.  The group's music history = Early on = Guard, like his classmate Bob Shane (b. Robert Castle Scho√´n) grew up in Honolulu, in what was then a remote, but strategically important, U.S. territorial possession in the Pacific, the pre-statehood Territory of Hawaii. The only two radio stations in Honolulu during Guard's high school and pre- high school years were AM stations KGU and KGMB. Both stations, each owned by Honolulu's two newspapers and conservative in their popular music programs. Hawaiian music and the most popular \\"Hit Parade\\" tunes of the late '40s, early '50s were the popular music staples that Guard and Shane, and their classmates heard over the airwaves. Television did not arrive in the Territory until 1952, after both Guard and Shane had completed high school and gone on to college on the mainland. While Guard and Shane were teenagers in Hawaii there was only one record shop in Honolulu where new pop tunes ‚Äì carried in cargo holds of Matson Lines freighters sailing from California, usually four to six weeks after their release on the mainland ‚Äì could be listened to in listening booths and purchased. It was in this relatively austere pop music environment, with its one pop music DJ \\"Aku\\" heard during the morning hours and the commute to school, and the ever-present Hawaiian music, with its harmonies and falsettos, strumming guitars and ukuleles and their country riffs and slack key finger-picking, clearly influenced both Guard's and Shane's instrumental development and were embedded in the Trio's and latter the Singers arrangements. A high school drama presentation of Oklahoma in 1951 brought Guard and Shane, along with similarly guitar-competent classmate Bob Murphy, together as a group. This influenced soloists Guard and Shane to get together and form what was later to become The Kingston Trio. While at Punahou, Guard and his '52 classmate Bob Shane were frequently and regularly exposed to the words and a cappella harmonies of the classical Hawaiian music of Hawai'i's revered Queen Liliuokalani. Ukuleles and guitars tuned to either standard tuning or to one of the many Hawaiian slack key tunings, were the standard - if not expected - accompaniment to virtually all local music. In the 7th and 8th grades in the Junior Academy at Punahou, \\"ukulele\\" was a required music class for all students; thereafter Shane became quite accomplished with the ukulele, graduating from standard to tenor ukulele and then to baritone uke, with one or the other almost always in or near his hand. Guard and Shane were also regularly exposed to Japanese language and music broadcasts, as well as broadcasts of Chinese, Filipino, and Portuguese languages and music. Popular Japanese tunes of the 1949‚Äì1953 era, like \\"Kankan musumae (koku no Hawai'i)\\" were popular among haole and non-haole's alike. Rarely understanding the meaning of the words, but being able to remember and sing a medley of popular and traditional Hawaiian \\"folk music\\" was virtually a requisite at house parties, beach parties, moonlight gatherings, and other events. Being able to sing along and play a ukulele or guitar was a recognized and envied accomplishment at which Guard and Shane gradually to excelled during their high school years at Punahou. Within this background of Hawaiian/Polynesian harmonies and instrumental accompaniments for venerable staples like Genoa Keawe's \\"Kaimana Hila\\" came the folk music of Burl Ives and Pete Seeger, with party songs like Burl Ives' rendition of \\"On Top Of Old Smokey\\", Pete Seeger and The Weavers' ever popular \\"Goodnight, Irene\\" and Roy Acuff's \\"Wabash Cannonball\\". The calypso rhythms and vocals of Harry Belafonte, and the hand- clapping, sing-along style of Mitch Miller's group, very popular during the high school years of Guard and Shane, were a significant influence on Guard's and Shane's, and eventually the Trio's, musical style. Then a bit later in the early 1950s, came Fijiian tunes, like \\"Isa Lei\\", the perennial slack key favorite, the comic Samoan \\"Salomila\\", the classic \\"Pupu o Ewa\\", taught as one of Shane's Punahou graduating class of 1952's Hawaiian songs sung en chorale during their graduation (and which Don Ho's performed with English lyrics to become his signature, tourist favorite \\"Pearly Shells\\"), and the catchy, toe- tapping \\"Molokai Nui Ahina\\", all of which were beach and house party favorites that clearly influenced and contributed to Guard and Shane's music style and rhythms. In the pop music realm, both Guard and Shane were clearly influenced by the harmonies and often lusty style of Mitch Miller's group, and the distinctive voices of Vaughn Monroe, and (early on) young Dean Martin. Fast guitar strumming rhythms and rippling banjo riffs characteristic in Pete Seeger and The Weavers's renditions became the basic, and ultimately expected, bedrock sound in Guard's and Shane's Kingston Trio, a sound which Guard, in his Whiskeyhill Singers group, and for whatever reason, found it necessary to repeat. A quick, shadowy glimpse of the early influence on Guard of Miller's group, Mitch Miller and the Gang, seeps out in the title of his group's one album, Dave Guard and the Whiskeyhill Singers. Guard and Shane's relative isolation from the varieties of mainland pop music and their continual exposure to Polynesian sing-along harmonies with their strummed guitar accompaniments are clearly heard in both the Trio's and the Singers' renditions. For example, Hawaiian slack key guitar riffs can be heard throughout the Singers' rendition of Salomila. = Post-Trio = Guard's and Buck Wheat's departure from the Trio, and the forming of the Whiskeyhill Singers allowed Guard to have the freedom and total control over the reptoire and style of a more 'folk-like' folk music group. Whether he accomplished his goal or not is hard to say. The addition of Judy Henske to the group, with her often harsh, contemporary, but out of place Janis Joplin-esque vocals, may have done more harm to the group than good. If Guard's objective was to meld traditional folk with contemporary '60's activist intensity and Trio-style renditions, he may well have succeeded in accomplishing his goal. Whether Guard's idea of a 'new' folk music style was viable and acceptable to the public is hard to tell, since once again, differences with group members quickly led the Singers down the road to a short group life.  The end of the line  After disbanding of the Singers Faryar and Henske went their separate ways but still maintained contact and friendship. The two returned to the San Diego area where they performed for a few years, with Faryar eventually returning to Hawai'i and taking up a relatively reclusive residence on the state's Big Island. [1] = Dave Guard = Guard spent a few years vacillating between wanting to return to the Trio, and wanting not to return to the Trio. In his absence, the other two members of the Trio, Bob Shane and Nick Reynolds, recruited John Stewart to take Guard's place. The new configuration continued the Trio's success until they disbanded in 1967. Shortly after the Trio breakup, Bob Shane formed a group called the New Kingston Trio, which he led. Shane, understandably, was not much interested in having Guard back in his new group. Guard moved his family to Australia, and kept active in his musical interests, developing a guitar teaching tool he called \\"Colour Guitar\\". A cardboard, color-coded chording device, the tool met with little financial success. He hosted his own TV show, Dave's Place, in Australia in the late part of 1965. Guard returned to the US in 1968. He died of lymphatic cancer in 1991. = Buckwheat = David \\"Buck\\" Wheat went on to arrange and record with Bud & Travis duo.

Life and career Eleanor Dark memorial plaque in Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay Eleanor Dark was born in Sydney, the second of three children of the poet, writer and parliamentarian Dowell Philip O'Reilly and his wife, Eleanor McCulloch O'Reilly. She studied at the Redlands College for Girls at Cremorne, and was known as Pixie O'Reilly. On finishing school and unable to enter university, having failed mathematics, she learnt typing and took a secretarial job. In February 1922 she married Dr Eric Payten Dark (1889‚Äì1987), a widower and general practitioner who wrote books, articles and pamphlets on politics and medicine. She became step-mother to his two-year-old son. Eric Dark was an active member of the Labor left in New South Wales, was involved in contemporary political debate and was a committed socialist. His books include The World Against Russia and Who are the Reds. They lived in Katoomba, New South Wales, where Eleanor bore their son Michael and wrote eight of her ten novels, including short stories and articles and was a frequent contributor to Walkabout magazine where Eric Lowe described her love of Australian floraEric Lowe, ‚ÄòOur Authors‚Äô Page: Eleanor Dark‚Äô, Walkabout, May 1951, 8. which is evidentEleanor Dark, ‚ÄòThe Blackall Range Country‚Äô, Walkabout, November 1955, 18 in her sense of its life and light in a 1951 article about the beauty of Central Australia: She also wrote under the pseudonym \\"Patricia O'Rane\\". She and her husband were, in September 1949, charter members of the Australian Peace Council. In the 1950s they bought a farm in Montville, Queensland, where they spent part of the year for seven years. Eleanor wrote her last published work, Lantana Lane at the farm. Their son Michael had also moved to Queensland, where he eventually married and had two daughters. The move to Queensland has, by some, been associated with the desire to escape a growing sense of persecution and isolation within the Katoomba community due to growing attacks on members of left-wing parties in the press and by the Menzies Government. Dr Dark's political writing and involvement in left-wing circles attracted attention from anti-communist elements within the Menzies Government and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Like many writers and social commentators of the time who were critical of Menzies or were left-wing, it is certain that the Darks were under surveillance. This surveillance extended to Eric Dark's first son from his first marriage, John Dark, and possibly to his second son with Eleanor, Michael Dark. Eleanor Dark's best known work is The Timeless Land (1941), the first part of a trilogy, with Storm of Time (1948) and No Barrier (1953).

The parcel is typically made from folded parchment paper, but other material, such as a paper bag or aluminium foil, may be used. The parcel holds in moisture to steam the food. The pocket is created by overlapping circles of aluminum foil and parchment paper and then folding them tightly around the food to create a seal. A papillote should be opened at the table to allow people to smell the aroma when it opens. The moisture may be from the food itself or from an added moisture source, such as water, wine, or stock. This method is most often used to cook fish or vegetables, but lamb and poultry can also be cooked en papillote. Choice of herbs, seasonings and spices depend on the particular recipe being prepared. The pouch should be sealed with careful folding. Regional variations=In Asia= With large leaves (e.g. banana, Xanthosoma, or cassava) widely available across the archipelago, Indonesians have long used them in food preparation. The leaves are used to wrap food before cooking it either by steaming or grilling. The Indonesian method requires no additional moisture, and in some dishes, the leaf wrappings may also be eaten. Popular Indonesian dishes that employ this cooking method include pepes, botok, buntil, and otak- otak (variations of this dish are also commonly available in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia). Beggar's Chicken is encased in mud or clay before being heated directly on a fire. The legend surrounding its origination was to prevent any aroma from escaping while it was being cooked.

A hotbed for mining in the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Burke Canyon now contains several ghost towns and remnants of former communities along Idaho State Highway 4, which runs northeast through the narrow canyon to the Montana border. Burke Canyon takes its name from the town of Burke; settlers arrived in the canyon in 1884 after silver, lead, and zinc were found in mines throughout. Between 1886 and 1890, numerous mining communities developed in the canyon. Many of the communities in Burke Canyon saw multiple labor disputes, namely the Coeur d'Alene labor strike of 1892 and the confrontation of 1899, which resulted in violent conflict between miners and mine owners. Populations throughout the canyon's towns dwindled in the late-twentieth century after a series of natural disasters and mine closures, and the last active mine in the canyon was closed in 1991, leaving the majority of the communities unpopulated. The Environment Protection Agency includes Burke Canyon as part of the Coeur d'Alene basin's Superfund sites due to hard metal and waste contamination of Burke-Canyon Creek. History=Settlement= Gold was initially discovered in the early 1860s in the mountains to the north of the Snake River basin, which gave way to a large influx of prospectors. Silver, copper, and other minerals were subsequently discovered. Idaho experienced boom after boom, and mining towns arose overnight, boomed, and then disappeared as the miners left for the latest rush. In 1884, miners discovered significant amounts of silver, zinc, and lead at the Tiger Mine in Burke Canyon. The Tiger Mine was sold to S.S. Glidden for $35,000. In 1887, Glidden began construction on a three-foot-wide railway to transport hardrock ore out of the Tiger Mine. Meanwhile, a buildup of of ore had accumulated from the various mines in the canyon, leading to the establishment of the Canyon Creek Railroad, which had its first shipment to Wallace on December 12, 1887. The establishment of the railroad coincided with that of the town of Burke, from which the canyon takes its name. Burke was the largest mining community in the canyon, with a peak population of 1,400 in 1910. The community of Gem, just south of Burke, had been established in 1886. Both Gem and Burke attracted various miners as well as a large number of Swedish immigrants. By 1903, Burke Canyon was the most developed mining region in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains and was home to seven dividend-paying mines: the Gem of the Mountains, Frisco, Mammoth, Standard, Hecla, Tiger-Poorman and Hercules mines. =Civil unrest and natural disasters= Frisco Mill before and after July 11, 1892 explosion. On July 10, 1892, miners called a strike which developed into a shooting war between union miners and company guards. The first shots fired were exchanged at the Frisco mine in the early morning hours of July 11. The gunfire ignited a stock of dynamite in the Frisco Mill, causing the four-story mill to explode and kill six people. The violence soon spilled over into the community of Gem. From there, union miners who had successfully shut down both the Frisco and the Gem mines travelled west, to the Bunker Hill mining complex near Wardner, and closed down that facility as well. The Idaho National Guard and federal troops were dispatched to the area. The incident marked the first violent confrontation between the workers of the mines and their owners. Hostilities would erupt at the Bunker Hill facility once again in 1899. In both disputes, issues included pay, hours of work, the right of miners to belong to the union, and the mine owners' use of informants and undercover agents. Violence committed by union miners was answered with a brutal response in 1892 and in 1899. Burke Canyon was the site of several natural disasters as well. Two major avalanches struck the canyon in the twentieth century: one on February 4, 1890, which killed three; and another in February 1910, which buried and killed twenty-five people. In the days after the February 1910 avalanche, snow and rock continued to dislodge from the canyon walls, inflicting additional damage on the towns of Burke and Mace, and causing numerous deaths. In August of that year, the Great Fire of 1910 would cause further damage to the communities in the canyon. Three years later, in May 1913, the communities were stricken by heavy rains that resulted in significant floods. The Northern Pacific railroad considered discontinuing service through the canyon after the depot was damaged in a July 1923 fire. The railroad also cited increased automobile traffic as a reason for discontinuing the line. By 1939, the rail to Burke had been officially closed, and the tracks dismantled. =1980s‚Äìpresent= By the late twentieth century, mining operations in Burke Canyon had slowed considerably. The Hecla Mine in Burke officially ceased operations on June 30, 1983, due to low metal prices. The last mine in Burke officially closed in 1991, and the town and several of the surrounding communities became ghost towns. Around 2010, the Hecla Mining Company has been exploring the potential of exploiting additional resource deposits in the Star mine. As of December 2012, Hecla invested $7 million in rehabilitation and exploration with published estimates suggesting the potential to recover in excess of 25 million ounces of silver from the site with significant zinc and lead deposits also present. Geography The structure of Burke Canyon resembles a narrow gulch, roughly across, with steep cliffs and hills on both sides. The hillsides of the canyon are so steep that the community of Burke only receives around 3 hours of full sunlight during winters. =Climate= Burke Canyon experiences a continental climate, marked by warm summers and cold, snowy winters. Communities In 2002, it was reported that around 300 people lived in or near the canyon. There are numerous communities and former communities located along Burke-Canyon Road in Burke Canyon, though several are now ghost towns. The communities include: 1907 Geologic map of the Burke Canyon in Idaho, including the locations of Gem, Black Bear, Mace and Burke Environmental concerns=Mining effects= Standard-Mammoth mine entrance near Mace. Decades' worth of mining activity resulted in various metals leaching into Canyon Creek, contaminating much of Burke Canyon. Leftover waste rock from mines leached cadmium, lead, arsenic, and zinc into the creekbed. Ecologists found that long stretches of Canyon Creek were entirely uninhabited by fish due to the high levels of metal content in the water. Canyon Creek is considered one of the Coeur d'Alene basin's Superfund sites. The metals leached in Canyon Creek were partially responsible for the contamination of the Coeur d'Alene River, the most heavy- metal contaminated river in the world. In 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moved forward with plans to dispose of leftover rock piles and contaminated soil in Burke Canyon. Various metals also impacted the local water supply of Burke Canyon: After the closure of the last mine in Burke in 1991, residents' water supplies continued to be sourced from pipes that extended into abandoned mine shafts. Consequently, the metal content of Burke's water supply was fifty times above that of federal water quality standards. In 2001, the EPA offered to buy out residents of Burke Canyon, citing water contamination in Canyon Creek, but residents refused. The following year, the EPA ordered the town of Burke to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act; however, given the small number of homes within the boundaries of the town, it would have cost each household an estimated $48,000 per year. =Waste disposal= For decades, raw sewage was emptied via pipelines directly into Canyon Creek from the residences in Burke Canyon. By the turn of the twenty-first century, citizens of Burke had continued to dump up to of raw sewage into Canyon Creek per day. In 2004, the Panhandle Health District (PHD) and Idaho Department of Environmental Equality (DEQ) tested homes in Burke to identify contaminations, finding a total of thirty occupied homes discharging untreated waste into the creek. In 2007, the DEQ sequestered $220,000 in order to help residents install new septic systems to prevent further contamination. In 2016, the EPA announced its plan to construct a waste repository in lower Burke Canyon in order to alleviate waste accumulation in Wallace. Some residents of the canyon objected to the repository, citing further pollution from diesel trucks used to transport waste in the canyon.

Microfungi are a paraphyletic group, distinguished from macrofungi only by the absence of a large, multicellular fruiting body. They are ubiquitous in all terrestrial and freshwater and marine environments, and grow in plants, soil, water, insects, cattle rumens, hair, and skin. Most of the fungal body consists of microscopic threads, called hyphae, extending through the substrate in which it grows. The mycelia of microfungi produce spores that are carried by the air, spreading the fungus. Many microfungi species are benign, existing as soil saprotrophs, for example, largely unobserved by humans. Many thousands of microfungal species occur in lichens, forming symbiotic relationships with algae. Other microfungi, such as those of the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus and Neurospora, were first discovered as molds causing spoilage of fruit and bread. Certain species have commercial value. Penicillium species are used in the manufacture of blue cheeses and as the source of the antibiotic penicillin, discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928, while fusarium venenatum is used to produce a mycoprotein food product. Harmful microfungi Yeast of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae Microfungi can also be harmful, causing diseases of plants, animals and humans with varying degrees of severity and economic impact. The irritating human skin disease known as athlete's foot or tinea pedis is caused by species of the microfungal genus Trichophyton. Microfungi may cause diseases of crops and trees which range in severity from mild to disastrous, and in economic importance from beneficial to seriously costly. The mould Botrytis cinerea can cause spoilage of crops including grapes, but is also responsible for the \\"noble rot\\", which concentrates sugars in the grapes used to make the intensely sweet and concentrated Sauternes dessert wines from the Bordeaux region of France. Dutch elm disease, which has ravaged elms across Europe and North America in the last 50 years, is caused by the microfungi of the genus Ophiostoma. Rice blast, a devastating fungal disease of cereals including rice, wheat and millet, is caused by the phytopathogenic Ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe grisea. In the built environment, the toxic fungus Stachybotrys chartarum causes damage to damp walls and furnishings, and may be responsible for sick building syndrome. Types of epidermal microfungal infections are: *Yeast infection *Athlete's foot *Mycosis *Tinea *Candida Diversity Within the United States, approximately 13,000 species of microfungi on plants or plant products are thought to exist. Specimens of microfungi are housed in the U.S. National Fungus Collections and other institutions that serve as reservoirs of information and documentation about the nation's natural heritage. Based on the number of species reported in the literature and those represented in the collections; the number of microfungi known in the United States is estimated at 29,000 species. In areas of the world where fungi have been well studied, the ratio of vascular plants to fungi is about 6 to 1.Hawksworth, D.L. (1991) The fungal dimension of biodiversity: magnitude, significance and conservation.

He has worked under the aliases , , and . Career A fan of Osamu Tezuka's works, when Yoshikawa was a sophomore in high school, he saw a \\"Mushi Production's first batch of animators wanted\\" news article and applied for the job, which led him to enter the anime industry. He was planning to go to art college, but was invited to join Mushi Pro, so he quit high school and joined the company. He participated as an animator for the first Astro Boy series. In 1967, he participated in the founding of Art Fresh with Gisabur≈ç Sugii and Osamu Dezaki. After working as an animator on Mushi Production's Gok≈´ no Daib≈çken, which Art Fresh participated in, he worked as a freelance animator before becoming a senior director and board member of Dyna-Method Inc. (formerly known as A-UN Entertainment). In addition to serving as episode director, storyboard artist and writer, he also worked as a director. He has participated in Tensai Bakabon, Star of the Giants, Ashita no Joe, Moomin, Lupin the Third Part I, Invincible Super Man Zambot 3, Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3, and Future Boy Conan. He is still at the forefront of the animation world. In addition to anime, he created, wrote and directed Star Guardian with Airship Theater Company, wrote the screenplays for Tanoshii Moomin Ikka and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and wrote and directed The Wizard of Oz. It all started when he was asked by director Masaaki ≈åsumi to help with the screenplay of Aladdin for Airship Theater Company's Aladdin when he was working on the TV adaptation of Moomin. In addition, he has worked on commercials, events, performances and novels. He has been a fan of science fiction since he read Sh≈çnen Sh≈çjo Sekai Kagaku B≈çken Zensh≈´ by Kodansha when he was a kid. One of the reasons that the 100th episode of the Kirby: Right Back at Ya! anime contained some problems, inconsistencies, and heavy- handedness in the plot and development is that Yoshikawa, who wrote the final episode, learned that his wife was in critical condition at the time and had to rush through the script and leave it in incomplete form in order to be present for her dying moments. In an interview with Yasuo ≈åtsuka for the Lupin III Perfect Book: Complete Collector's Edition, he cites Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, Osamu Dezaki, and Yoshikawa as representative members of the Japanese anime world.

The Colonial History of Hartford. Hartford. 1914. Page 82 In 1633, fur traders from the Dutch West India Company set up Fort Goede Hoop at the rivers' confluence. The Dutch referred to today's Connecticut River as the \\"Great River\\", and called its tributary, the Park, the \\"Little River\\".Alberta Eiseman, \\"The Industrialization of the Great River, New England's Longest,\\" New York Times, 30 August 1998 The first English settlers arrived in the area in 1635; the following year, the Reverend Thomas Hooker led 100 of his congregation to form a new settlement north of the Dutch fort. The first mill in the settlement was built on the Little River by Matthew Allyn to grind local corn. During industrialization, the Little River became known as Mill River because of the numerous mills built to use its water power. The lower part of the river was prone to flooding. Damaging floods in 1936 and 1938 led to a public works project to move the lower part underground, which was started by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1940. The conduit under Bushnell Park (for which the river was named) was completed in 1943-1949. Sections farther upriver were completed after the next big floods in August 1955, which followed two hurricanes (Connie and Diane) that came about a week apart, and the whole project was completed in the 1980s, with a total of more than 9 miles of river underground. North Branch Park River watershed Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) American eel Fallfish The North Branch Park River watershed is a 28.6 square-mile basin within the Park watershed. It has a watershed management plan that was completed in 2010, and its subwatersheds are mapped here. Four major tributaries -- Beamans Brook, Wash Brook, Filley Brook, and Tumbledown Brook -- drain from Bloomfield and northern parts of West Hartford, converging near the University of Hartford to form the North Branch of the Park River. Upstream drainage from the entire watershed flows between the West End, Blue Hills, and Asylum Hill neighborhoods of Hartford, Connecticut‚Äôs capital city, before pouring into an underground conduit north of Farmington Avenue. The North Branch is exposed once more on the northern edge of Pope Park, just before it joins the South Branch and flows from there to the Connecticut River in a conduit. The watershed features a number of native and introduced fish, many of which are game fish. A 2000 survey found American Eel, Pumpkinseed, and Tessellated darter to be the most abundant species in the North Branch. A 2008 survey found that North Branch tributary creeks hold large populations of Eastern blacknose dace and Longnose dace. Largemouth Bass, Fallfish, Common shiner, Common carp, Bluegill, Redbreast sunfish, Rock Bass, White sucker, and Banded killifish are also found throughout the North Branch and its tributaries. South Branch Park River watershed The South Branch Park River watershed covers 39.6 square miles, and the river is formed by the confluence of Trout Brook and Piper Brook, near New Britain Avenue in the Elmwood section of West Hartford. The South Branch is exposed from there to Pope Park, where it joins the North Branch and flows from there to the Connecticut River in a conduit. The Trout Brook watershed covers 17.7 square miles, and, 66% of West Hartford is in the Trout Brook watershed. Sections of Trout Brook are impaired. Piper Brook starts in St. Mary's Cemetery in New Britain, has an 11.5 square mile watershed, and also has impaired sections. Bass Brook is the other brook in the watershed, with a 10.4 square mile watershed, which starts near Farmington Ave. and flows into Piper Brook near CT Rt. 9 in New Britain.

It was most likely performed on Twelfth Night, 6 January 1617 in the Banqueting House at Whitehall Palace, and repeated on 19 January that year.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The New Intellectuals: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1977; pp. 79, 86-7. The Vision of Delight was first published in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641. Design The scholarly consensus favors the view that the masque was designed by Inigo Jones,Leah Sinanoglou Marcus, The Politics of Mirth: Jonson, Herrick, Milton, Marvell, and the Defense of Old Holiday Pastimes, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1986; p. 74. though no firm historical evidence necessitates this conclusion, and data on the masque's design elements are not extant. The masque's music, composed by Nicholas Lanier, has unfortunately not survived, except for a setting for the final song. Pocahontas The masque's first performance was attended by the Native Americans Pocahontas and Tomocomo, two months before Pocahontas's untimely death.Karen Ordahl Kupperman, Indians and English: Facing Off in Early America, Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press, 2000; p. 199.James P. P. Horn, A Land as God Made It: Jamestown and the Birth of America, New York, Basic Books, 2005; p. 227. Buckingham The masque was connected with George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the favorite of King James I. The Vision of Delight was performed on the day Villiers received his title as Earl (later Duke) of Buckingham. Buckingham had sponsored Jonson's masque The Gypsies Metamorphosed (1621); he had also danced in Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue (1618). The show The Vision of Delight has been regarded as almost a prototypical or quintessential example of the masque; it features the mythological figures and personifications of abstractions that are standard for the form. The work opens with personifications of Delight, Harmony, Grace, Love, Laughter, Revel, Sport, and Wonder; they are later joined by the ancient Greek deities Zephyrus and Aurora. Jonson's verse, heralding the coming of Spring, is lush and vibrant; the nineteenth-century critic and editor William Gifford called the masque \\"one of the most beautiful of Jonson's little pieces, light, airy, harmonious, and poetical in no common degree. It stands without parallel among performances of this kind....\\"William Gifford, ed., The Works of Ben Jonson, Vol. 7; London, Bickers and Son, 1875; p. 282. Two anti-masques feature comical figures of \\"pantaloons\\" and \\"phantasms,\\" followed by the more serious portion of the work in which the aristocratic masquers descend from a Bower of Spring to dance their dances. The effect is one of \\"glowing idealism.\\"Marcus, p. 104. One passage in Jonson's text has been cited by critics as influencing John Milton's poem Il Penseroso.Wiltshire Stanton Austin, The Lives of the Poets-Laureate, London, Richard Bentley, 1853; p. 96. Sources Despite its evanescent surface appearance (one commentator has called the work \\"a masque about masques\\"),Mary Chan, Music in the Theatre of Ben Jonson. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1980; p. 276. Jonson's text is not without intellectual weight; Jonson based his masque on traditional dream theory, relying most likely on the Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis, Macrobius's study of the Dream of Scipio by Cicero. Jonson treats the audience of the performance as an assemblage of dreamers, and through his masque illustrates Macrobius's categories of dreams.Logan and Smith, p. 79.

He was born in Pont-de- Vaux, Ain and grew up in Bresse. In 1838 he moved to Paris, where he began studying under Paul Delaroche in 1842. The following year he met Corot, who influenced him profoundly by encouraging him to paint landscape en plein air. Art historian Athena S. E. Leoussi suggests that Chintreuil's work can be divided into three periods: From c. 1846‚Äì1850 he painted Paris and its surroundings, particularly Montmartre; from 1850‚Äì1857 he lived in Igny and frequently painted in Barbizon, and from 1857 on he lived and worked in La Tournelle-Septeuil in the Seine valley. During this final period his work reached its fullest development, and he achieved critical recognition. In the breadth and simplicity of his execution, and in his attention to capturing light and atmosphere, Chintreuil can be placed alongside Eug√®ne Boudin, Johan Barthold Jongkind, and the painters of the Barbizon school, as an important forerunner of Impressionism.

Career He played his early cricket with Hull Town C.C., before getting into the Yorkshire Federation side in 1966. He played with Leeds C.C., taking 9‚Äì21 versus Doncaster in 1968, and from 1969 assisted Bradford, taking 7‚Äì9 against Bowling Old Lane in 1970 and helped them win the Priestley Cup in 1973. Bore made his debut for Yorkshire in 1969. He played for his native county until 1977, when he moved to Nottinghamshire where he played past the age of 40 until 1988. A doughty campaigner on the county circuit he took 372 first-class wickets at 30.22 with a best of 8‚Äì89. He conceded 2.43 runs per over, bowling a mixture of accurate swing and seam. He was a noted rabbit with the bat, with a highest score of just 37* in 158 innings, and an average of 8.24. He took 139 wickets in one day cricket. One of the few instances of an all run six occurred off Bore's bowling in a Surrey v Yorkshire Sunday League match at the large Oval ground in 1974. Robin Jackman cut Mike Bore to the third man boundary where the fielder gave up the chase, thinking the ball a certain four. It stopped short, and a relay throw was aimed at Intikhab Alam's end as he tried to complete a third run. The throw defeated wicketkeeper David Bairstow, allowing Jackman another two runs. Another attempt to run out Intikhab failed, and he was able to complete the sixth run. Bore played an important role in the remarkable climax to the 1984 County Championship, which saw Essex and Nottinghamshire neck and neck at the top of the table. Essex had won their final game against Lancashire in two days, but if Nottinghamshire could beat Somerset the title would belong to Trent Bridge. Nottinghamshire were set 297 in 60 overs by Ian Botham, and needed 36 from the last three overs. The last pair were at the wicket, with one of them being the archetypal non batsman, Bore. Clive Rice and Bore recalled the game in 2006 for Cricinfo. Rice: If you knew Mike, then believe me, every run he made was an unexpected bonus. I wasn't daring even to watch. No one was allowed to move inside the dressing room. Everyone stayed in their seats as we got closer and closer. Mike Bore: If it was pitched on the off stump, I thought, I'll hit it straight. If it's on my legs, I'll sweep it. Remarkably, Bore found the middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to complete a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask \\"What did you do that for?\\" \\"It wasn't in the right place.\\" Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, \\"That's it, we've won\\". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister \\"We were stunned. We got in the car and I don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs\\". He subsequently worked as a coach in the Nidderdale League, and was active in the East Yorkshire Cricket Development Group for Yorkshire.

The observatory was designed by L.P. Burnham, Cornell Professor of Architecture and completed in fall of 1917. It was originally used by the Civil Engineering Department as an instructional field office for navigation and surveying. Today, the observatory is primarily used for public outreach, welcoming over two thousand visitors per year with open houses on clear Friday nights. The facility is currently maintained by the Cornell Department of Astronomy, though open houses are routinely managed by the Cornell Astronomical Society, a group of Cornell undergraduates, graduate students, and Ithaca citizens. The observatory is named after the Puerto Rican-American astronomer and builder of Cornell's first observatory, Estevan Antonio Fuertes.  History  Professor Samuel L. Boothroyd looks through the Irving Porter Church Telescope in 1923, soon after its completion. Cornell Alumni News, May 3, 1923. Several observatories existed on Cornell's Central Campus in the later part of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century. However, due to the development of the campus and the need to build a drill hall (Barton Hall), the predecessors to Fuertes were demolished, and plans were made to build a new observatory on the undeveloped North Campus. In 1916, construction of the Fuertes Observatory began under the supervision of the Cornell Department of Civil Engineering. The building was completed in Fall of 1917 with a 24-foot-diameter steel dome; 30-foot-long I-beams were incorporated to provide support for a future telescope. This differed from the typical masonry pier used to support a telescope in most observatories. The first telescope in the dome room of Fuertes was a 4.5-inch refractor telescope used in some of Cornell's previous observatories, and was mounted on an equatorial clock-driven mount. Soon after, in 1919, Civil Engineering Professor Irving Porter Church acquired two glass blanks from the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin. The glass blanks were ground and polished into a 12-inch achromatic lens by Brashear & Co in 1920. Professor Church spearheaded a campaign to raise money from civil engineering alumni to build the telescope and equatorial mounting. In January 1922, the order was placed with the Warner & Swasey Company to build the equatorial mount. After modifications were made to the original dome, the telescope was installed during the summer and fall of 1922, and was completed on October 16, 1922. It was officially dedicated on June 15, 1923 as the ‚ÄúIrving Porter Church Memorial Telescope.‚Äù Additionally, the observatory was built with a classroom, transit room (with a clamshell roof), and an office. A large backlit display case containing numerous astronomical slides was featured (and remains today) in the lobby of the building. Many civil engineering instruments were housed in Fuertes, including zenith telescopes, theodolites, sextants, transit instruments, and a chronograph. The transit room has since been converted into a museum to display many of the historic instruments. http://topics.sirtf.com/Fuertes/FuertesHistory A Brief History of the Fuertes Observatory at Cornell by Prof. Phil Nicholson.

The observatory contains a 12-inch refracting telescope with a weight-driven mechanical clock drive. The original glass blanks that were to become the optics were procured in 1919 by Prof. Irving P. Church, head of the Cornell Department of Civil Engineering; the two-element lens was ground and polished by the well-known firm of Brashear & Co. and delivered to Cornell in 1920. In January 1922, a contract was given to the Warner and Swasey Co. of Cleveland, Ohio to build the mount. On October 16, 1922, the telescope was erected upon its German equatorial mount in the central dome of the Fuertes Observatory. The observatory's original 4.5-inch telescope was mounted onto the 12-inch refractor, and currently serves as the finder scope.http://topics.sirtf.com/Fuertes/ChurchTelescopeDedication Retrieved 2015-10-19 The observatory also contains several transit telescopes, zenith scopes, and other antique astronomical instruments used by Civil Engineers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for geodesy and timekeeping. These instruments are on display in a museum that occupies the east wing of the building.

Approximate locations of some of the important tribes and states of the Arabian Peninsula at the dawn of Islam 600AD, Anizah inhabited the Nejd desert between modern-day Saudi Arabia and Syria. Genealogy and origins Anazzah's existence as an autonomous tribal group, like many prominent modern tribes, predates the rise of Islam in the 7th century CE. The classical Arab genealogists placed \`Anizzah within the large Rabi\`ah branch of Adnanite (North Arabian) tribes, alongside the tribes of Abdul Qays, Bakr ibn Wa'il, Bani Hanifa, and Taghlib. In the genealogical scheme, \`Anazzah's eponymous ancestor is a great uncle of all of these. Two main branches of \`Anazzah are recorded by the early Muslim scholars. One branch was nomadic, living in the northern Arabian steppes bordering Syria and Mesopotamia. The other, known as Bani Hizzan, was sedentary, living within the wadis of the district of Al-Yamama in eastern Nejd, just south of their purported cousins, the Bani Hanifa of the Bakr ibn Wa'il, who inhabited modern-day Riyadh. Families tracing their origin to \`Annizah through Hizzan still exist in that area today.Hamad Al-Jassir, \\"Hizzan\\", Compendium of the Lineages of the Settled Families of Nejd, pt. II, p. 889 (Arabic) The other tribes of Rabi'ah were far more prominent in the events of late pre-Islamic Arabia and the early Islamic era (see Banu Hanifa, Taghlib, and Bakr). According to historians such as Al-Tabari (10th century CE), \`Anazzah joined with Bakr ibn Wa'il under an alliance they called \\"al-Lahazim\\". Many of these tribes were followers of the Christian faith prior to Islam. Others such as bani Taghlib remained largely Christian even after the Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia and the Levant Modern history=\`Annazah in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia= Post-card of Emir Mejhem ibn Meheid, chief of the Anaza tribe near Aleppo with his sons after he was decorated with the Croix de L√©gion d'honneur on 20 September 1920 by General Gouraud The modern tribe of \`Annazah became prominent in the Ottoman era, as masters of the oasis towns of northwestern Arabia, particularly Khaybar and Al-Ula. Although not farmers themselves, the \`Annizah levied crops from the inhabitants, and only spent the winter months in the area, while migrating northwards into southern Syria in the summer months, where they collected tribute from the inhabitants of the Hawran region. The tribute was known as khuwwa (\\"brotherhood\\"), and in exchange, the tribesmen pledged to protect the farmers from other tribes. Other clans of the tribe spread across the northern Arabian steppes as far north and east as the Euphrates. According to Encyclopedia of Islam, \\"it is not known whence they came\\", while many such as the Western travelers Philby and Anne Blunt simply assumed they had recently migrated from Nejd, having been pushed northwards into Syria by other tribes. However, the tribe does not appear in the historical or genealogical records of Nejd, and members of the tribe posit a migration from Syria and Iraq southwards to Nejd, which comports with the original lands of the Bakr ibn Wa'il. In particular, it is believed they originated from the area of Ayn Tamr in the Iraqi desert near Karbala. In the 19th century, the Swiss traveler Burckhardt and the British traveler Doughty visited the tribe in their stronghold of Khaybar and gathered from them many details of Bedouin life. Sheikh Medjuel el Mezrab of the Anizah was the husband of Lady Jane Digby. One branch of the \`Annizah in that area, centered around Al-Jouf and the valley of Wadi Sarhan and extending into Jordan and Syria, became so large and powerful that it practically developed into an independent tribe, known as the Ruwallah. The Ruwallah engaged in battle with other branches of \`Annizah, and also became the arch-enemy of the large tribe of Shammar, who inhabited roughly the same area and dominated Nejd in the late 19th century after temporarily deposing the Al Saud. A 19th century oral poetic epic telling the tale of a rivalry between two heroes from Shammar and \`Annizah was published in 1992.The social context of pre-Islamic poetry: poetic imagery The Ruwallah were among the tribes that took part in the \\"Arab Revolt\\" against the Ottomans in 1916. Another northern branch of \`Annizah, the \`Amarat, was centered in the deserts of Iraq. According to the tribe's genealogists, the modern tribe in north Arabia is divided into the following branches: * Dhana Bishr (\\"children of Bishr\\") ‚Äì which includes the \`Amarat of Arabia ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî * Dhana Maslam ‚Äì which includes the Ruwallah of north Arabia. =\`Annazah in Nejd= The sparse chronicles of Nejd relating to the pre-Wahhabi era relate a process of penetration of the tribe into northern and western Nejd, where they began to claim pastures during the winter months.U.M. Al-Juhany, Najd before the Salafi Reform Movement, Ithaca Press, 2002 One 19th-century historian, Ibn La'bun, a descendant of \`Annizah who went by the tribal appellation of \\"Al-Wa'ili\\", recorded the story of the settlement of several \`Annizi families in Nejd, which he placed in the 14th century CE. In the 15th century, the region of Al-Qassim in northern Nejd was being rapidly settled through migration and the majority of this activity was by members of \`Annizah. In the early 18th century the Bedouins of \`Annizah are recorded to have reached as far as the gates of Riyadh, killing its ruler in battle. This battle was part of a tribal war in which Riyadh and its neighboring villages took sides. With the rise of the First Saudi State in the late 18th century, \`Annizah were among the tribes that adopted a favorable attitude towards this new power, but took little active part in supporting it militarily, due to their geographical location. The royal family of Saudi Arabia Al Saud family are the from the 'Annizah tribe,C.M. Doughty, Travels in Arabia Deserta with Al Saud having ancestry from Wa'il, the region's native inhabitants as well as the migratory \`Annizah. The Saud intermarried with their 'Annizah rivals, al Shammar, along with other powerful tribes to solidify their dynasty. Ibn Saud sired dozens of children by his many wives. He had at most four wives at a time, divorcing many times, making sure to marry into many of the noble clans and tribes within his territory, including the chiefs of the Bani Khalid, Ajman, and Shammar tribes, as well as the Al ash-Sheikh. \\"Role of Ikhwan in Early Saudi State\\" =20th century= Limited settlement of Bedouin tribesmen in nearby towns and villages has always been an ongoing process in the region. Settled families in \`Annizah are to be found not only in Saudi Arabia, where they are most numerous, but also in Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Ahwaz (Iran) and the West Bank, where the village of Anzah near Jenin is reportedly named after the tribe. The establishment of the modern borders of the Middle East dealt a severe blow to the Bedouin lifestyle of tribes such as \`Annizah, which were accustomed to raising their animals over wide areas spanning many modern states. Special arrangements were made in the early 20th century for these tribes, but the vast majority ended up settling within these new states and taking Saudi, Kuwaiti, Iraqi, Lebanese, Syrian, or Jordanian citizenship. These recently settled tribesman are often distinguished from their sedentary cousins by retaining tribal appellations such as al-\`Annizi or Al-Ruwaili as their surnames.

Roger de Busli was born in or around 1038. His surname comes from the town now known as Bully (near Neufch√¢tel-en-Bray, mentioned as Buslei ar. 1060, Busli 12th century.Fran√ßois de Beaurepaire, Les noms des communes et anciennes paroisses de la sine-Maritime, √©ditions Picard 1979. p. 54.) in Normandy, and he was likely born there.Scholars believe that the English word 'bully' derives from the surname of this early Norman lord.{cn} Busli was given lands in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Strafforth wapentake of Yorkshire. These had previously belonged to a variety of Anglo-Saxons, including Edwin, Earl of Mercia.David Hey, Medieval South Yorkshire and Rynold de Wynterwade, patriarch of the Wentworth family. By the time of the Domesday survey de Busli was tenant-in-chief of 86 manors in Nottinghamshire, 46 in Yorkshire, and others in Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and Leicestershire, plus one in Devon. They became the Honour of Blyth (later renamed the Honour of Tickhill), and within it, de Busli erected numerous castles, at Tickhill, Kimberworth, Laughton-en-le-Morthen and Mexborough. Much of the de Busli's family's leverage came from their familial relationships with the crown through the Counts of Eu. Lewis Christopher Loyd, Charles Travis Clay, David Charles Douglas, Published by Genealogical Publishing Company, 1975 Roger de Busli's wife Muriel was in favour with the queen, to whom she was probably a lady-in-waiting or a kinswoman, evident in the queen's grant to de Busli of the manor of Sandford upon his marriage.The Aristocracy of Norman England, Judith A. Green, Cambridge University Press, 1997 The de Buslis had one son, also called Roger, who died as an infant, thus leaving no heirs. (wikisource) Beatrix, probably Roger's daughter (or possibly his sister), married William, Count of Eu. De Busli died in the last years of the 11th century without an heir. His lands were given to Robert de Bell√™me, but de Bell√™me lost them in 1102 after he led a rebellion against Henry I. Ernulf de Busli, probably Roger's brother, may then have inherited some of the lands; these were then passed to his son Jordan and grandson Richard de Busli. Richard de Busli was co-founder of Roche Abbey, South Yorkshire with Richard FitzTurgis in 1147. The male line of the de Busli family ran out in 1213, and the de Busli family holdings passed into the family of Vipont through the marriage of Idonea de Busli with Robert de Vipont (Vieuxpont).The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Ordericus Vitalis, 1854Roger de Busli, Malty, Yorkshire, Maltbyonline References *The Origins of Some Anglo-Norman Families, Lewis C.

Convinced that this was not an acceptable test for a Salvage Drum, on January 1, 1998, the 'T' Salvage Drum (1A2T)What Is A T-Rated Salvage Drum became the UN recommended salvage packaging for international shipments. The US-DOT, per 49 CFR 173.3, also recognizes the 'T' Salvage Drum for shipments within the US. Unlike the original 49 CFR Salvage Drum requirement, the 'T' Salvage Drum is most commonly an steel drum that, meets UN Model Regulations test requirement 6.1.5.1.11, which specifies that when filled with water, the drum can qualify for Packing Group II and be dropped on its most critical orientation, and not leak.

The style follows the AA BB A CC DD musical form common for both cakewalks and rags, particularly after the earlier publication of Joplin's hit \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\".

It modulates to E-flat major (three flats) for the trio (C) section, returning to B-flat for the final (D) section. It is thought that Joplin wrote the trio and Marshall wrote the A, B and D strains.

At the Piano with Scott Joplin.(1990) Van Nuys, California: Alfred Publishing Co.

An L/34 gun is 34 times long as it is in diameter. The third gun, a L/28 gun, was placed in a turret aft. The secondary battery consisted of four L/36 guns in casemates were mounted below the forward main battery, and a fifth 5.9-inch gun was placed on the centerline on the same deck as the main battery. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included four L/22 guns, four 3-pounder guns, four 1-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder Hotchkiss revolver cannons. The ships were also armed with three torpedo tubes. Two tubes were placed on the broadside and one was mounted in the bow. The ships were armored with a mix of Creusot and compound steel. The main belt was thick amidships and reduced to on either end of the hull. At a normal displacement, the main belt extended for above the waterline. Under a full load, however, the belt was completely submerged below the waterline, rendering it largely ineffective. Above the belt, a strake of 3 in of armor covered the side of the vessels amidships. The main battery was protected by of armor with 12-inch thick barbettes.Brassey, p. 233 Hydra had an armored deck thick; the decks of Spetsai and Psara were increased to . Service history The 10 cm and 6.5 cm Canet guns installed on the Hydra-class vessels in their first modernization Hydra was built by the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire dockyard in St. Nazaire, while Spetsai and Psara were built at the Soci√©t√© Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e shipyard in Graville.The Chinese Times, p. 488 Hydra was launched on 15 May 1889.Laughton, p. 348 Spetsai was launched on 26 October 1889 and Psara followed on 20 February 1890.Neal, p. 603 All three ships were transferred to Piraeus and in service by 1892. Throughout their careers, the three Hydra-class ships generally operated together. The ships saw limited action in the Greco‚ÄìTurkish War in 1897, as the Royal Hellenic Navy was unable to make use of its superiority over the Ottoman Navy. The Ottoman Navy had remained in port during the conflict, but a major naval intervention of the Great Powers prevented the Greeks from capitalizing on their superiority. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the three ships were partially rearmed, with work lasting until 1900. Their small-caliber guns were replaced with one gun forward, eight guns, four 3-pounders, and ten 1-pounder revolver cannon. One of the 14-inch torpedo tubes was replaced with a weapon.Mason, p. 293 In 1908‚Äì1910, the ships' armament was again revised. The old 5.9 in guns were replaced with new, longer L/45 models.Gardiner & Gray, p. 383 The three ships saw action during the First Balkan War in 1912 at the Battle of Elli, alongside the powerful armored cruiser . At the subsequent Battle of Lemnos, the ships were left behind due to their slow speed and did not engage the Ottoman flotilla.Fotakis, p. 50 By 1914, Hydra and Psara had been reduced to secondary duties: Hydra became a gunnery training ship while Psara was used to train engine-room personnel.Fotakis, p. 78 During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and the Hydra-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and accommodation space for a decade.Paizis- Paradellis, pp. 78, 153, 166 All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.

The novel has a prequel and a sequel.  Plot Summary  The story is set in Brooklyn, New York. The main character is Winter Santiaga, the teenaged daughter of a local drug kingpin. Winter is brash and self-important; she says, ‚Äúit was important for me to know I deserved the best, no slum jewelry or knock-offs\\". The story is told from her perspective in slang that is highly influenced by the hip-hop culture. Due to the power of her father, Winter is infamous in her neighborhood, and she uses her power to get what she wants. This all changes when Winter‚Äôs father is arrested for drug trafficking, and Winter finds herself in a girls‚Äô home. Winter takes up the skills she learned from her father to maintain her lifestyle, such as selling illicit items in the girls‚Äô home to make money.  Characters  Winter Santiaga: The protagonist of the story. She is born to a teen mother and drug lord father during extreme winter weather. The story follows her life, first as a pampered child and adolescent of questionable morality. She is highly focused on attainment of material wealth and is also sexually promiscuous. After her father is arrested, Winter encounters much more strife, and eventually lands up repeating many of the mistakes and experiences of her parents. Simone: Winter‚Äôs nemesis. She is initially a coconspirator of Winter‚Äôs as they are involved in illegal activities together. She is eventually arrested while pregnant and is angry when Winter turns her back on her. As such, she seeks revenge, resulting in an escalating rivalry that becomes violent.

She is an advocate and role model for young black men and women. Ricky Santiaga: Winter‚Äôs father and he is depicted as a man who lavishes attention, love, and material gifts on the women in his life, while being a calculated and violent drug lord. He is depicted as an initially successful man who lets greed and his vices overpower him. Moms: Winter‚Äôs mother who is more sister than mother. She is a teen mother who seems to be content with her lot in life as long as she is provided material compensation for her sexual favors. She is not very maternal towards her family.

He is depicted as being ultimately selfish and focused on his own best interests. Mercedes Santiaga: Younger sister of Winter. Lexus Santiaga: Younger sister of Winter. Porsche Santiaga: Younger sister of Winter who takes after her. Lauren: Sister Souljah‚Äôs sister. Natalie: Winter‚Äôs friend. Midnight: Young yet strategic worker for Ricky Santiago. Smart, loyal, and mysterious. Winter's crush.  Reception  The Coldest Winter Ever was one of the best-selling novels of 1999, and since its debut, it has continued to enjoy success in sales year after year. As a result of this book, Sister Souljah cemented her role as a successful novelist. While the reviews of the book have been overwhelmingly positive, fans say the classification of the book as street lit/urban lit has diminished its status. Sister Souljah believes the splitting of fiction as such is a result of the exclusionary hierarchy of literature that sidelines authors of color. Sister Souljah told The Root in an interview, \\"I'm not in sync with this street-lit genre. I think that when European authors or Euro-American authors write about urban, suburban or rural areas, it's just called literature. So I call my work literature, and anyone who reads my books knows that it's literature.\\" A 1999 review in Publisher's Weekly commended and criticized Sister Souljah's writing style, calling it both \\"raw and true\\" and \\"rough and unsophisticated\\" in the same sentence. The reviewer called the book \\"honest...at the expense of disciplined writing.\\" Kirkus Reviews lauds the language, calling it a \\"frank\\" \\"tour de force\\", but criticizes Winter for her narcissism and materialism.  Themes  The novel deals with drugs, sex, prostitution, violence, greed, and the cycle of poverty. Sex is used throughout the novel as a means of currency, power, control, and expression of love. Moms's rapid descent into drug use and prostitution, eventually resulting in her death, provides the most extreme example. She has no marketable skills, and used her beauty as a means to provide for herself. She makes herself beautiful enough to be attractive to the wealthiest man. Ricky Santiga, the father of Winter, was a powerful street pharmasist, but due to the nature of their society, his skill was not put towards a legal profession and he was removed from the community. (Ricky Santiaga was not only a drug trafficker, he was a violent criminal as well, a tendency which continues after his incarceration.) After his incarceration, his wife has no safety net, and she does not have the means to continue making herself attractive. Her beauty regimen requires matching outfits, expensive makeup, regular hair care, and other expensive items. Without her husband, she reduces herself to prostituting herself for drugs and quickly becomes ill. All the characters show greed, a condition the fictional Sister Souljah believes is ubiquitous in her community and would like to remedy. The greed extends not just to money, but to power and sex as well. For example, Winter discovers that her father has a mistress who bore him a son. He was greedy for more children, for a son, for more women. His girlfriend wanted his money and access to his power. Winter wants money, power, beauty. Perhaps the only reason that she wants money and beauty is the access they afford her to power over others. Midnight is perhaps the only character who seems immune to greed and lust, as he \\"has plans\\" for living well legally.

Path 64 is part of The Western Electricity Coordinating Council's links of electrical intertie paths in the western United States. Path 64 is part of the Path 46 transmission system in southeastern California. This power line is operated by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). This line, along with Path 27, the Intermountain DC line and other Path 46 powerlines, supply over 10,000 megawatts of electrical power to the Los Angeles area. Path 64 is an essential line for powering Los Angeles. Route The 500 kV power line begins at the Adelanto substation, where two 500 kV lines from the San Fernando Valley and another from Victorville terminate. On top of that, this is where the Adelanto inverter station or the southern terminus of the HVDC Intermountain line (Path 27) is also located. As the line leaves Adelanto substation, the 500 kV line follows Highway 395 for a distance northwest. At Kramer Junction (intersection with State Route 58), the line turns east. The power line then meets the other Path 46 power lines from Victorville along with the Intermountain DC line near Newberry Springs and runs parallels with the them for a short distance; all of the lines at this point are now heading northeast. After a few miles, the line crosses over the other Path 46 and Intermountain DC lines and splits off of the corridor; heading towards the Interstate 15 where it runs alongside the highway through the desert until both descend into the Ivanpah Valley. Just prior to the California-Nevada border, the Path 64 line crosses the Interstate 15 once more before turning north and entering Nevada southeast of Primm where it rejoins with the Path 46 and Intermountain lines again north of the community. The now scattered power lines then head in a roughly northeast direction across the desert to the Eldorado - Marketplace - McCullough substation complex. Path 64 ends at the Marketplace substation, where Path 63, another long distance transmission line from Arizona also terminates.

Discovered in 1997, erbin is a 200kDa protein containing a PDZ domain.  Function  This gene is a member of the leucine-rich repeat and PDZ domain (LAP) family. The encoded protein contains 17 leucine-rich repeats and one PDZ domain. It binds to the unphosphorylated form of the ERBB2 protein and regulates ERBB2 function and localization. It has also been shown to affect the Ras signaling pathway by disrupting Ras-Raf interaction. Alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, but only two of them have been characterized to date.  Clinical significance  Erbin's C-terminal PDZ domain is able to bind to ErbB2, a protein tyrosine kinase which is often associated with poor prognosis in epidermal oncogenesis.

He was the first son of Nakai Shuan (d. 1758), one of the Kaitokud≈ç's two founders, and was influenced by his teacher and mentor Goi Ranju (‰∫î‰∫ïËò≠Ê¥≤:1697-1762). He became the administrative head of the Kaitokud≈ç in 1797 during the Tokugawa period in Japan. An extrovert known for his bureaucratic skills and his firm precise kanji, Chikuzan was vastly different in demeanour to his brother Nakai Riken, although their underlying epistemologies, beliefs and degree of tenacious individualism were similar. They both focused on the epistemological study of virtue in the merchant class of Tokugawa Japan, furthering the work of Goi Ranju and consolidating previous thought around the Kaitokud≈ç school. Together, through their scholarly works they would bring a level of prestige to the Kaitokud≈ç with their study of virtue. Ultimately they wanted to reconcile merchants and contemporary views of merchants in Tokugawa society.  Life and Philosophy  The first son of Nakai Shuan, one of the two main founders of the Kaitokudo, he was just as adept in the external bureaucratic maneuvering of administration as his father. He attended the Kaitokudo from a young age, where his interests in the epistemological study of virtue were cultivated by the scholar Goi Ranju. Both felt that education should be their primary concern rather than working on the side to supplement their income, something symptomatic of many Jusha who preferred to operate pharmacies on the side. This earned them scorn from many of the Osaka merchants who contributed to the school's cost of operation. Both he and his brother Rikan took care of the elderly Goi in his later years, something for which both are remembered. While he was of superior intellectual capabilities compared to the successor his father supported in the academy, Miyake Shunro, his father subtly made a position of leadership for his son. Shuan left a fund of twenty kan to insure against emergencies to be managed by Chikuzan. In this way Shunro would be responsible for formal activities and Chikuzan would be in charge of financial activities \\"to assure the immortality of the academy-Eitai s≈çzoku no y≈ç\\". (Najita 151‚Äì152). Chikuzan whole-heartedly denounced Ogy≈´ Sorai and contended that all people have potential, even commoners could become scholars, while he also denounced religion and superstition.  Works  *Hi- Cho ‚Äì an emotional work written to denounce Ogy≈´ Sorai and his historicism.

This body of work upset his brother due to the work's apologetic bias. This bias also earned him the respect and affection of the Bakufu. A work that reflects his own form of realpolitik. This was a way for him to gain assurance from the Bakufu to continue running the Kaitokudo but corrupted his academic integrity. *Sobo kigen  Legacy References * Najita, Tetsuo.

His father was a construction worker who wanted nothing to do with him and would not accept any financial responsibility for him. Gary met his biological father only once, when he was 12 years old. Gary's mother was extremely poor and, as a result, they frequently relocated. He was malnourished most of the time and was often left with his aunt or great-aunt, both maids for elderly, wealthy women. In elementary school, Gary suffered serious head trauma when he was knocked unconscious in a playground accident. In his teens, he was a heavy drug user. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he was arrested numerous times for robbery, arson and assault. During that time, he married a woman named Sheila, and had two children. In 1970, he moved to Albany, New York, where he had plans to become a singer, but he continued with his criminal activities. Murders In May 1970, soon after Carlton Gary moved to Albany, an elderly woman named Marion Brewer was robbed and attacked in her hotel room. Two months later, 85-year-old Nellie Farmer was robbed in her apartment and strangled to death. After Gary attempted an assault on a third elderly woman, he was arrested and his fingerprints matched one left at the scene of the Farmer murder. Gary admitted having taken part in a robbery, but he claimed that an accomplice, John Lee Mitchell, was responsible for the actual murder. Gary testified against Mitchell in court, and Mitchell was charged, despite no material evidence connecting him to the crime. Gary was charged only with robbery, a sentence he served in the Onondaga County Correctional Institution in Jamesville, New York. He was paroled in 1975 and moved to Syracuse, New York. Here, two more elderly women were attacked, raped, and strangled in their homes; one died but the other survived. The attacks occurred within four days of each other. The two survivors were not able to identify Gary positively, as the crimes occurred in the dark; at least one victim was sure that her attacker was a mustachioed black male, and she was strangled with a scarf. Gary was never charged for any of these crimes but was instead sent back to prison for parole violation and robbery after he was caught trying to sell coins stolen from the same apartment building as one of the surviving Syracuse victims. On August 22, 1977, Gary escaped from his low- security prison by sawing through the bars of his cell and made it back to Columbus, Georgia. One month after his escape, on September 16, 1977, 60-year- old Ferne Jackson was raped, beaten, and strangled to death with a nylon stocking at her home in the Wynnton district of Columbus. Nine days later, 71-year-old Jean Dimenstein was killed similarly as were 89-year-old Florence Scheible on October 21 and 69-year-old Martha Thurmond on October 25. On December 28, Gary struck again, raping and killing 74-year-old Kathleen Woodruff. This time, there was no stocking left at the scene. Two months later on February 12, 1978, Ruth Schwob was attacked, but she triggered a bedside alarm and her assailant fled. He went just two blocks down the road before breaking into another house and raping and strangling 78-year-old Mildred Borom. His final victim was 61-year-old Janet Cofer, murdered on April 20, 1978. Police announced that they suspected an African-American man of the murders. Things became more complicated when a man calling himself the \\"Chairman of the Forces of Evil\\" threatened to murder selected black women if the Stocking Strangler was not stopped. This turned out to be an African- American male (William Henry Hance) trying to cover up three murders of his own by putting the blame onto white vigilantes. The Chairman was arrested on April 4, and police hoped that this was the Stocking Strangler, but their hopes were dashed when Cofer was murdered. In December 1978, following a robbery in Gaffney, South Carolina, Gary was arrested, and he confessed and was sentenced to 21 years in prison for armed robbery. He escaped from custody on March 15, 1983, coincidentally 35 years to the day before his execution, and remained at large for a year before he was apprehended again. New evidence had come to light, including a gun that was traced back to Gary and a possible fingerprint match that led the police to believe that Gary was the murderer they were looking for. Overall, Gary is alleged to have raped and/or murdered seven elderly women between 1977 and 1978 in Columbus. Known there as the Stocking Strangler, in three of the cases he was convicted of beating, sexually assaulting and strangling the victims, mostly by using stockings. Two of the survivors testified that he strangled them into unconsciousness before raping or attempting to rape them. The one Georgia survivor positively identified him as her attacker in court. However, she had previously positively identified three other black men as the attacker and, in her initial statement, had indicated that it was too dark to even distinguish the race of the attacker. His fingerprints were found at four of the crime scenes. Gary was indicted for the murders on May 5, 1984, convicted on August 26, 1986, and sentenced to death the following day. Controversy Questions have been raised over the propriety of Gary's conviction. According to a group of supporters and a book by investigative journalist David Rose, Gary's lawyer was refused state funding to carry out a defense. There is also evidence that Gary's fingerprints were not held to match the crime scene prints until seven years after, when the case was re-examined, despite Gary having been printed just one year after the murder, at a time when all prints in the U.S. were being compared to prints found at the crime sites. They also claim Gary's interview at which he supposedly confessed was not recorded, nor were notes taken, and Gary's confession was written by a police officer in the days following the interview, from his own recollection. When submitted as evidence, the confession was unsigned and undated, and Gary denied having made it. They allege Gary's semen antigen secretion did not match the perpetrator's. Furthermore, a cast made from a bite wound on a victim allegedly did not match Gary's bite-mark pattern although it was noted that he had had dental work in prison subsequent to the victims' deaths. His supporters claimed that the prosecution withheld this evidence at trial. Rose's book also links prosecutors, judges and police who worked on the case to a whites-only organization called The Big Eddy Club and traces the history of racial injustice in Columbus, including the role of the judge's family members in lynchings and other injustices in the city. In 2007, Gary was positively linked through DNA to the rape and murder case of white 40-year-old Marion Fisher. Marion was raped and murdered after leaving a bar in Nedrow, New York, in 1975.  Execution  On December 1, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Gary's latest appeal, clearing the way for an execution date to be set. On December 4, a court set a December 16 execution date for Gary. On December 15, the state Board of Pardons and Paroles denied a request to stay his execution. On December 16, only hours before the execution, the Georgia Supreme Court halted the execution to hold a hearing and determine whether DNA tests should be conducted to determine Gary's guilt or innocence. On February 23, 2018, a new execution date was set for March 15, 2018. On March 15, 2018, Carlton Gary was executed by lethal injection. He died at 10:33pm and declined to make a final statement.

The poem, as given in Joseph Jacobs' 1890 rendition, is as follows: Illustration by Arthur Rackham in English Fairy Tales by Flora Annie Steel, 1918 > Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, Be he alive, or be he > dead I'll grind his bones to make my bread. Though the rhyme is tetrametric, it follows no consistent metrical foot; however, the lines correspond roughly to a monosyllabic tetrameter, a dactylic tetrameter, a trochaic tetrameter, and an iambic tetrameter respectively. The poem has historically made use of assonant half rhyme. Origin The rhyme appears in the 1596 pamphlet \\"Haue with You to Saffron-Walden\\" written by Thomas Nashe, who mentions that the rhyme was already old and its origins obscure: In William Shakespeare's play King Lear (c. 1605), the character Edgar exclaims: > Fie, foh, and fum, I smell the blood of a British man. The verse in King Lear makes use of the archaic word \\"fie\\", used to express disapproval. This word is used repeatedly in Shakespeare's works: King Lear shouts, \\"Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!\\", and in Antony and Cleopatra, Mark Antony exclaims, \\"O fie, fie, fie!\\" The earliest known printed version of the Jack the Giant-Killer tale appears in The history of Jack and the Giants (Newcastle, 1711) and this, and later versions (found in chapbooks), include renditions of the poem, recited by the giant Thunderdell: > Fee, fau, fum, I smell the blood of an English man, Be alive, or be he dead, > I'll grind his bones to make my bread. > Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum. I smell the blood of an Englishman, Be he living, or be he > dead, I‚Äôll grind his bones to mix my bread. Charles Mackay proposes in The Gaelic Etymology of the Languages of Western Europe that the seemingly meaningless string of syllables \\"Fa fe fi fo fum\\" is actually a coherent phrase of ancient Gaelic, and that the complete quatrain covertly expresses the Celts' cultural detestation of the invading Angles and Saxons: * Fa from (fa!) \\"behold!\\" or \\"see!\\" * Fe from Fiadh (fee-a) \\"food\\"; * Fi from fi√∫ \\"good to eat\\" * Fo from fogh (f√≥) \\"sufficient\\" and * Fum from feum \\"hunger\\". Thus \\"Fa fe fi fo fum!\\" becomes \\"Behold food, good to eat, sufficient for my hunger!\\" See also * Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey, five mice who traveled to and circled the Moon on Apollo 17, four nicknamed after the poem References Category:English poems ","title":"Fee-fi-fo-fum"},{"id":"10363020","text":"Howard Pennett Cooper, CBE (born 17 April 1949) is an English former first- class cricketer, who played for Yorkshire from 1971 to 1980, and for Northern Transvaal in the 1973/4 season Cooper was born in Great Horton, Bradford, Yorkshire.

Produced by her son, Ravi Coltrane, who also played, it is the final album of Coltrane's career. Her third son with her deceased husband John Coltrane, Oran, also plays on the record. In addition to original compositions by Alice Coltrane, it includes two compositions by John Coltrane and four covers of traditional works. Background Translinear Light was Coltrane's first commercial album following a 26-year hiatus, during which she was \\"home most often, focused on contemplation and inner growth.\\" She recorded Translinear Light at the encouragement of her sons Ravi and Oran. Ravi Coltrane stated: \\"I always felt like there was a gap that was widening ‚Äî any idea of us being two professional working musicians at the same time was just evaporating. I was getting deeper and deeper into music and each year she would say she was more and more retired from music. I think about those times I had opportunities to play professionally with my mother, but I was new to it and not ready. I wanted some document that I'll always be able to share with my kids. I don't want to have a day of regret, saying, 'I never did this with my mom.'\\" Alice Coltrane recalled: \\"Well, I told my children I'm so happy to do this, but I‚Äôm not starting a second career!\\" \\"My son was... practically pleading, 'Mom, you must do this, you have to!' It sort of originated from him, 'Mom, please make a record, make a CD.' So I said okay and this is what we did.\\" Recordings for the album took place at five different locations on dates ranging from April 28, 2000 to June 12, 2004. Coltrane scholar Ashley Kahn wrote: \\"The title is a play on the Coltrane name, and also a nod to Alice Coltrane's deep spirituality.\\" With regard to the title, he quotes Coltrane: \\"Look at what trance means... It means to transcend... it means to become transcendental! So if we get a singular transcendental path of light, that could lead to such great dimensions of consciousness, of revelation, of spirituality, of spiritual power.\\"  Reception  Ekow Eshun, writing for The Observer (UK) in 2004 said, 'Translinear Light is less of a comeback than a continuation of where she left off. Coltrane eschews the harp, her most well-known instrument, for piano and Wurlitzer organ. And while the album doesn't touch the heights of a record like 1970's Journey in Satchidananda, it's more focused than her later work in the Seventies'. JazzTimes reviewer David R. Adler described the album as \\"momentous,\\" stating that it \\"channels the raw magic of Alice Coltrane‚Äôs classic early albums without recapitulating old ideas. There is a relevance and sonic freshness in her Wurlitzer organ, her synthesizer, her piano... Translinear Light is seamless, and wholly refreshing.\\" John Kelman, writing in AllAboutJazz, called the disc \\"a richly rewarding album of music that has little to do with music as an exercise in technique and more as a means of conveying deeper expression... With Translinear Light Coltrane has created a work that honestly and unassumingly demonstrates the healing power of music, bypassing more intellectual concerns and instead going straight for the heart of the matter.\\" AllMusic reviewer Thom Jurek wrote: \\"Translinear Light is a major entry in Coltrane's catalog. It is a defining, aesthetically brilliant statement from a master composer, improviser, and player. If ever there were a candidate for jazz album of 2004, Translinear Light is it.\\" Track listingPersonnel *Alice Coltrane ‚Äî piano or Wurlitzer organ; synthesizer on \\"The Hymn\\" *Ravi Coltrane ‚Äî tenor saxophone on \\"Jagadishwar,\\" \\"Blue Nile,\\" \\"Crescent,\\" and \\"Leo\\"; soprano saxophone on \\"Translinear Light\\"; percussion on \\"Sita Ram\\" and \\"Translinear Light\\"; sleigh bells on \\"Leo\\" *Oran Coltrane ‚Äî alto saxophone on \\"The Hymn\\" *Charlie Haden ‚Äî bass on \\"Translinear Light,\\" \\"This Train,\\" \\"Crescent,\\" and \\"Troika\\" *James Genus ‚Äî bass on \\"Walk with Me,\\" \\"Jagadishwar,\\" and \\"Blue Nile\\" *Jack De Johnette ‚Äî drums on \\"Sita Ram,\\" \\"Translinear Light,\\" \\"This Train,\\" and \\"Crescent,\\" and \\"Leo\\" *Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts ‚Äî drums on \\"Walk with Me,\\" \\"Jagadishwar,\\" and \\"Blue Nile\\" *The Sai Anantam Ashram Singers ‚Äî vocals on \\"Satya Sai Isha\\" References Category:2004 albums Category:Alice Coltrane albums Category:Impulse!

R5, 543 words, Sarah Efron, Special to The Globe and Mail He has written several books on Buddhism and Buddhist practice including Refuge Recovery: A Buddhist Path to Recovering from Addiction. Early life Noah Levine is the son of American Buddhist author Stephen Levine. His parents had a history of addiction and, when he was very young, they divorced. He states he has had a \\"core distrust of authority\\" his whole life, which led him to reject the teachings of his father. At the age of five, Levine began exhibiting suicidal behavior and the next year began smoking marijuana. He discovered punk rock through the boyfriend of his older sister and the first time he heard the Sex Pistols \\"was like hearing the voice of God\\" because it expressed all the dissatisfaction he felt. His teenage years were filled with drugs, violence, multiple suicide attempts and detentions at juvenile halls, which was encouraged by the punk scene. In 1988 and after three felonies and one suicide attempt while jailed, he hit \\"an emotional rock bottom\\" and \\"realized\\" his addiction; in a desperate attempt to relieve his fear and uncertainty he tried to apply the anapanasati techniques his father taught him, and saw for the first time how this practice worked. Shortly afterward, he became highly involved in the straight edge scene (a hardcore punk associated movement whose members avoid drug and alcohol use), attended a twelve-step program and began a meditation practice. He was trained by Jack Kornfield of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California. Later, he earned a master's degree in counseling psychology from the California Institute of Integral Studies. Career He currently leads Dharma and vipassana meditation retreats and workshops across the United States and teaches weekly meditation classes in Los Angeles. A member of the Prison Dharma Network, Levine works with juvenile and adult prison inmates, combining meditation techniques with psychotherapy although he is not a licensed therapist or psychotherapist. He \\"[explores] how they can have a deeper understanding of what has happened and what they need to do in order to be free, on many levels‚Äîfree from prison, free from the trauma of the past.\\" He has helped found several groups and projects including the Mind Body Awareness Project, a non-profit organization that serves incarcerated youths, and Refuge Recovery, an addiction recovery community. Allegations of sexual misconduct In March 2018, Against the Stream released a statement that they were investigating allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of Noah Levine. \\"It is with great regret we announce that we have received reports of sexual misconduct by Noah Levine which require an investigation. During the investigative process we are required to suspend Noah‚Äôs teaching activities with Against the Stream and his membership on the Board of Directors.\\" Levine denied the accusations, stating in a letter to the community \\"This never happened.\\" The ATS Grievance Council retained attorney Roberta Yang to independently investigate the accusations against Levine. In August 2018, ATS released a statement announcing that Yang and the Board of Directors had concluded that the preponderance of evidence indicated that Levine had likely violated the Third Precept of the ATS Teacher's Code of Ethics, which requires teachers to \\"avoid creating harm through sexuality,\\" with multiple women. Levine was removed from the ATS Board of Directors, and the Board announced that its centers in Melrose, Santa Monica, and San Francisco would close as a result of financial difficulties stemming from the allegations against Levine. In a Facebook livestream shortly following the announcement of the closing of ATS, Levine clarified that there were no accusations from ATS students. The report prepared for ATS was leaked in fall 2018 and some details appeared to contradict Levine's claims. On February 20, 2019, Spirit Rock Meditation Center's Ethics and Reconciliation Council released a statement that the organization and Dr. Jack Kornfield rescinded his authorization to teach. Spirit Rock had previously indefinitely suspended Levine from teaching there, pending the investigation by the ATS organization, which was founded by Levine. That investigation, completed in August, concluded that showed Levine had likely violated the Third Precept, ‚Äúto avoid creating harm through sexuality‚Äù and was followed by the dissolution of ATS. The EAR Council then ‚Äúconducted its own investigation, a long and careful process of collecting information from numerous sources in order to determine Mr. Levine‚Äôs fitness for teaching.\\" Books and beliefs  One notable aspect of Buddhist Dharma is the path of our choices, the actions past and present and the intention for future action (Buddhist Law of Karma). Levine's past‚Äîaddiction, incarceration, violence, initial rejection of Buddhism and meditation‚Äîare all defining characteristics of his writings and teachings. \\"We all sort of have a different doorway to dharma or spiritual practice. Suffering is a doorway. For me it was the suffering of addiction, violence and crime which opened me at a young age, 17 years old. I was incarcerated, looking at the rest of my life in prison and thought, 'Maybe I will try dad's hippie meditation bullshit.' Suffering opened me to the possibility of trying meditation.\\" In Levine's second book, Against the Stream, released in April 2007, \\"he presents what he has learned about and through Buddhism\\"Against the Stream: A Buddhist Manual for Spiritual Revolutionaries, Publishers Weekly Reviews, April 23, 2007, REVIEWS; Nonfiction; Pg. 47, 240 words, Staff and \\"clearly returns to such central ideas as impermanence and suffering\\".

He was self-taught in palaeontology and became an authority on the taxonomy of the trilobite order Lichida and the trilobite family Encrinuridae.  Early life  Encouraged by his school science master, Ron enthusiastically collected Tertiary fossils in Suffolk. He later collected in the Cretaceous rocks of Kent and Sussex, and Ordovician rocks of the Girvan area. The latter material was used in the studies of F.R.C. Reed. He trained as a Spitfire pilot in World War II, and published his first paper in 1954 on the Ordovician trilobites of Girvan. Many other papers would follow. He was employed by British Cake and Oils from early on until about 1970.  Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology  During preparation of the first edition of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Cyril James Stubblefield asked Tripp to step in to write the Lichid section of the Trilobite volume, in place of Elsa Warburg, who had died before her work was complete. As part of this ambitious effort, Tripp established the new family, Lichakephalidae.  Work on the Encrinuridae  By the time Tripp had begun working on the Treatise, he became interested in the tuberculated family of trilobites---the Encrinuridae. Elaborating on the work of Russian palaeontologist, Elsa Rosenstein, Tripp began developing an innovative system of distinguishing encrinurid taxa on the basis of the arrangement of their glabellar tubercles. For the next several decades, this was an important part of encrinurine diagnoses. For example, he used glabellar tubercle arrangement to help characterize \\"species groups\\" that F.R.C. Reed had recognized within Encrinurus. This set the groundwork for an eventual major splitting of a genus that had become a virtual garbage pail of encrinurids. While he did author some of these genera himself to ease this confusion, he was extremely cautious to avoid over-splitting and creating too many names.  Later years  While as Research Associate at the Natural History Museum (London) and Royal Ontario Museum, Tripp conducted numerous trilobite studies, particularly concerning encrinurid taxonomy. His colleagues and co-authors during or prior to that time included Euan Clarkson, Bill Evitt, Richard Fortey, Chris Gass, Yvonne Howells, Keith Ingham, Rolf Ludvigsen, David Rudkin, Cyril James Stubblefield, John Temple, Steve Tunnicliff, Harry Whittington, and Zhou Zhi-yi. Ron's wife, Doris, whom he had met during his years in Scotland, died in 1980. He married Phyllis Forrest in 1981, and died at their home in Toronto in 2001.

Matthew James Wood (born 6 April 1977, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England) is a former English first-class cricketer who played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Glamorgan in a career lasting eleven years. He was a right- handed batsman and occasional off spinner, who made his debut in first-class cricket in 1997.

Section 287(g) allows the DHS and law enforcement agencies to make agreements, which require the state and local officers to receive training and work under the supervision of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE provides the officers with authorization to identify, process, and‚Äîwhen appropriate‚Äîdetain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-enforcement activity. Section 287(g), codified at , was added by section 133 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Division C, Title I of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, ).  Implementation  ICE currently requires participating officers to undergo a four-week training process. Of 15,338 local police and sheriff offices in the United States, only 37 participated in 287(g) as of March 2017. Local officials who have chosen not to participate or discontinued the program cite as their reasons program costs, disruptions to their relationship with local residents, bad publicity, and a desire to focus on criminal law enforcement as opposed to federal civil laws including immigration laws. Between 2006 and 2015, over 402,000 immigrants were identified for deportation through ¬ß 287(g).https://web.archive.org/web/20170228155736/https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Implementing- the-Presidents-Border-Security-Immigration-Enforcement-Improvement- Policies.pdf  History  287(g) programs were originally used to deport criminals who were screened while in jail. Then, in 2006, officers under the sheriff of Charlotte, North Carolina, Jim Pendergraph, began screening the public for violations of civil immigration law. This began the \\"task force model\\" of 287(g) in addition to the original jail-based model. Pendergraph was later appointed chief of ICE‚Äôs Office of State and Local Coordination, and in this position he expanded the task force model to other communities. At the close of 2012, ICE reported that it had decided to discontinue its agreements under the task force model, saying that \\"other enforcement programs, including Secure Communities, are a more efficient use of resources.\\" Participation of localities in the 287(g) program reduced from a peak of 72 localities in 2011 to 37 in March 2017. Chris Newman, National Day Laborer Organizing Network's legal director, reported in early 2017 that he thought the 287(g) program was coming to a close. However, Donald Trump asked the Department of Homeland Security to build more 287(g) partnerships in a January 2017 executive order. Commentators speculate that his planned expansion includes a return to the \\"task force\\" model. Subsequently, a number of sheriffs requested to join the 287(g) program in the early months of the Trump administration.  Civil rights violations  The US Justice Department has found that some localities participating in the 287(g) program have used their authority to commit large scale pattern or practice constitutional violations. For example, Maricopa, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio used his authority under ¬ß 287(g) to justify sweeps during which Latinos were illegally racially profiled. Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute described the situation there by saying, \\"there were people in yellow suits running around catching Hispanics.\\" In Alamance County, NC, sheriff‚Äôs deputies established checkpoints at entrances to Latino neighborhoods where Latino drivers were ten times more likely to be stopped than non-Latino drivers. It was also found that for the same traffic violations, Latino drivers were frequently arrested, whereas non-Latino drivers merely received citations. In February 2017, the ACLU cited numerous instances of civil rights violations, patterns of racial discrimination, and patterns of improper behavior among ¬ß 287(g) participating localities, and urged ICE to discontinue the program on the grounds that these localities could not be trusted to attend to constitutional and civil rights.  Support and opposition  The National Sheriffs' Association has issued a position paper supporting the expansion of the 287(g) program, stating: \\"It is critical that local law enforcement maintain and build upon the partnerships with federal law enforcement to ensure that collectively we can promote, protect, and preserve the public safety and homeland security.\\"; see also, http://www.cis.org/articles/2012/nsa-position-paper-on-immigration-and-border- security.pdf The International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association have both issued statements opposing police participation in immigration enforcement on the grounds that it interferes with the \\"trust, communication, and cooperation\\" between police and the immigrant community that are necessary for police to maintain public order. Report from the Chair of the Legislative Committee for the Major Cities Chiefs Association to the House Committee on Homeland Security The Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, composed of 63 sheriffs and police chiefs signed a letter asserting that they don‚Äôt want their officers acting as immigration enforcement agents. 287(g) has also been strongly opposed by the ACLU, the American Immigration Council, and the Southern Center for Human Rights.

As a right-arm fast bowler, he played first class cricket for five counties Yorkshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Sussex and Leicestershire between 2004 and 2017. Shahzad made his international debut for England in a Twenty20 International in February 2010. He went on to play 3 Twenty20 internationals, 11 One Day Internationals and one Test match (against Bangladesh in 2010) for his country. Following his playing career, Shahzad initially became an assistant coach at Marylebone Cricket Club's youth team.. He succeeded Steve Kirby as the club's Head Coach in February 2019. Family and education Shahzad's father is an accountant by profession, who played club cricket for Idle, West Yorkshire. Ajmal Shahzad grew up in Bradford, where he attended Bradford Grammar School and Woodhouse Grove School; he lived close to fellow cricketer Adil Rashid. Shahzad studied four months of pharmacy at Bradford University before transferring to Leeds Metropolitan University to study sports science to enhance his cricket career. Domestic career In 2004, he became the first Yorkshire-born player of Asian extraction to play for Yorkshire. In his only first-class appearance in 2006, he failed to take a wicket, and scored just two runs. He enjoyed more success in the shorter formats of the game, claiming five wickets and 18 runs in four List A matches for his native county, and in his sole Twenty20 appearance, he took 2 wickets. In 2009, Shahzad took 40 wickets and scored 445 runs in the lower middle order. His performances gained him a call up to the England performance squad on a tour of South Africa, where he impressed coach Andy Flower. In the 2011 County Championship he managed 25 wickets at a bowling average of 41.00. In September, Shahzad was reprimanded for scuffing the pitch during the penultimate Championship match against Warwickshire and fined ¬£750. The club was relegated from the First Division in the final match of the season. Shahzad regretted the incident, explaining \\"It's not the way I want to play my game. I don't want to be seen as a cheat, or a pitch-damager. ... It's one mistake I've made in an eight- or nine-year career so far. It's out of the blue for me, and I definitely would never do anything like it again. It was just a random, stupid act.\\" In April 2012 Yorkshire's new bowling coach, Jason Gillespie, praised Shahzad's efforts, saying \\"Ajmal has got himself in as good a condition as he's ever been in his first-class career. He's worked incredibly hard, and I think he's a fantastic bowler, a very exciting bowler.\\" However, on 1 May 2012, it was announced that Shahzad was to leave Yorkshire and a week later he joined Lancashire on loan for the rest of the season. On 10 October 2012, having been told he was free to leave Yorkshire, Shahzad signed a three-year contract to join Nottinghamshire. On 7 November 2014, he was released a year early from his Nottinghamshire contract and signed a three-year contract with Sussex. On 10 July 2017, Shahzad departed Sussex after his contract was terminated by mutual agreement. International career In January 2010, he was named in the Test and ODI squads for the England tour of Bangladesh. On his debut for England in a Twenty20 International against Pakistan, he claimed two wickets, both in his first over. He then made his ODI d√©but against Bangladesh, again taking a wicket in his first over. When Bangladesh toured England a few months later, he made his Test debut in the second Test, replacing the injured Tim Bresnan. After only scoring 5 runs in England's innings and an expensive first bowling spell, he took 3 wickets in 3 overs in his second spell as Bangladesh failed to reach the follow-on target. Pakistan toured England in July and Shahzad was included in England's 12-man squad for the first Test. A week before the match, he twisted his ankle whilst playing for Yorkshire. As he was still experiencing discomfort the day before the Test, England chose to play Tim Bresnan instead of Shahzad. Though pundits had expected Shahzad to be included in England's squad for the 2010‚Äì11 Ashes, he was omitted from the 16-man touring party. However, he was included in the performance squad who were training in Australia and ready to provide cover in the event of injuries. He was not called upon in the Tests, but played two T20Is against Australia and the first five of the seven ODIs that followed. He took 6 wickets at an average of 40.50 before a hamstring injury in the fifth match ruled him out of the rest of the series. Shahzad was included in England's 15-man squad for the 2011 ICC World Cup held in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka in March 2011. He managed three wickets from two appearances in the tournament, but suffered a recurrence of the hamstring injury against Australia forcing him out of the tournament prematurely. On his return to Yorkshire, he struggled for form so was left out of the England Test and ODI squads to face Sri Lanka in 2011. He was selected in the England Performance Programme held over the 2011-12 English off-season, but never played international cricket again.

The mall is also a regular filming location on several productions, including Better Call Saul and Daybreak. It features over 100 stores and restaurants, as well as a Regal Cinemas (formerly United Artists) Theater. Cottonwood Mall is managed by Washington Prime Group. The mall‚Äôs parking area has several dining establishments, including BJ's Restaurant & Brewery, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin, Texas Roadhouse, and New Mexican cuisine restaurants like Gardu√±os, Los Cuates, and Range Cafe. In May 2014, as part of Simon Property Group's spinoff of smaller malls, ownership of the mall was transferred to Simon spinoff Washington Prime Group, although Simon was retained as the mall's manager until early 2016. Washington Prime would later become WP Glimcher, and take over management of the mall. However in that same year WP Glimcher was renamed back to Washington Prime Group. Former tenants include Sega City amusement arcade, Sears which was prior a Montgomery Ward, and Macy's which was once a Foley's, and a Mervyn's. Hobby Lobby, Conn's, and Mor Furniture have since replaced Macy‚Äôs and Mervyns. Sega City was converted into a second story for Regal Cinemas. History Cottonwood Mall was built on part of an 89,000 acre parcel of land given by King Philip IV of Spain in 1710 to Francisco Montes Vigil, who later sold the land, which included only some farmland along the Rio Grande, to Captain Juan Gonzales of the Spanish Army. The land grant is known as the \\"Alameda Land Grant\\" (alameda means \\"cottonwood grove\\" in Spanish). In 1929, 20,500 acres were purchased by Albert F. Black who established the Seven Bar Ranch. The Black family built an adobe home and in 1947 a small airport which was known as the Seven Bar Airport, and later the Alameda Airport. Surrounded by growing urban areas, the Black family sold off much of the remaining ranch for the development of new residential subdivisions. The Alameda Airport remained in operation until 1986, when it was closed to make way for 1983 plans for the 95 acre mall project. When Cottonwood Mall opened in July 1996, it was the first regional mall to open in Albuquerque in thirty years.Shopping Centers Today To this day, and with the exception of a new mall under construction in the South Valley, it is the newest completed enclosed shopping mall in New Mexico.http://www.simon.com/mall/LeasingSheet%5CCottonwood.pdf Original anchors included Dillard's, Foley's, JCPenney, Mervyn's, and Montgomery Ward.

Originally refusing to take the Canadian citizenship oath because it would require him to swear allegiance to royalty, Bar-Natan later decided to become a citizen but publicly announced his intention to renounce the oath immediately after becoming a citizen. He is married to mathematician Yael Karshon and is the father of two sons, Assaf and Itai. Research In 1999, Bar-Natan collaborated on a paper with the goal of mathematically refuting claims made in The Bible Code by Michael Drosnin that hidden messages could be deciphered from within the bible. In particular, the paper demonstrated that practically any \\"code\\" could be found within the Bible, thereby debunking Drosnin's \\"discovery\\" of specific codes. This work is outside the main scope of his academic interests, although he is known for it because of the popularity of The Bible Code.Bar-Natan, D with Brendan McKay, Gil Kalai and Maya Bar-Hillel; Statistical Science 14-2 (1999) 150-173.

The Copenhagen XI only competed in the above mentioned editions of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cups. All other tournaments involving a Copenhagen team were contested by individual clubs from Copenhagen. Usually St√¶vnet would feature players from its member clubs exclusively, but players were often borrowed from other Danish clubs. In the two matches against Chelsea F.C. in 1958 the team featured 8 and 7 Frem players respectively. Most of the matches played by St√¶vnet were exhibition matches either against its Danish competitor Alliancen, or against foreign, often British, teams, sometimes displaying a common St√¶vnet/Alliancen team. On 10 May 1960 it played the Brazilian 1958 World Champions in an unofficial international arranged in collaboration with the Danish FA and Alliancen. The Brazilian team won the match by 4‚Äì3.

Biography He was born on 4 April 1714, as son of Jan Krasi≈Ñski and El≈ºbieta Teresa So≈Çtyk, brother of Micha≈Ç Hieronim Krasi≈Ñski. In his early years he was a supporter of king Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski during the War of the Polish Succession which begun in 1733. A year later he joined the Dzik√≥w Confederation and acted as its diplomatic emissary to Paris. He attended universities in Paris, and later, in 1737, in Rome. In 1747 he matriculated from the Jagiellonian University. With support of Andrzej Stanis≈Çaw Za≈Çuski he became canon of P≈Çock and joined the chancellery of king Augustus III of Poland. In 1751 he was P≈Çock's delegate to the Crown Tribunal. Next year, in 1752, with support of Jerzy August Mniszech he became the Great Crown Secretary. In 1753 he became the canon of Gniezno. In 1757 he became the prelate scholasticus of Gniezno and received the Order of the White Eagle. In 1758 he was the president of the Crown Tribunal and became the bishop of Kamieniec (now Kamianets-Podilskyi). Opponent of Familia's reforms in 1763; supporter of the hetman's faction and House of Wettin. In 1764 his actions interrupted the sejmik in GrudziƒÖdz. Political opponent of Familia's King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Joined the Radom Confederation in 1767 and for a short time supported Gabriel Podoski and Nicholas Repnin's plans against Poniatowski. From 1768 to 1772 one of the leaders of the Bar Confederation, considered by some to be the first Polish uprising. It was formed by Polish nobility who opposed Russian intervention into Polish internal politics; Krasi≈Ñski also criticized the Holy See for its silence on the matter of arrest of several Polish nobles during that time, including two bishops (Kajetan Ignaty So≈Çtyk and J√≥zef Andrzej Za≈Çuski, by the Russians. In the Bar Confederation he became their most important diplomat, responsible for many negotiations and their relations with foreign powers. In October 1768 he went to Paris where he was received by Louis XV of France who promised support for the confederates. In 1769 he advocated the assassination of King Poniatowski, later that year he became the head of the confederate's government in Bia≈Ça. In 1770 he went to Dresden to gain support from the Holy Roman Empire; later that year he met Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and received an offer of help from him. Also he did not support the declaration that King Poniatowski is not the legitimate king of Poland, he nonetheless supported Frederick Augustus I of Saxony as a counter-candidate. He was likely one of the supporters or even the ring-leader of the plan to kidnap Poniatowski, eventually carried by Kazimierz Pu≈Çaski in 1771. That plan nonetheless backfired, as Poniatowski not only escaped but this action caused much controversy in Europe and resulted in loss of much international support for the confederates. Eventually in 1772 he began negotiations with the King about surrender of the confederates; later that year he himself was kidnapped by the Cossacks and temporarily imprisoned in Warsaw. He was nonetheless set free after he pledged loyalty to the king and regained his posts in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After 1772, he distanced himself from political life until the reforms of the late 1780s. In 1780, 1782, 1784 and 1786 he was the president of the Sejm court. In 1787 ordered the reconstruction of fortress in Kamieniec. During the Great Sejm, he was one of the most active supporter of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, publishing projects and papers supporting it, and eventually taking part in the semi-coup that resulted in its declaration. Notably, he commented on behaviour of one of the constitution opponents, Jan Sucharzewski (who threatened to kill himself and his young son to 'spare them the fate of living under this restrictive law') saying 'shave his head and send him to the asylum'. Vocal opponent of Targowica Confederation, which after its victory punished him by abolishing his diocese. Supporter of Ko≈õciuszko Uprising; he collected funds for the uprising. After its defeat, he left political life again, eventually moving to the Prussian partition. He died in October 1800 in Krasne. He was also known for his support of religious tolerance. He has been a controversial figure for historians: unyielding supporter of Golden Liberty in the age where it was impossible to uphold this principle; supporter of the conservative and treacherous hetman's faction in the early 1760s, two decades later, leader of the Bar Confederation - seen the first of Poland's national uprisings - and finally one of the supporters of the May's Constitution.

Viglielmo (December 11, 1926 - November 14, 2016) was a prominent scholar and translator of Japanese literature and works of Japanese philosophy. Early life Viglielmo was born in Palisades Park, New Jersey. He grew up in a small rural community in the Hudson Valley of New York State, he completed both his primary and secondary school education and began his college studies in that state. Being of draft age during World War II and knowing he would have to serve, he chose to volunteer, serving in the ASTRP (Army Specialized Training Reserve Program). He was eventually drafted in January 1945, undergoing basic training in Florida. The European phase of the war ended in May 1945 while he was in training, but the Pacific war was still raging. Toward the end of his training Viglielmo responded to an appeal for enlisting in a Japanese language program being conducted under the auspices of the ASTP (the word ‚ÄúReserve‚Äù no longer applied). He was sent to the University of Pennsylvania where he began an intensive nine-month course of study, almost exclusively in the spoken language. After the end of the war in August 1945, his training was then directed toward being an interpreter during the Occupation of Japan, and he served as such in the 720th Military Police Battalion in Tokyo from April to September 1946. Academic career In October 1946, after his military discharge, Viglielmo transferred to Harvard University to continue his study of Japanese in the then-Far Eastern Languages Department. He received his A.B. degree magna cum laude in June 1948. He was accepted into the Harvard graduate program for Fall 1948, but chose instead to go to Japan for a three-year position teaching English as a foreign language at Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo. In the summer of 1951 Viglielmo returned to Harvard, receiving his M.A. degree in June 1952. He then entered the Harvard Ph.D. program in Japanese Literature, completing his general examinations in June 1953. That same year he won a Ford Foundation Fellowship for two years of graduate study in Japan, studying both at Tokyo University and the Gakush≈´in University. His dissertation topic was ‚ÄúThe Later Natsume S≈çseki: His Art and Thought.‚Äù At Gakush≈´in University, Viglielmo participated in a graduate seminar on S≈çseki conducted by S≈çseki biographer Komiya Toyotaka. In the spring of 1955 his Harvard teacher, Serge Eliss√©eff, asked Viglielmo if he would accept an appointment as a Harvard instructor in Japanese language and literature, beginning in Fall 1955. He taught at Harvard until June 1958, having completed his doctoral dissertation in December 1955 and having received his Ph.D. degree in March 1956. During the period from Fall 1958 until June 1960 he taught at International Christian University as well as Tokyo Women's Christian University and Tokyo University. In September 1960, Viglielmo received an appointment as assistant professor at Princeton University, where he taught Japanese language and literature. In January 1965, he accepted an offer of an associate professorship in the then Department of Asian and Pacific Languages at the University of Hawai‚Äòi. Viglielmo was soon promoted to full professor and taught at the University of Hawai‚Äòi until his retirement at the end of August 2002. Academic works Viglielmo's primary career focus was on modern Japanese literature, and he produced many studies of principal authors and their works, as well as translations. In 1971 Viglielmo translated the S≈çseki novel Meian (Light and Darkness, 1916), which received high praise from Western literary critics such as Fredric Jameson and Susan Sontag. Two years earlier, in 1969, he translated a brace of essays, The Existence and Discovery of Beauty, which the first Japanese Nobel Prize recipient Kawabata Yasunari gave in the form of public lectures as a visiting professor at the University of Hawai‚Äòi in May 1969. From the late 1950s on, Viglielmo also developed an interest in modern Japanese philosophy, introducing to the Western world works by the two principal figures of the Kyoto school, Nishida Kitar≈ç and Tanabe Hajime. Viglielmo was abled to visit Tanabe Hajime at his home in Spring of 1959. His first translation of Nishida, Zen no kenky≈´ (A Study of Good, 1911) in 1960 was considered instrumental in a deepening of East-West comparative philosophy. Viglielmo's most sustained work in modern Japanese philosophy was a collaborative effort with David A. Dilworth and Agustin Jacinto Zavala, A Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy, in 1998. It was recognized as the first comprehensive study of its kind, with extensive selections from the work of seven major modern Japanese thinkers. Viglielmo served as interpreter at the first International PEN meet in Tokyo in 1957. He formed friendships with the bundan (literary establishment), including Mishima Yukio, Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, Sei Ito, Sat≈ç Haruo, and prominent critics such as Okuno Takeo and Saeki Sh≈çichi. Viglielmo was on the editorial staff of the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies. He was also the first editor of the Journal- Newsletter of the Association of Teachers of Japanese, which has since developed into the principal journal of scholars of the Japanese language and literature outside Japan. He also served as an Executive Committee member of that Association. At the University of Hawai‚Äòi he enjoyed teaching Meiji- Taish≈ç (1868-1926) literature. He attended the first International Conference of Japanologists held in Kyoto in 1972. Viglielmo also developed a close connection with the Japanese anti-nuclear group Gensuikin (Congress for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs), and especially with the Nagasaki branch. He and his wife, Frances, were instrumental in facilitating the erection in 1990 of the Nagasaki Peace Bell in Honolulu, the funding for which came from the survivors of the Nagasaki atomic bombing and their relatives and friends. In the summer of 1998 Viglielmo and his wife were invited to Nagasaki to receive a Peace Prize in honor of their work in the anti-nuclear movement. In Honolulu they were granted the Peacemaker of the Year Award in 1988 by the Church of the Crossroads.

The book calls for small assaults on Japanese supply lines instead of large confrontations on the battlefield. The book was highly criticised by the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), which considered the book, along with Mao's theory, an excuse for avoiding fighting against Japan. The Communist Party justified that the book did not deny the effectiveness of the big battles carried out by the Nationalists but provided an alternative means of resistance before the Chinese army became powerful. Once the Chinese army became powerful enough, the Communist Party explained, the guerrilla warfare aspect of the strategy should be de-emphasized, and conventional forces should take over the primary prosecution of the war.

It is located in the former Jewish quarter of Kazimierz developed from a neighborhood earmarked in 1495 by King Jan I Olbracht for the Jewish community, which has been transferred from the budding Old Town. Kupa Synagogue serves Krak√≥w's Jewish community as one of the venues for religious ceremonies and cultural festivals, notably the annual Jewish Culture Festival in Krak√≥w.Jewish Krakow, A Visual and Virtual Tour, The Kupa Synagogue: ul. Miodowa 27 from the Internet Archive The Synagogue was founded in 1643 by the Kazimierz Jewish district's kehilla (a municipal form of self-government), as a foundation of the local qahal. A contribution of 200 zlotys by the Jewish goldsmiths' guild helped to bring the construction to its successful completion. The Synagogue was built in a baroque style with a square prayer hall inside. The building underwent many renovations throughout the centuries. In 1830-1834 the two-storey annex was added with entrance hall and washrooms. In 1861 the western wing was built. At the end of the 19th century, the synagogue was joined with the adjacent building. Following ravages of World War II, it has been meticulously restored. Its northern wall connects with the remnants of the medieval city-wall of Kazimerz while its southern flank faces Warchauera Street. The colorful interior of the Kupa Synagogue serves as an exhibition hall and the venue for musical events. The Synagogue is richly decorated with paintings from the 1920s featured on walls, the ceiling and in the women's section. The depictions include the holy places of Hebron, Tiberias, and Jerusalem. There are also Biblical scenes and illustrations to verses in Psalms, such as the painting showing people standing by the rivers of Babylon (), or musical instruments (). Another painting depicts Noah's ark including the figure of Noah - quite unusual since the use of human images was very rare in Jewish art.Hebrew University of Jerusalem: \\"Exploring the Synagogues of Poland: Wall Painting and Decoration\\" The signs of the Zodiac are painted over the women's gallery. The artist, although unidentified, was clearly professional. There are also remnants of earlier paintings from the 17th to 18th centuries. The older drawings are ornamental, with leaves and fruit surrounding texts. A carved wood and stucco Torah Ark, from the early 17th century, adorns the interior.

F√†n was born into an impecunious family in today's Zhumadian, Henan province. Later he became a high-ranked official for his erudition. Reacting to Buddhism prevailing in his time, he wrote Shen Mie Lun at 507, denying the ideas of reincarnation and body-soul dualism. A courtier tried to persuade F√†n to give up his opinion, in exchange of a higher official title, but was refused. Emperor Wu of Liang, unhappy with his subject's work, made an imperial decree (ÊïïÁ≠îËá£‰∏ãÁ•ûÊªÖË´ñ) to criticize the treatise, and ordered 64 of his courtiers to answer F√†n back. 75 pamphlets were produced against Shen Mie Lun.

The college is affiliated to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar University, Agra and Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow. Established in 1885, Raja Balvant Singh College owes its existence to Raja Balwant Singh of Awagarh who enabled the institution to grow as one of the oldest and biggest colleges of Uttar Pradesh. Raja Balwant Singh College, formerly known as Balwant Rajput College, was started with the help of Raja Balwant Singh of Awagarh Estate, Etah, Uttar Pradesh. It started in 1878 as Rajput Boarding House for education and upliftment of Rajputs of India. In 1885, it was upgraded as Balwant Rajput High School with Col. Dobson and Sir E.H. Forsyth as headmasters, and Rajput community given preference. Balwant Educational Society was created to safeguard the interests of the institution. Raja Sahib insisted that the president of the society will always be the District Judge of Agra, and that the Civil Surgeon of Agra and District Inspector of Schools, Agra would be its permanent members out of the 21 members. Dr. S.C. Sircar, homeopath, was its first Indian headmaster. In about 1934, Dr. R.K. Singh took over as principal of the Intermediate College. He started its expansion and in 1941 Balwant Rajput Intermediate College was the first in Uttar Pradesh to have faculties of Arts, Commerce, Science, and Agriculture. An education wing was started and within two years it was raised to postgraduate level. He established Bichpuri Institute of Agriculture at Bichpuri, Agra and a Research Center of Agriculture at Awagarh Farm of 400 acres donated by Raja Sahib's grandson. In 1949 R.K. Singh started the Rural Engineering Institute at Bichpuri. Raja Balwant Singh had also donated more than 100 acres in Agra for agriculture known as Khandari Farm, attached to Rajput High School. The present building of RBS Inter College was formerly known as Nachghar Kothi and was the residence of the headmaster. The school was run in the present college building. R.K. Singh got the special preference for Rajputs taken away but this enraged Raja Surya Pal Singh, son of Raja Balwant Singh, who curtailed major financial help to Balwant Educational Society and divested his funds to Shantiniketan and Kishori Raman College, Mathura. RBS College has seven faculties - Arts, Commerce, Education, Science, Agriculture, Engineering and Technology, and Management and Computer Application, and five campuses - three in Agra itself besides Bichpuri and Awagarh. Affiliation The institute is affiliated to the Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU). Prior to the formation of UPTU, the institute was affiliated to Dr. B. R.

He is the minister of the Ashfield parish in Sydney's inner west. Biography Bill Crews was born in England and migrated to Australia in his early years. He studied electrical engineering at the University of New South Wales under a scholarship provided by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) (AWA). He worked with AWA in microelectronic research studying the properties of silicon until 1971, including building the first machine in Australia to grow ultra pure single crystal silicon. In late 1969, he first visited the Wayside Chapel in Kings Cross and ultimately became involved in voluntary programs, visiting the elderly, sick and shut-ins of the Woolloomooloo-Kings Cross area. By 1971, he had decided to quit engineering and work full-time at the Wayside Chapel. Crews was a member of the team that created the first 24-hour crisis centre in Australia. By 1972 he was director of the crisis centre and directed all the social work programs of the Wayside Chapel until 1983. During that time he established the first program in Australia to reunite adoptees and birth parents (Reunion Register), and the first program to assist parents who were at risk of abusing their children (Child Abuse Prevention Service). He also established the first modern youth refuge in Australia. In 1973 he was made a member of the New South Wales Drug and Alcohol Authority and was intimately involved in establishing drug rehabilitation, education and prevention programs throughout New South Wales. Together with Ted Noffs, in 1978 they created the first Life Education Centre, that have since spread all over Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, New Zealand, England and America, promoting drug avoidance and harm minimisation strategies. He also hosts the radio program Sunday Night with Bill Crews on Sydney radio station 2GB. Guests have included Clive James, Helen Reddy, Bob Hawke and Kerry O'Brien. He is known to have a centre-left political viewpoint. Crews is the founder and chairman of the Exodus Foundation, a charity that assists homeless and abandoned youth. He is also the founder and CEO of the Bill Crews Charitable Trust. The Exodus Foundation's activities include a free kitchen (restaurant) in Ashfield which feeds 400 people each day, health both dental and medical and welfare services for the homeless and needy, and an outreach program for homeless youth. There is also a night food van providing meals to the homeless at Woolloomooloo. From 1996 to 2014 Exodus (in collaboration with MULTILIT) operated a literacy program which offered free remedial reading tuition to disadvantaged primary school children, with tutorial centres located in Ashfield, Redfern, Coen, Queensland and Darwin, Northern Territory . The NSW State Government terminated funding to the program on September 30, 2014, \\"Exodus Foundation‚Äôs reading program on the chopping block after State Government cuts funding\\", Sean Thompson, Inner West Courier, 6 Oct. 2014 and the Ashfield and Redfern centres closed soon after, although The Bill Crews Trust continues to operate a literacy program for indigenous students in the Northern Territory. Rev. Bill Crews was the subject of a documentary film released in 2020, A War of Compassion, directed by Warwick Moss.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/bill-crews- documentary-a-war-of-compassion-screening-in-sydney-on-march-3/news- story/90836346c88440492515518d9ad84e88 Awards and honours Crews has been awarded an International Paul Harris Fellow by the Rotary Foundation. He has been voted Father of the Year and Humanitarian of the Year (1992). In February 1998 Crews was included in the National Trust of Australia's 100 \\"National Living Treasures\\".

As part of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Crews ran a leg of the Olympic Torch Relay and the Paralympic Torch Relay. He also distributed hundreds of donated tickets to those who would otherwise not have had the financial means to partake in the Olympic experience. In 2001 Crews was named Ashfield Citizen of the Year for his contribution to the local community. He received the William R. Tresise Fellowship Award from the Australian Lions Foundation in June 2001 ‚Äì the highest honour the Foundation bestows for humanitarian services.

Crosby. The book built on Crosby's earlier study, The Columbian Exchange, in which he described the complex global transfer of organisms that accompanied European colonial endeavors. In Ecological Imperialism, Crosby sought to explain why European colonialists were successful in establishing settler societies in temperate regions around the globe, and he argued that this was due principally to the \\"portmanteau biota\\" - disease microbes, weeds, domesticated plants and animals - that accompanied Europeans, devastating local populations and significantly re- making local landscapes. The book advanced understandings of the environmental impacts of global colonialism and re-shaped understandings of the colonial experience itself, placing environmental factors at its center. Ecological Imperialism is considered a foundational text in the field of Environmental history and has been influential in many other fields, including Postcolonial studies. It was awarded the 1987 Ralph Waldo Emerson Award. Contents Crosby begins by pointing out that the populations of what he calls the \\"Neo- Europes\\" of temperate zones are primarily composed of European descendants. He asks why there are such large concentrations of Europeans in these lands which are so distant from Europe. Furthermore, why have these locations been able to routinely produce large food surpluses and why are many of the countries located in these regions able to consistently be among the world's largest exporters of food?Crosby, Alfred W. Ecological Imperialism. Second ed. New York: Cambridge UP, 2004. Although Europeans as a whole were reluctant to leave the familiarity of their homelands to start a new life abroad until the early 19th century, the Neo-Europes experienced a great influx of European settlers between 1820 and 1930. According to Crosby, this mass emigration was caused by conditions within Europe at the time, such as \\"population explosion and a resulting shortage of cultivable land, national rivalries, persecution of minorities\\", alongside \\"the application of steam power to ocean and land travel\\". But what was so appealing about the Neo-Europes to warrant being selected as the primary locations for European expansion? Crosby's explanation for the success of European imperialists is biogeographical. Europe and the Neo-Europes all share similar latitudes. That is, Europe and the Neo-Europes \\"are all completely or at least two-thirds in the temperate zones, north and south, which is to say that they have roughly similar climates\\". This is significant because the plants and animals Europeans have traditionally relied upon for sustenance tend to require a warm-to-cool climate that receives 50 to 150 centimeters of annual precipitation to flourish. Therefore, just as farming was able to spread from the Fertile Crescent, east and west, without much difficulty, replacing the hunter-gatherer lifestyle along the way, so was it able to in the Neo-Europes. But before this could take place, because the indigenous flora and fauna in the Neo-Europes were different from those located in Europe, the foreign biota brought to the New World by Europeans would have to compete with the local ones to survive. This would ultimately result in the complete devastation of the native floras and faunas. Crosby says: \\"the regions that today export more foodstuffs of European provenance ‚Äì grains and meats ‚Äì than any other lands on earth had no wheat, barley, rye, cattle, pigs, sheep, or goats whatsoever five hundred years ago\\". Rather than give credence to claims of innate European superiority and the like, Crosby explains the relative ease with which Europeans conquered the Neo-Europes as being a product of biological and ecological processes. One of the major contributors to European domination was disease, which is a natural byproduct of human interaction with animals. Consequently, when Europeans shifted from being hunter/gatherers to being farmers who settled in large, stationary communities and domesticated small animals, they exposed themselves to conditions that engendered diseases that would later assist them in conquering the Neo-Europes. Some such carriers of diseases were the mice, rats, roaches, houseflies, and worms that were able to accumulate in these urban settings. Because Europeans were living in an environment where they were in close contact with domestic animals and the germs that accompany them, the same germs from which many of the devastating diseases of humans have sprung, they were constantly being subjected to disease. And though millions of lives were lost when diseases like the Black Death ravaged Europe during the Middle Ages, a natural consequence of these frequent epidemics was a population that had built up a resistance to these diseases. Each epidemic would spare some individuals who were biologically more capable of resisting the virus. After undergoing this process for a number of centuries, the entire population eventually acquired at least some minor immunological defense against diseases such as measles and smallpox. Crosby addresses the first subjugation of lands nearest Europe, in his chapter entitled, The Fortunate Isles, which documents the history of the European waves of attacks on the Azores, Madeira Islands, and Canary Islands to bring them under European suzerainty, and their earliest efforts to enslave their populations and restructure their wildlife.(p.70-103) However, because the majority of the native populations to the Neo-Europes were still participating in hunting/gathering and did not interact with animals in the same manner as Europeans, they were never exposed to such diseases. Therefore, \\"When the isolation of the New World was broken ... the American Indian met for the first time his most hideous enemy: not the white man nor his black servant, but the invisible killers which those men brought in their blood and breath.\\"Crosby, Alfred W. The Colombian Exchange. Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2003. Because the Europeans arrived in the Neo-Europes with diseases that were absolutely new to those locations, they had an enormous advantage over the indigenous peoples and the consequences were overwhelming. > By 3,000 years ago, give or take a millennium or so, \\"superman,* the human > of Old World civilization, had appeared on earth.

Legacy Ecological Imperialism built directly on Crosby's earlier work on the Columbian exchange, with Crosby remarking that Ecological Imperialism \\"took The Columbian Exchange up another notch in scope and abstraction.\\" It is thus part of a long scholarly legacy that helped to re-shape how historians and others have understood global historical and environmental change. Ecological Imperialism, along with The Columbian Exchange, is considered a foundational text in the field of Environmental history, and the concept at its core - the theory of Ecological imperialism - has been called \\"one of the most enduring models of past global environmental change.\\" The book has similarly been influential in other fields, including Postcolonial studies. Scholars have drawn upon and refined the concept in the decades since the book was published, even applying it to regions outside of the Neo-Europes that drew Crosby's attention. Ecological Imperialism has also been cited as a key inspiration for popular works such as Jared Diamond's 1997 Pulitzer Prize- winning book Guns, Germs, and Steel and journalist Charles C. Mann's books 1491 and 1493. In fact, Mann has related that he was encouraged by Crosby to write the latter book after Mann had urged Crosby to write an updated edition of Ecological Imperialism. Editions The first edition of Ecological Imperialism was published by Cambridge University Press in 1986. A second edition was published by Cambridge in 2004 with a new preface from Crosby. *Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900, 1986, (hardback), (paperback) *Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900, second edition, 2004, (hardback), (paperback)  See also  * 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created * Alfred W.

Eventually, Larry kisses Anne while they are working together at his apartment, while Linda makes love with her young gigolo, who gives her the key to his apartment and says goodnight. Linda returns to her husband (after giving them enough time to compose themselves) and tells Larry that they should go to bed as it is very late. Anne watches as Larry goes to the bedroom with his wife and closes the door behind him. She is heartbroken and decides she will give him her resignation in the morning. Linda decides to divorce Larry. Anne agrees to marry her long-time admirer Ted O'Hara after giving her resignation. On the final day of work, Anne's sister Katherine Murdock (Joan Blondell) phones the confused Larry and explains everything, bringing about a happy ending.

Afterwards, she changed her name to Nair de Teff√© Hermes da Fonseca. Biography Born in Petr√≥polis, Nair de Teff√© was the daughter of Admiral Ant√¥nio Lu√≠s von Hoonholtz, Baron of Teff√©, and granddaughter of Prussian military and aristocrat Friedrich Wilhelm von Hoonholtz, that moved to the Empire of Brazil. As a girl, she studied in Paris and Nice. In 1909, she published her first work in Fon-Fon magazine, under the pseudonym of Rian (\\"Nair\\" backwards). Her caricatures were also published in, among others, the magazines O Bin√≥culo, A Careta, O Malho, as well as the newspapers Gazeta de Not√≠cias and Gazeta de Petr√≥polis. She had an agile hand which transmitted people's characters quite well. She stopped working as a cartoonist in 1913 when she married the then Brazilian President, Marshal Hermes da Fonseca. Nair de Teff√©. Nair de Teff√© was a woman ahead of her time. As First Lady she hosted soir√©es in Catete Palace which became famous for introducing the guitar in society salons. In 1914, Nair de Teff√© organized a recital to launch Corta Jaca, a maxixe composed by Chiquinha Gonzaga. The following day, controversy and criticism developed because the presidential palace had promoted and disseminated music that had its roots in what the social elite believed were lascivious and vulgar dances. Bringing popular music to the presidential palace was considered at the time to be a breach of protocol, causing controversy in the highest ranks of Brazilian society and politics. Ruy Barbosa had strong criticism about the wife of the president. After the presidential mandate ended, she moved to Europe. In 1921 she returned to Brazil and in 1922, participated of the Modern Art Week. Began to participate in Brazilian Academies(organizations) of art and in 1932 she founded a theater, Cinema Rian, which had a privileged locate (facing the sea of Copacabana: Photo of the theater Cinema Rian). Afterwards, Nair started playing at casinos and lost a great part of her fortune, as well as an island in the coastline of Angra dos Reis.

A realization in modern notation is given below. The Missa L'homme arm√© super voces musicales is the first of two settings of the Ordinary of the Mass by Josquin des Prez using the famous L'homme arm√© tune as their cantus firmus source material (for the other, presumed later, setting see Missa L'homme arm√© sexti toni).An extensive listing of sources and critical commentary on Masses based on the L'homme arm√© tune, created as part of a Spring 2002 seminar by Mary Kay Duggan at the University of California, Berkeley, is available at Reform and music: 1450‚Äì1600 (accessed 2008-03-18). The setting is for four voices. It was the most famous mass Josquin composed, surviving in numerous manuscripts and print editions.Blackburn, in Sherr, p. 53 The earliest printed collection of music devoted to a single composer, the Misse Josquin published by Ottaviano Petrucci in 1502, begins with this famous work. Background Dating of the mass has been controversial, with some scholars proposing a mid-career date, for example during Josquin's Roman period (roughly 1489 to 1495), and other scholars, such as Gustave Reese, arguing for an earlier date, claiming that the contrapuntal complexity the mass shows is more typical of Josquin's early style, and that he simplified his method as he aged.Reese, p. 237 The earliest source containing the mass is the Vatican manuscript CS 197 (c. 1492‚Äì1495)Blackburn, p. 65 In his 1547 Dodekachordon, Heinrich Glarean wrote that Josquin \\"composed the two L'homme arm√© masses to show off his skill.\\"Blackburn, p. 65: the Latin original, on p. 441 of the Dodekachordon (Basle, 1547), reads \\"Ad ostentationem autem artis haud dubie duas illas Missas instituit L'homme arme.\\" Music While usually classified as a cantus firmus mass, the use of snatches of the tune in other voices foreshadows the paraphrase technique which Josquin was to use extensively later in works such as the Missa Pange lingua, and which was to become one of the standard methods of writing cyclic masses in the 16th century. Like most settings of the mass, it is in five sections: # Kyrie # Gloria # Credo # Sanctus and Benedictus # Agnus Dei (in three sections: I, II, III) rightthumb400pxAgnus Dei (II) from Missa l'homme arm√© super voces musicales. The entire Agnus Dei II consists of a three-part mensuration canon. The middle voice is the slowest; the lowest voice sings at twice the speed of the middle voice, and the top voice at three times the speed. Showing off his contrapuntal virtuosity seems to be Josquin's aim,Blackburn, p. 59. and the mass is full of mensuration canons, second only to Ockeghem's Missa prolationum, which contains nothing but mensuration canons. In a mensuration canon, each voice sings the same notes, but the length of time each note is sung differs. The opening Kyrie of Josquin's mass contains consecutive mensuration canons based on each phrase of the L'homme arm√© tune, with the tenor leading each and the other voices entering in turn.Reese & Noble, Grove. The second of the three of Agnus Dei sections is another well-known mensuration canon (see example); this particular canon was famous in the sixteenth century, and often mentioned in theoretical treatises.Blackburn, p. 56 The last of the three repetitions of the Agnus Dei, the section that closes the mass, is the longest, and is accompanied by a direction in the score: \\"Clama ne cesses\\" (\\"cry without ceasing\\", from Isaiah 58:1), which in this context means to sing the tune without any of the rests. The cantus firmus is pitched on A, the highest note of the hexachord, and is in double augmentation. The length, and the sustained notes of the cantus firmus, refer both to the \\"cry for mercy\\" aspect of the Agnus Dei text, which cries to the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world, and to the trumpet motif and text \\"On a fait partout crier\\" from the original L'homme arm√© tune, calling the listeners to arms. In addition to the canonic complexities, Josquin adds variety by beginning the L'homme arm√© tune on a successively higher note in each section (and also in the third Agnus Dei), one for each of the six notes in the natural hexachord (thus the title, \\"voces musicales\\", or solmization syllables, ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la). The overall modality is Dorian, and all of the movements end on D. References * Blackburn, Bonnie. \\"Masses on Popular Songs and on Syllables\\". In The Josquin Companion, ed.

The decree changed the steps FUNAI was required to follow to demarcate indigenous lands, effectively making the process more complicated and allowing for more interference from commercial interests. Individuals or companies were allowed from the beginning of the demarcation process until 90 days after FUNAI issued their report to submit an appeal showing that the contested lands do not meet the qualifications of indigenous lands as stated in the constitution. The decree also placed the final decision in the hands of the Minister of Justice, which left the fate of indigenous lands vulnerable to various political ideologies. The government claimed that allowing people to contest indigenous lands during the demarcation process would prevent any future challenges of completed lands on the basis of unconstitutionality. The decree was widely contested as a violation of indigenous rights, earning the nickname of the \\"Genocide Decree,\\" due to the power it gave to commercial interests to exploit Indian lands. By April 1996, FUNAI had received over 500 appeals for over 40 indigenous territories that were in the process of being demarcated. FUNAI followed procedure and submitted its official opinion to the Ministry of Justice, rejecting the appeals that were brought against the indigenous lands. Justice Nelson Jobim sided with FUNAI on all except eight territories, ordering further investigation.

Life history Born in Hohenheim near Stuttgart, Germany to a Lutheran minister, he received an excellent education. He came to the South African diamond- and goldfields in 1882, and soon acquired a reputation as the resourceful manager of the Phoenix Diamond Mining Company at Du Toit's Pan near Kimberley. He attracted the attention of Julius Wernher and Alfred Beit and in 1884 joined them in the partnership of Jules Porg√®s & Co (later Wernher, Beit & Co). In 1885 Beit arranged for Hermann Eckstein and Jim Taylor, to report on the firm's interests in the Barberton and De Kaap goldfields, in which they had invested heavily. Taylor wrote a gloomy report on the extent and quality of the ore lode that brought Porg√®s hurrying back to South Africa. He and Beit decided to disinvest. The firm suffered a loss, which was trivial compared with what was to follow. The soaring share prices during the boom, were rapidly followed by pessimism, plummeting prices and widespread bankruptcy. Just before the collapse there had been rumours of enormous deposits of gold on the Witwatersrand, about 60 km south of Pretoria. These rumours had reached Porg√®s and Beit whilst visiting government offices in Pretoria. Initially discounted, they had proved to be true. Beit hurriedly acquired extensive mining rights in Johannesburg. In 1888 Eckstein started his own firm under the name of Hermann Eckstein & Co., in the Corner House as a representative of Jules Porg√®s. He was instrumental in establishing the Chamber of Mines in Johannesburg, and acted as its first president until 1892. Eckstein put the infrastructure of the mines on a solid footing by using competent engineers, thus turning mere diggings into established industry. He was involved in the move to deep level mining when the surface deposits had run out. By the end of 1888 he was in charge of virtually all the mining activities in the central area of the Witwatersrand, and controlled the eleven most important syndicates. He played an important role in the founding of the Wanderers Club and is considered one of the Randlords. Eckstein was dismayed by the growing rift between the Uitlanders and Afrikaners, more so since he counted Paul Kruger as a personal friend. He played a large part in establishing the National Bank of the South African Republic. The year before his death he went to England, having been offered a partnership with Wernher and Beit in the Central Mining and Investment Corporation. He left Johannesburg with his wife who was pregnant with their fourth child, but didn't live long enough to see its birth. On 16 January 1893 he died of \\"apoplexy of the heart\\", probably a heart attack. His brother Frederick took over the family interests and in 1910 rebuilt Ottershaw Park in Surrey which at the time was described as the 'Wonder House of Surrey'. Sachsenwald Beit's company planted some three million trees on an area of , an area Eckstein called Sachsenwald, now known as the Johannesburg suburbs of Saxonwold and Forest Town, the Zoo Lake and Johannesburg Zoo. The forest became a favourite recreational spot for the wealthy Randlords and their families. Ten years after his death, and in his memory, his former partners made a gift to Johannesburg of the Sachsenwald, later named the Hermann Eckstein Park. This Deed of Gift read: \\"Whereas the late Hermann Eckstein was in his lifetime a resident in the town of Johannesburg and always took a deep interest in its advancement and prosperity, and played an active part in many schemes and undertakings for its improvement and whereas it has appeared to us that the dedication of a suitable area of land for the use of the public of Johannesburg, as a public park, would have met with the cordial approval of our late friend and will be acceptable to fellow townsmen.\\" The Deed was signed by Julius Wernher, Alfred Beit, Lionel Phillips, Ludwig Breitmeyer, Friedrich Eckstein (his brother), Charles Rube and Ludwig Wagner. Epilogue \\"Eckstein's skill in financial transactions and his unimpeachable integrity made him a respected man in a community where dishonesty was rife. He became a leading figure in the Johannesburg mining industry.\\" - South African Dictionary of National Biography. Eckstein was a founding member of the Rand Club, an exclusive club created for the use of the Randlords, and first president of the Wanderers' Club.

It is part of the Nile river system, being a tributary of Bahr el Ghazal, which is a tributary of the White Nile. The river flows through Sudan's Kurdufan and Darfur regions and forms part of the border between Darfur and the region of Bahr el Ghazal in northwestern South Sudan. For centuries the Bahr al-Arab has marked the boundary between the Dinka and Baggara ethnic groups.; online at Google Books The river has served as a frontier and zone of conflict between the Baggara and Dinka peoples since their oral traditions began.; online at Internet Archive Etymology The name \\"Bahr al-Arab\\" is Arabic for \\"Sea of the Arabs\\" (possibly from \\"Nahr al-Arab\\", Arabic for \\"River of the Arabs\\"). The Dinka people call it the \\"Kiir River\\". Course The Bahr al-Arab arises from several tributaries that drain the Bongo Massif and Marrah Mountains in Darfur, close to Sudan's border with Chad and the Central African Republic. The Adda and Umbelasha flow east from the Bongo Massif to join the Ibrah (Wadi Ibra), which flows south from the Marrah Mountains. Formed from these tributaries, the Bahr al-Arab flows east along the border of the Darfur and Bahr el Ghazal regions, then through a southern part of the Kurdufan region. According to some sources, the Bahr al-Arab's confluence with the Jur River marks the source of the Bahr el Ghazal River. Other sources say the Jur joins the Bahr el Ghazal before the Bahr al-Arab does. The Bahr el Ghazal flows a short distance east to join the White Nile in the Sudd wetlands.

But compared to the rivers to the south, the Bahr al-Arab has very little water and it flows sluggishly.; online at Internet Archive History During the Second Sudanese Civil War Bahr al-Arab's location on the border of Northern and Southern Sudan made it a military front and an area of conflict. In the early 1980s western Sudan suffered several droughts and crop failures. As various peoples shifted southward the Baggara moved south of the Bahr al- Arab and came into conflict with the Dinka.

It was based on the French play by Andr√© Mou√´zy-√âon and Yves Mirande. The English version of the play, by Sir Seymour Hicks, opened in New York on October 12, 1927 and had 13 performances. Plot Leopold Trebel (Frank Fay) is a man who was in a train wreck five years earlier and was taken for dead by his wife, Juliet (Florence Eldridge) Leopold and Juliet have both remarried. Leopold, who remembers nothing that occurred before the train wreck, is the father of two sets of twins by his new wife, Sylvaine (Lilyan Tashman). Juliet has recently had a child with her new husband, Gustave Corton (James Gleason). Leopold is a very popular hairdresser and some of Juliet's friends urge her to try him out. When Leopold shows up at her home, he shocks the servants and his ex-wife. A doctor manages to restore Leopold's memory through hypnosis but in the process makes him forget what has happened in the last five years. When Leopold awakes from hypnosis, he thinks he has only been unconscious for a short while. He assumes he is still Juliet's husband. The doctor warns everyone not to tell him the truth because the shock could kill him. Just at this crucial moment, Gustave Corton arrives home and is shocked to find Leopold in his bed. Later on, Sylvaine arrives only to find her husband in bed with Gustave Corton. Eventually, Leopold learns what has happened and asks the doctor to pretend to take back his memory so that Juliet, whom he deeply loves, can continue to live her new life. Pre-Code Sequences * Leopold is discovered in bed with Gustave, and Sylvaine assumes they are having an affair and, shocked, exclaims: \\"What kind of a house is this?\\" * When the doctor attempts to examine Leopold, the other assumes the doctor is gay and refuses to take off his shirt. When the doctor turns off the light to hypnotize him, Leopold exclaims that he was right in his suspicions about him. * The movie has numerous gay jokes as the hairdresser/husband played by Leopold.

(Currently inactive)https://www.rosebayhigh.education.tas.edu.au/webcam/ In March 2017, the school was one of eighteen high schools to have an expansion to year 11 and 12. Construction In 1960 a deputation from the Clarence High School P & F Association strongly emphasised the urgent need for immediate action in the provision of additional high school accommodation on the Eastern Shore. With the co-operation of the Housing Department and the Clarence Commission negotiations were rapidly completed for the procurement of the magnificent site on which the school now stands. On 23 June 1960 the Rose Bay High School Advisory Council was formed through the P & F Associations of the three Primary Schools immediately concerned: Lindisfarne North, Lindisfarne and Montagu Bay. On 29 July 1960 a tender was let for the first unit of the Rose Bay High School at a contract price of ¬£43,000. The first stage of the new building consisted of eight classrooms, two of which were used for practical activities with some provision for both administrative and staff requirements. Redevelopment 2009 saw the start of the school's second redevelopment stage to which 4.78 million dollars has been allocated. This will complement the $1.3 million refurbishment which was completed in 2005 and provide 'state of the art facilities' in most learning areas. The first phase began in November 2009, with the demolition of the old student toilet block at the end of B Block. This is the site of the school's new Dance/Drama suite which is now constructed Language Centre Rose Bay High School gained funding from the federal government's Building the Education Revolution Program to build a Language Centre to provide modern facilities for the teaching of languages other than English.

Wallgate made his debut in 1875, and his final appearance was in 1878. Wallgate was born in Norton-on-Derwent in the East Riding of Yorkshire (now in North Yorkshire), England, and scored nine first-class runs, and took one wicket for seventeen with his round arm, right-handed, bowling. He made his debut against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in a drawn, end of season game, at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough in September 1885. Wallgate opened the Yorkshire first innings, and scored three runs. His only appearance in the County Championship came almost two years later, in August 1887, against Middlesex at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. Wallgate was dismissed for a duck in Yorkshire's 251, and the game was drawn before he had the chance to bat again. Wallgate also played in two matches for Yorkshire against Scotland at The Grange, Edinburgh in 1878. Batting at number three, he scored six first-class runs in Yorkshire's first innings, and took a catch off the bowling of Tom Emmett. As this match finished a day early, a one-day game was arranged which Scotland won, after they passed Yorkshire's paltry 57, in which Wallgate top scored with 14, the only Yorkshire batsman score in double figures. Wallgate died, aged 37, in May 1887 in Harrogate, Yorkshire.

Stable vices are stereotypies of equines, especially horses. They are usually undesirable habits that often develop as a result of being confined in a stable with insufficient exercise, boredom, hunger, excess energy or isolation. They present a management issue, not only leading to facility damage from chewing, kicking, and repetitive motion, but also lead to health consequences for the animal if not addressed. They also raise animal welfare concerns. Stereotypical behaviors in animals are generally thought to be caused by artificial environments that do not allow animals to satisfy their normal behavioral needs. Rather than refer to these behaviors as abnormal, it has been suggested that they be described as \\"behavior indicative of an abnormal environment.\\" It was once thought that stable vices may be learned by observing other horses already performing the behaviors, but studies on the topic to date have failed to establish this as a cause. Stereotypies are correlated with altered behavioral response selection in the basal ganglia. Although a more enriched environment may help minimize or eliminate some stereotypical behavior, once established, it is sometimes impossible to eliminate them due to alterations in the brain. Examples Stereotypies in equines are usually placed into one of two classes: Locomotor or Oral. Common stable vices include: *Wood chewing (lignophagia): Gnawing on wood out of hunger or boredom. This is not to be confused with the more serious vice, cribbing. *Cribbing, also called windsucking: When the equine grabs a board or other surface with its teeth, arches its neck, and sucks in air. This can harm the teeth and may lead to colic. Cribbing can be caused either by nervousness or boredom. It was previously thought to release endorphins in the horse, but recent research suggests this is a fallacy. Additional research suggests that cribbing increases salivation and may reduce stomach discomfort. There is a direct correlation between diet and cribbing, increasing hay in the ration or feeding more frequent meals appears to help. Cribbing occurs in 2.4-8.3% depending on breed and management. *Weaving: Rocking back and forth in a repetitive fashion that is correlated to isolation or stall confinement, usually alleviated by pasture turnout. Possibly a self- stimulating behavior. Problems with weaving can include weight loss and uneven hoof wear, unnatural stress on the legs and lameness. *Wall kicking: Kicking the walls of its stall with hind legs. This raises the potential of injury to the equine and damage to the barn. Usually this is caused by a lack of exercise and boredom. Wall-kicking is one habit that is often acquired by others in the barn once an individual starts doing it. *Stall-walking or fence-walking: Like weaving, this is a repetitive movement, only the individual paces compulsively. It is usually correlated with isolation or anxiety while awaiting feed. This habit can also lead to weight loss and lameness. *Pawing or digging: The equine may paw with its front feet. This can lead to abnormal hoof wear and lameness, and may also damage the flooring of the stall. An equine that paws can dig a noticeable hole in a dirt-floored barn in a very short time. Some behaviors are not classed as stereotypies, but are viewed as undesirable behaviors for health or safety reasons: *Biting: A nervous or anxious equine may reach out of its stall to bite at passers-by, human or animal. Box stall designs that keep the horse from reaching its head out prevent harm to other animals, but some horses may attempt to bite a handler when the person enters the stall. *Bolting feed: Eating food too fast without adequate chewing. This can potentially lead to certain problems in the digestive system including choke and colic. *Masturbation: A male horse, either a stallion or a gelding, will use his abdominal muscles to rhythmically bounce his penis against his belly. Previously believed to be a vice caused by boredom, confinement, or discomfort,Study on horse masturbation masturbation by stallions and geldings is now viewed as a normal behavior. Horses may engage in a number of undesirable behaviors when being ridden or driven. These are not \\"stable\\" vices, but are often classified as \\"vices\\" in terms of being behavior that poses a danger to the animal or its handler. These include: * Head-shaking: Where a horse shakes its head repeatedly for no obvious reason, a condition with many possible causes from insect annoyance, dental problems, allergies, sun exposure or nerve damage. *Bucking: May be misbehavior or a result of discomfort. *Rearing: a normal behavior at play, but dangerous around humans, when it is often triggered by fear or pain. *Bolting or running away Other equine behaviors that may (or may not) arise from boredom or frustration, but still present management challenges. These include destruction of buckets, mangers, and feed tubs; defecation in the manger or water bucket; dumping water buckets; sloshing feed in water and then scattering it on the ground, and so on. There is little that can be done to stop them, and other than hygienic considerations, they present few health or safety concerns.  Modern husbandry and the effects on behavior  Horses are extremely social creatures, and the process of domestication has not altered their need for social interactions.Dierendonck, M., 2006. The Importance of Social Relationships in Horses. Also, in the wild, horses are constantly grazing; they are called trickle feeders because they continuously eat small amounts of forage throughout the day, except the approximately 2 hours that they spent sleeping.Getty, J., 2009. Feed Your Horse Like a Horse: Optimize your horse's nutrition for a lifetime of vibrant health. Modern equine husbandry sometimes creates conflicts with the horse‚Äôs natural behaviors; some owners keep their horses confined to a stall with minimal turnout time, little to no social interactions, and sometimes inadequate amounts of roughage. This can be problematic as this system of equine husbandry completely ignores certain basic needs, such as social interactions, foraging, and locomotion. Studies have shown that horses that are offered low quantities of forage and minimal social contact have a higher reported level of stereotypic behaviors such as cribbing, wind sucking, weaving, and other stereotypic behaviors.Nicol, C., 1999. Understanding equine stereotypies. Equine Veterinary Journal, 31(28), 20-25. Social interactions are important to horses; mutual grooming has been shown to reduce heart rate and cortisol levels, therefore reducing stress.Feh, C., and Mazieres, J., 1993. Grooming at a preferred site reduces heart rate in horses. Animal Behaviours, 46(6), 1191-1194. Play behavior between two horses aids in the development of the musculo-skeletal system and cardiovascular fitness; play allows practice of reproductive and survival skills. Living in a group also has an adaptive significance, as younger animals living within the herd will learn from the other members of the group. The amount of forage a horse is given or has access to is extremely important as the equine digestive tract continuously produces acid, therefore the horse‚Äôs digestive tract must contain food most of time; if a horse is without forage for more than 3 hours, the acid in the digestive tract will build up which can cause ulcers, diarrhea, and potentially colic. Behavioral problems can also develop because the horse is in pain from the ulcers that are a result of the low quantities of forage. The process of chewing produces saliva, which the horse uses as a natural antacid; if the horse has no hay or pasture to chew on, the antacid will not be produced and the horse will find anything to chew on to try and produce saliva, which can be the start of an oral stereotype. Solutions In most cases, reducing confinement and providing the animal a more natural setting reduces the incidence of stable vices. There are stopgap \\"cures\\" that can be provided in the stall to keep a horse busy or out of trouble, including increased exercise, feeding of larger quantities of lower-quality food (so the animal spends more time eating and less time being bored), feeding more frequently, or cutting back on grain or other high-energy concentrates. Toys such as a ball or empty one-gallon plastic milk jug can be hung in the stall. Sometimes simply giving the animal a companion in the next stall, or even a smaller animal placed in the same stall, also helps a bored or nervous horse. In extreme cases, a short term fix may include various forms of restraint. However, none of these practices solve the underlying problem, some may raise animal welfare concerns, and the animal will resume its behavior as soon as the restraint is removed. The long-term solution that has the most success is to give the horse less time in the stall and more free turnout time.

It is managed by Transport for West Midlands (TfWM). Local bus services operated by various companies serve the bus station which has 19 departure stands and 1 unloading stand. The bus station is located halfway between Wolverhampton, St George's West Midlands Metro tram terminus and Wolverhampton railway station; both are just a short walk away. It also features glass-enclosed waiting areas and electronic doors, allowing passengers out of designated pedestrian areas, only when buses are on stand. Uniquely, the designs for the station have meant that there is no need for buses and pedestrians paths to cross, due to the 'W' shape of the station. The bus station's enquiry office is now in the main building, but was in the Queen's Building, a grade II listed building, now host to Costa Coffee, but which was formerly the carriage entrance to the railway station. The Interchange Project The station, which had existed since 1986, was closed after service finished on 3 April 2010. Building work took place during the ensuing months, in which a new pedestrian bridge linking the railway and bus stations was built, a contraflow system installed along the ring road and the bus station rebuilt. The station re-opened on 24 July 2011, which coincided with the Wolverhampton bus network review and marked the end of Phase One of the project. Phase Two includes improvements to the railway station, a new hotel, and redevelopment of the canalside area, but a date for this has yet to be finalised. During, December 2014 the next phase of the Interchange project was given the go ahead, the next phase of the project comprises the refurbishment and extension of the Railway Station Car Park, it has seen the car parks capacity increased to just over 900 parking spaces, the whole interchange project will see all public transport in Wolverhampton connecting in one place, eventually linking the bus station, railway station and the West Midlands Metro with the latter's Piper's Row tram stop to be located adjacent to the bus station.http://wolverhamptoninterchange.co.uk/bus- station/http://centro.org.uk/projects/completed/wolverhampton-bus- station/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2014/12/31/500-extra-car-parking- spaces-to-be-created-at-wolverhampton-railway-station/ External links *Information on the redevelopment of the bus station and the plans for the new one. * Wolverhampton Interchange Phase One References *Where to board your bus - Network West Midlands.com Category:Bus stations in the West Midlands (county) Category:Buildings and structures in Wolverhampton Category:Transport in Wolverhampton ","title":"Wolverhampton bus station"},{"id":"10365922","text":"Red, White and Blue Paradise: The American Canal in Panama is a history of the Panama Canal Zone by Herbert and Mary Knapp. It is at once an intellectual history of the Canal Zone and its host Republic, and an account of the authors' own reluctant emergence from a fashionable contempt for the Zonians.

Sutcliffe was born in Pudsey, near Leeds, Yorkshire, England. Playing as a right-handed batsman and occasional medium and leg break bowler, he made his debut for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1948, and retired from the first-class game in 1959. In 210 first- class matches, he scored 7,530 runs, with a career best score of 181 against Kent in 1952,Kent v Yorkshire 1952 at an average of 26.42. He scored six centuries in all, including 171 not out against Worcestershire and 161 not out against Glamorgan. Bob Appleyard recalled that Sutcliffe batted with a 2 pounds 6 ounces bat, which had to be specially made as it was considered very heavy in its day. He toured India with the Commonwealth XI in 1950-51 (adding 301 for the fourth wicket with Frank Worrell in the match against Ceylon),Ceylon v Commonwealth XI 1950-51 and Pakistan with the MCC in 1955-56. Sutcliffe captained Yorkshire as an amateur for two years in 1956 and 1957. He led a recovering Yorkshire to third in the County Championship in his final season in charge. Brian Close called him \\"a super lad who made himself into a county cricketer because it was expected of him, and because he believed in Yorkshire cricket and its right to pre-eminence. He was happier having a pint and a natter than he was in cracking the whip on the field\\". The Yorkshire and England spin bowler and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) coach Don Wilson said \\"It was unfair to suggest he was only in the job because of his name. He was a great league player and had proved himself a knowledgeable captain for Leeds. It was the senior players who were at the root of this malediction.\\" He later served on the Yorkshire committee, and on the Test selection panel in 1969 and 1970.Wisden 1999, p. 1491.

Life and career Adebayo Adefarati was appointed commissioner twice under the Afenifere leader Chief Michael Adekunle Ajasin. He was the State Commissioner for Works and Transport (between 1979‚Äì1983). Adefarati was also a prominent member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a leading organization in the fight against the military during the rule of Sani Abacha. Political intrigues during his term as governor culminated in the alienation of many of his erstwhile comrades, figures like Olusegun Mimiko, Chief Rufus Giwa, Akerele Adu, Olu Agunloye, Chief Yele Omogunwa, Chief Niyi Omodara, Olatunji Ariyo and Chief Bamidele Awosika. This state of affairs worked against him when he made a bid for a second term as governor and enhanced the likelihood of victory for Olusegun Agagu at the polls in April, 2003.THISDAY NEWSPAPER \\"Ondo: The Drama to Watch\\" Claims made against Adefarati included disillusionment with his administration and a lack of transparency in the selection process adopted by the Alliance for Democracy in the selection of its gubernatorial candidates at that election. The relationship of Chief Adebayo Adefarati with Chief Ruben Fasoranti and Chief Olu Falae was just being repaired during the election, thereby making the impact of the duo of little consequence in his favour during the Nigerian general elections of 2003. Many of his detractors were to later regret their actions when Olusegun Agagu was himself removed from office by a coalition that included many of the previous players and was replaced by Olusegun Mimiko, thus vindicating Chief Adebayo Adefarati. Adefarati was Governor of Ondo State from 1999 to 2003. He was later a presidential candidate for the Alliance for Democracy party in the April, 2007 presidential election,\\"Nigeria death fails to halt poll\\", BBC News, March 29, 2007. but died in Owo, Ondo State at the age of 76 of an undisclosed ailment a few weeks prior to the election. He had not been considered a major candidate, but his death raised the possibility that the election would be delayed. A spokesman for the Independent National Electoral Commission said that this would not happen, and that the party could name a replacement candidate. Personal life Adebayo Adefarati was a native of Akungba Akoko and was married to Adetutu Adefarati.

In this sense, a \\" Jump kick\\" is a special case of a flying kick, any kick delivered in mid-air, i.e. with neither foot touching the ground. Flying and jump kicks are taught in certain Asian martial arts, such as karate,Hidetaka Nishiyama, Richard C. Brown, Karate: the art of \\"empty hand\\" fighting, 1990, , p. 133 kenpo, kalarippayattu, kung fu and taekwondo. __TOC__ History High kicks in general, as well as jump kicks, were foreign to Southern styles, and their presence in Wing Chun as well as Japanese and Korean martial arts is probably due to the influence of a Northern style. Historically, the development and diffusion of flying kick techniques in Asian martial arts seems to have taken place during the 1930s to 1950s. During this time, Chinese martial arts took an influence on traditional Okinawan martial arts, from the late 1940s specifically Shorinji Kempo. Okinawan martial arts in turn developed into karate and ultimately also taekwondo.William Durbin Mastering Kempo, 2001 p. 11. Taekwondo's special emphasis on spinning, jumping and flying kicks is a development of the 1960s.Frank Thiboutot, Cardio Kickboxing Elite: For Sport, for Fitness, for Self-Defense, 2001, p. 202. Technique Effective accomplishment of a flying kick relies on a mental preparation combined with an athletic condition. For instance, a typical element of the preparation consists in mentally exercising and visualizing the flying kick before its execution. A flying kick correctly performed requires the individual to land on their feet while keeping balance. Practicality and purpose While the efficiency of a jump kick in combat sports or self-defense is highly debatable, the move is popular for demonstration purposes, showing off the practitioner's skill and control,\\"Practicing the flying kick is a complete exercise which ultimately provides the best means of attaining balance, coordination, and body shifting.\\" Sihak Henry Cho, Jeff Leibowitz, Tae kwon do: secrets of Korean karate, 1992, , p. 125, as a dance move, or in cinema. Flying kicks (regardless of concerns of utility) are considered among the martial arts techniques most difficult to perform correctly. A 1991 essay dedicated to flying kicks in taekwondoFlying Kicks of Tae Kwon Do, Black Belt magazine, February 1991 cites trainer Yeon Hwan Park arguing that the main benefit of training flying kicks is \\"the transcending of mental barriers by overcoming physical challenges that gives the student confidence.\\" Park emphasizes that flying and jump kicks are among the most difficult and advanced techniques, and that he does not recommend their use in tournament situations, but at the same time he surmises that they might in theory be performed effectively even in self-defense situations once their execution has been mastered.

The label was founded and financed by Guggenheim heiress Diane Hamilton in 1956. Its president and director was Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Clancy, who was soon to join his brothers Liam and Tom Clancy and Tommy Makem, as part of the new Irish folk group, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Liam Clancy designed the company's maple leaf logo. Columbia University Professor of Folklore Kenneth Goldstein was also involved in the early creation of the company, which operated out of Greenwich Village, New York, United States. With artists like The Clancy Brothers, Odetta, and Jean Ritchie growing in popularity during the American folk music revival, the label began to generate good profits. When The Clancy Brothers signed with Columbia Records in 1961, Paddy Clancy ceased to run the day-to-day operations of the company. In 1966, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, as owners of the label, sold the Tradition catalogue to Everest Records. Everest reissued Tradition recordings without any notes in haphazard permutations. Much of the Tradition catalogue has been reissued on CD and/or for digital download. For many years John Jacob Niles received little acclaim, but following the broadcast of the Bob Dylan documentary No Direction Home, there was a surge in the demand for his albums. His two albums on Tradition were reissued. 43 North Broadway. a private IP management fund, acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to the Tradition Records catalog as part of its acquisition of the Everest Record Group of labels.

Personal life The only child of millionaire Harry Frank Guggenheim, president of Newsday and onetime U. S. ambassador to Cuba, and his second wife, Caroline Morton (formerly Mrs William Chapman Potter), Hamilton was born as Diana Guggenheim in New York City, New York. She had two half-sisters, Joan (born 1913) and Nancy (1915‚Äì1972), from her father's first marriage to Helen Rosenberg. Her maternal grandfather was Paul Morton, U. S. Secretary of the Navy, while her maternal great-grandfather was Julius Sterling Morton, U. S. Secretary of Agriculture. She was married and divorced four times: *Lieutenant John Meredith Langstaff, a U. S. Army officer and aspiring concert singer, married 1943. They had one child, Diane Carol Langstaff (Mrs Peter Duveneck, Mrs Jim Rooney). *Robert Guillard. *William Meek, an Irish journalist, whom she married in 1963. They had four children: Eoin Meek, Colm Meek, Sorcha Meek, and Caitriona Meek. *John Darby Stolt, aka John Hamilton-Darby Career Very little is known of Hamilton's life, and only since the publication of the book The Mountain of the Women: Memoirs of an Irish Troubadour by Liam Clancy has it been possible to reconstruct her most notable years. In order to disguise her wealth, she adopted the alias 'Diane Hamilton'. She lived in Florence, Italy in the late 1950s where she ran a Montessori school and frequented workshops led by Dr. Roberto Assagioli. In 1955 she traveled to Ireland in search of folk singers. According to Liam Clancy's book, she became acquainted with Tom and Paddy Clancy in New York, and while in Ireland made the Clancy household one of the stops on her collecting trip. Young Liam was invited to continue on the trip with her, and one of the next stops was the home of Sarah Makem who had previously been recorded by Jean Ritchie on her album Field Trip (1954). This fateful meeting brought together Liam and Sarah's younger son, Tommy Makem, who was also recorded. These two, along with Liam's older brothers Paddy and Tom Clancy, would eventually form \\"The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem\\", one of the most successful groups in Irish music history. The anthology Hamilton recorded in 1955 as The Lark in the Morning is the earliest album-length collection of Irish folk songs sung by Irish singers to be recorded in Ireland. Also on the album are Paddy Tunney and Tommy Makem, son of Sarah Makem. This album was re- released in a restored format in the late 1990s on the Rykodisc label. Tradition Records Another member of the Clancy family, Paddy Clancy, helped Hamilton run Tradition Records as the company's president. The Lark in the Morning was the first album released on the Tradition label in 1955. Subsequent releases included The Rising of the Moon by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, and The Countess Cathleen by W.B. Yeats in 1956. Other notable recordings include Negro Prison songs, a compilation by Alan Lomax and The Bonny Bunch of Roses with Seamus Ennis. Other Tradition artists included Ed McCurdy, Odetta, Paul Clayton, Jean Ritchie, Lightnin' Hopkins and Etta Baker. In 1959 the label released John Langstaff Sings American and English Ballads, featuring her then-current husband singing and Nancy Trowbridge (who later became Langstaff's second wife) on piano. The album was re-released by Revels Records in 2002 as The Water Is Wide: American and British Ballads and Folksongs. Once the Clancy Brothers signed with Columbia Records in 1961, the catalogue was sold, possibly to Transatlantic. In the 1970s, Hamilton was involved in the founding of the Mulligan record label, in Dublin. She may have regarded D√≥nal Lunny as the successor to Liam Clancy as the next standard- bearer of the authentic Irish traditional music heritage. A passing reference to Hamilton in a California folk music magazine suggests that she was still active in Irish music as late as the early 1980s. The November/December 1982 issue of Folk Scene (Los Angeles) credits her with \\"the lion's share of the work\\" for the recording, in 1977, of the album The Gathering--released on the label Greenhays in 1981--which features the playing of Andy Irvine, Paul Brady, D√≥nal Lunny, Matt Molloy, Tommy Potts, Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill and uilleann piper Peter Browne.Folk Scene, Los Angeles, CA, November‚ÄìDecember 1982, Vol. 10, #5, p. 14.

Biography Born in Lodz, Poland, Binyomin was the oldest son of a Radoshitzer chassidic family. His mother passed away when he was eight years old, and he left Europe by himself in 1907 based on correspondence with a friend who preceded him to America.Age 20 He first peddled from a pushcart, until he had made enough money to rent a store. Within less than two years he had his own houseware business; the business still exists. Binyomin married Bluma Weberman. Torah Vodaath He moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he and his friend, Louis (Leibish) Dershowitz, wanted to open a yeshiva for boys. At that time, the few yeshivos that existed in the United States ‚Äî Yeshivas HaRav Yaakov Yosef, Etz Chaim Yeshiva, Yeshivas HaRav Shlomo Kluger ‚Äî were all in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Wilhelm envisioned a yeshiva that taught secular studies in the afternoons. Wilhelm had to overcame large opposition to his type of yeshiva. Most parents did not want to send their children to yeshiva. There was also opposition from the other side. Some parents held that a yeshiva should be purely for Jewish studies. In the end he prevailed and founded what would become known as 'the mother of all American yeshivos' - Yeshiva and Mesivta Torah Vodaath. A major breakthrough was the later recruitment and hiring of a yet unknown man, who Wilhelm uncovered, Rabbi 'Mr.' Shraga Feivel Mendelowitz. Together they built the first mesivta (Yeshiva High School) in New York and spurred the creation of Torah Umesorah. Binyomin Wilhelm was instrumental in the founding and stabilization of the first Bais Yaakov schools for girls and many other organizations. Wilhelm was active in Torah Vodaas until his 80s, when he moved to Israel in 1968. There, he founded a network of afternoon programs for Sephardic youth in developing areas, which was to strengthen their commitment to Judaism. He called the network Mifal Torah Vodaath. \\"Founded in 1968 by the Torah pioneer and builder R' Binyomin Wilhelm, z\\"l, after he moved to Israel Mifal played a major role in turning the tide that was ...\\" This innovative program was one the very first Jewish outreach programs created. Belsky, Hershkowitz, Gewirtz branches The Wilhelm family went on to become known as leaders on the Jewish communal scene in communities across the country and beyond. Their daughter Chana married Rabbi Berel Belsky and in 1970 moved from Williamsburg to Kensington.; their son Yisroel Belsky, years later, became a rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Torah Vodaath.

Dr. Dumont (Arthur Edmund Carewe) has bad news for Toto: his heart is so weak, even the excitement caused by so much as a woman's kiss would be fatal. Toto takes to his bed, but three of his girlfriends insist on nursing him: Fifi (Joan Blondell), Florine (Louise Brooks) and Dagmar (Yola d'Avril). When they all converge on his bedroom and discover each other, they engage in a three-way catfight. Then an outraged husband (John T. Murray) shows up to shoot him. Dr. Dumont arrives and divulges Toto's condition. The husband and the three women all depart. Then Diane shows up, but before she leaves with her father for America, she insists on spending an hour of passion with him. Unable to resist, he kisses her. When he remains alive, he upbraids the newly arrived Dr. Dumont for his faulty prognosis. Mr. Churchill explains that he had Dumont fake his diagnosis, that it was all a test of Toto's claim he loved Diane \\"more than life itself\\". Convinced, he gives Toto permission to marry Diane.

Dominic College caters for students from Kindergarten to Grade 10. The school aims to foster a Catholic community focused upon the eucharist, and creating a caring community in which all members can live and work harmoniously. History The College owes its religious foundation to the Salesians of Don Bosco and the Dominican Sisters. Dominic College was formed in 1973 and was the first Co-educational Catholic College in Tasmania. The Senior Campus amalgamated with other Catholic Secondary Colleges in 1995 to form Guilford Young College. In 2009, Dominic opened an on-campus early learning and child care centre.  Student leadership  The four houses of the College, Bosco, Siena, Savio and Guzman, have four leaders each which all have set responsibilities. Mission Captains: Enforces the religious and community aspect of school life by helping in masses, liturgies and charity. Sport Captains: Enforces the sporting aspect of school life by assisting in organising sporting carnivals, lunchtime sport and co-curricular sport. Creative Arts Captains: Enforces the creative arts aspect of school life by assisting and promoting house events such as house drama, co-curricular creative arts and various public exhibitions. Academic Captains: Promote the importance of learning throughout the college by ensuring all students are learning to the best of their abilities. These leaders are also assisted by their house co-ordinator. The secondary college and primary school also has one male and female captain and one male and female vice-captain. These captaincy positions are held by students in either year 6 or year 10. The captains must uphold the school values and represent the school wherever they are. Each leader of any sort receives a black tie and badge for recognition towards their position in the school.  House system  All students and staff are assigned to a particular House and family links are observed for the sake of tradition and continuity. The House system operates in Kindergarten ‚Äì Year 10. Each student belongs to one of the following Houses under the direction of the House Coordinator: BOSCO (Blue): Eagles GUZMAN (Green): Crocodiles SAVIO (Yellow): Sharks SIENA (Red): Dragons Students are divided evenly among the houses. Houses are allocated evenly to each of the primary classes and for Year 7‚Äì10 students, pastoral/home groups are assigned to a particular house. Dominic College actively participates in several house carnivals and events. Traditional house carnivals include Cross Country, Athletics and Swimming Carnivals. While many schools have had to do away with these carnivals due to poor attendance records, Dominic enjoys increased attendance for such events due to the strength of the vertically streamed pastoral groups and the camaraderie which they encourage. More recently introduced house events include House Drama and House Dance.
