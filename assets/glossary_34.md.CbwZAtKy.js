After joining the French Army in 1944 during the colonial era of Vietnam, he soon met and became the aide-de-camp and bodyguard of D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, and spent the rest of his career in this role as Minh rose up the ranks to become a general. Nhung and Minh later transferred to the French-backed Vietnamese National Army (VNA) during the First Indochina War and he became an officer; the VNA then became the ARVN after the creation of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). A soft-spoken man, Nhung was a professional military hitman who was reputed to have etched a line on his revolver for each of his killings, and ended the lives of 50 people during his career.Hammer, p. 298. Nhung was best known for his role in the November 1963 coup d'√©tat led by Minh that ousted President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám from office. At the end of the coup, Nhung - having shot Colonel L√™ Quang Tung, the loyalist commander of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces at a grave at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base the day before - executed Di·ªám and his brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu. An investigation led by General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n, another coup plotter, determined that Nhung had repeatedly stabbed and shot the Ng√¥ brothers while escorting them back to military headquarters after having arrested them. In a 1994 interview, General Nguyen Khanh recalled, \\"Nhu (Diem's brother) was alive when they put the knife in to take out some of the organs.....the gallbladder. And in the Orient when you are a big soldier, big man-this thing is very important.... They do it against Nhu when Nhu was alive..... And Diem had this happen to him, and later on they kill him by pistol and rifle.\\"Nhuyen Khanh, interview by Geoffrey D.T. Shaw, June 16, 1994. U.S.A.F Special Operations School, Hurlburt Field, Florida, transcript, 46-48. It was widely believed that Minh had ordered Nhung to execute the Ng√¥ brothers. Following Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh's successful January 1964 coup against Minh's military junta, Nhung died in mysterious circumstances, the only rebel fatality in the regime change. Early career Nhung was born in either 1919 or early 1920. At the time, Vietnam was a French colony within French Indochina; and, in 1944, Nhung joined the French Army, where he soon met D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, who became his superior for the next two decades. Nhung would spend most of his career as Minh's aide-de-camp and bodyguard. He was described as a quiet and slightly built man who smoked a pipe. Following the end of World War II, the French set up the State of Vietnam, an associated state within the French Union, and created the Vietnamese National Army (VNA), and both Minh and Nhung transferred to the VNA, where they were trained and commissioned as officers. As of November 1963, Nhung had risen to the rank of captain. Tung assassination alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. On 1 November 1963, a group of ARVN generals, led by Minh, orchestrated a coup against President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. The plotters summoned a group of ARVN officers to the Joint General Staff headquarters at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base, on the pretext that they were going to attend a lunch meeting.Jones, p. 408. Among those invited was the loyalist commander of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, Colonel L√™ Quang Tung. At 13:30 (UTC 06:30), General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n announced that a coup was taking place. Most of the officers rose to applaud, but Tung did not, refusing to join the coup. He was taken away by Nhung, all the while shouting, ‚ÄúRemember who gave you your stars!‚ÄùTucker, p. 227. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Di·ªám on the phone, telling the president that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Di·ªám loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids in August.Hammer, p. 290. The generals were well aware of the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning,Karnow, p. 310.Jones, p. 325. having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.Jones, p. 388. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major L√™ Quang Tri·ªáu,Karnow, p. 321. with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them to the edge of the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.Jones, p. 414. Di·ªám and Nhu assassination Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu (pictured) shaking hands with United States Vice President alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. By the next morning, the loyalist forces had collapsed. Di·ªám and his younger brother and chief adviser, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup plotter ƒê√¥n promised them safe passage out of the country.Karnow, p. 322. In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Di·ªám and Nhu for the surrender ceremony. However, the Ng√¥ brothers were not there, they had escaped from Gia Long Palace via a secret tunnel to a safehouse in Cholon the previous night.Jones, p. 418.Hammer, p. 293.Karnow, p. 323. Di·ªám and Nhu had communicated with the generals via a direct phone link from the safehouse to the palace, giving the false impression that they were still besieged. Having been informed of Di·ªám and Nhu‚Äôs whereabouts, Minh dispatched a group of officers and troops--which included Nhung--to arrest them. He was aware that the brothers had left the safehouse to go to St Francis Xavier's Church. Led by General Mai H·ªØu Xu√¢n, the officers took an M113 armored personnel carrier (APC), four jeeps, and several soldiers to Cholon. As they left, Minh gestured to Nhung with two fingers, taken to be an order to shoot the brothers.Jones, pp. 416-17. alt=Middle-aged black-haired man lies face half-down on the floor, covered on his face and dark suit and trousers with blood. His hands are behind his back. The soldiers arrived at the church and promptly arrested the brothers, tying them with their hands behind their backs. After the arrest, Nhung and Major D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a sat with Di·ªám and Nhu inside the APC, and the convoy departed for T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t. They stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip where, by all accounts, the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by ƒê√¥n later determined that Nghƒ©a had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing their bodies with a knife.Karnow, p. 326. During the journey back, Nghƒ©a gave his account of the assassinations to military headquarters: ‚ÄúAs we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Di·ªám sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [Nhung] began to insult each other. I don‚Äôt know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion.‚Äù When the convoy reached a train crossing, Nghƒ©a said that Nhung ‚Äúlunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Di·ªám, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Di·ªám nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.‚Äù ƒê√¥n and other officers were stunned when the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters. ƒê√¥n confronted Minh in his office, and while they were remonstrating, Xu√¢n entered the room. Unaware of ƒê√¥n's presence, Xu√¢n snapped to attention and stated in French, ‚ÄúMission accomplie‚Äù.Jones, p. 429. Despite ƒê√¥n's investigation, no one was ever charged with the killings.Jones, p. 180. Death Following the coup, Nhung's commanding officer, General Minh, became the President of South Vietnam, ruling through a military junta known as the Military Revolutionary Council. After three months of rule, which was criticised for its lack of direction,Shaplen, p. 213.Karnow, pp. 350-54. General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh deposed Minh in a bloodless coup before dawn on 30 January 1964. Minh was briefly put under house arrest, and the next day, reports surfaced that Nhung was dead, the only fatality in the coup or its aftermath. There was initially confusion as various conflicting reports of Nhung's demise surfaced, one source telling journalists that Nhung lived in a cottage within the grounds of Minh's villa and shot himself outside his house. These informants speculated that Nhung committed suicide to avoid having to live to see Minh being demoted or humiliated. The time of this incident was reported to be 21:00. Other reports at the time said that Nhung was found dead as a result of strangulation at the Joint General Staff headquarters. According to variations of this line, Nhung either hanged himself in custody or was murdered by an unknown hand. More recently, historians have come to believe that Kh√°nh ordered that Nhung be liquidated and that the earlier reports were deliberately false material disseminated by Kh√°nh through his subordinates. According to this now-established account, one of Kh√°nh's men took Nhung to the garden of a Saigon villa and forced him to kneel, before executing him with a single gunshot to the back of the head. Nhung's death led to protests among the Saigon public, who took the killing to be a signal that the remaining members of Di·ªám's regime would be reinstated to positions of authority.Karnow, pp. 354-55. Nhung was buried on 1 February, the day after his death, in the presence of family and friends, at Gia ƒê√≠nh cemetery. Nhung's death was never formally investigated by an independent body and the official line of suicide continued to be propagated. Minh was said to have been deeply affected by the loss of his long-time aide, and it was reported that the general erected an altar dedicated to Nhung's memory in his office, with the major's portrait on it. Shortly after the coup, Kh√°nh made Minh the figurehead head of state under American advice, hoping that the presence of the popular general would help to unify the armed forces, but Minh made little attempt to help Kh√°nh, partly because of resentment over the loss of his aide.

Inspec coverage is extensive in the fields of physics, computing, control, and engineering. Its subject coverage includes astronomy, electronics, communications, computers and computing, computer science, control engineering, electrical engineering, information technology, physics, manufacturing, production and mechanical engineering. Now, due to emerging concept of technology for business, Inspec also includes information technology for business in its portfolio. Inspec indexed few journals publishing high quality research by integrating technology into management, economics and social sciences domains. The sample journals include Annual Review of Financial Economics, Aslib Journal of Information Management, Australian Journal of Management and, International Journal of Management, Economics and Social Sciences. Inspec was started in 1967 as an outgrowth of the Science Abstracts service. The electronic records were distributed on magnetic tape. In the 1980s, it was available in the U.S. through the Knowledge Index, a low-priced dial-up version of the Dialog service for individual users, which made it popular. For nearly 50 years, the IET has employed scientists to manually review items to be included in Inspec, hand- indexing the literature using their own expertise of the subject area and make a judgement call about which terms and classification codes should be applied. Thanks to this work, a significant thesaurus has been developed which enables content to be indexed far more accurately and in context, which in turn helps end-users discover relevant literature that may otherwise have remained hidden from typical search queries, making Inspec an essential tool for prior art, patentability searches and patent drafting. Access to Inspec is currently by the Internet through Inspec Direct and various resellers.

Section A, Physics and Science Abstracts. Section A, Physics Abstracts from volume 6 to volume 74. By 1972 other societies were associated as authors of this service such as the American Institute of Physics. In 1975 or 1976 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers also became an author. By 1980 this database was also issued as INSPEC-Physics on various formats. It was also available as part of INSPEC database. Presently it is part of Inspec, Section A - Physics database. At the same time, the Physics Abstracts title was employed throughout the 1990s.

This position allowed Clarke to access to \\"all of the world‚Äôs leading scientific journals.\\" =Science Abstracts= The first issue of Science Abstracts was published in January 1898. During that first year, a total of 1,423 abstracts were published at monthly intervals, and at the end of the year an author and subject index were added. Bibliographic information for this database The first issue contained 110 abstracts and was divided into 10 sections: * General Physics * Light * Heat * Sound * Electricity * Electrochemistry and Chemical Physics * General Electrical Engineering * Dynamos, Electric Motors and Transformers * Power Distribution, Traction and Lighting * Telegraphy and Telephony Science Abstracts was the result of a joint collaboration between the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) and The Physical Society of London. The publication was (at that time) provided without charge to all members of both societies. The cost of the publication was mainly borne by the IEE and The Physical Society. Financial contributions were also received from the Institution of Civil Engineers, The Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science By 1902, the annual number of abstracts published had increased to 2,362. By May 1903 it was decided to split the publication into two parts: A (Physics) and B (Electrical Engineering). This decision allowed the subject's scope to widen, particularly in physics. As a result, this allowed a larger quantity of material to be covered. Since 1967, electronic access to Science Abstracts has been provided by INSPEC.

It is located about east of the southeast arm of Yellowstone Lake. Etymology According to Lee Whittlesey, Eagle Peak was named in 1885 by geologist Arnold Hague for its resemblance to a \\"spread eagle\\". Another source states that it was named in 1878 by Jack Newell, who killed a golden eagle on the mountain that year. History Up until the 1930s, most park officials and geologists believed that Electric Peak near Gardiner, Montana was the park's highest peak, not Eagle Peak. It is ranked as the 218th highest peak in Wyoming and the 2252nd highest peak in the United States. During the historic Yellowstone fires of 1988, the south slopes of Eagle Peak were affected by the Mink Fire. Geology Eagle Peak is part of the Absaroka Range and is formed of Eocene age volcaniclastic rocks. In the last ice age, the area was covered by an ice cap over thick. Glacial deposits remain in some locations on the mountain. Geography Located in the Absaroka Range, on the park boundary with Shoshone National Forest in northwestern Wyoming, the mountain rises about east of the southeast arm of Yellowstone Lake. The mountain is also one of the highest points in the Washakie Wilderness area of Shoshone National Forest. Eagle Peak is of a similar height to several other local mountains; there is a ridge which gradually gets higher as it heads southeast culminating in several summits - Mount Schurz, to the immediate northwest is shorter, and Pinnacle Mountain, to the immediate southeast, is taller, but outside of the park boundary. Several creeks flow through the mountain and the surrounding area and they become a vehicle for cold melt water. The Gardner River flows to the east of the summit. Some of the runoff is fed by the melting of the two major snowfields found in the shadows of the north face of the mountain. The range to the east drains into the Yellowstone River via the Bighorn River, but the southern slopes drain into Yellowstone Lake via Mountain Creek. Eagle Peak is one of the most prominent features of the Eagle Peak Quadrangle, a USGS division used for surveying purposes. Other nearby peaks are Mount Humphreys, Table Mountain, Mount Schurz, Pinnacle Mountain, Turret Mountain and Colter Peak. Access The mountain is fairly inaccessible, being a hike from any of the park roads. From outside the park, the peak can be ascended by hiking up the Fish Hawk Creek valley, which is around one-way. It is also climbed from inside the park, by sailing to the southeasternmost tip of Yellowstone Lake, hiking down the Yellowstone River valley, and then turning to the east for the ascent. Wildlife Eagle Peak, c.1890 Eagle Peak wildlife are in the alpine tundra zone and may be threatened by global climate change‚Äîthe gradual shift of montane fauna and flora upwards could lead to the permanent loss of some species from the park. To the south, on the boundary of the park is Eagle Pass and the Thorofare Plateau, which has a population of elk, moose, deer, bear, bighorn sheep and others and lies along an important north-south migration route for the elk. Flora includes sedges and rushes, and tufted hairgrass in alpine meadows.

Renumbered On 14 September 1987 it became 173rd Guards District Training Centre. In 1991 it comprised three motor rifle regiments, one tank regiment, one Guards training artillery regiment and one air defence regiment. These units were the 70th, 71st and 72nd Motor Rifle Regiments; the 392nd Tank Regiment; the 50th Guards Training Artillery Regiment and the 1203rd Anti- aircraft Missile Regiment. In November 1990 it had a total of 219 tanks, 187 being T-55s. Disbanded It was disbanded on 4 January 1992 (Holm). Later it may have had to hand over half its weapons to the Chechens in order to evacuate the other half unhindered. Reformed The Division was reformed late 1990s. Following the beginning of the Second Chechen War it was designated in December 1999 as the permanent garrison force for Chechnya and various military districts started raising its regiments separately in 2000.Michael Orr, \\"Russia's Chechen War Reaches Crisis Point\\", Jane's Intelligence Review, October 2000. The division was intended to have a strength of 15,500 men. Its headquarters was established at Khankala outside Groznyy, with the 71st Motor Rifle Regiment also at the same base; the 71st MRR was raised in the Volga Military District. 70th Motor Rifle Regiment was formed in the Urals MD and located at Shali. 72nd MRR, raised from the 2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District was established at Kalinovskaya, and 291st Motor Rifle Regiment, originating in the Leningrad Military District, was set up at Borzoy.Borzoy is at 42¬∞50‚Ä≤19‚Ä≥N 45¬∞37‚Ä≤50‚Ä≥E / 42.83859¬∞N 45.63042¬∞E / 42.83859; 45.63042, in the Shatoy district, on the Itum-Kale - Shatoy road.

He also said that three of the regiments of the 42nd Division were going to be equipped \\"to the maximum\\" by the end of the year. The writer Michael Orr, noted that the 291st MRR had been relocated 'when the tactical vulnerability of the position [originally Itum-Kale] was appreciated.'Orr, 2000, p.17 The division was equipped with T-62 tanks, with at least one regiment having BMP-1 IFVs (infantry fighting vehicles). The 42nd Division included two Chechen battalions, the Vostok and Zapad units.http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/0/2A70ED295DFC411EC22571FD0049FC9E?OpenDocument. Sulim Yamadayev commands the Vostok battalion. The two battalions were apparently GRU Spetsnaz units but under the operational command of the 42nd Division. Following the 2008 Russian military reform, the division was downsized into the 18th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade. The division was reestablished in 2016.

It is native to southern Africa. Taxonomy There are two subspecies: * Z. v. capensis Sundevall, 1850 ‚Äì south-western South Africa, Lesotho and adjacent western KwaZulu-Natal. * Z. v. virens Sundevall, 1850 ‚Äì eastern and south-eastern Botswana, eastern and northern South Africa, Swaziland, and adjacent south-western Mozambique. These subspecies interbreed where they come into contact. The Orange River white-eye (Z. pallidus) has been split from the Cape white-eye. Identification Z. v. capensis, Cape Town Z. v. virens, Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve This species is about 12 cm long with rounded wings, strong legs, and a conspicuous ring of white feathers round the eyes. The upperparts are green, and the throat and vent are bright yellow. The members of the Z. v. capensis has a grey breast and belly, whereas Z. v. virens has a greenish-yellow breast and belly. They are very vocal, and constantly keep in touch with soft trilled pee, pree or pirreee callnotes. The song consists of repeated long jerky phrases of sweet reedy notes, varying in pitch, volume and temp, usually starting off with teee teee or pirrup pirrup notes, then becoming a fast rambled jumble of notes, which may incorporate mimicked phrases of other birdcalls. Behaviour This is a sociable species forming large flocks outside the breeding season. It builds a cup nest in a tree and lays 2-3 unspotted pale blue eggs. The eggs hatch in 11‚Äì12 days, and fledging occurs in another 12‚Äì13 days. The peak breeding season is September to December. The Cape white-eye feeds mainly on insects, but also soft fleshy flowers, nectar, fruit and small grains. It readily comes to bird feeders. Distribution It is found in a wide range of densely to lightly wooded habitats in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and marginally in Mozambique. Most populations are resident, but some perform minor seasonal movements.

First Formation The 5th Guards Stalingrad-Kiev Red Banner Tank Division was formed in September 1945 at Sherlovaya Gora, Chita Oblast, from the 5th Guards Tank Corps. In mid 1957 it became the 122nd Guards Motor Rifle Division. Second Formation Structure of the 5th Guards Tank Division, late 2000s The second formation drew its heritage from an illustrious Soviet World War II cavalry formation, the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps (Honorifics Don- Budapest Red Banner). After the end of World War II, the corps relocated from Ploie»ôti in Romania, where it was part of the Southern Group of Forces, to Novocherkassk in Rostov Oblast, by the fall of 1945. The corps was reorganised as the 5th Guards Cavalry Division on 6 May 1946, part of the North Caucasus Military District. Its two cavalry divisions, the 11th Guards and 12th Guards, became regiments with the same numbers in the new division. A third regiment, the 7th Guards Cavalry Regiment, was renumbered from the 37th Guards Cavalry Regiment. On 6 September 1951, the division was awarded the honorific \\"named for E.A. Shchadenko\\", in honor of Soviet cavalry commander Yefim Shchadenko. On 18 November 1954 18th Guards Heavy Tank Division was formed from 5th Guards Cavalry Division. With the beginning of the Nikita Khrushchev era, the Strategic Rocket Forces were increasingly emphasised at the expense of the Ground Forces, and the Ground Forces were reduced and reorganized. On 5 March 1962, the division dropped the designation \\"Heavy\\" and became simply the 18th Guards Tank Division. Between 1 and 2 June 1962, the division was involved in the Novocherkassk massacre, the suppression of a strike caused by food shortages. On 11 January 1965, the division was renumbered the 5th Guards Tank Division to reflect its World War II title. In April 1966, the division was transferred to Kyakhta, on the Mongolian‚ÄìRussian border, to reinforce the Transbaikal Military District in the light of deteriorating relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 22 February 1968, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Star. By May 1970, the division was part of the 29th Army. The division was expanded into the 48th Separate Guards Army Corps, as an experiment in rapid reaction units along with the Belorussian Military District's 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division, from 1982 to 1989. The three tank regiments and single motor rifle regiment of the division were expanded into two tank brigades and two motor rifle brigades, and the 1319th Air Assault Regiment and 373rd Separate Helicopter Regiment, both newly formed, were added to the corps.

Russell devised and introduced the axiom in an attempt to manage the contradictions he had discovered in his analysis of set theory. History With Russell's discovery (1901, 1902)According to van Heijenoort 1967:124, Russell discovered the paradox in June 1901. van Heijenoort in turn references Bertrand Russell (1944) \\"My mental development\\" in The philosophy of Bertrand Russell, edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp (Tudor, New York), page 13. But Russell did not report it to Frege until his letter to Frege dated 16 June 1902. Livio 2009:186 reports the same date. Livio 2009:191 writes that Zermelo discovered the paradox as early as 1900, but does not give his source for this (Ewald 1996?). Indeed, Zermelo makes this claim in a footnote 9 to his 1908 A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering in van Heijenoort 1967:191. of a paradox in Gottlob Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift and Frege's acknowledgment of the same (1902), Russell tentatively introduced his solution as \\"Appendix B: Doctrine of Types\\" in his 1903 The Principles of Mathematics.Cf. Introductory remarks by W. V. O. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150. This contradiction can be stated as \\"the class of all classes that do not contain themselves as elements\\".Cf. Introductory remarks by W. V. O. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150. At the end of this appendix Russell asserts that his \\"doctrine\\" would solve the immediate problem posed by Frege, but \\"there is at least one closely analogous contradiction which is probably not soluble by this doctrine. The totality of all logical objects, or of all propositions, involves, it would seem a fundamental logical difficulty. What the complete solution of the difficulty may be, I have not succeeded in discovering; but as it affects the very foundations of reasoning...\\"Russell 1903:528 By the time of his 1908 Mathematical logic as based on the theory of typesreprinted in van Heijenoort 150‚Äì182 Russell had studied \\"the contradictions\\" (among them the Epimenides paradox, the Burali-Forti paradox, and Richard's paradox) and concluded that \\"In all the contradictions there is a common characteristic, which we may describe as self-reference or reflexiveness\\".Russell 1908:154. The exact wording appears in Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:60 In 1903, Russell defined predicative functions as those whose order is one more than the highest-order function occurring in the expression of the function. While these were fine for the situation, impredicative functions had to be disallowed: He repeats this definition in a slightly different way later in the paper (together with a subtle prohibition that they would express more clearly in 1913): This usage carries over to Alfred North Whitehead and Russell's 1913 Principia Mathematica wherein the authors devote an entire subsection of their Chapter II: \\"The Theory of Logical Types\\" to subchapter I. The Vicious-Circle Principle: \\"We will define a function of one variable as predicative when it is of the next order above that of its argument, i.e. of the lowest order compatible with its having that argument. . . A function of several arguments is predicative if there is one of its arguments such that, when the other arguments have values assigned to them, we obtain a predicative function of the one undetermined argument.\\"Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:53 They again propose the definition of a predicative function as one that does not violate The Theory of Logical Types. Indeed the authors assert such violations are \\"incapable [to achieve]\\" and \\"impossible\\": The authors stress the word impossible: Russell's axiom of reducibility The axiom of reducibility states that any truth function (i.e. propositional function) can be expressed by a formally equivalent predicative truth function. It made its first appearance in Bertrand Russell's (1908) Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types, but only after some five years of trial and error.Cf. commentary by W. V. O. Quine in van Heijenoort 1967:150‚Äì152 In his words: For relations (functions of two variables such as \\"For all x and for all y, those values for which f(x,y) is true\\" i.e. ‚àÄx‚àÄy: f(x,y)), Russell assumed an axiom of relations, or [the same] axiom of reducibility. In 1903, he proposed a possible process of evaluating such a 2-place function by comparing the process to double integration: One after another, plug into x definite values am (i.e. the particular aj is \\"a constant\\" or a parameter held constant), then evaluate f(am,yn) across all the n instances of possible yn. For all yn evaluate f(a1, yn), then for all yn evaluate f(a2, yn), etc until all the x = am are exhausted). This would create an m by n matrix of values: TRUE or UNKNOWN. (In this exposition, the use of indices is a modern convenience.) In 1908, Russell made no mention of this matrix of x, y values that render a two-place function (e.g. relation) TRUE, but by 1913 he has introduced a matrix-like concept into \\"function\\". In *12 of Principia Mathematica (1913) he defines \\"a matrix\\" as \\"any function, of however many variables, which does not involve any apparent variables. Then any possible function other than a matrix is derived from a matrix by means of generalisation, i.e. by considering the proposition which asserts that the function in question is true with all possible values or with some values of one of the arguments, the other argument or arguments remaining undetermined\\".Whitehead and Russell 1913:162 For example, if one asserts that \\"‚àÄy: f(x, y) is true\\", then x is the apparent variable because it is unspecified. Russell now defines a matrix of \\"individuals\\" as a first-order matrix, and he follows a similar process to define a second-order matrix, etc. Finally, he introduces the definition of a predicative function: From this reasoning, he then uses the same wording to propose the same axioms of reducibility as he did in his 1908. As an aside, Russell in his 1903 considered, and then rejected, \\"a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples\\",Russell 1903:99 i.e. the modern set- theoretic notion of ordered pair. An intuitive version of this notion appeared in Frege's (1879) Begriffsschrift (translated in van Heijenoort 1967:23); Russell's 1903 followed closely the work of Frege (cf. Russell 1903:505ff). Russell worried that \\"it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent from the relatum: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. It would seem, viewing the idea philosophically, that sense can only be derived from some relational proposition . . . it seems therefore more correct to take an intensional view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes\\".Russell 1903:99 As shown below, Norbert Wiener (1914) reduced the notion of relation to class by his definition of an ordered pair. Criticism =Zermelo 1908= The outright prohibition implied by Russell's axiom of reducibility was roundly criticised by Ernst Zermelo in his 1908 Investigations in the foundations of set theory I, stung as he was by a demand similar to that of Russell that came from Poincar√©: Zermelo countered: =Wiener 1914= In his 1914 A simplification of the logic of relations, Norbert Wiener removed the need for the axiom of reducibility as applied to relations between two variables x, and y e.g. œÜ(x,y). He did this by introducing a way to express a relation as a set of ordered pairs: \\"It will be seen that what we have done is practically to revert to Schr√∂der's treatment of a relation as a class [set] of ordered couples\\".Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:226 Van Heijenoort observes that \\"[b]y giving a definition of the ordered pair of two-elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes.\\"Wiener in van Heijenoort 1967:224 But Wiener opined that while he had dispatched Russell and Whitehead's two-variable version of the axiom *12.11, the single-variable version of the axiom of reducibility for (axiom *12.1 in Principia Mathematica) was still necessary.Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:224 =Wittgenstein 1918= Ludwig Wittgenstein, while imprisoned in a prison camp, finished his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. His introduction credits \\"the great works of Frege and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell\\". Not a self-effacing intellectual, he pronounced that \\"the truth of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved.\\"Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:4 So given such an attitude, it is no surprise that Russell's theory of types comes under criticism: This appears to support the same argument Russell uses to erase his \\"paradox\\". This \\"using the signs\\" to \\"speak of the signs\\" Russell criticises in his introduction that preceded the original English translation: This problem appears later when Wittgenstein arrives at this gentle disavowal of the axiom of reducibility‚Äîone interpretation of the following is that Wittgenstein is saying that Russell has made (what is known today as) a category error; Russell has asserted (inserted into the theory) a \\"further law of logic\\" when all the laws (e.g. the unbounded Sheffer stroke adopted by Wittgenstein) have already been asserted: =Russell 1919= Bertrand Russell in his 1919 Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, a non-mathematical companion to his first edition of PM, discusses his Axiom of Reducibility in Chapter 17 Classes (pp. 146ff). He concludes that \\"we cannot accept \\"class\\" as a primitive idea; the symbols for classes are \\"mere conveniences\\" and classes are \\"logical fictions, or (as we say) 'incomplete symbols' ... classes cannot be regarded as part of the ultimate furniture of the world\\" (p. 146). The reason for this is because of the problem of impredicativity: \\"classes cannot be regarded as a species of individuals, on account of the contradiction about classes which are not members of themselves ... and because we can prove that the number of classes is greater than the number of individuals, [etc]\\". What he then does is propose 5 obligations that must be satisfied with respect to a theory of classes, and the result is his axiom of reducibility. He states that this axiom is \\"a generalised form of Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles\\" (p. 155). But he concludes Leibniz's assumption is not necessarily true for all possible predicates in all possible worlds, so he concludes that: The goal that he sets for himself then is \\"adjustments to his theory\\" of avoiding classes: =Skolem 1922= Thoralf Skolem in his 1922 Some remarks on axiomatised set theory took a less than positive attitude toward \\"Russell and Whitehead\\" (i.e. their work Principia Mathematica): Skolem then observes the problems of what he called \\"nonpredicative definition\\" in the set theory of Zermelo:Zermelo stipulates that there exist \\"a domain B of objects, among which are the sets.\\" But by a theorem Zermelo proves that this domain B cannot be a set itself \\"and this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned.\\" (Cf. Zermelo 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:203.) The ultimate problem (to be answered by Skolem [1922] and Fraenkel [1922]) is a precise definition of Zermelo's notion of definite property which, via Zermelo's Axiom of separation (Axiom der Aussonderung), when applied via a propositional function to a set M, separates from M a subset e.g. M1 (Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:292). While Skolem is mainly addressing a problem with Zermelo's set theory, he does make this observation about the axiom of reducibility: =Russell 1927= In his 1927 \\"Introduction\\" to the second edition of Principia Mathematica, Russell criticises his own axiom: Wittgenstein's 5.54ff is more centred on the notion of function: A possible interpretation of Wittgenstein's stance is that the thinker A i.e. p is identically the thought p, in this way the \\"soul\\" remains a unit and not a composite. So to utter \\"the thought thinks the thought\\" is nonsense, because per 5.542 the utterance does not specify anything. =von Neumann 1925= John von Neumann in his 1925 \\"An axiomatisation of set theory\\" wrestled with the same issues as did Russell, Zermelo, Skolem, and Fraenkel. He summarily rejected the effort of Russell: He then notes the work of the set theorists Zermelo, Fraenkel and Schoenflies, in which \\"one understands by \\"set\\" nothing but an object of which one knows no more and wants to know no more than what follows about it from the postulates. The postulates [of set theory] are to be formulated in such a way that all the desired theorems of Cantor's set theory follow from them, but not the antinomies.von Neumann in van Heijenoort 1967:395 While he mentions the efforts of David Hilbert to prove the consistency of his axiomatisation of mathematicsvon Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395 von Neumann placed him in the same group as Russell. Rather, von Neumann considered his proposal to be \\"in the spirit of the second group ... We must, however, avoid forming sets by collecting or separating elements [durch Zusammenfassung oder Aussonderung von Elementen], and so on, as well as eschew the unclear principle of 'definiteness' that can still be found in Zermelo. [...] We prefer, however, to axiomatise not 'set' but 'function'.\\"von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:401 Van Heijenoort observes that ultimately this axiomatic system of von Neumann's, \\"was simplified, revised, and expanded ... and it come to be known as the von Neumann-Bernays-G√∂del set theory.\\"van Heijenoort 1967:394 =David Hilbert 1927= David Hilbert's axiomatic system that he presents in his 1925 The Foundations of Mathematics is the mature expression of a task he set about in the early 1900s but let lapse for a while (cf. his 1904 On the foundations of logic and arithmetic). His system is neither set theoretic nor derived directly from Russell and Whitehead. Rather, it invokes 13 axioms of logic‚Äîfour axioms of Implication, six axioms of logical AND and logical OR, 2 axioms of logical negation, and 1 Œµ-axiom (\\"existence\\" axiom)-- plus a version of the Peano axioms in 4 axioms including mathematical induction, some definitions that \\"have the character of axioms, and certain recursion axioms that result from a general recursion schema\\"Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467 plus some formation rules that \\"govern the use of the axioms\\".Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467 Hilbert states that, with regard to this system, i.e. \\"Russell and Whitehead's theory of foundations[,] ... the foundation that it provides for mathematics rests, first, upon the axiom of infinity and, then upon what is called the axiom of reducibility, and both of these axioms are genuine contentual assumptions that are not supported by a consistency proof; they are assumptions whose validity in fact remains dubious and that, in any case, my theory does not require ... reducibility is not presupposed in my theory ... the execution of the reduction would be required only in case a proof of a contradiction were given, and then, according to my proof theory, this reduction would always be bound to succeed.\\"Boldface added, Hilbert in van Heijenoort 1967:473 It is upon this foundation that modern recursion theory rests. =Ramsey 1925= In 1925, Frank Plumpton Ramsey argued that it is not needed.The Foundations of Mathematics (1925), pages 1..61 of The Foundations of Mathematics, F. P. Ramsey, Littlefield Adams & Co, Paterson New Jersey, 1960 However in the second edition of Principia Mathematica (1927, page xiv) and in Ramsey's 1926 paperMathematical Logic, pages 62..61, op. cit. it is stated that certain theorems about real numbers could not be proved using Ramsey's approach. Most later mathematical formalisms (Hilbert's Formalism or Brower's Intuitionism for example) do not use it. Ramsey showed that it is possible to reformulate the definition of predicative by using the definitions in Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus. As a result, all functions of a given order are predicative, irrespective of how they are expressed. He goes on to show that his formulation still avoids the paradoxes. However, the \\"Tractatus\\" theory did not appear strong enough to prove some mathematical results. =G√∂del 1944= Kurt G√∂del in his 1944 Russell's mathematical logic offers in the words of his commentator Charles Parsons, \\"[what] might be seen as a defense of these [realist] attitudes of Russell against the reductionism prominent in his philosophy and implicit in much of his actual logical work. It was perhaps the most robust defense of realism about mathematics and its objects since the paradoxes and come to the consciousness of the mathematical world after 1900\\".This commentary appears on pages 102‚Äì118, and the paper itself on pages 119‚Äì141 appears in 1990 Kurt G√∂del: Collected Works, Volume II, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, . In general, G√∂del is sympathetic to the notion that a propositional function can be reduced to (identified with) the real objects that satisfy it, but this causes problems with respect to the theory of real numbers, and even integers (p. 134). He observes that the first edition of PM \\"abandoned\\" the realist (constructivistic) \\"attitude\\" with his proposal of the axiom of reducibility (p. 133). However, within the introduction to the second edition of PM (1927) G√∂del asserts \\"the constructivistic attitude is resumed again\\" (p. 133) when Russell \\"dropped\\" of the axiom of reducibility in favour of the matrix (truth-functional) theory; Russell \\"stated explicitly that all primitive predicates belong to the lowest type and that the only purpose of variables (and evidently also of constants) is to make it possible to assert more complicated truth-functions of atomic propositions ... [i.e.] the higher types and orders are solely a fa√ßon de parler\\" (p. 134). But this only works when the number of individuals and primitive predicates is finite, for one can construct finite strings of symbols such as: :x = a_1 \\\\vee x = a_2 \\\\vee \\\\dots \\\\vee x = a_k [example on page 134] And from such strings one can form strings of strings to obtain the equivalent of classes of classes, with a mixture of types possible. However, from such finite strings the whole of mathematics cannot be constructed because they cannot be \\"analyzed\\", i.e. reducible to the law of identity or disprovable by a negations of the law: But he observes that \\"this procedure seems to presuppose arithmetic in some form or other\\" (p. 134), and he states in the next paragraph that \\"the question of whether (or to what extent) the theory of integers can be obtained on the basis of the ramified hierarchy must be considered as unsolved.\\" (p. 135) G√∂del proposed that one should take a \\"more conservative approach\\": =Quine 1967= In a critique that also discusses the pros and cons of Ramsey (1931)W. V. O. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150‚Äì152 W. V. O. Quine calls Russell's formulation of \\"types\\" to be \\"troublesome ... the confusion persists as he attempts to define nth order propositions'... the method is indeed oddly devious ... the axiom of reducibility is self-effacing\\", etc.Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) in van Heijenoort 1967:151 Like Stephen Kleene, Quine observes that Ramsey (1926) Kleene 1952:532 gives this reference: \\"Ramsey, F. P. 1926, The foundations of mathematics, Proc. London Math. Soc., ser. 2, vol. 25, pp. 338‚Äì384. Reprinted as pp. 1‚Äì61 in The foundations of mathematics and other logical essays by F. P. Ramsey, ed. by R. B. Braithwaite, London (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner) and new your (Harcourt, brace) 1931. The latter reprinted London (Routledge and Kegan Paul) and New York (Humanities Press) 1950.\\" divided the various paradoxes into two varieties (i) \\"those of pure set theory\\" and (ii) those derived from \\"semantic concepts such as falsity and specifiability\\", and Ramsey believed that the second variety should have been left out of Russell's solution. Quine ends with the opinion that \\"because of the confusion of propositions with sentences, and of attributes with their expressions, Russell's purported solution of the semantic paradoxes was enigmatic anyway.\\"W. V. O. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150‚Äì152. Kleene (1952) is less sanguine about the problem of the paradoxes, cf. Kleene 1952:43. Kleene 1952 analyzes the situation this way: that Ramsey 1926 classifies the paradoxes as the \\"logical\\" versus the \\"epistomolical or \\"semantical\\" and Ramsey observes that the logical antinomies are (apparently) stopped by the simple hierarchy of types, and the semantical ones are (apparently) prevented ... by the absence ... of the requisite means for referring to expressions in the same language. But Ramsey's arguments to justify impredicative definitions within a type entail a conception of the totality of predicates of the type as existing independently of their constructibility or definability\\"; thus neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded (see at Kleene 1952) =Kleene 1952= In his section \\"¬ß12. First inferences from the paradoxes\\" (subchapter \\"LOGICISM\\"), Stephen Kleene (1952) traces the development of Russell's theory of types: Kleene observes that \\"to exclude impredicative definitions within a type, the types above type 0 [primary objects or individuals \\"not subjected to logical analysis\\"] are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1 [properties of individuals, i.e. logical results of the propositional calculus ], properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to order 0, and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order below to the next higher order)\\".Kleene 1952:44 Kleene, however, parenthetically observes that \\"the logicistic definition of natural number now becomes predicative when the [property] P in it is specified to range only over properties of a given order; in [this] case the property of being a natural number is of the next higher order\\".Slight punctuation changes added for clarity, Kleene 1952:44 But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which [see Kleene's example at Impredicativity] contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his axiom of reducibility.Kleene 1952:44 But, Kleene wonders, \\"on what grounds should we believe in the axiom of reducibility?\\"Kleene 1952:45 He observes that, whereas Principia Mathematica is presented as derived from intuitively-derived axioms that \\"were intended to be believed about the world, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world[,] ... if properties are to be constructed, the matter should be settled on the basis of constructions, not by an axiom.\\" Indeed, he quotes Whitehead and Russell (1927) questioning their own axiom: \\"clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content\\".Kleene 1952:45, quoting from Whitehead and Russell's introduction to their 1927 2nd edition of Principia Mathematica. Kleene references the work of Ramsey 1926, but notes that \\"neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded in attaining the logicistic goal constructively\\" and \\"an interesting proposal ... by Langford 1927 and Carnap 1931-2, is also not free of difficulties.\\"both quotes from Kleene 1952:45 Kleene ends this discussion with quotes from Weyl (1946) that \\"the system of Principia Mathematica ... [is founded on] a sort of logician's paradise\\" and anyone \\"who is ready to believe in this 'transcendental world' could also accept the system of axiomatic set theory (Zermelo, Fraenkel, etc), which, for the deduction of mathematics, has the advantage of being simpler in structure.\\"Kleene 1952:45 Notes References * van Heijenoort, Jean (1967, 3rd printing 1976), From Frege to Godel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879‚Äì1931, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, (pbk) * Russell, Bertrand (1903) The Principles of Mathematics: Vol. 1, Cambridge at the University Press, Cambridge, UK, republished as a googlebook. * Whitehead, Alfred North and Russell, Bertrand (1910‚Äì1913, 2nd edition 1927, reprinted 1962 edition), Principia Mathematica to *56, Cambridge at the University Press, London UK, no ISBN or US card catalogue number. * Mario Livio (2009), Is God a Mathematician?, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, .

He was the son of Wayne B. and Mildred M. and married to Linda L. Kranch. They have two children together named Michael and Laura Cushman. Dr. Cushman was an American chemist who co-invented captopril, the first of the ACE inhibitors used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. With Miguel A. Ondetti, he won the 1999 Lasker Award for: \\"developing an innovative approach to drug design based on protein structure and using it to create the ACE inhibitors, powerful oral agents for the treatment of high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease.\\" Biography In high school Dr. Cushman didn‚Äôt have a drive or reason to succeed academically, until he found a class he enjoyed because of the teacher. He went on to Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana where he majored in Zoology and minored in Chemistry. His tenacious attitude gave him the boost to get magna cum laude. He was a first-generation college student in his family and grew up poor. He also stated that growing up poor is what made him strive for better, stating ‚Äúbeing poor is a great stimulus for wanting to achieve something.‚Äù After earning his Ph.D. in 1966 from the University of Illinois, Dr. Cushman joined the Squibb Institute for Medical Research. His and Dr. Ondetti's research began with the Brazilian pit viper, one of the world's deadliest snakes. Something in the venom inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which helps regulate blood pressure. At first the idea of this drug was controversial and many believed that the drug would be ineffective. There were multiple instincts when people told them to quit. Despite that, Dr. Cushman, and Dr. Ondetti paid no attention to them and continued their research. Dr. Cushman even considered Zola Horovitz as a hero for is support. Dr. Cushman says captopril's significance from a basic research point of view is that it was developed through pure chemical design. He credits Dr. John Vane with suggesting angiotensin converting enzyme as a target for research at The Squibb Institute. As Dr. Ondetti put it in an interview, \\"Capoten really was the first example of rational drug design based on a hypothetical biological mechanism.\\" Dr. Cushman and Dr. Ondetti were not expecting as much publicity from discovering the captopril drug or the importance of the drug it was in that field. The captopril became available to the public in 1982 once the FDA viewed it. An issue that occurred was that the drug caused rashes when ‚Äúvery high doses of the drug‚Äù are given. It was stated that the captopril is ‚Äúan oral drug that significantly reduces hypertension in more than eighty percent of users and has no side effects on the central or autonomic nervous systems.‚Äù Retired at 54 Dr. Cushman does many things in his free time like golfing, languages, and traveling around the world.

Given that the novel's setting, the planet Koryphon, is integral to the plot, The Gray Prince may be said to belong to the science fiction subgenre of the planetary romance. Also significant in this regard is the work's original title, The Domains of Koryphon, which gives prominence to the setting of the conflict narrated in the novel rather than to one of its many characters.  Narrative  The conflict central to the plot arises from opposing claims to the land of the Alouan on the Uaia continent, with one side (the Uldras) asserting a right derived from original tenancy and the other (the Land Barons or \\"Outkers\\") a right based on the strength and determination to defend established property ownership, even if the property in question was originally stolen. Exploring the theme of barbarism versus civilisation, Vance would ultimately seem to argue that a societal mean is the most preferable of all possible worlds. The society of Szintarre has become over-civilised and proves too weak to defend itself when the erjins that the rights-obsessed city-dwellers hypocritically keep as slaves rise up against them. On the other hand, the Land Barons, who are in effect settled reavers and are rustic and quaint in comparison with urbane Szintarre society, nonetheless bring the benefits of civilisation (basic healthcare, education, reliable sources of drinking water, etc.) to the Uldras, curbing their more violent and barbarous customs, while otherwise allowing them to continue their traditional way of life unhindered. = Bildungsroman and initiatory journey = Jean-Fran√ßois Jamoul divides the narratives found in the novels of Jack Vance into two possible categories: the bildungsroman (\\"le roman de formation et d'exp√©rience\\") and the initiatory journey (\\"le voyage initiatique\\"), citing Emphyrio, the Durdane trilogy, the Demon Princes series, and Maske: Thaery as examples of the former and the Tschai series as an example of the latter.Jean-Fran√ßois Jamoul, \\"Les singuli√®res Arcadies de John Holbrook Vance\\", Univers 1984, √âditions J'ai Lu, 1984, p. 301. The Gray Prince might be said to include the two different kinds of narrative within the same novel, with the same character as the protagonist of each. That character is Elvo Glissam, an independently wealthy young man, who arrives on Koryphon and in Szintarre becomes involved in one of the various political groups campaigning for the rights of the planet's natives. At a soir√©e, he accepts an invitation from Schaine Madduc, the daughter of a Land Baron, to visit her father's domain in the Alouan. On the way, their aircraft is shot down and the party embarks upon an arduous trek across the wilderness, during which they are attacked by both Uldra tribesmen and wild erjins. Glissam, an urbanite who has previously lived a life of ease, comes face to face with death and gains experience of life in the raw. Glissam meets the challenges and gives a good account of himself, but ultimately he refuses to relinquish the political beliefs that civilised society has inculcated in him. His initiatory journey takes place when he joins a quest to the Palga plateau undertaken by Gerd Jemasze, a Land Baron whose domain borders the Madducs', and Kurgech, a shaman of the Ao tribe resident on the Madducs' Morningswake estate. Jemasze and Kurgech are seeking the answer as to why Schaine's father, Uther, was murdered shortly after visiting the Palga and what was the secret, or \\"joke\\" as he referred to it, he discovered when he was there. The journey, which they make in one of the Wind Runners' sail wagons, takes them to a sacred forest. There, Kurgech engages in a battle of magic against the Wind Runner priests, assisted by Jemasze, but this is an initiatory test that the civilised Glissam fails: the Wind Runners are easily able to manipulate his thoughts by telepathic magic, until Jemasze breaks the spell for him. The three manage to escape and at the edge of the Palga plateau, bordering the Morningswake estate, they discover a hidden erjin temple carved from the solid rock. Here, Glissam fails yet again: under attack by the erjins, he despairs and allows himself to be shot, almost bringing disaster upon his two companions, who nonetheless manage to save him and bring him back to Morningswake. Uther Madduc's \\"joke\\" is that the erjins are not wild beasts but sentient beings and therefore have an earlier and better claim to the land than the Uldras, although by the same logic the only rightful owners of the planet are the indigenous morphotes.  Setting  The planet Koryphon is part of Jack Vance's overarching Gaean Reach science-fiction setting, which he defines in the Prologue to The Gray Prince as follows: \\"the Gaean Reach encompasses a perceptible fraction of the galaxy. Trade routes thread space like capillaries in living tissue; thousands of worlds have been colonized, each different from every other, each working its specific change upon those men who live there. Never has the human race been less homogenous.\\"Jack Vance, The Gray Prince. A Science Fiction Novel, Avon, New York, 1975, p. 5 The planet has two continents, Uaia to the north and Szintarre to the south, separated by the Persimmon Sea. The littoral of Uaia, known as the Alouan, is inhabited by the Uldras, consisting of various tribes, some of which signed the so-called Submission Treaties with the Land Barons two hundred years prior to the timeframe of the novel, while the others retained their own lands, known as the Retent. Szintarre is a long, narrow island, whose capital, Olanje, is a sophisticated, fashionable resort for Outkers (\\"out-worlders\\" in general) and also the seat of the planet's single organ of government, the Mull, which sits in Holrude House. The Mull is disdained by the Land Barons, who see it as \\"an organ for the production of inconsequential sophistry.\\"The Gray Prince, p. 7. The Retent Uldras, led by the Gray Prince, attempt to manipulate the Mull as a means of evicting the Land Barons, but otherwise reject all centralised authority. The Wind Runners of the Palga Plateau of the Uaia continent are ignorant of the very existence of the Mull. = The linguistic setting = As Jacques Chambon observes, the dialogue in almost all Vance's novels is understood to be an often approximate translation of a fictional language.Jack Vance, Le Livre d'or de la science fiction, edited and with an introduction by Jacques Chambon, Presses Pocket, 1981, p. 20. We are given a glimpse of one such alien future language in the Prologue to The Gray Prince, where, in a footnote, the term Land Baron is said to be an unsatisfactory translation of \\"eng'sharatz (literally: the revered master of a large domain)\\".The Gray Prince, p. 7. Elsewhere, one of the characters employs the term \\"weldewiste\\", which is explained in a footnote‚Äîalso providing a metafictional rationale of Vance's own xenological approach‚Äîas \\"a word from the lexicon of social anthropology, to sum up a complicated idea comprising the attitude with which an individual confronts his environment [...] his character and personality from the purview of comparative culture.\\"The Gray Prince, p. 20. Other examples of \\"untranslatable\\" concepts that form part of the phenomenology of the alien cultures of Koryphon are the Uldra word \\"aurau\\" (\\"said of a tribesman afflicted with revulsion against civilized restrictions, and sometimes of a caged animal yearning for freedom\\")The Gray Prince, p. 32. and \\"Sarai\\", the geographical name for the Windrunners' plateau, but suggestive of \\"a limitless expanse, horizon to horizon, of land or water, lacking all impediments or obstacle to travel and projecting an irresistible urgency to be on the way, to travel toward a known or unknown destination.\\"The Gray Prince, p. 86.  Characters  * Schaine Madduc: daughter of land baron Uther Madduc, owner of the Morningswake domain. At the beginning of the novel she returns to Koryphon after an absence of five years, having been sent off-world to a school on the planet Tanquil by her father in order to nip in the bud an amorous relationship with Jorjol, an Uldra servant. During the course of the story she becomes attracted to the suave off-world Elvo Glissam, who rejects land baron society on principle, but ultimately she rejects him when she realises that she is too attached to the Morningswake domain and the way of life and privileges that come with it. * Kelse Madduc: brother of Schaine Madduc and heir to the Morningswake domain. Five years prior to the opening of the novel, Kelse is mauled by a \\"native\\" erjin, losing an arm and a leg, which are replaced by prosthetic limbs. A rigid traditionalist, he organises the land barons into an association to counter political interference on the part of the planet's nominal government, the Mull, and to suppress the Uldra uprising. * Gerd Jemasze: owner of the Suaniset domain, which borders Morningswake; a taciturn, self-reliant, strong and resourceful hero in the mould of Adam Reith (the protagonist of Vance's Tschai series). Jemasze safely guides Schaine, Kelse and Elvo Glissam across the perilous Alouan wilderness after their flyer is shot down by the Uldras and later undertakes an expedition to the Palga plateau to discover the mystery behind the murder of Uther Madduc. * Elvo Glissam: a native of the planet Diamantha, he is now independently wealthy thanks to a lottery win. Arriving on Koryphon, he becomes involved in the Society for Emancipation of the Erjins. Falling in love with Schaine Madduc, he accepts her invitation to visit Morningswake, but gets more than he bargained for when their flyer is shot down, stranding them in the wilderness. Hoping to impress Schaine, he joins Gerd Jemasze and Kurgech on their journey to the Palga and barely escapes with his life. * Jorjol: an Uldra orphan, originally of the Garganche tribe, who grew up with Schaine and Kelse Madduc on the Morningswake estate. Nicknamed Muffin in childhood, he is now the self- styled Gray Prince, a \\"messiah\\" who aims to unite the various Uldra tribes so that they might destroy the land barons and reclaim their ancestral lands. Consumed by resentment at his menial status within the Madduc household, he was responsible for Kelse's mauling in that he could have prevented it. Obsessed with possessing Schaine, he tries to kidnap her, but is thwarted by Gerd Jemasze. * Valtrina Darabesq: aunt of Schaine and Kelse Madduc, society hostess in Olanje, the capital of Szintarre. Her famous parties at the Villa Mirasol are the setting for gatherings of Olanje's various groups dedicated to \\"liberation\\" of the Uldras. * Glinth Isbane: Szintarre celebrity and secretary of the Society for a Free Szintarre. * Reyona Werlas-Madduc: housekeeper at Morningswake, third cousin to Schaine and Kelse. * Hermina Lingolet: cook at Morningswake, second cousin to Schaine and Kelse. * Kurgech: shaman of the Ao tribe of Uldras resident on the Morningswake Domain. He accompanies Gerd Jemasze and Elvo Glissam on the mission to the Palga plateau and engages in a battle of magic with the Wind-runner priests of the Aluban forest. * Julio Tanch: Uldra of the Ao tribe, head stockman on the Morningswake Domain. * Lilo Stenbaren: baron of the Doradus Domain. * Moffamides: treacherous Wind-runner priest from the No. 2 Depot at the edge of the Palga, supplier of \\"fiaps\\" (protective fetishes). Hypnotised by Kurgech using an Uldra \\"crazy-box\\", he leads Gerd Jemasze, Elvo Glissam and the Ao shaman to the secret erjin temple. * Adare Jemasze: younger brother of Gerd. * Ervan Collode: bombastic land baron who joins the expedition force to quell the uprising of the Retent Uldra tribes. * Erris Sammatzen: Chairman of the Mull, the organ of all the folk of Koryphon, which sits at Holrude House. He aims to reconstruct the Domains and return the land to the Uldras. * Adelys Lam, Thaddios Tarr, Julias Metheyr: members of the Mull, they are taken to the erjin temple, where they are confronted with conclusive evidence that their erjin domestics are in fact sentient and therefore slaves. * Old Erjin: chief of the erjins, telepathically controls the erjin uprising in Szintarre.  Plot summary  Schaine Madduc returns to Koryphon from school off-world, met by her brother Kelse. They and Gerd Jemasze are to meet their father, Uther, who has said he just learned something that is a splendid joke. An acquaintance, Elvo Glissam agrees to visit Uaia with them. However, Uther is ambushed and killed by Retent Uldras. Schaine, Kelse, Gerd, and Glissam survive a similar ambush and reach the Madducs' domain Morningswake. Uther Madduc was exploring the Palga plateau before he was killed. Gerd, Glissam, and the Madducs' Uldra foreman Kurgech go into the Palga to discover what he found. After various encounters with the Wind-runners, they find the secret: an ancient temple built by Erjins, who are in fact fully sentient. They return to Morningswake to learn that the Mull, the seat of government on the island continent of Szintarre, has ordered the land barons to give up their domains. The land barons defy this decree, and form their own Order of Uaia. The Uldra leader Jorjol, a childhood friend of the Madducs and the so-called Gray Prince, incites several hundred Retent Uldras to invade Morningswake. This attack is defeated by the Order's militia. A committee of the Mull arrives at Morningswake. Gerd escorts them to the Erjin temple, where he explains the first part of Uther Madduc's joke. The Mull has demanded that the land barons yield to the claim of the Uldras, who were there first. But the temple shows that the Erjins are sentient, which makes the Szintarrese slaveowners. Near the temple is the depot from which tamed Erjins are shipped. There they discover that the Erjin mounts and servitors exported by the Wind-runners are actually warriors, who at that very same moment are uprising and destroying their supposed masters. Erjin \\"servitors\\" seize control of Szintarre from its effete inhabitants. Erjin \\"mounts\\" turn on their Retent Uldra riders, but the combative Uldras defeat them. The Order of Uaia's militia (including Submission Uldras) fly south and defeat the Erjins in Szintarre. Returning to Uaia, they defeat a second and larger Uldra attack incited by Jorjol. This experience chastens some of the Szintarrese reformers, but the others persist in their campaign. Now Gerd Jemasze reveals the rest of Uther Madduc's joke. The temple shows that the Erjins were there before the Uldras, so they have an even better claim to the land. Furthermore, the temple's decorations depict Erjins arriving in spaceships and in combat with the semi-intelligent Morphotes: the Morphotes are in fact the original inhabitants of Koryphon and \\"rightful\\" claimants to the land. Gerd, speaking for the land barons, tells the Szintarrese that to be consistent they should either revoke their decree against the land barons, or else give their own country to the Morphotes as well.

In August 1870, the Washburn-Langford- Doane Expedition camped near and explored the Tower Fall area for several days en route to Yellowstone Lake. In his 1871 report to Secretary of War Gustavus C.

The novels are set in England in the 1140s during the civil war (see The Anarchy) between Empress Matilda and King Stephen of England. There are six books in the series: Rosemary for Remembrance, Rue for Repentance, Lilies for Love, Willows for Weeping, Sage for Sanctuary and Thyme for Trust. The 2015 edition, aimed at the adult market, rebrands the series as The Jenna Chronicles, and the individual books have been rewritten with new titles: Blood Oath, Stolen Child, Unholy Murder, Pilgrim of Death, Devil's Brew and Day of Judgment.Felicity Pulman on the new edition Book 1: Rosemary for Remembrance Janna is learning to be a healer. She is being taught by her mother but she feels her mother is not giving her enough responsibility. They argue over this, and also because Janna wants to know the identity of her father. Her mother agrees to tell her but, before she can, she dies in mysterious circumstances. Janna suspects poison, and puts herself in danger trying to find out who was responsible. Suspects include the midwife, the apothecary, the priest and Robert of Babestoche. Helping her are the villein Godric, who is in love with Janna, and also the handsome nobleman, Hugh, who is attracted to Janna but must marry well as he has no property of his own. When her home is burned to the ground, Janna is forced to flee - but by then several secrets have been uncovered giving Janna some clues about her father's identity. She sets off to find him in order to avenge the death of her mother. Book 2: Rue for Repentance Janna's house has been burnt to the ground by superstitious villages and she is on the run. Disguised as a boy she meets the fugitive Edwin, and together they find work at a manor farm, which Janna later discovers is managed by the handsome Hugh, nephew of Dame Alice who owns the property. All is not as it seems. A series of 'accidents' occur, marked by the presence of a sprig of rue; finally a child goes missing, and Janna vows to find him. But who can she turn to for help? Edwin, who stole from her in the forest? Godric, who has turned against her? Or Hugh, who stands to gain everything if the child dies? Janna needs all her wits and common sense to solve the mystery of the child's disappearance - but time is running out, for both of them! Book 3: Lilies for Love On the run from Robert of Babestoche, the man who will stop at nothing, even murder, to hide his secret, Janna takes refuge at Wiltune Abbey. There she desperately seeks to learn how to read, so that she can uncover the truth about her unknown father. But first there are mysteries to be solved. Who is the newcomer asking questions about Janna? Who stabbed the lord Hugh at St Edith's fair? Was the knife meant for Janna, or will Hugh's friendship with the beautiful Emma have disastrous consequences for them all? Who is destroying a precious manuscript and who is leaving lilies at the shrine of St Edith? The civil war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda has reached a crucial point, and Janna meets the empress when she comes to the abbey, a meeting that will open her eyes to a whole new world and further discoveries about her identity. Book 4: Willows for Weeping In Willows for Weeping, Janna leaves the abbey in the company of pilgrims en route to Amesbury where she hopes to find out more about her mother's past. But a stolen relic and a dead man bearing a mysterious message add complications to the journey, especially when the leader of the pilgrims is found dead at Stonehenge. A charismatic pilgrim catches Janna's heart, particularly when he hints that he knows something about her father's identity. Together they travel with a group of jongleurs towards Winchester. When the missing message suddenly turns up things start to go horribly wrong as Janna is forced to choose between love and duty. Book 5: Sage for Sanctuary 1141 - England is divided by the bitter civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda. Janna's quest to find her father has brought her to the heart of the royal court at Winchestre, solving many crimes and mysteries along the way. But the mystery of her own birth and her mother's death are secrets that put both her life (and her heart) in danger. How can Janna choose between the two men who love her when her purse has been stolen, she's lost all proof of her real identity, and she's working as a lowly drudge in a tavern to support herself? When sabotage threatens the tavern's future, Janna needs to find out the truth. Instead she finds herself fighting for her life against those who would silence her forever. Book 6: Thyme for Trust Janna's quest to avenge her mother's death is nearing completion, but there are more challenges ahead as she comes to realise the threat she poses to her new family. Fearing for her life, Janna accompanies her father to Oxeneford where the Empress Matilda is under siege from King Stephen. Janna wants the freedom to act, to follow her heart, which puts her at odds with her father who is negotiating her marriage to the king's favourite. When the man she truly loves is accused of murder, Janna has one last crime to solve - until the siege of Wiltune turns her life upside down and changes everything.

It was drafted by and named after his first Economics Minister Pedro Vuskovic, who had worked before with the CEPAL. Although good results were obtained in 1970, hyperinflation made a comeback in 1972. By 1973, Chile was in shambles ‚Äì inflation was hundreds of percents, the country had no foreign reserves, and GDP was falling. Background The overall stated objective of Allende's Popular Unity government was to achieve a transition to socialism by democratic means. This would involve a combined political and economic program aimed at wresting control of the economy out of the hands of business owners and placing it in the hands of the state. It would then be easier to dismantle the various institutions connected with Western capitalism. The key figure in the economic policy of Salvador Allende‚Äôs UP government was the first Minister of the Economy, Pedro Vuskovic. In accordance with Keynesian economics, he wanted to implement a massive redistribution of revenue by raising salaries and increasing public expenditure, through which the buying power of the population would increase and accordingly consumption in general. These measures would activate the idle capacity of the Chilean productive apparatus (which was relatively large) and generate a climate of prosperity. If this strategy paid off, it would have had the effect of strengthening the government‚Äôs position and allowing it to advance its revolutionary program much faster.The attitude of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio towards the main economic policies of the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende (1970‚Äì1973). Llewellyn, Paul Francis The macroeconomic program was based on several key assumptions, the most important being that the manufacturing sector had ample underutilized capacity. The lack of full utilization was, in turn, attributed to two fundamental factors: the monopolistic nature of the manufacturing industry and the structure of income distribution. Based on this diagnosis, influenced by Keynesian ideas of support to aggregate demand, it was thought that if income were redistributed toward the poorer groups through wage increases and if prices were properly controlled, there would be a significant expansion of demand and output. This provided the theoretical basis for the belief that large fiscal deficits would not necessarily be inflationary . Regarding inflation, the UP program placed blame on structural rigidities (namely, slow or no response of quantity supplied to price increases), bottlenecks, and the role of monopolistic pricing, and it played down the role of fiscal pressures and money creation. Application The plan considered the following economic measures as necessary: *Nationalization of the country‚Äôs basic resources. *Nationalization of large foreign enterprises, which were seen to be draining the wealth out of the country. *Agrarian reform: the breaking-up of the latifundios (large landed estates) and redistribution of land to the peasants. *Transferring banks and large businesses into state property in order to obtain control over internal credit and income. *A massive redistribution of income. These measures were seen as a first phase and, in theory, would form the basis of a popular-social movement. Having gained the popular support of the masses, the government would then be in a position to make a successful transition to a socialist society. Little attention was paid to the financial sector, given the orientation of the new regime's economic technocrats toward the import substitution, structuralist philosophy of the CEPAL (United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean). In fact, Allende's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Vice President, Clodomiro Almeyda, relates in his memoirs how in the first postelection meeting of the economic team, these technocrats argued expressly and convincingly that monetary and financial management did not deserve too much attention. Alfonso Inostroza, the Central Bank president, stated in early 1971 that the main objective of the monetary policy was to \\"transform it into a key instrument . . . to achieve the complete mobilization of productive resources, and their allocation to those areas that the government gives priority to . . . .\\" This was consistent with the view of inflation of those espousing structuralism. US President Richard Nixon had made it known that he wanted to \\"make the (Chilean) economy scream\\" and this policy was outlined in National Security Decision Memorandum (NSDM) 93 of November 1970: \\"All new bilateral foreign assistance was to be stopped, although disbursements would continue under loans made previously. The US would use its predominant position in international financial institutions to dry up the flow of new multilateral credit or other financial assistance. To the extent possible, financial assistance or guarantees to US private investment in Chile would be ended, and US businesses would be made aware of the government's concern and its restrictive policies‚Ä¶\\" Chile and the United States: Declassified Documents Relating to the Military Coup, September 11, 1973, introduced by Peter Kornbluh of the National Security Archive Results Chile real wages between 1967 and 1977. Orange lines mark the beginning and end of Allende's presidency. The first year saw 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). In addition to the rise in employment, Allende also raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971. These rises in wages were negated by continuing increases in prices for food. Although price rises had also been high under president Eduardo Frei Montalva (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. In the period 1970‚Äì72, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%.Figures are from Nove, 1986, pp. 4‚Äì12, tables 1.1 & 1.7] However, these results were not sustainable. The price of copper took a nose-dive and production also went down, with correspondingly negative results for the economy. A commercial deficit was recorded at the end of 1971 and private investors shied away. In 1972, the Chilean economy took a turn for the worse. Exports fell, imports rose alarmingly and inflation rocketed. The falls in exports were mostly due to a fall in the price of copper, since Chile was at the mercy of international fluctuations in the value of its single most important export. As with almost half of developing countries, more than 50 per cent of Chile's export receipts were from a single primary commodity.Hoogvelt, 1997 Adverse fluctuation in the international price of copper negatively affected the Chilean economy throughout 1971‚Äì72. The price of copper fell from a peak of $66 per ton in 1970 to only $48‚Äì9 in 1971 and 1972.Nove, 1986 In 1972 the escudo had runaway inflation of 140%. From December 1972 to December 1973, the inflation rate was a catastrophic 508% ‚Äì an example of hyperinflation.Flores, Fernando 1997 The average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6% (\\"negative growth\\"), and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined.Flores, 1997 Inflation led to the rise of black markets in rice, beans, sugar, and flour, and a \\"disappearance\\" of such basic commodities from supermarket shelves. The government attempted to prevent this shortage by creating juntas de Abastecimientos y Precios (JAP, literally \\"Committees of Supply and Prices\\").Comienzan los problemas , La Tercera These were local administrative units essentially functioning as rationing boards, designed to alleviate the chronic shortages. In addition to the hyperinflation and the fall in the value of copper, the lack of economic aid further depressed the economy. The growth in GDP went from 9% in 1971 to ‚àí1.2% in 1972, while the rate of inflation went from 22.1% the previous year to 163.4%. Vuskovic was replaced as Minister of Economy on June 17, 1972, and the Allende government announced it would default on debts owed to international creditors and foreign governments. Allende also froze all prices while raising salaries, but the damage was already done. Chile had entered a major recession, with hyperinflation, a negative growth in GDP, a lack of supplies and spare parts, as well as a state of general political and social disorder. His implementation of these policies led to strong opposition by landowners, some middle-class sectors, the rightist National Party, the Roman Catholic Church (which was displeased with the direction of the educational policyDeclaraci√≥n de la Asamblea Plenaria del Episcopado sobre la Escuela Nacional Unificada , 11 April 1973. Accessed online 21 September 2006 on the site of the Conferencia Episcopal de Chile ), and eventually the Christian Democrats. By September 1973, inflation had reached 381.1% and the growth in GDP stood at ‚àí4.2%.

Stalin, Early Morning Shift (album notes), Demolition Man Records As a youth he sold drugs in his local housing projects and spent eleven months on parole for drug dealing. Musical career Although young and boyish-looking, J-Stalin adopted a tough rapper persona. He references Joseph Stalin in his stage name because they shared the same initials, and \\"...He was short like me, but he was always smashin' on everybody.\\" In a recent interview he remarked about his home and lifestyle, \\"This is West Oakland, man. This is the bottoms right here.\\" He went on to say that the crime rate in his neighborhood was so high, the city had remodeled the housing units in his housing project to remove the back doors so that criminals could not escape from home raids by the police. His major influences Stalin claims came from a small town named Castroville. He claims he can relate to the poverty and hardships the town has to deal with and has major respect for the town. Stalin was also in the internet sensation video \\"Cupcakin\\" with J-Nash. J.

This species does not contain a digestive tract and relies on the nutrients provided by its host species leading to the accumulation of lead in P. laevis from the bile of the host species. Life cycle Pomphorhynchus laevis is a parasite with a complex life cycle, meaning that it needs multiple host species to complete it. The female releases eggs containing acanthor that are then ingested by an arthropod. The acanthor is then released from the egg and becomes acanthella which penetrate the host's gut wall and transforms into the infective cystacanth stage which presents as a cyst. The larval stages (cystacanths) reside in the hemocoel of, Gammarids, its intermediate host. Several fish species can serve as the definitive host, where P. laevis infect the intestine. In the fish host, bile is an important resource for the growth of P. laevis. The preferred final hosts of Pomphorhynchus laevis include the chub, Leuciscus cephalus and barbel, Barbus barbus when in freshwater and the minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus when in an isolated body of water. Immature P. laevis are mainly found in the proximal part of the digestive tract while mature and developing P. laevis are found near the first intestinal loop with the posterior third loop of the digestive tract being uninhabitable. Environmental factors = Lead pollution = When chub (Leuciscus cephalus, a definitive host of Pomphorhynchus laevis) infected with P. laevis are exposed to different concentrations of lead, the parasite is able to reduce lead concentrations in the host. The normal mechanism of filtering lead for a freshwater fish includes the binding of the lead to steroids contained in the bile of the liver. The bile then travels down the bile duct into the small intestine where the lead is either absorbed or excreted. The parasite reduces the lead concentration in the bile of the chub once it has travelled to the small intestine by absorbing the metals contained in the bile. The lead being absorbed by P. laevis leaves less lead in the bile to be reabsorbed by the chub. This results in decreased levels of lead in the bile of the fish as well as in the fish organs. P. laevis itself builds up high concentrations of lead (1000 times water concentration). =Temperature= The infection success of acanthors emerging from eggs to Gammarus pulex is not affected by temperature, but developmental rate is increased at warmer temperatures (14 versus 17 ¬∞C) . At the same temperatures parasite infection reduces survival of these hosts, but this is not compounded by temperature .  Host manipulation  Pomphorhynchus laevis facilitates its movement between their hosts by altering the behavior and visual appearance of its gammarid intermediate hosts. Infected gammarids are manipulated to develop a preference for fish odours. At the same time, the parasites itself develops a bright orange colour making it more visible and consequently more likely to be consumed by a subsequent fish host. This visual manipulation is effective specifically on host species that can serve as suitable hosts as fish species that are not suitable hosts are less attracted. Pomphorhynchus laevis also causes changes in the behavior of Gammarus pulex when responding to light. Normally, the species G. pulex show strong photophobic behaviour, meaning they avoid light, which is advantageous to evade predation. When infected with P. laevis, G. pulex become strongly photophilic and seek out light which increases their chance of predation in turn increasing the likelihood of parasite transmission. This alteration in behaviour pertaining to light was found to involve an alteration in serotonergic activity of the brain. The immunoreactivity of the brain to serotonin was found to be increased by around 40 percent for infected G. pulex when compared to uninfected G. pulex. It is also shown that G. pulex infected with the cystacanths, the infective larval stage of P. laevis, are less likely to show behaviours that would normally allow them to avoid predation such as using refuge less frequently, being less likely to cluster together when in the presence of danger, and frequently clinging to things floating in the water. When G. pulex are infected by the non-infective life stage of P. laevis, there is an increased use of refuge which in turn decreases the risk of predation which is advantageous to the parasite due to them not being able to infect the next host when in this life stage. Biomimetics This worm swells its proboscis to press microneedles into the intestinal wall, with a very strong adhesive force. This has inspired a structural skin graft adhesive that sticks strongly but has minimal tissue damage while in place and upon removal.

The film is based on John Osborne's play about a love triangle involving an intelligent but disaffected working-class young man (Jimmy Porter), his upper-middle-class, impassive wife (Alison) and her haughty best friend (Helena Charles). Cliff, an amiable Welsh lodger, attempts to keep the peace. The character of Ma Tanner, only referred to in the play, is brought to life in the film by Edith Evans as a dramatic device to emphasise the class difference between Jimmy and Alison. The film and play are classic examples of the British cultural movement known as kitchen sink realism. Plot Jimmy and Alison Porter, a young married couple, live in a Midlands industrial town (Derby) in a shabby attic flat, which they share with Jimmy‚Äôs best friend and business partner, Cliff. Despite graduating from university, Jimmy and Cliff make a meagre living running a sweet-stall in the local market. Jimmy‚Äôs inability to climb the socioeconomic ladder, coupled with other injustices he sees around him make him angry at society, particularly to those in authority. He takes out his frustrations on his wife Alison, a submissive girl from an upper-middle-class family. Jimmy's love for Alison is mixed with contempt, as he feels she never had to experience want, pain, or suffering. He verbally abuses her telling her, in temper, that he wishes she would have a child that would die. Unbeknownst to Jimmy, Alison is pregnant, and having mixed feelings about the pregnancy and her marriage. Tensions heighten between the couple when Alison invites her assertive friend, Helena, whom Jimmy loathes, to temporarily stay with them. After witnessing Jimmy's treatment of Alison, Helena persuades Alison to leave Jimmy on the same day that Ma Tanner, who lent Jimmy the money to set up his stall, has a fatal stroke. Eventually, Alison moves out and departs with her kindly father, Colonel Redfern, who has come to collect her. A grieving Jimmy returns to the flat to find Alison gone, and learns for the first time that she is pregnant. He starts an emotional tirade with Helena, who first slaps him but then kisses him passionately, and the two begin an affair. Months later, Jimmy and Helena have settled into a comfortable relationship, but Jimmy is still hurt at Alison‚Äôs departure. She, living in her parents' tranquil home, is having a precarious pregnancy, and fears that Jimmy's wish for her to suffer tragedy might come true. Cliff decides to strike out on his own, and Jimmy and Helena see him off at the train station. After Cliff's train departs, Jimmy and Helena see Alison sitting disconsolately in the station. Alison explains to Helena that she has lost the baby and Helena, realizing that she was wrong to break up their marriage, informs Jimmy that she is leaving him. Jimmy and Alison reconcile.

P. Kapoor as Himself Locations Interiors were shot at Elstree Studios in September 1958. Some establishing shots were shot in Derby but the market scenes were shot in Deptford market; the railway station was Dalston Junction. Deptford and Dalston are in fact in the London area. The first market scenes were shot in the centre of Romford Market, Romford, Essex (now in the east London Borough of Havering). The scenes showing the street outside Jimmy and Alison Porter's flat were filmed in Harvist Road, London N7. The road was later demolished by Islington Borough Council and rebuilt as the Harvist Estate. Production Look Back in Anger was produced by the Canadian impresario Harry Saltzman, who was seen an obvious choice as he was a fan of the play and it was he who had urged Osborne and Richardson to set up Woodfall Film Productions. The film was to be Woodfall's first production. Osborne insisted, against resistance from Saltzman, that Richardson was the right man to direct the film.He wrote \\"This was based not on blind loyalty but on my untutored faith in his flair and his being the only possible commander to lead Woodfall's opening assault on the suburban vapidity of British film-making\\". (Osborne, p. 107) Richardson had directed the original theatrical production but had no track record in feature films. The original backer, J. Arthur Rank, pulled out of the deal because of the choice of director. Saltzman and Richardson persuaded Richard Burton to take on the title role, at a much lower fee than his accustomed Hollywood payoff. It is not known what Kenneth Haigh, who had created the role, thought of this. The idea of recruiting Nigel Kneale to extend the play into a screenplay is credited to the influential theatre critic Kenneth Tynan (who had been in large part responsible for the incredible success of the play). Osborne was relieved at not having to do the job and handed over story rights for a mere ¬£2,000.Osborne, p. 108. The part of the doctor was specially created for George Devine, the artistic director of the English Stage Company and the man to whom Osborne most owed his success. Glen Byam Shaw, Devine's longtime collaborator (they created the Young Vic Company), was handed the role of Colonel Redfern. Two other members of the English Stage Company, Nigel Davenport and Alfred Lynch, were given small roles as commercial salesmen who try to pick up Alison and Helena in the railway station bar.

Off road karting is now a well established and popular activity with a burgeoning range of vehicles, options and adherents. Just as the automobile is undergoing evolutionary changes, noticeably in the field of \\"off road\\" use, the smaller recreational vehicles called \\"go-karts\\" have spawned a new generation of vehicle for off road use. The origins of using a go-kart sized vehicle for off road use undoubtedly had many stages of development and claimants whose homemade vehicles were \\"the first\\" off road go-karts. However, as concerns manufactured products it seems the first was from Honda who released in 1977 a vehicle they called the Odyssey, essentially an \\"off road\\" go-kart with a 250 cc two stroke engine, single seat, and a CVT automatic transmission. The main differences to the traditional racing go-kart were a bigger size of tires (giving greater ground clearance and off road traction) and a roll cage. This proved to be a very popular vehicle and in 1985 Honda made major upgrades to the Odyssey and released the FL350. Changes were an improved roll cage, 350 cc engine with electric starter, and a full front and back suspension system. Then in late 1989 Honda released the FL 400. In addition to the increased engine size (a liquid cooled 400 cc unit) it had its suspension improved to handle the extra load. However this had evolved into an expensive vehicle and sales were disappointing so Honda ceased manufacture in 1990. Although today these aging Honda units are still to be found and have an enthusiastic following, their main achievement was to create a pool of enthusiasts alerted to the possibilities of off road small vehicle fun and keen to develop these possibilities. The question of when an off road \\"go-kart\\" becomes an off road \\"buggy\\" or when a dune buggy becomes an off road buggy or even if there is any difference will no doubt elicit many opinions and responses. Even manufacturers seem confused and the terms \\"buggy\\" and \\"go-kart\\" are often used interchangeably for the same vehicle. However, in terms of the evolution of go-karts and buggies, it seems correct to point out that go-karts are mainly constructed without a differential and are not intended to be registered for road use. They are purpose built from scratch not using second hand auto parts. All of these features are shared by many of the off road go-karts on the market today. However, in the U.S.A. the term \\"buggy\\" is often applied to the same type of vehicle referred to as a \\"go-kart\\" in most other countries. \\"Buggies\\" were originally made by converting existing vehicles (usually VWs) and were usually intended for both on road and off road use (mainly on sand or beaches) and the majority still are. However just as racing go-karts have evolved off road cousins, so the dune buggy now has many versions of off road buggy and trail use is increasing rapidly. This type of buggy has undergone many transformations in body style and appearance and many are purpose built from scratch using all new parts instead of converted second hand auto parts and have the same style of frame and body structure as off road go-karts. A simple and workable distinction would seem to be that \\"go-karts\\" are not intended for certification or approval for \\"on road\\" use at any time, but a \\"buggy\\" can be.

The diocese comprises the whole department of Haute-Loire, in the Region of Auvergne- Rh√¥ne-Alpes. Currently the diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Clermont. The current bishop, as of April 2015, is Bishop Luc Cr√©py. The territory of the old Diocese of Le Puy, suppressed by the Concordat of 1801, was united with the Diocese of Saint-Flour and became a diocese again in 1823. The district of Brioude, which had belonged to the diocese of Saint-Flour under the old regime, was thenceforward included in the new Diocese of Le Puy. Early history The Martyrology of Ado and the first legend of St. Front of P√©rigueux (written perhaps in the middle of the tenth century, by Gauzbert, chorepiscopus of Limoges) speak of a certain priest named George who was brought to life by the touch of St. Peter's staff, and who accompanied St. Front, St. Peter's missionary and first Bishop of P√©rigueux. A legend of St. George, the origin of which, according to Duchesne is not earlier than the eleventh century, makes that saint one of the seventy-two disciples, and tells how he founded the Church of Civitas Vetula in the County of Le Velay, and how, at the request of St. Martial, he caused an altar to the Blessed Virgin to be erected on Mont Anis (Mons Anicius). After St. George, certain local traditions of very late origin point to Sts. Macarius, Marcellinus, Roricius, Eusebius, Paulianus, and Vosy (Evodius) as bishops of Le Puy. It must have been from St. Paulianus that the town of Ruessium, now Saint-Paulien, received its name; and it was probably St. Vosy who completed the church of Our Lady of Le Puy at Anicium and transferred the episcopal see from Ruessium to Anicium. St. Vosy was apprised in a vision that the angels themselves had dedicated the cathedral to the Blessed Virgin, whence the epithet Angelic given to the cathedral of Le Puy. It is impossible to say whether this St. Evodius is the same who signed the decrees of the Council of Valence in 374. Neither can it be affirmed that St. Benignus, who in the seventh century founded a hospital at the gates of the basilica, and St. Agrevius, the seventh-century martyr from whom the town of Saint-Agr√®ve Chiniacum took its name, were really bishops. Duchesne thinks that the chronology of these early bishops rests on very little evidence and that very ill-supported by documents; before the tenth century only six individuals appear of whom it can be said with certainty that they were bishops of Le Puy. The first of these, Scutarius, the legendary architect of the first cathedral, dates, if we may trust the inscription which bears his name, from the end of the fourth century. Pilgrimage and medieval status Legend traces the origin of the pilgrimage of Le Puy to an apparition of the Blessed Virgin to a sick widow whom St. Martial had converted. No French pilgrimage was more frequented in the Middle Ages. Charlemagne came twice, in 772 and 800; there is a legend that in 772 he established a foundation at the cathedral for ten poor canons (chanoines de paup√©rie), and he chose Le Puy, with Aachen and Saint-Gilles, as a centre for the collection of Peter's Pence. Charles the Bald visited Le Puy in 877, Eudes of France in 892, Robert I of France in 1029, Philip Augustus in 1183. Louis IX met the King of Aragon there in 1245; and in 1254 passing through Le Puy on his return from Palestine, he gave to the cathedral an ebony image of the Blessed Virgin clothed in gold brocade. After him, Le Puy was visited by Philip the Bold in 1282, by Philip the Fair in 1285, by Charles VI of France in 1394, by Charles VII of France in 1420, and by the mother of Joan of Arc in 1429. Louis XI made the pilgrimage in 1436 and 1475, and in 1476 halted three leagues from the city and went to the cathedral barefooted. Charles VIII visited it in 1495, Francis I of France in 1533. Theodulph, Bishop of Orl√©ans, brought to Our Lady of Le Puy, as an ex-voto for his deliverance, a magnificent Bible, the letters of which were made of plates of gold and silver, which he had himself put together, about 820, while in prison at Angers. St. Mayeul, St. Odilon, St. Robert, St. Hugh of Grenoble, St. Anthony of Padua, St. Dominic, St. Vincent Ferrer, St. John Francis Regis were pilgrims to Le Puy. The Church of Le Puy received, on account of its dignity and fame, temporal and spiritual favours. Concessions made in 919 by William the Young, Count of Auvergne and Le Velay, and in 923 by King Raoul, gave it sovereignty over the whole population of the town (bourg) of Anis, a population which soon amounted to 30,000 souls. In 999, Pope Sylvester II consecrated his friend Th√©odard, a monk of Aurillac, Bishop of Le Puy, to replace Stephen of G√©vaudan, whom his uncle Guy, Bishop of Le Puy, had in his lifetime, designated to be his successor, and whom a Roman council had excommunicated. Sylvester II exempted Th√©odard from all metropolitan jurisdiction, a privilege which Pope Leo IX confirmed to the Bishops of Le Puy, also granting them the right, until then reserved to archbishops exclusively of wearing the pallium. \\"Nowhere\\", he said in his Bull, \\"does the Blessed Virgin receive a more special and more filial worship.\\" It was from Le Puy that Pope Urban II dated (15 August 1095) the Letters Apostolic convoking the Council of Clermont, and it was a canon of Le Puy, Raymond d'Aiguilles, chaplain to the Count of Toulouse, who wrote the history of the crusade. Pope Gelasius II, Pope Callistus II, Pope Innocent II and Pope Alexander III visited Le Puy to pray, and with the visit of one of these popes must be connected the origin of the great Jubilee which is granted to Our Lady of Le Puy whenever Good Friday falls on 25 March, the Feast of the Annunciation. It is supposed that this jubilee was instituted by Callistus II, who passed through Le Puy, in April, 1119, or by Alexander III, who was there in August, 1162, and June, 1165, or by Pope Clement IV, who had been Bishop of Le Puy. The first jubilee historically known took place in 1407, and in 1418 the chronicles mention a Bull of Pope Martin V prolonging the duration of the jubilee. During the Middle Ages, everyone who had made the pilgrimage to Le Puy had the privilege of making a will in extremis with only two witnesses instead of seven. Honoured with such prerogatives, the Church of Le Puy assumed a sort of primacy in respect to most of the Churches of France, and even of Christendom. This primacy manifested itself practically in a right to beg, established with the authorization of the Holy See, in virtue of which the chapter of Le Puy levied a veritable tax upon almost all the Christian countries to support its hospital of Notre-Dame. =Relationship with Girona= In Catalonia this droit de qu√™te, recognized by the Spanish Crown, was so thoroughly established that the chapter had its collectors permanently installed in that country. A famous \\"fraternity\\" existed between the chapter of Le Puy and that of Girona in Catalonia. Later history The statue of Our Lady of Le Puy and the other treasures escaped the pillage of the Middle Ages. The roving banditti were victoriously dispersed, in 1180, by the Confraternity of the Chaperons (Hooded Cloaks) founded at the suggestion of a canon of Le Puy. In 1562 and 1563 Le Puy was successfully defended against the Huguenots by priests and religious armed with cuirasses and arquebuses. But in 1793 the statue was torn from its shrine and burned in the public square. P√®re de Ravignan, in 1846, and the Abb√© Combalot, in 1850, were inspired with the idea of a great monument to the Blessed Virgin on the Rocher Corneille. Napoleon III placed at the disposal of Bishop Morlhon 213 pieces of artillery taken by P√©lissier at Sebastopol, and the colossal statue of \\"Notre-Dame de France\\" cast from the iron of these guns, amounting in weight to 150,000 kilogrammes, or more than 330,000 lbs. avoirdupois, was dedicated 12 September 1860. Saints The saints specially venerated in the diocese are: *St. Domninus, martyr, whose body is preserved in the cathedral; *St. Julian of Brioude, martyr in 304, and his companion, St. Ferr√©ol; *St. Calminius (Carmery), Duke of Auvergne, who prompted the foundation of the Abbey of Le Monastier, and St. Eudes, first abbot (end of the sixth century); *St. Theofredus (Chaffre, Theofrid), Abbot of Le Monastier and martyr under the Saracens (c. 735); *St. Mayeul, Abbot of Cluny, who, in the second half of the tenth century, cured a blind man at the gates of Le Puy, and whose name was given, in the fourteenth century, to the university in which the clergy made their studies; *St. Odilon, Abbot of Cluny (962‚Äì1049), who embraced the life of a regular canon in the monastery of St. Julien de Brioude; *St. Robert d'Aurillac (d. 1067) who founded the monastery of Chaise Dieu in the Brioude district; *St. Peter Chavanon (d. 1080), a canon regular, founder and first provost of the Abbey of P√©brac. At the age of eighteen M. Olier, afterwards the founder of Saint- Sulpice, was Abbot in commendam of P√©brac and, in 1626 was an \\"honorary count- canon of the chapter of St. Julien de Brioude\\". We may mention as natives of this diocese: the Benedictine, Hughes Lanthenas (1634‚Äì1701), who edited the works of St. Bernard and St. Anselm, and was the historian of the Abbey of Vend√¥me; the Benedictine, Jacques Boyer, joint author of Gallia Christiana; Cardinal de Polignac (d. 1741), author of the \\"Antilucretius\\". Cathedral The cathedral of Le Puy, which forms the highest point of the city, rising from the foot of the Rocher Corneille, exhibits architecture of every period from the fifth century to the fifteenth. The architectural effect is audacious and picturesque. The four galleries of the cloister were constructed during a period extending from the Carolingian epoch to the twelfth century. The Benedictine monastery of the Chaise Dieu united in 1640 to the Congregation of St-Maur, still stands, with the fortifications which Abbot de Chanac caused to be built between 1378 and 1420, and the church, rebuilt in the fourteenth century by Clement VI, who had made his studies here, and by Gregory XI, his nephew. This church contains the tomb of Clement VI. The fine church of S. Julien de Brioude, in florid Byzantine style, dates from the eleventh or twelfth century.

He served in the RAF, rising to the rank of Flight Lieutenant, and took part in more than 70 bombing sorties. He returned to the RAF as a recruiting officer after the end of his cricket career.Wisden 1961, p. 945. Crick also played cricket for the Combined Services in 1947, and scored 65 opening the innings for the RAF against the Army at Lord's in 1946. He kept wicket quite regularly for the Yorkshire Second XI during his career, and played for the South of England and Maurice Leyland's XI in 1947. He was a wicket-keeper who took 20 catches and completed eight stumpings. He was hampered in his first-class career by a lack of success with the bat, scoring just 124 runs at an average of 9.53, with a best score of 22. Crick died in a car crash in February 1960 in Lower Wyke, Bradford, aged 50.

The operation succeeded in that Israeli intelligence was not, as a whole, able to inform a nationwide alert that war was imminent and that mobilisation should proceed apace; the established 48-hour warning had proved advantageous to Israel in previous wars, most notably the Six-Day War. However, a number of Israeli generals, including General David Elazar, cottoned on to the fact that the Syrians and the Egyptians were mobilising their forces behind the ceasefire lines, preparing for offensive actions. Importantly, and arguably the fact that saved the Golan Heights from Syrian conquest, was the ordering of the 7th Armoured Brigade to the area, even though this was a blatant disregard of the spirit of the Israeli High Command's current directives. Nevertheless, when war started, clearly Israel as a whole was surprised. Therefore, Operation Spark was a success, a preamble to Syrian and Egyptian initial success in the Yom Kippur War. However, as said, the initiative of some Israeli generals meant that some preparation was in place to try and resist the Arab advance.

Plot The movie, set in 1988 begins when Majid (Kambiz Dirbaz), a local thug from Southern Tehran is released from prison along with his friend Amir (Arzhang Amirfazli). To avoid embarrassment, Majid and his friends have told his family and neighborhood that Majid is returning from Hajj at Mecca. Even though his lie is unveiled after some stupid mistakes by Amir and his other friend Bayram (Akbar Abdi). Majid has been attempting to show that he is an honorable man so he can marry Narges (Niousha Zeyghami), the daughter of Mirza (Manouchehr Azar); a pious man in the neighborhood. Bayram on the other hand wants to marry Majid's sister Marzieh (Negar Forouzandeh). In order to impress Narges and her father, Majid decides he must go to the front and fight against the Iraqi Army. Majid, Amir, Bayram, Mostafa (Alireza Osivand), Bijan (Amin Hayai) and a local musician sign up for the war and head off to training. Here they are met with opposition by Haj Saleh (Mohamad Reza Sharifinia) and Kamali (Ghasem Zareh), who question their faith as Majid and his friends don't pray, gamble, use foul language, smoke and use drugs. They are eventually kicked out of training but with the help of an acquaintance from the neighborhood named Morteza (Javad Hashemi) they are allowed to go back to training.

Shepherd's car in the Nebrodi, Sicily The Nebrodi (, ; Sicilian: Munti N√®bbrudi) is a mountain range that runs along the north east of Sicily. Together with the Madonie and the Peloritani, they form the Sicilian Apennines. The mountains run from the Peloritani on the eastern part of the island to the foothill of the Madonie mountains to the west, facing the Tyrrhenian Sea on the north. Mount Etna, from which it is separated by the rivers Alcantara and Simeto, forms the range's southern border. Several of the peaks are above 1500 meters with the highest being the Monte Soro (1,847 m) and the Serra del Re (1,754 m). The range mostly made up of sandstone and clay rocks, but include also limestone landscapes, like the Rocche del Crasto where is located the Grotta del Lauro abundant of stalactites and stalagmites . Towns that are situated in the mountains include Troina, Nicosia, Mistretta, and a number of other towns in the province of Messina. Much of the mountains are covered by thick forests of cork trees on the lowest slopes giving way to oak and then beech at the higher elevations. Yew trees occur in the beech forests.

The collapse brought national attention to bridge safety and was reported in national magazines, including Reader's Digest, and on The CBS Evening News.Vanderbilt Television News Archive The Atkinson-Needham Memorial Bridge, which was built at the site of the old bridge, was named in honor of the four victims ‚Äì Samuel Hugh and Ola Marion Atkinson and Judy Needham and her 3-year- old daughter, Andrea Lee.The Heritage of Yadkin County, Frances Harding Casstevens, editor; Page 108 Among those rescued from the collapse was former Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson, who was 10 at the time.\\"Into the Darkness: Minneapolis tragedy stirs painful memories of a cold night in 1975,\\" Winston-Salem Journal article, August 3, 2007 According to a National Transportation Safety Board report, the accident started about 9:25 p.m. when a car struck a timber railing on the bridge, causing the bridge to collapse in to the rain-swollen river. In heavy fog, six more vehicles within a 17-minute period drove off the bridge.NTSB highway accident report By the 1970s, state officials had hung a sign on the second-hand bridge that read, \\"Local Traffic Only.\\" The bridge, which had originally been used near High Rock Lake, was reassembled in Siloam in 1938. It was listed as deficient and needing repair or replacement in a 1974 state report. Troy Doby, the state secretary of transportation, said later that \\"it should have been replaced, but it was a question of money.\\" Weeks before the collapse, Hugh Atkinson had urged state officials to tear it down. The Atkinson family later found a letter in his coat pocket that he had written to the governor's office urging action on the bridge.

Jabal Tuwaiq () is a narrow escarpment that cuts through the plateau of Najd in central Arabia, running approximately from the southern border of Al-Qasim in the north, to the northern edge of the Empty Quarter desert near Wadi ad-Dawasir in the south. It is high and also has a Middle Jurassic stratigraphic section. The eastern side slopes downwards gradually, while the western side ends in an abrupt manner. The escarpment can be thought of as a narrow plateau, though the locals refer to it as a jebel (\\"mount\\"). Marshall Cavendish used the name \\"Tuwayr Mountains\\" to describe mountains of central Arabia, distinct from the Shammar in the north, the Dhofar in the south, and the Hajar to the east. Many narrow valleys (wadis) run along its sides, such as Wadi Hanifa, and a group of towns lie on its central section, including the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Many settlements have historically existed on either side of it as well, such as those of Sudair and Al-Washm. The Tweig escarpment is mentioned in Yaqut's 13th century geographical encyclopedia under the name \\"Al-'Aridh\\", though for the past few centuries that name has applied only to the central section of it, around Riyadh. In the framework of the recent Saudi tendency to promote entertainment, a group of 100 young hikers joined Tuwaiq Mountains Challenge in February, 2019. The hikers climbed around 25km. Petroleum geology The Arab-D (Upper Jurassic) unit of the Riyadh Group makes up one of the largest petroleum reservoirs in the world. Bureau and Saudi Aramco researchers conducted a high-resolution LIDAR survey of Middle Jurassic outcrops of the Tuwaiq Mountain limestone along the Tuwaiq Mountain Escarpment near the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This study was a first step towards building a quantitative 3-D geologic model for use as an analog to the lower Arab-D reservoir. Outcrop analogs like this one are critical to understanding reservoir performance on the flow-unit scale (1 to ). Although seismic data allow geologists to gain information about large-scale reservoir compartmentalization (>), flow-unit scale reservoir parameters are far below seismic imaging capability and inter-well spacing. High-precision laser scans were used as a template upon which stratigraphic interpretation were made allowing researchers to characterize sub-seismic, flow-unit scale reservoir properties of Jurassic bioherms in an effort to better understand optimum production techniques of this enormous reservoir.

Biography  = Early years = Luzel was born in the manor of Keramborgne, which then formed part of the commune of Plouaret (which, nowadays, is part of the commune of Le Vieux- March√©, C√¥tes-d'Armor. His father, Fran√ßois, and his mother, Rosalie le Gac, were peasants, but Luzel had a peaceful childhood in his home town, making friends (including the future painter Yan Dargent, and attending many veill√©es, which were traditional parties held after dark where the villagepeople would assemble and pass the long winter nights in one another's company, often listening to ancestral stories. Thanks to his uncle, Julien- Marie Hu√´rou, he was able to go to the Royal College of Rennes, where Hu√´rou taught. = School and a change of direction = There, he met the future historian Arthur de La Borderie, and √âmile Grimaud, who became the sub-editor of the Revue de Bretagne et de Vend√©e. As a young man, he aspired to be a naval doctor, and went to study to such an end in Brest. Instead of becoming a naval doctor, he went down a different route towards being a professor, but could not find a fixed post, which made his life rather nomadic. An encounter with Adolphe Orain, a folklorist of Upper Brittany, gave him some direction, and, with the support of Ernest Renan, he managed to obtain from the Minister for State Education the means to go search for old literary texts in Basse- Bretagne. He succeeded in collecting a huge corpus of songs, tales, legends and plays, enough to make several books. The majority of the contents of this abundant collection came from Tr√©guier and the province of Brittany that surrounds it, Tr√©gor. Marguerite Philippe (in Breton, Marc'harit Fulup) is amongst most known of the people whose folklore Luzel collected. After publishing a book including some of his own poetry in 1865, entitled Bepred Breizad, he published in 1868 a selection of the works that he collected, under the name Chants et chansons populaires de la Basse-Bretagne' (Melodies and Songs from Low-Brittany.) There were several volumes of this work, including a volume dedicated to Gwerziou (Laments) and Soniou (Songs.) A year later, a follow-up of sorts appeared, entitled Contes et R√©cits populaires des Bretons armoricains (Popular Tales and Stories of the Armorican Bretons). = Quarrel over Barzaz Breiz = At the 1872 Congress of the Breton Association at Saint-Brieuc, Luzel read a text that he had prepared, in which he raised suspicions about the authenticity of the songs included in the Barzaz Breiz, which was published by Th√©odore Hersart de la Villemarqu√© 33 years earlier. A public controversy ensued and his speech, which was rejected by the Breton Association, was heavily edited. The controversy surrounding Barzaz Breiz would last for more than a century. In 1960, the Breton scholar Francis Gourvil wrote a doctorate thesis in which he maintained that Luzel was right. In 1989, the musician and linguist Donatien Laurent demonstrated, in a thesis based on the manuscripts of La Villemarqu√©, that even if the author had revised the lyrics, he still nearly always relied upon the versions that he himself had collected or transcribed. = Journalist, justice, and archivist = Luzel's career trajectory changed yet again in 1874, when he started writing political editorials for the Republican newspaper, l'Avenir de Morlaix, where he would work until 1880. He was later made a justice of the peace in Daoulas. In 1881, he found stable work as a curator of Quimper's Departmental Archives of Finist√®re. There, he encountered Anatole Le Braz, who would become his disciple of sorts and would continue his work in finding stories and making an inventory of pieces of Ancient Breton theatre. Luzel was elected as a Republican to the municipal council of Quimper, and was later, in 1883, made Vice-President of the Archeological Society of Finist√®re, a group in which he participated for quite some time, and which La Villemarqu√© founded. = Defence of Breton = In 1888, Luzel asked Ernest Renan to intervene in the Ministry of Public Instruction, so that his friend, Anatole Le Braz, could teach Breton at the Quimper Lyc√©e outside school hours, which Le Braz offered to do for free. In his letter to Renan, he stated that he 'would like that, in all our primary schools that Breton children attend, an hour or two were consecrated to teach them Breton by heart and to sing Breton songs and pieces of poetry to instill patriotism in them.' Later in the letter, he referred to the Breton language as being 'the national language.' This request would be flatly refused by the Ministry. On 1 January 1890, Luzel was made knight of the Legion of Honour, an accolade that he received from the hands of his old rival, La Villemarqu√©, in a ceremony that took place on 30 January. Seemingly reconciled, the pair later died in the same year, 1895. Bibliography * Sainte-Tryphine et le roi Arthur, Quimperl√©, Clairet (1863) * Bepred Breizad.

History STFC was formed in April 2007 when Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC), along with the nuclear physics activities of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) were brought under the one umbrella organisation. From 1 November 2016 Brian Bowsher has replaced John Womersley as the CEO of STFC. John Womersley has now moved on to the European Spallation Source as the new Director General. In January 2018, Mark Thomson was announced as the new Executive Chair.  Purpose  Receiving its funding through the science budget from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), STFC's mission is to \\"To maximise the impact of our knowledge, skills, facilities and resources for the benefit of the United Kingdom and its people\\". ¬∑ Universities: STFC supports university-based research, innovation and skills development in particle physics, nuclear physics, space science and astronomy. ¬∑ Scientific Facilities: They provide access to world-leading, large-scale facilities across a range of physical and life sciences, enabling research, innovation and skills. ¬∑ National Campuses: Working with partners to build National Science and Innovation Campuses based around National Laboratories to promote academic and industrial collaboration and translation of research to market through direct interaction with industry. ¬∑ Inspiring and Involving: STFC help create a future pipeline of skilled and enthusiastic young people by using the excitement of our sciences to encourage wider take-up of STEM subjects in school and future life (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Activities The Science and Technology Facilities Council is one of Europe's largest multidisciplinary research organisations supporting scientists and engineers worldwide. Through research fellowships and grants, it is responsible for funding research in UK universities, in the fields of astronomy, particle physics, nuclear physics and space science. STFC operates its own world-class, large-scale research facilities (such as materials research, laser and space science and alternative energy exploration) and provides strategic advice to the UK government on their development. It manages international research projects in support of a broad cross-section of the UK research community and directs, coordinates and funds research, education and training. It is a partner in the UK Space Agency (formerly British National Space Centre or BNSC) providing about 40% of the UK government's expenditure in space science and technology.  Facilities  It helps operate/provide access for UK and international scientists to the following large-scale facilities: * Central Laser Facility (CLF) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory * CERN * DiRAC Distributed Research using Advanced Computing (Supercomputing facility) * The space science and space exploration programmes of ESA * European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) * Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) * Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING), La Palma * ISIS pulsed neutron and muon source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory * Diamond Light Source, operating on STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory site *:(Diamond is also partly funded by the Wellcome Trust.) * UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Edinburgh * Microelectronics Support Centre (MSC) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory * The Hartree Centre for high performance computing and data analytics at Daresbury Laboratory * ALICE (accelerator), EMMA (accelerator), CLARA and VELA at Daresbury Laboratory * The LHC Computing Grid (through its funding of the GridPP project) * Boulby underground laboratories * Advanced LIGO  Budget  STFC's budget is allocated annually by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. For 2015-16 STFC's budget allocation was ¬£529 million.  Knowledge exchange obligations  STFC is active in its responsibility for knowledge exchange from government funded civil science into UKPLC. As such, many technologies are licensed to UK companies and spin-out companies created including: * L3 Technology (L3T); * Microvisk; * Orbital Optics Ltd; * Oxsensis; * PETRRA; * Quantum Detectors; * ThruVision.

Jones worked in such occupations as mining, banking, and blacksmithing before his 1918 recording debut. He recorded with the Cleartone Four, the Crescent Trio, the Harmonizers Quartet and the Premier Quartet, and he performed under a variety of names (Harry Blake, Billy Clarke, Lester George, Duncan Jones, Reese Jones, John Kelley, Dennis O'Malley, William Rees, Victor Roberts, Billy West, William West, and Carlton Williams). After he met Ernie Hare in 1919, they teamed in 1920 when Brunswick executive Gus Haenschen had them sing an accompaniment on a Brunswick Records recording. They went on to do numerous recordings together for Brunswick, Edison, and other companies. They began on radio October 18, 1921 on WJZ (Newark, New Jersey). Sponsored by the chain of Happiness Candy stores, they were heard on The Happiness Boys program beginning August 22, 1923 on New York's WEAF, moving to NBC from a run from 1926 to 1929. As \\"The Happiness Boys\\", they sang popular tunes, mostly light fare and comic songs, and they joked with one another between numbers. By 1928, they were the highest paid singers in radio, earning $1,250 a week. The partnership ended with Hare's death on March 9, 1939. Jones continued to perform, teaming with Hare's 16-year-old daughter, Marilyn Hare, in 1939-40. He died November 23, 1940, in Manhattan, of a heart attack, and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Among Jones' hits was \\"The grass is always greener in the other fellow's yard\\" (available on YouTube) which became the theme song of the \\"Big Brother Bob Emery \\" a children's program, first on radio, then on TV in both New York and Boston in the 1940s and 1950s.

It is based in Seattle, Washington. It manages a network of fishing ships, processing plants, and a vertically integrated distributorship of its products. It sells frozen, canned, smoked and ready-to-eat seafood products for the wholesale, retail and food service markets under a variety of different brand names. It is a member of the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative. History  The company was founded in 1972 by Chuck Bundrant. In 1986, it merged with ConAgra's Northwest Pacific seafood unit, retaining the Trident name, and with ConAgra holding a 45% stake in the new company. In 1995, ConAgra sold most of its interest to Trident's original private owners. A leader in the consolidation of the seafood industry since the 1990s, the company has made numerous acquisitions, increasing its operations and market presence. Some of these acquisitions with their associated brands are: * ConAgra (1986 - see above). Along with the merger came ConAgra's Sea Alaska and Lily brands. * Farwest Fisheries (1992), along with its Faust, Prelate, Rubinstein's,The Rubinstein's brand has been in use since 1960 by Whitney- Fidalgo Seafoods (predecessor of Farwest), and named for its founder Sam Rubinstein. The Star of David in its logo was to indicate that the canned salmon or tuna was kosher, in contrast to the canned crab that was also marketed under the Rubinstein's brand.

The agreement between Exxon and the so-called Seattle Seven came to light after Anchorage-based attorney David W. Oesting, the lead plaintiffs' counsel in Exxon Shipping Company, et al. v. Baker, Grant, et al., submitted a preliminary \\" 'Plan of Allocation' or Damage Matrix\\" to federal judge H. Russel Holland in February 1997. The Seattle Seven responded by filing suit against Oesting and other plaintiffs' attorneys. In court it was revealed that Trident and the other processors had accepted a settlement of between 63.75 and 76 million dollars from Exxon for agreeing to return to Exxon their share of any punitive damages awarded by the court. The processors \\"agreed to be Exxon's front\\" in recovering punitive damages and Exxon agreed to pay their ongoing legal fees. Judge Holland called the deal an \\"astonishing ruse\\" and accused Exxon of acting as \\"Jekyll and Hyde ... behaving laudably in public and deplorably in private.\\" Even though they had already settled with Exxon, the Seattle Seven filed $745 million in punitive damage claims to be secretly given back to Exxon. Judge Holland voided the agreement and said that neither Exxon nor the seafood processors would share in the punitive damages. The judge wrote: \\"Public policy will not allow Exxon to use a secret deal to undercut the jury system, the court's numerous orders upholding the punitive verdict, and society's goal in punishing Exxon's recklessness.\\" However, in 2000, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Holland's decision and reinstated the agreement. The appeals court ruled that Judge Holland had abused his discretion and characterized the secret settlement as \\"an innovative way to encourage settlements in large class- action cases\\" that was \\"in the public interest.\\" Environmental record In 2011, as part of a consent decree (United States of America v. Trident Seafoods Corporation, Civil Action No. 11-1616), Trident Seafoods agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine, the largest Clean Water Act penalty ever assessed by the US Environmental Protection Agency to an Alaska fish processor. According to the EPA, Trident had illegally dumped fish processing waste into the ocean for years, creating at one site near its Akutan plant a \\"massive carpet of gelatinous goo\\" covering an area of sea floor the size of 38 football fields or more than 50 acres in size. The agreement also required Trident to invest an estimated $30‚Äì40 million in \\"source control and waste pile remediation measures\\" at its facilities in Naknek, Akutan, Cordova, St. Paul, and Ketchikan, Alaska. The 2011 agreement, finalized in 2012, settled more than 480 alleged violations of the Clean Water Act that took place between 2005 and 2009 at fourteen of the company's onshore and offshore plants. The EPA press release announcing the 2011 consent decree noted that in the previous ten years \\"Trident has been a party to multiple administrative enforcement agreements and judicial consent decrees resolving similar violations at many of the same facilities.\\" In February 2019, Trident Seafoods agreed to spend up to $23 million \\"to fix serious air pollution issues with its vessels and land- based facilities.\\" The company was fined $900,000 by the EPA for violating the Clean Air Act. Trident Seafoods had released an estimated 200,000 pounds of greenhouse gases, and failed to promptly repair leaks in its refrigeration equipment, which uses ozone-depleting coolants.  Philanthropy  The company has given donations to the victims of the huge earthquake that hit Japan in 2011. Groups who assisted the victims of hurricane Katrina and superstorm Sandy was also supported by Trident. A Bundrant Stadium was also built in his high school alma mater in Evansville as well as a Bundrant Media Center.

He played saxophone, flute, organ, piano, and synthesizer. Early life Ham was born in Melbourne and attended Camberwell Grammar School from 1964 to 1971.Gallery of Achievement: Mr Greg Ham (1971), Old Camberwell Grammarians‚Ä≤ Association, 2008. According to the school's year books, he was remembered for his acting talent in school plays, particularly The World We Live In (the insect comedy) in 1969 where he played the \\"parasite\\". In 1970 he played Mr Seekamp, editor of the Ballarat Times, in Lola Montez and, in 1971, Puff in The Critic. In 1967 Ham was photographed airborne by J. Jones in a still photo which won first prize in the Ilford Competition. Men at Work In 1972, Ham met Colin Hay via mutual friend Kym Gyngell. In 1979, he joined the original lineup of Men at Work with Hay, Ron Strykert, and Jerry Speiser. Ham and Hay formed the core of the band from 1979 until 1985 when Ham left, and the band broke up shortly afterward. Ham returned to Men at Work when they reformed in 1996 to tour the United States. Ham played saxophone, keyboards, flute, and harmonica for the group, as well as performing support vocals. He sang lead vocals on songs such as \\"Helpless Automaton\\" and \\"I Like To.\\" Ham also performed the saxophone solo in the song \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" (a rehearsal take was used in the final mix) and improvised the flute riff in the song \\"Down Under\\". Plagiarism accusation Larrikin Music bought the rights to the 1930s children's song \\"Kookaburra\\" in 1990 for $6,100. In 2009, music publisher Larrikin Music, then headed by Norman Lurie (now retired), sued Men at Work and their record label EMI for plagiarism, alleging that the flute riff copied the 1934 nursery rhyme \\"Kookaburra\\", to which they owned the publishing rights. The Federal Court of Australia ruled that \\"Down Under\\" did infringe the copyright of \\"Kookaburra\\" and awarded Larrikin 5% of the song's royalties backdated to 2002. Several appeals by EMI and Men at Work were unsuccessful. In an interview with The Age newspaper, Ham said he was deeply affected by the judgment and felt it tarnished his reputation, saying: \\"I'm terribly disappointed that that's the way I'm going to be remembered‚Äîfor copying something.\\" Post-Men at Work career Ham played brass and keyboard with the R&B; band Relax with Max, with frontman Max Vella, girlfriend Linda \\"Toots\\" Wostry, on saxophone, James Black on keyboard, David Adam and Ross Hannaford on guitar and John James \\"JJ\\" Hackett on drums. Relax with Max played at the Metropol in Fitzroy and on ABC's television comedy While You're Down There and at the Falls Creek music festival. They supported Australian artists including Kylie Minogue and American soul singers James Brown and Bo Diddley. Ham also performed regularly with jazzy ensemble Miss Dorothy and His Fools in Love. Later in life, Ham taught guitar at Carlton North Primary School and assessed music students for the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). Death Ham was found dead on 19 April 2012 at his home in Carlton North, Melbourne. Several newspapers listed the cause as a heart attack. There have been allegations that Ham had a long battle with heroin addiction, and the cause of death is still being debated. It is known that he was despondent over the copyright lawsuit filed against him and the members of Men At Work for using a few bars from \\"Kookaburra\\" without permission for the flute riff in \\"Down Under\\". Ham's private funeral was held at the Fitzroy Town Hall in Melbourne on 2 May 2012. Ham is survived by his two children.

Its transmitter is located on McClain Road in Fort Shawnee. It is Lima's first and oldest commercial radio station. The call letters, when spoken like a word rhymes with the city of Lima, which is pronounced with a long \\"i\\" sound, unlike the capital city of Peru. Early history Originally WBLY (at 1240 on the AM dial) which aired traditional middle of the road programming in the early 1930s then switching the call letters to WLOK in the early 1940s. Veteran broadcaster Hugh Downs started at WLOK while a student at Bluffton University in nearby Bluffton, Ohio. Starting in radio under the leadership of the Hoosier Schoolmaster of the Air, Dr. Clarence M. Morgan, long time Lima broadcast legend Easter Straker was program director for many years in addition to hosting \\"Easter's Parade\\" a live mid- day program on WIMA and on Channel 35.'\\"Easter's Parade\\" was a midday show similar to the popular Ruth Lyons show out of Cincinnati. Talk and topics were aimed at the women, mothers and children that were the early watchers of the 1950s. Straker would discuss national, state and local issues with the Lima woman in mind. She instituted the \\"Teddy Bear Fund\\" with the local hospitals. This was to provide funds for Teddy Bears to every child admitted to Lima hospitals. One way to raise funds was to invite children to come down to the studio to be interviewed by Easter while sitting in her \\"birthday chair.\\" While they were being questioned she would ask if they brought any tax stamps for the Teddy Bear.The tax stamps were then used to buy Teddy bears for sick children. In return children were offered the chance to help themselves to pennies in a giant glass jar. The handful of pennies to a young person was a thrill. The TV show continued until 1984, and the radio show until 1991, ending a few months before Straker's death in April 1992 from colon cancer at age 73. It switched to the WIMA call sign in 1955. Its then-owner Lloyd A. Pixley, a former Ohio State football legend later founded WLOK-TV (later WIMA- TV now WLIO) and WIMA-FM (now WIMT) which was later sold to George Hamilton and Robert Mack's company Northwestern Ohio Broadcasting in 1964. For much of its early years WIMA was a daytime station which eventually was granted an FM station in the late 1950s. WIMA-AM was granted a 24-hour license in 1970. WIMA-FM switched to a pre-recorded country music format in 1974, while WIMA-AM continued its \\"middle-of-the-road\\" format, with disc jockeys Alan DeBoer \\"Ace Alan\\", Tom Francis, Joe Jansen \\"J.J.\\", G. Arthur Versnick \\"Versnick on the Radio\\", and Andy Wetherall, under program director and deejay Jack Stower \\"J.S.\\", and station manager Les Rau. Around that time WIMA-AM's MOR format evolved from traditional \\"old-line\\" MOR to a more contemporary flavor, the forerunner of today's adult contemporary music format. In April 1974, Jack Stower moved from WIMA-AM, to WIMA-FM (Country Lovin'), to become that station's first manager. Mr. Stower was succeeded by Joe Jansen as WIMA-AM program director. WIMA-FM is now known as WIMT \\"T-102\\". The former WIMA-TV (now WLIO) was sold off in 1972 to Lima Communications Corporation, a division of Toledo-based Block Communications, owners of the Toledo Blade newspaper. The WBLY call sign later moved to an AM station in Springfield, Ohio where it resided from 1954 to 2002 which is now WULM. WIMA along with four other Clear Channel Lima radio stations were initially sold to Florida-based GoodRadio.TV LLC in May 2007, but the deal soon collapsed prior to FCC approval. The most recent proposed deal was to banker American Securities under the new name Frequency Licensing Partners LLC, but it has yet to be completed or approved. As of 2009, these stations (except WBUK) remain in Clear Channel's hands.

Lake Mergozzo) is a small sub-alpine lake in northern Italy just to the west of Lago Maggiore and north of Lago d'Orta, at the mouth of the Val d‚ÄôOssola in the province of Verbano Cusio Ossola, Piedmont. In ancient times it was the extreme point of the short northwestern arm of Lago Maggiore, formed by glaciation. However repeated flooding of Maggiore‚Äôs tributary the Toce deposited sediment which gradually formed a stretch of land which cut off Mergozzo from the larger expanse of water, and from the Toce itself. Today the settlement of Fondotoce (a frazione of Verbania) stands on this alluvial plain. The small town Mergozzo, which lies at the other end of the lake, gives it its name. The greater part of the lake falls within the commune of Mergozzo, the rest within Verbania. Monte Orfano (790 m) rises from the south-west shore of the lake; the limestone rocks of which it is composed are heavily quarried. On the opposite side of the lake the mountains form the beginning of the Corni di Nibbio chain which divides the Val d‚ÄôOssola from the Valgrande and its National Park. The lake is fed by the waters of a number of clean mountain streams, the two most important being the Rio Bracchio and the Rio Rescina. Its sole outlet is the 2.7 km canal which links it to Lago Maggiore near Fondotoce. The difference in levels between the two lakes is slight, and when Maggiore is in flood, the flow of water in the canal goes into reverse. This opens up the possibility of pollutants entering Lago Mergozzo. Nevertheless, today the lake, where the use of motor boats has long been forbidden, is one of the least polluted in Italy; it has become a tourist destination particularly popular with people from Germany and the Netherlands. Fish A pike Species found in the lake include, pikeperch, common whitefish, brown trout, Arctic char, bleak, chub, Danube roach (Rutilus pigus), common carp, rudd, tench, triotto (Rutilus aula), savetta, or Italian nase (Chondrostoma soetta), twait shad, northern pike, perch, black bass, pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), eel and burbot.

(1,1)-forms  Real (p,p)-forms on a complex manifold M are forms which are of type (p,p) and real, that is, lie in the intersection :\\\\Lambda^{p,p}(M)\\\\cap \\\\Lambda^{2p}(M,{\\\\mathbb R}). A real (1,1)-form \\\\omega is called positive if any of the following equivalent conditions hold #-\\\\omega is an imaginary part of a positive (not necessarily positive definite) Hermitian form. #For some basis dz_1, ... dz_n in the space \\\\Lambda^{1,0}M of (1,0)-forms, \\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\omega can be written diagonally, as \\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\omega = \\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_i dz_i\\\\wedge d\\\\bar z_i, with \\\\alpha_i real and non-negative. #For any (1,0)-tangent vector v\\\\in T^{1,0}M, -\\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\omega(v, \\\\bar v) \\\\geq 0 #For any real tangent vector v\\\\in TM, \\\\omega(v, I(v)) \\\\geq 0, where I:\\\\; TM\\\\mapsto TM is the complex structure operator.  Positive line bundles  In algebraic geometry, positive (1,1)-forms arise as curvature forms of ample line bundles (also known as positive line bundles). Let L be a holomorphic Hermitian line bundle on a complex manifold, : \\\\bar\\\\partial:\\\\; L\\\\mapsto L\\\\otimes \\\\Lambda^{0,1}(M) its complex structure operator. Then L is equipped with a unique connection preserving the Hermitian structure and satisfying : abla^{0,1}=\\\\bar\\\\partial. This connection is called the Chern connection. The curvature \\\\Theta of a Chern connection is always a purely imaginary (1,1)-form. A line bundle L is called positive if :\\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\Theta is a positive definite (1,1)-form. The Kodaira embedding theorem claims that a positive line bundle is ample, and conversely, any ample line bundle admits a Hermitian metric with \\\\sqrt{-1}\\\\Theta positive.  Positivity for (p, p)-forms  Positive (1,1)-forms on M form a convex cone. When M is a compact complex surface, dim_{\\\\mathbb C}M=2, this cone is self-dual, with respect to the Poincar√© pairing : \\\\eta, \\\\zeta \\\\mapsto \\\\int_M \\\\eta\\\\wedge\\\\zeta For (p, p)-forms, where 2\\\\leq p \\\\leq dim_{\\\\mathbb C}M-2, there are two different notions of positivity. A form is called strongly positive if it is a linear combination of products of positive forms, with positive real coefficients. A real (p, p)-form \\\\eta on an n-dimensional complex manifold M is called weakly positive if for all strongly positive (n-p, n-p)-forms Œ∂ with compact support, we have \\\\int_M \\\\eta\\\\wedge\\\\zeta\\\\geq 0 . Weakly positive and strongly positive forms form convex cones. On compact manifolds these cones are dual with respect to the Poincar√© pairing.  References  *P. Griffiths and J.

The area includes fields, ponds and in part landmarked industrial architecture from the former brewery. The historically rare basement vaults cover 1.5 hectares and were made to store beer in spaces up to 8 meters high. Contents = History = In 1669, a brewery was built for the first time next to the largest duty building in Graz in the area of the stone field. In 1855, the Westphalian Johann Peter Reininghaus together with his brother Julius founded the company ‚ÄúBr√ºder Reininghaus‚Äù and built the first steam-run brewery in Styria. Around 1900, the brewery was the fifth largest in Austria. The brewery‚Äôs area of business spread out far beyond Austria to Greece, Egypt, East India, Zanzibar and South America. When the Second World War broke out, the Reininghaus family was forced to emigrate. After their return from exile, they transferred the beer production to Puntigam. In spite of having moved production, the family held onto the mostly fallow fields. Peter Reininghaus Sr.‚Äôs death in 1973 signaled the beginning of a period of 25 years in which many projects were conceived, but none were actually completed. =Neighborhood= On the property itself one finds a building housing research-oriented companies, a day-care center specializing in integration and an allotment garden facility.

The film was directed by Tinnu Anand, and starred Amitabh Bachchan and Shabana Azmi. This film is remade in Telugu as Azad (2000 film)& tamil as Velayudham. The film was a Disaster at the box office and is the lowest grossing Amitabh film of the 1980s,even lower than the then lowest Jaadugar released in the same year. The film has only one song; \\"Itne Baazu Itne Sar\\", written by Shabana Azmi's real life father and noted poet Kaifi Azmi and sung by the lead actor himself, Amitabh Bachchan. The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Dialogue for Javed Akhtar.Awards IMDb Plot The movie begins with a journalist named Subhashini (Shabana Azmi) working for a daily newspaper in a city named Rajnagar. She is deemed controversial due to her bold and open-mouthed articles against corrupt politicians. After a change in the ownership of the newspaper, she realises that she stands to lose her job along with many others, especially who are not likely to subscribe to the new management's policies. Feeling betrayed, she vents her frustration by penning her column with a fictitious letter ad verbatim, which is supposedly written to her by someone named Azaad. This letter openly criticises the establishment and the chasm that exists between the haves and the have-nots, vocalising unacknowledged and uncomfortable facts. The letter also says that the author of the letter would commit suicide from a high-rise building on 26 January, the Republic Day of India, as a mark of protest against a failed system. The letter creates a sensation among political leaders, businessmen and the public. In this new development, the new owner, Seth Gokulchand (Manohar Singh), senses an opportunity. He thinks of a scheme to promote his newspaper and coaxes Subhashini to establish a column in the name of Azaad and write about the ills of the present society and administration. The task for them now is to find a face and character for Azaad, should the question arise about the real identity of the author of the column and the letter. One day, she comes across a jobless and nameless vaudevillian character, Amitabh Bachchan), who happens to be drifting by Rajnagar along with another bum friend of his. Subhashini offers him a job asking him to pose as Azaad. He sees a chance in it to make a few quick bucks. With this in mind, and that he has nothing to lose, he accepts the job. Subhashini makes use of the whole propaganda machinery at her disposal to create a public figure for Azaad. Azaad is steadily introduced in the media and local issues and made to attend various public rallies. His native, down to the earth charm finds instantaneous appeal with the people of the town. This draws the gullible public to his frequent public addresses. Word spreads like wildfire and soon people from the surrounding rural areas flock in to attend his public appearances. This gathers momentum and soon Azaad becomes a cult figure. Gokulchand initiates the idea of making Azaad a much wider-publicised figure to Subhashini. She very efficiently works on the idea writing articles on Azaad, on Azaad's ideas. This results in Azaad becoming a kind of a nationwide hero, and is soon perceived as a threat by the local politicians as a potential national leader. Later he learns through the media that he has been used, however he decides to sacrifice for the nation and prove that he now identifies with the ideology of the imaginary character Azaad. To prove that what had begun as fiction, has now become the truth, he jumps from the 30-story under-construction building and dies. But before that, he records a message for his supporters and urges that Azaad should evolve in each one of them.

He was a professional pedagogue, taught in a Jewish school, and later was a postgraduate student at Kiev Pedagogical Institute. In September 1941, when the Germans occupied Kiev, Oleksandr Ohloblyn who knew him for years invited him at the meeting where representatives of OUN (Andriy Melnyk's faction) formed the new Kiev city administration. Although Bahaziy was supported by a large group, the OUN representatives mistrusted him and agreed to appoint him a deputy to Ohloblyn who became the city mayor. Very soon, however, Bahaziy gained favor of both OUN people (for his active participation in the activities of the Ukrainian National Council) and the German military leaders.

Olympiad Antwerp 1920 Football Tournament, Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation, 5 November 2015 =United Kingdom= The Scottish Derby County player Tommy Barbour encountered Abdullah first, when he served with the Derbyshire Yeomanry in Egypt during the Great War. There he was inside right of an Egyptian XI which played the British Army in Cairo. After recommendation of Barbour Abdullah was tried out in a match of the Derby County reserves in mid September 1920. After he \\"pleased the crowd immensely\\" there, he was signed by the club a week later. He played his first match in the First Division in October, where he scored the first goal for the Rams in a 3-0 home win against Manchester City. Abdullah, whose first name Tewfik was soon transformed into his nickname \\"Toothpick\\", thus became the second Egyptian in professional English football after Hussein Hegazi, who played with him in the 1920 Olympics and who spent some years with Dulwich Hamlet FC in the Isthmian League and in 1911 completed a match with London's Fulham FC in the Second Division. Abdullah's goal against City should remain his only goal and only win in a dozen league matches for Derby County in the 1920/21-season which ended in relegation. He stayed on, but got little playing time in the Second Division. Abdullah's ability with the ball found praise, but he was said to lack speed.Egyptian Inside right - Signs for Derby County, Daily Mail (London), 22 September 1920, p. 9.Abdallah, Tewfik, (Statistics with Derby County), The Rams, 2007 (via Internet Archive Wayback Machine) For the 1922/23 season, he joined the Scottish second division club Cowdenbeath FC which should finish eleventh. This transfer was made on the recommendation of his Derby teammate Willie Paterson, whose father Alex Paterson was coaching the Scots. Abdullah soon broke his arm there, but otherwise played well and regularly. In a later review, Alex Paterson described him as one of the \\"smartest footballers\\" he ever encountered.From Central League to First Division, Evening Telegraph (Dundee, Scotland), 21 August 1930, p. 9 At the end of the season, it was initially said that he would go to America despite an offer to stay.Abdullah for America, Hull Daily Mail, 26/05/1923, p. 3. Eventually, he moved to Bridgend Town in Wales, which was to be 13th in the Western Division of the Southern Football League.Sporting Items, Nottingham Evening Post, 16 August 1923, p. 6 He played there until late February or early March 1924. At the beginning of March 1924 he returned to England and joined Hartlepools United in the Third Division North, staying until early May. There he scored in his debut at the 4-0 debut against Wrexham. After the game, it was reported that he had increased the impact of the Hartlepools attack significantly and that he had gained a lot of weight and strength since he left Derby County. He was considered a \\"god-send\\", but Hartlepools finished the season on the penultimate place. For Abdullah, who played a total of eleven times, one goal stood.The Amateur League, Derby Daily Telegraph, 15 March 1924, p. 4North and South: Abdallah Gets Going, Derby Daily Telegraph, 22 March 1924, p. 4Sporting Tiems (sic), Nottingham Evening Post, 8 May 1924, p. 8Club History: Part 1 - 1885 to 1945: The Early Years, Hartlepool United (per 31 July 2020) = American Soccer League = As a result of the expansion of the American Soccer League for the 1924/25 season from eight to twelve teams, the steady stream of British, especially Scottish, footballers to the United States increased. There, the players besides a place in the team, got a job, mostly in the factory of the team owner, which then earned them up to three times the three or four pounds that the British clubs usually paid per week. Abdullah joined the Providence Clamdiggers in Rhode Island. Abdullah, soon to be given the new nickname \\"Happy\\", ended the season there with 15 goals in 34 games. In 1925/26 he only managed seven goals in ten games and then two goals in 18 games. In three years he had accumulated 62 appearances and 24 goals for the Clamdiggers. Later in the 1926/27 season, he moved to the Fall River Marksmen in Massachusetts, a top team of the time, for which he scored once in six matches until the end of the season. With the Marksmen, where he played again with Willie Paterson, he won the National Challenge Cup, predecessor of the US Open Cup, of 1927, albeit he was not on the pitch in the final. On April 2, 1927, he was also in a selection of the ASL, which was defeated 2-4 against the well-staffed national team of Uruguay. A week later he was part of a 1-1 draw against Uruguay with the Marksmen. For the 1927/28 season, he switched to the newly founded Hartford Americans. The club withdrew early in the season and Abdullah only played eleven times for the Connecticut side. Until the end of the year, he then played eight games for the New York Nationals which were created at the beginning of the season by the controversial entrepreneur Charles Stoneham by transferring the Indiana Flooring franchise to the east coast metropolis. Still in 1928 followed a short comeback to the Marksmen where in February 1928 he had two games in which he marked one goal. = Return to Egypt - career end in Canada - management = Once he returned to Egypt he joined Al Ahly SC of Cairo, winning the Sultan Hussein Cup of 1929 contributing one goal to the 2-0 victory against Scottish military side Dirhams in the final. In the following year he won the Egypt Cup with a 2-0 win in the final over Al Ittihad of Alexandria. After this he returned to Cairo International SC with which he reached the Egypt Cup final of 1931, losing there to 1-4 to Al Ahly. It is reported, that in 1932 he returned to North America, joining Montreal Carsteel in Canada, where he saw out his playing years. The club won the Coupe du Qu√©bec, the Cup of Quebec, in the years of 1932 to 1934, and he might have been involved in the winning of these trophies.

Its IUPAC name is 1,3-diethyl-1,3-diphenylurea. Ethyl centralite is insoluble in water, but is soluble in acetone, ethanol and benzene. It is mainly used as a burning rate moderator and stabilizer for smokeless powder, and also a plasticizer for celluloid.

The term \\"Centralite\\" was originally applied to dimethyldiphenylurea developed about 1906 at the German Central War Laboratory Zentralstelle f√ºr wissenschaftlich-technische Untersuchungen in Neubabelsberg as a deterrent coating for smokeless powder in military rifle cartridges. Thereafter, all hydrocarbon-substituted symmetrical diphenyl urea compounds used as smokeless powder deterrents (or moderants) were called centralites after the laboratory. The preferred ethyl centralite became known as Centralite No. 1 and the original methyl centralite was identified as Centralite No. 2. Butyl centralite was also used as a celluloid plasticizer. Its reaction history is considerably more complicated than that of diphenylurea. Ending up with nitrated anilines, the methyl analog centralite-2 or sym-dimethyldiphenylurea is also known and is used somewhat abroad. The centralite are considered to be somewhat less effective as stabilizers than 2-nitrodiphenylamine, but they are also quite good plasticizers. When found in propellants they are frequently used at higher fractions than the diphenylamines to take advantage of their plasticizing properties.

This event was the work of the Australian millionaire Arthur Earle, who wanted to recognise the positive impact that camels had on the development of Australia, and highlight the importance these animals had in the exploration and transport needs in the central Australian deserts. It is said to have been the longest animal endurance race ever held. The event The event was long spanning from the centre of Australia, starting at Ayers Rock, to the East Coast of Australia ending on the Gold Coast. The race was broken down into six legs each with check points in between. The event was run like a car rally, where each competitor was timed on how long it took to complete a leg. Each leg as detailed in the Australasian geographical magazine Geo Volume 11 number 3 as below. * Leg 1: Ayers Rock to Alice Spring (Northern Territory 410 km) * Leg 2: Alice Springs to Boulia (Northern Territory to Queensland 761 km) * Leg 3: Boulia to Longreach (Queensland app. 604 km) * Leg 4: Longreach to Charleville (Queensland app. 530 km) * Leg 5: Charleville to Warwick, Queensland (Queensland app. 1242 km) * Leg 6: Warwick to Gold Coast (Queensland app. 140 km) For three months competitors battled disease, floods and competitor rivalry, as the mix of people in the event varied greatly. Australia's elite SASR (Special Air Service Regiment which came second overall) along with the a team from the 2/4 Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, competitors from the United States, Australia's leading camel handlers and ex-marathon runners entered the event totaling 69 competitors. A total of 28 competitors completed the event with details of finishing times for first second and third place as below.Sheratons Great Australian Camel Race Final Results #Gordon O'Connell 480 Hrs #SASR 514 Hrs #Steve French 542 Hrs Calculating these times into a 24‚Äëhour period, then gaining an average of distance traveled daily equates to Gordon O'Connell taking 20 days in total time to complete, covering 168 km every 24 hours as the average. (This includes meals, sleeping and animal feeding) Gordon O'Connell won The Great Australian Camel race by approximately 34 hours ahead of his nearest competitor. In addition to this the distance he won by had been reached by the second leg of the race. Gordon won the first four of the six legs, even when he was hospitalised with kidney failure from Shiguella on the second leg going into Boulia. The army was the team organising the legs and were there for the safety of all competitors along with competing themselves. In addition to this they were the best equipped for the event with hundreds of support personnel and vehicles. The clear leaders throughout the race were the SASR and Gordon O'Connell. Other social context It featured in the four-hour documentary produced by Orana Films and photographed in the Australasian geographical magazine Geo Volume 11 number 3 page 97. The race was to also inject more celebration into Australia's Bicentennial year whilst raising funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. See also * Camels in Australia Notes :After the event Gordon went to retire the camel for her efforts when a dispute broke out over ownership of Carla. Because she had won one of the longest race events in history, the original person Gordon was involved with before the race, made claim to her and wanted to use her name to start his camel business. After close to six years Gordon was awarded ownership of the camel and she resides with him to this day in retirement. References 1\\\\.

The park sits at an elevation of . Red Hills State Park is open for year-round recreation including boating, fishing, hunting, hiking and various winter sports. The park includes a restaurant which is open year-round and has banquet facilities. History Red Hills State Park is in southeastern Illinois in Lawrence County. The county borders the state of Indiana to the east. This part of Illinois was once part of the Vincennes Tract, a tract of land that was ceded to the United States of America in 1795 by Native Americans. The Natives lost a series of battles to General Anthony Wayne. The treaty was signed in Greenville. The Treaty of Greeneville was signed by a number of tribes known as the Western Confederacy. The tribes in the confederacy included the Wyandot, Lenape, Shawnee, Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Miami, Wea, Kickapoo and Kaskaskia. The natives agreed to relinquish their claim to land that was north of the Ohio River and east of an established line. That line passes through what is now Red Hills State Park. The area grew following a series of wars and treaties and came to be known as the Northwest Territory and comprised what is now the states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota. Following the forced removal of the Native Americans, the area was open to settlement by Euro- American settlers from the original Thirteen Colonies. The land that is now Red Hills State Park was divided by an old wagon road known as Old Cahokia Trace, more commonly known as Trace Road. The road was the main route from Vincennes, Indiana to St. Louis, Missouri. The establishment of Red Hill State Park coincided with the construction of a dam and reservoir on Muddy Creek. The dam was completed and the park opened in 1953. The creek is a main tributary of the Embarras River. Red Hills Lake is with a maximum depth of . The lake has of shoreline. The park has expanded over the years to include many facilities that are typical of a state park including picnic areas, boat ramps, trails and campgrounds. The dam at Red Hills Lake State Park was damaged by the 2008 Illinois earthquake. Engineers feared that the dam could collapsed and cause flooding downstream. The decision was made to drain the lake for repairs in December 2008. The dam was repaired in 2009 and the lake has been restocked with fish. Ecology Red Hills State Park is on the Embarras River which is a tributary of the Wabash River which in turn flows into the Ohio River as part of the Mississippi River drainage area. The park is on the Red Hills which are the highest bits of land between Cincinnati and St. Louis. There is a tower atop the Red Hills that provides for scenic viewing of the area. The area comprises a variety of ecosystems including dry and wet prairies, wooded hills, ravines, meadows, and wetlands along the river and lake. The park is bisected by U.S. Route 50. The areas north of the highway are deciduous woods and the areas south of the highway are scattered woods with plots of a grains, clover and grassy prairies. Recreation Red Hills State Park is open for year-round recreation. There are shaded picnic areas spread throughout the park and three picnic pavilions. The park has more than 100 campsites that have access to modern restroom facilities, electric hook-ups and a dumping station for chemical toilets. One cabin is available to rent. There are of trails in the park that are open to hiking, horseback riding and, in the winter months, cross-country skiing. Additionally that park as volleyball and basketball courts. The park is open to hunting and fishing. The lake is surrounded by a paved road that provides access to the lake for fishing from the bank. Boats are permitted on the lake, but they must be battery or human powered. Common game fish include bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass and channel catfish. Ice fishing is permitted when the lake is frozen and the ice is thick enough to allow safe access. Common game animals that may be legally hunted at the park are white-tailed deer, quail, woodcocks, doves, wild turkeys and rabbits. Deer must be taken with a bow. Hunting deer with guns is prohibited. Gun hunting for the other wildlife is permissible.

It is 12 km south of the largest city and former capital Bujumbura, overlooking Lake Tanganyika. In French, it is referred to as La Pierre de Livingstone et Stanley. Some Burundians claim the location is where the famous first meeting of Livingstone and Stanley took place, at which the latter uttered the famous words \\"Dr Livingstone, I presume?\\". However, that meeting actually took place in Ujiji in Tanzania on 10 November 1871 as clearly detailed in Stanley's book, \\"How I Found Livingstone\\".Henry M. Stanley: How I Found Livingstone on Project Gutenberg website accessed 13 April 2007. David Livingstone's journal also confirms Ujiji as the location, with an entry the day before the meeting reading \\"At dawn, off and go to Ujiji\\", a town he knew well. Livingstone then details meetings with several Arab residents of Ujiji including one who was supposed to be keeping his goods from his previous visit, before recording Stanley's arrival.David Livingstone and Horace Waller (ed.): The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death. Two Volumes. John Murray, London, 1874. [Note that after several years out of contact with Europeans, Livingstone was out on the European calendar by 18 days because of the many days passed delirious with fever, and his servants did not keep a calendar. Until corrected by Stanley, he thought the date of the meeting was 24 October.] From their writings, the visit to Mugere appears to be the one on 25‚Äì27 November which Livingstone and Stanley described as being one of the most hospitable they enjoyed. The date 25 November 1871 can be seen scratched on the rock. They had rested in Ujiji for six days, and then set off by canoe up the north-east shore of the lake to explore rivers which might flow out of the Lake Tanganyika. At the Mugere River they found the village of Chief Mukamba who welcomed them and gave them a hut in which to rest. They stayed two nights, and Stanley records that Livingstone's servant Susi got very drunk on the Chief's hospitality. As the first Europeans to visit the area, their arrival was memorable, and it must be at some time later the event became confused in some people's minds as the first meeting between Livingstone and Stanley.

They were held at Cealchythe, in Kent, generally identified with modern Chelsea, London. Offa's councils =787= King Offa of Mercia presided over a church council held at Chelsea in the 787. Although it has often been claimed that the council was attended by papal legates, this stems from a conflation of the visit by papal legates to Offa's court and Northumbria in 786. The two legates did attend a council held at Offa's court, but this was not necessarily held at Chelsea.Cubitt Anglo-Saxon Church Councils p. 270 Two different versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle record the proceedings of the council. The Peterborough Manuscript (Version E) of the Chronicle records the council under the year 785, although the events took place in 787, and states that \\"here there was a contentious synod at Chelsea and Archbishop J√¶nberht relinquished some part of his bishopric, and Hygeberht was chosen by King Offa, and Ecgfrith consecrated as king.\\"Swanton (trans. and ed.) Anglo-Saxon Chronicle pp. 53, 55 The Canterbury Manuscript (Version F) has the council under 785 also, and describes the council as \\"a full synod sat at Chelsey\\" but otherwise relates much the same events.Swanton (trans. and ed.) Anglo-Saxon Chronicle p. 52 The historian Nicholas Brooks sees the coupling of the elevation of Lichfield with the consecration of Ecgfrith, who was Offa's son, as significant. He argues that Offa desired to have Ecgfrith consecrated as his successor during Offa's lifetime, but was unable to get J√¶nberht to agree, and this was another factor in the creation of Lichfield as an archbishopric.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 118‚Äì119 Hygeberht consecrated Ecgfrith after Hygeberht's elevation to archiepiscopal status.Williams Kingship and Government p. 28 Offa vowed at the council to donate 365 mancuses each year to the papacy, to provide for poor people in Rome and to provide lights for St. Peter's Basilica, stated to be a thanks- offering for his victories. C. J. Godfrey has argued that the donation was really in return for the papal approval of Offa's scheme to elevate the diocese of Lichfield to an archdiocese. Whatever Offa's motivation, historians have generally seen the gift as the beginning of Peter's Pence, an annual \\"tax\\" paid to Rome by the English Church.Godfrey \\"Archbishopric\\" Studies in Church History p. 147 Although it appears that the 787 council approved Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, remained a bishop at its conclusion; he signed the council's report still as a bishop. There is no indication that he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop. =789= Another council was held at Chelsea in 789, and a surviving charter records some of the attending bishops. These included both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of Lichfield, as well as the Bishops of Dunwich, Leicester, Lindsey, and Winchester.Cubitt Anglo-Saxon Church Councils pp. 273-274 =793= Although a charter exists claiming that there was a council at Chelsea in 793, the charter itself (Sawyer 136) is a forgery, and likely put together from a list of bishops alive at that date. 801 A council appears to have been held at Chelsea in 801, as an extant charter (Sawyer 158) records a confirmation of a land grant by Coenwulf, the king of Mercia that was part of the council's proceedings.Cubitt Anglo-Saxon Church Councils p. 279 816 There was a further synod in Chelsea in 816.

The prefix was introduced in December 1946 when the Irish Naval Service was established with the purchase of three corvettes from the Royal Navy replacing Muirch√∫. Career =UK career= She was built in Liffey Dockyard in 1908 (registration required) as a fishery research and protection cruiser and was named Helga II.

At this time the \\"II\\" was dropped from her name and she served as an anti-submarine patrol vessel as well as undertaking escort duty in the Irish Sea. Helga was involved in the Easter Rising when the British forces used her to shell Dublin starting with Liberty Hall in April 1916.

Helga was released from the navy in March 1919 and returned to fisheries work. She was later used to transport the British auxiliary troops known as Black and Tans around the coast when many of the roads in Ireland were rendered impassable by Irish forces in the War of Independence. =Irish service= Helga was handed over to the Irish Free State in August 1923 and was renamed Muirch√∫. She thus became one of the first ships in the newly established Coastal and Marine Service. She was commandeered in July 1922 by the government and used against Anti-treaty forces in Munster. However, in the following year the vessel was returned to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to carry on her task of fishery protection. It was not until the actual day on which the Second World War was declared that the Marine and Coastwatching Service was established and on 12 December 1939 Muirch√∫ was taken over by this Service from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

The symbol consists of three dots placed in an upright triangle and is read therefore. While it is not generally used in formal writing, it is used in mathematics and shorthand. History According to Cajori, A History of Mathematical Notations, Johann Rahn used both the therefore and because signs to mean \\"therefore\\"; in the German edition of Teutsche Algebra (1659) the therefore sign was prevalent with the modern meaning, but in the 1668 English edition Rahn used the because sign more often to mean \\"therefore\\". Other authors in the 18th century also used three dots in a triangle shape to signify \\"therefore\\", but as with Rahn, there wasn't much in the way of consistency as to how the triangle was oriented; because with its current meaning appears to have originated in the 19th century. In the 20th century, the three-dot notation for 'therefore' became very rare in continental Europe, but it remains popular in Anglophone countries. Example of use Used in a syllogism: :All gods are immortal. :Zeus is a god. :‚à¥ Zeus is immortal. :x + 1 = 10 :‚à¥ x = 9 Other uses In meteorology, the 'therefore' sign is used to indicate 'moderate rain' on a station model; the similar typographic symbol asterism (‚ÅÇ, three asterisks) indicates moderate snow. = Freemasonry= A diploma from the Masonic alt=A diploma from the Masonic Grande Loge de France In Masonic traditions, the symbol is used to indicate an abbreviation (rather than the conventional period mark).

Since the 1980s and 1990s it has been a popular area for shopping, dining, and entertainment, as well as a high-end residential area. It was previously an industrial area. Bryggetorget at Aker Brygge Location Aker Brygge is located just west of downtown on the westside of Pipervika, an arm of the Oslo Fjord, on the former ship yard of Akers Mekaniske Verksted, which ceased operations in 1982. Prior to the establishment of the shipyard in 1854, the area was known as Holmen. It was then an old yard where some minor industrial activity, and a suburban establishment grew in the early 19th century. Aker Brygge is served by the Aker Brygge tram station. History The area contained shipyards and engineering industry - Aker Mekaniske Verksted AS - until 1982. The construction of Aker Brygge was carried out in four steps by the realtors Aker Eiendom AS. A few old industrial buildings were demolished, while several of the major workshop halls were rebuilt as shopping areas. The first step of the construction was finished in 1986, with Telje, Torp and Aasen as architects. The fourth and final construction, the Storebrand insurance building facing Munkedamsveien, was completed in 1998. The area consists of a shopping center with shops and restaurants, a cinema, office space, and apartments. Additionally, there is a small boat harbour, and a terminal for the ferries to Nesodden. The area measures 260,000 m2. Today, about 6,000 people work in Aker Brygge and approximately 900 people have their homes here. Aker Brygge was also the scene of an infamous gang-related shootout 19 August 2006. The shooting happened in bright daylight, with several hundred bystanders, including children and tourists in the line of fire. Only two people were wounded and nobody was killed in the incident. The area today Tingvallakaia, gaten Stranden, September 2009 A masterplan led by Space Group Company and Ghilardi + Hellsten reorganized the area between 2010 and 2014. Space Group worked on activating the parallel streets, and created an inside street, going through the main buildings. Aker Brygge is a leader in Norway for waterfront development and it is one of the most visited place in Oslo with 12 million visitors each year. Aker Brygge area today consists of 13 separate units and 9 of them are divided into a total of 823 owner units. The properties are bound together through a comprehensive working agreement thereby creating a new district of Oslo which is unique in both a national and international perspective. A number of well situated public areas and arrangements have been developed through cooperation between apartment owners, and business and cultural interests. The administration of the working agreement and the carrying out of such tasks is done by the commonly owned company Bryggedrift AS.

It has a north-south range from about Geraldton to the south coast, but with a split in the formation south of Perth. The southern part is known as the South West Yarragadee Aquifer. The aquifer is quite deep, situated hundreds of metres below ground level and with a thickness ranging up to about two kilometres. In the Perth area, the Yarragadee Aquifer is located beneath the Leederville Aquifer, which itself is located beneath two superficial aquifers known as the Gnangara Mound and Jandakot Mound. These aquifers are separated by impervious layers with no groundwater, called aquitards. The Yarragadee Aquifer stores about 1000 cubic kilometres of water, compared to about 20 cubic kilometres in the Gnangara Mound. As such it is seen as a potential source of water, and the Water Corporation of Western Australia currently extracts about 45 gigalitres per year from the aquifer. One cubic kilometre is equivalent to 1000 GL. Ultimately the Yaragadee Aquifer is replenished by rainfall. This recharging is usually where there are outcroppings near other aquifers like the Leederville Aquifer. There are also outcrops near the surface in the vicinity of the Blackwood River. Current models estimate this recharge at about 280 to 340 GL per year. This groundwater can remain in the aquifer for many years; in some areas the age of the groundwater is over 30,000 years. Geologically, the aquifer is part of what is known as the Yarragadee Formation, which is a relatively thick geological unit in the Perth Basin. Formed during the Jurassic Period, the Yarragadee Formation is composed primarily of non-marine fluviatile feldspathic, poorly sorted sandstones which are porous and poorly cemented, hence allowing for considerable groundwater reserves. It grades from a shale-siltstone dominated base to a cleaner sandstone in the upper portions of the formation, probably representing increased subsidence or filling of the basin during the late Jurassic. The Dalkeith Hot Pool was formed by water from the Yarragadee Aquifer.

He was the \\"right- hand\\" of his father before, during and after the Iranian Revolution. He was a link between Ruhollah Khomeini and officials and people. He had several decision-making positions. He died of heart disease and was buried next to his father. Early life and education Ahmad Khomeini was born in Qom on 15 March 1946, where he did his primary and secondary education in Owhadi and Hakin Nezami school, respectively. and then started seminary studies and accomplished primary and secondary hawza courses. He secretly joined his father, Ruhollah Khomeini, after his father was exiled to Najaf. Career and activities Ahmad was regarded as Khomeini's \\"right-hand man\\", the \\"torch- bearer for his father's anti-Western radicalism\\" and was close to his father, the leader of the Iranian Revolution of 1979. He helped coordinate affairs during and after the Iranian Revolution, in Khomeini's office in Najaf, Paris and subsequent to the ayatollah's return to Iran in February 1979.Sayyed Ahmad Khomeini, IRIB. He used to visit the deprived areas to learn their shortages and reported his findings to Imam Khomeini. His letters containing the issues he had encountered is available. He was among the officials went through Fatah training. His political life career commenced after death of his brother, Mostafa. In the 6 years after the death of his father, he had several decision-making positions. He served as his father's chief of staff until his father's death in 1989. From the summer of 1988 to 1989, death of Khomeini, he was one of the decision-makers in all official issues along with Rafsanjani and Khamenei. He was a member of Iran's Supreme National Security Council without assuming any executive position. He was a member of Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution by Ali Khamenei's official order. He became the overseer of the Mausoleum of Khomeini. He spoke against America, Israel and what he called \\"exploitative Iranian capitalists,\\" on several occasions. =During hostage crisis= During the Iran hostage crisis, he had a \\"prominent role\\" and made \\"tough anti-American statements\\". According to the hostages, after Ahmad's visit to the then taken over embassy, he greeted the students and congratulated them for their action. Emphasizing on that some of the hostages were CIA agents based on the discovered documents, he repeated his father's threat \\"to put some of the captives on trial for spying\\" if the recently toppled Shah was \\"not returned to Iran.\\" =During Iran-Iraq war= During the war, he had an important role reporting government general issues to his father and relaying the Imam's messages to officials and others. He also used to act as counsel for his father and other high-ranking officials. =Letter to Ayatollah Montazeri= On 29 April 1989, Ahmad Khomeini wrote a \\"more than three pages\\" letter addressing Ayatollah Monatzeri saying that he was regretful for Monatzeri's being heedless of \\"Imam's calls.\\" Producing a list of accusations, Ahmad Khomeini tried to show that Montazeri's leadership would be harmful to the revolution. \\"Was it not because of your affection for Mehdi Hashemi that you created so many problems for Islam and the revolution?\\" said Ahmad Khomeini in a part of the letter. In response, Montazeri defended Mehdi Hashemi, an Iranian Shia cleric who was defrocked later, and said that he would \\"stay away from politics.\\" Personal life His wife was Fatemeh Soltani Tabatabai, daughter of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Bagher Soltani Tabatabai Borujerdi, niece of Imam Musa Sadr, the Shia religious leader of Lebanon. She was also the sister of Sadegh Tabatabai. Death According to pro-government media, Ahmad Khomeini suffered a cardiac arrest on 12 March 1995, and went into a coma. He died five days later, on 17 March 1995, hours after being connected to life support machinery. Iran government announced two days of national mourning after Ahmad Khomeini's death. Ahmad Khomeini is entombed next to his father in a grand shrine south of Tehran, where his son, Hassan Khomeini, is the superintendent. At least one author regarded his death as suspicious, stating that \\"he died in his sleep\\", without mentioning the heart attack five days prior and subsequent coma. According to Assembly of the Forces of Imam's Line, the Tehran times reported that the rumors regarding Ahmad Khomeini's death was originally published by Alireza Nourizadeh, an alleged \\"British spy\\" according to the government. Under duress, his son, Hassan Khomeini \\"confirmed\\" this, calling the rumors \\"baseless\\" and repeated the claim that they were created by a \\"British spy\\". However, non-government sources claim that Ahmad Khomeini was indeed killed after falling foul of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the then president, Hashemi Rafsanjani. On multiple occasions, Hassan Khomeini himself publicly claimed that his father was poisoned by the Iranian intelligence agents with the help of pills that his father had received at the hospital. Reception Ahmads's father, Ruhollah, described him as such: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Current supreme leader of Iran, described him as who solved many problems and did many things throughout the revolution. Khamenei called him capable and a unique and necessary element besides Khomeini. According to Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani, Ahmad was a strong column, a capable arm for the government, supreme leader and the officials.

He married Catherine, daughter of John Rochfort, and had at least nine children. Plunkett was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Louth in 1541, one of six new peerages created at the time: among the others were Baron Dunboyne, and Baron Upper Ossory. This was part of a calculated policy of King Henry VIII, on the advice of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Anthony St Leger, that the loyalty of the Anglo-Irish nobility could be better secured by \\"small gifts and honest persuasion rather than rigor\\". The policy was successful, at least as regards the Plunketts, who were noted in later generations for their loyalty to the English Crown. He died in circa 1555 and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son Thomas. References *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition).

It is not part of the Anglican Communion. The UECNA describes itself as \\"embracing the broad base of ceremonial practice inherent in the Historic Anglican Communion\\"The United Episcopal Church - An Introduction (UECNA 1990, rev. 2013) although historically the UECNA has tended to be low or broad church in its ceremonial practice. The UECNA uses the 1928 Book of Common Prayer in the US and, in Canada, the 1962 edition of the Canadian Prayer Book. Use of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer is also permitted. The changes in The Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada that the UECNA and other continuing churches objected to include the theology of the newer versions of the Book of Common Prayer such as The Episcopal Church's 1979 edition, the ordination of women, attitudes toward divorce and abortion, and differing interpretations of how the authority of scripture is perceived. They also object to more recent innovations such as the ordination of openly homosexual clergy, but these were not at issue when they broke with the Episcopal Church. History =Founding= The origins of the United Episcopal Church of North America lie with the Congress of St. Louis in September 1977, and with Charles D. D. Doren, the first bishop consecrated for the Anglican Church of North America (Episcopal) ‚Äì later called the Anglican Catholic Church. Doren had been elected bishop of the Diocese of the Midwest immediately following the St. Louis meeting, and was consecrated on 28 January 1978 by Albert A. Chambers, acting bishop of the ACNA(E), and Francisco Pagtakhan. Letters of consent were received from bishops Mark Pae of Taejon, Korea, and Charles Boynton, formerly Assistant Bishop of New York. He was translated to the Diocese of the Mid- Atlantic states in 1979, but he soon backed away from active participation in the Anglican Catholic Church. He was alienated by the numerous constitution and canonical revisions undertaken in 1978-1981 and by the \\"stained glass ceiling\\" which kept Low Church clergy out of the episcopate. He finally resigned his diocese at the end of 1980. Parallel to Doren's departure from active episcopal ministry in the ACC, three parishes sympathetic to Doren's concerns left the Anglican Catholic Church, and set about the task of forming a new body. This led to the creation of the United Episcopal Church of North America at a meeting held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in October 1981. The standing committee of the new jurisdiction invited Doren to be its first bishop and, subsequently, the first archbishop. In more recent years, the church has described itself as representing the Broad/Central and Low Church traditions, but it also has one or two parishes from the Anglo-Catholic tradition. The church's constitution and canons are modeled on the PECUSA's 1958 code with some amendments, including provisions for the establishment of dioceses in Canada, and more specific direction is given as to the circumstances in which the jurisdiction will consecrate bishops for overseas. The last major revision of the UECNA canons was made in 1992/1996 with minor amendments being made in 2011 and 2014, and a more significant revision in 2017. Under the leadership of archbishops Doren (1981‚Äì1987) and Knight (1987‚Äì1992), the UECNA grew to almost forty congregations. In 1988‚Äì1990 these were divided between the Diocese of the Ohio Valley and at least three missionary districts - West, South and East. So far this has represented the high-water mark of the church's prosperity. The UECNA underwent a protracted decline during the early 1990s due to the illness and increasing incapacity of the then presiding bishop, John Cyrus Gramley (South 1985‚Äì1996; Presiding Bishop 1992‚Äì1996), whose health started to decline shortly after his election. When the summons to General Convention was issued in 1996 only seven parishes responded. The Fifth General Convention then proceeded to place the missionary districts into suspension and the church was administered as a single diocese from then until April 2010. Stephen C. Reber Sr. was elected as bishop- coadjutor and consecrated in September 1996 by bishops Robert C. Harvey, assisted by bishops Miller, Hamers, Gramley, and Caudill. Gramley died shortly thereafter. During the late 1990s, Reber traveled many thousands of miles reactivating old UECNA parishes and receiving new congregations into the jurisdiction. He continued the policy, started by Knight, of relaxing the aggressively low church stance of the jurisdiction allowing the range of churchmanship within the United Episcopal Church to broaden. However, unlike the ACC and APCK, the UECNA still requires that, in addition to the Scriptures and the Book of Common Prayer, candidates for the ministry to assent to the Thirty-nine Articles. In 1999 the UECNA entered into a short-lived intercommunion agreement with the Anglican Province of America, causing the ACC to suspend its intercommunion agreement with the UECNA. However, that action was not mirrored by the Anglican Province of Christ the King. The UECNA subsequently suspended its intercommunion agreement with the Anglican Province in America in 2002 when the latter entered into a relationship with the Reformed Episcopal Church. In 2007, intercommunion with the ACC was restored after a lapse of eight years, so that the UECNA now has cordial relations with both the ACC and the APCK.Excerpts from the website of the UECNA From 2007 to 2011, the ACC and the UECNA explored opportunities for greater cooperation and the possibility of achieving organic unity. Bishop Presley Hutchens of the ACC addressed delegates to the UECNA convention of 2008 and discussed the possibility of uniting the ACC and UECNA.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ViHz7oPK60&NR;=1 Youtube video of the Convention Although well received at the time, there was a feeling among many of the delegates that the proposal was being rushed, and that no proper consideration was being given to the theological, constitutional and canonical issues thrown up by the move. Moves towards unity with the Anglican Catholic Church were referred for further discussion and subsequently stalled. At the 2008 General Convention, the delegates elected three suffragan bishops with the intention that they would serve the UECNA and also assist the ACC and APCK when requested. Two of them subsequently departed the UECNA for the Reformed Episcopal Church, leaving Peter D. Robinson as the sole suffragan bishop in UECNA until his appointment as Bishop of the Missionary District of the West in November, 2009. Robinson was named as Archbishop Coadjutor by the National Council in April 2010 to succeeded Stephen C. Reber upon his retirement on September 6, 2010. He was elected as Presiding Bishop by the 10th General Convention, held in Heber Springs, AR, on May 12, 2011. Under Robinson's leadership, the UECNA has returned to a 'Classical Anglican' position emphasizing its continuity with the old Protestant Episcopal Church and the English Reformation. In July, 2014, a small continuing Anglican jurisdiction, the Diocese of the Great Lakes, under Bishop David Hustwick, joined the UECNA as its diocese for the Great Lakes states and eastern Canada. In January, 2015, a petition was received from Bishop George Conner of the Anglican Episcopal Church at the behest of that jurisdiction's standing committee asking for admission as a non-geographical diocese of the UECNA. This was granted on February 11, 2015. In mid-2017, there were 26 UECNA congregations in 12 states, including Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia. The UECNA also has clergy in Canada. As of March 2017, the headquarters of the jurisdiction were transferred to Waynesboro, Virginia. =Episcopate= The UECNA traces its historic episcopate from the Church of England as follows: * John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury, who, assisted by the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Bath and Wells, did consecrate on 7 February 1787 * William White, as first Bishop of Pennsylvania, and 1st and 4th Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, who in 1832 consecrated * John Henry Hopkins, as first Bishop of Vermont and subsequently Presiding Bishop, who in 1867 did consecrate * Daniel S. Tuttle, as first Missionary Bishop of Montana, who in 1911, as Presiding Bishop did consecrate * James DeWolf Perry, as seventh Bishop of Rhode Island, who in 1930, as 18th Presiding Bishop did consecrate * Henry Knox Sherrill, as eighth Bishop of Massachusetts, who in 1950, as 20th Presiding Bishop did consecrate * Arthur C. Lichtenberger, as ninth Bishop of Missouri, who whilst 21st Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and assisted by Horace Donegan, Bishop of New York and Reginald Mallet, Bishop of Northern Indiana, consecrated (1962) * Albert A. Chambers, as Bishop of Springfield, who in 1978, as acting Primate of the Anglican Church of North America (Episcopal), and assisted by Francisco Pagtakhan, and Charles D. D. Doren (later Abp. I of the UECNA) consecrated http://www.anglicancatholic.org - Chambers Succession * James Orin Mote, as first Bishop of the Diocese of the Holy Trinity, who assisted by Bishops Burns, Lewis, and Rutherfoord, consecrated (1980)ACC Website; Chambers Succession * Robert Condit Harvey, as first Bishop of the Southwest in the Anglican Catholic Church, who in 1996, assisted by Bishops Ogden Miller, Edwin Caudill, John Hamers, and John Gramley (Presiding Bishop III UECNA), did consecrate,The UECNA records preserve the program for Reber's consecration, which names Harvey as the principal consecrator. * Stephen C. Reber Bishop- coadjutor of the UECNA, and subsequently IV Presiding bishop of UECNA, who assisted by William Wiygul, Bishop of the Southeastern States (APCK) and D. Presley Hutchens, Bishop of New Orleans (ACC), on 10 January 2009 consecrated,UECNA records * Peter D. Robinson, as a suffragan bishop in the UECNA, who subsequently became II Bishop of the Missionary District of the West, and V Presiding Bishop of the UECNA. From the Scottish Episcopal Church the line is as follows: * On November 14, 1784, the bishops Robert Kilgour, Arthur Petrie, and John Skinner (bishop) consecrated * Samuel Seabury as first Bishop of Connecticut, who in 1792 was one of the consecrators of * Thomas John Claggett, first Bishop of Maryland, who in 1796 was one of the consecrators for * Edward Bass, first bishop of Massachusetts, who in 1797 was one of the consecrators of * Abraham Jarvis, second Bishop of Connecticut, who in 1811 was one of the co-consecrators of * Alexander Viets Griswold as Bishop of the Eastern Diocese, who in 1836 was one of the co-consecrators of John Henry Hopkins, first Bishop of Vermont, thus uniting in himself the two historical lines of apostolic succession to the episcopate. Intercommunion agreements The UECNA has effected intercommunion agreements with a number of other Continuing Anglican churches. Those presently in effect are with: *Anglican Catholic Church,http://www.anglicancatholic.org/acc-uec.html *Anglican Province of Christ the King * The UECNA formerly had an intercommunion agreement with the Diocese of the Great Lakes but the DGL voted to become a diocese of the UECNA on July 19, 2014. Governance =Dioceses and missionary districts= The United Episcopal Church is divided into the Diocese of the Great Lakes, the Anglican Episcopal Church (a non-geographical diocese), and three missionary districts/dioceses‚Äîthe West, consisting of churches in Arizona and California; the South and Ozarks, consisting of churches in Missouri, Arkansas, western Kentucky, and Alabama; and the East, consisting of churches in Florida, eastern Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. These are governed on a day-to-day basis by missionary bishops appointed by the National Council who act in concert with the Council of Advice (standing committee) and the Diocesan Convention or Convocation. Convocations consist of every cleric in good standing and canonically resident within the missionary district, plus lay delegates from each congregation. District convocations are unicameral, and are responsible for general policy within each district, including the allocation of funds received from the National Council. =General Convention= The General Convention meets every third year, and consists of two houses. The Upper House The upper house of General Convention is the House of Bishops which consists of all UECNA bishops in good standing. It meets under the chairmanship of the Presiding Bishop, and has the power to nominate bishops for missionary dioceses, to take order for the administration of vacant dioceses and missionary districts, and to set policy with regard to ordination and other related matters. Unlike the House of Deputies it customarily meets annually on the second Thursday of May to discuss matters of mutual concern between meetings of the General Convention. At present its membership consists of * Peter D. Robinson, who is Presiding Bishop of the UECNA and Missionary Bishop of the East. * George Conner, Bishop of the Anglican Episcopal Church, formerly Rector of St. Bede's Anglican Church, Tucson, AZ. * Glen Hartley, Retired Missionary Bishop of the South and Ozarks, and Rector of St Francis Anglican Church, Ava, MO * David Hustwick, Bishop of the Diocese of the Great Lakes, and Rector of St Andrew and St Matthias, Hastings, MI * Steven Murrell, Episcopal Visitor, Missionary Diocese of the South and Ozarks (former Presiding Bishop of the Primitive Episcopal Church) * John Pafford, Suffragan Bishop of the Diocese of the Great Lakes * Stephen C. Reber, Archbishop Emeritus of the UECNA * Jackson Worsham Jr., Bishop Emeritus of the Diocese of the Great Lakes The Lower House The House of Deputies is the lower house of the General Convention. The House of Deputies has a president, who is usually a priest. The present holder of this office is Wayne Ogg, Priest-in-Charge of Grace Anglican Church, Wildwood, Florida. The lower house elects the president, treasurer, and secretary of the General Convention who continue in office until the commencement of the next convention. Observers Bishops of the Anglican Catholic Church and the Anglican Province of Christ the King may sit in the UECNA House of Bishops and have voice but not vote. General Rules of Convention Business may be originated in either house of General Convention, though the budget customarily commences in the House of Deputies, and canon changes in the House of Bishops. After a first reading it passes to the other house of the General Convention for review and approval. If amendments are made it must be approved and returned to the originating house and be approved as amended before going to the Presiding Bishop for signature. Consideration is being given to amending the Canons to allow the two Houses of General Convention to meet in joint session, but voting will still be by Houses. =Presiding Bishop= The Presiding Bishop is elected by the General Convention, takes office on the 15th November following his predecessors retirement, and serves until the 14th November following his 72nd birthday; his successor having been elected at the previous General Convention. In the event of an unexpected vacancy, the senior bishop by date of consecration who has jurisdiction acts as Presiding Bishop until the next General Convention. The Presiding Bishop is assigned the following duties \\"to preside over meetings of the House of Bishops... ; take order for the consecration of bishops, duly elected; ...and perform such other duties as shall be assigned to him by the General Convention.\\" (UECNA Canon 3) By custom, he administers vacant dioceses and missionary districts on behalf of the House of Bishops. The present incumbent is Peter D. Robinson, who was born in 1969 in Scunthorpe and grew up in nearby Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, England. Educated at York St. John University attended the Anglican Catholic Church's Holyrood Seminary prior to ordination in 1994. He was consecrated as a suffragan Bishop in 2009, and has served as the UECNA's Presiding Bishop since September, 2010. He also serves as Missionary Bishop of the East, and Vicar of Good Shepherd Anglican Church, Waynesboro, VA. =National Council= The National Council is composed of the Presiding Bishop, two other bishops, three priests, six laypersons, and two representative of UECW. The bishops are elected by the House of Bishops, the clergy and lay members are elected members by the House of Deputies, and the two representatives of UECW by their triennial meeting. The National Council meets regularly each year, usually in mid-May, and at the end of General Convention when it meets. The Presiding Bishop has the authority to convene special meetings should circumstances so require. The canons describe the functions of the National Council as being to coordinate the church's social work, missions, and publicity, but over time it has become a sounding board for the House of Bishops assisting them in their administration of the church between general conventions. Bishop Peter D. Robinson has suggested that it may be time to redefine the role of the National Council, and rename it the \\"Administrative or Executive Council\\" and formalize its expanded purpose. Doctrine The doctrinal position of the United Episcopal Church is defined by the Preface to the Constitution of the UECNA and the Declaration of Conformity contained in Article VIII of the UECNA Constitution. This centers the Church's doctrine firmly in the 'Classical Anglicanism' tradition as contained in the historic formularies of the Church: the Thirty-nine Articles and the Book of Common Prayer. These, in turn, refer back to the inerrant Holy Scriptures and the Ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church, as well as to the \\"New Learning\\" of the Reformation era. The UECNA is wary of nineteenth and early twentieth century movements, such as Fundamentalism and Dispensationalism, which are at odds with historic Christian theology. The UECNA considers the Affirmation of St. Louis to be one of its founding documents but considers it to be a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, older statements such as the Articles of Religion, the Homilies, and the Book of Common Prayer. The UECNA accepts the Affirmation of St. Louis as a response to the theological and moral crisis in The Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada in the early 1970s, and as a call to action on the part of orthodox Episcopalians to preserve the traditional teaching and worship of the Church. In ceremonial matters, the present Presiding Bishop, Peter D. Robinson, points outs that the UECNA has a greater diversity of churchmanship and ceremonial practice than it did in the 1980s. However, the church is very insistent that ceremonial use conform to traditional Anglican or Episcopalian customs. Historically, the minimum of vestments required for services in parish churches is surplice and tippet (rochet, chimere and tippet for bishops.) At the other extreme, the 1559 Ornaments Rubric represents the maximum of vesture and ornament contemplated by the compilers of the BCP. Most parishes are Broad Church. Ordination and lay leadership An Anglican altar The UECNA's leadership is divided among lay leaders and ordained ministers as follows: =Lay ministry= *Lay reader - a layman licensed by the bishop of the diocese to read Morning and Evening Prayer, the Litany, and the Penitential Office, as well as the Burial Office. He is expected to have a good knowledge of Holy Scripture, and some knowledge of theology, so as to be able to answer questions from lay members of the church, and lead Bible studies. *Diocesan reader - a layman who has already served as a lay reader, has completed a formal course of theology and is licensed to preach sermons of his own composition. *Deaconess - the canons of the UECNA make provision for deaconesses to be \\"set aside\\" but not ordained. The order is open to women over the age of 25 who meet the same criteria as men entering the diaconate. Their training is similar to that of deacons, but with less emphasis on liturgy, and a particular focus on pastoral and educational work. =Clerical state= * Postulants are students for holy orders but not yet ordained. However, under canon law, they are regarded as having entered the clerical state, and may not be vestrymen or churchwardens. They are usually expected to serve as lay readers and diocesan readers whilst in training. A postulant must complete not less than one year of study consisting of Church history, pastoral work, liturgics, doctrine and holy scripture before being admitted as a candidate for holy orders. He assists the local parish as a layreader in the offices of the church as called upon and allowed by the canons of the church. * Candidates for holy orders are those students who are sufficiently advanced in their studies that their ordination to the diaconate is expected within the next year. They are expected to function as diocesan readers during the period of their candidacy, preaching under supervision, and assisting the clergy in the conduct of divine worship. *Deacons -- a deacon may be either permanent or transitional, though the UECNA makes no formal distinction between the two. Permanent deacons are those deacons who have decided not to study for the presbyterate, and therefore remain as deacons. Transitional deacons are training for priesthood. Before ordination to the priesthood, a deacon should serve for not less than one year and complete a course of study. *Priests -- priests or presbyters are ministers of word and sacrament who are authorized to undertake all ministerial functions except ordination and confirmation. In the UECNA only priests and bishops are allowed to be parish ministers. *Bishops -- bishops are \\"assigned a diocese consisting of a given number of parishes, and will provide regular oversight, counsel and guidance to those parishes. An Episcopal visit to each parish will be made not less than once in three years and attendance at national councils and meetings as called.\\" =Lay leadership positions= In addition to Lay Readers and Diocesan Readers, the following lay ministries exist in the United Episcopal Church. * Vestryman -- every parish has an elected council consisting of between five and thirteen members of the laity. Vestrymen are expected to be communicant members of the church, over the age of 18. Their function is to maintain and administer the physical plant of the local parish, and to advise the rector concerning mission, and parish affairs. Although the traditional term 'vestryman' is used the position is open to both men and women. * Senior (Rector's) and Junior (Peoples') Wardens take leadership in the vestry and are responsible for relations between the Rector (Minister) and congregation in the case of the Senior Warden, and the maintenance of the parish buildings and plant in the case of the Junior Warden. * Each parish is free to create such lay ministries as it may require provided that it has the approval of the bishop for so doing. These ministries may include District Visitors who are appointed by the Rector and Vestry to oversee communicant members of the church; Sunday school teachers and superintendents who undertake to train the children of the parish in Holy Scripture and the teachings of the Church. =United Episcopal Church Women= The UECW is an official organization of women who serve the church. Their particular focus is to raise funds for the missionary work of the Church. The work of UECW is coordinated by an Executive Council which is elected at the UECW Triennial Meeting which occurs during the General Convention week. Publications *Glad Tidings.

The Catalogue interface is available in twelve languages and is used by research scientists, citizen scientists, educators, and policy makers. The Catalogue is also used by the Biodiversity Heritage Library, the Barcode of Life Data System, Encyclopedia of Life, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The Catalogue currently compiles data from 168 peer- reviewed taxonomic databases, that are maintained by specialist institutions around the world. , the Catalogue lists 1,837,565 of the world's 2.2m extant species known to taxonomists on the planet at present time. Structure The Catalogue of Life employs a simple data structure to provide information on synonymy, grouping within a taxonomic hierarchy, common names, distribution and ecological environment. The Catalogue provides a dynamic edition, which is updated monthly (and in which data can change without tracking of those changes) and an Annual Checklist, which provides a dated, verifiable reference for the usage of names and associated data.

In the same year, the Catalogue of Life, Barcode of Life Data System, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Encyclopedia of Life, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility met to consider building a single shared authoritative nomenclature and taxonomic foundation \\"Catalogue of Life Plus\\" that could be used to order and connect biodiversity data, including content not yet in CoL but available via other sources, to serve both the users of the present Catalogue and users of extended taxonomic content (such as GBIF) using a common infrastructure. COL+ will develop a clearinghouse covering scientific names across all life, provide a single taxonomic view, and provide an avenue for feedback from content authorities.

After Hattab was ousted from the organization in 2003, the group officially pledged support for al-Qaeda, and in January 2007, the group officially changed its name to the \\"Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb\\" (AQIM). History Hassan Hattab was a regional commander of Armed Islamic Group (GIA). He broke with the GIA in 1998, and formed the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), in protest over the GIA's massacre of civilians. After an amnesty in 1999, many former GIA fighters laid down their arms, but a few remained active, including members of the GSPC. In March 2001 the GSPC was declared a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. Estimates of the number of GSPC members vary widely, from a few hundred to as many as 4,000. In September 2003, it was reported that Hattab had been deposed as national emir of the GSPC and replaced by Nabil Sahraoui (Sheikh Abou Ibrahim Mustapha), a 39-year-old former GIA commander who was subsequently reported to have pledged GSPC's allegiance to al-Qaeda,Algerian group backs al-Qaeda, BBC News, 23 October 2003 a step which Hattab had opposed.Interview with the Former Leader of the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, Ash-Sharq al-Awsat, 17 October 2005 Following the death of Sahraoui in June 2004, Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud became the leader of the GSPC.Interview with Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud, commander of the GSPC , 26 September 2005 (globalterroralert.com website) (pdf) Abdelmadjid Dichou is also reported to have headed the group.\\"Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC)\\", Terrorist Organizations, World Statesman. Retrieved 8 September 2007. A splinter or separate branch of Hattab's group, the Free Salafist Group (GSL), headed by El Para, was linked to the kidnapping of 32 European tourists in Algeria in early 2003. Other sources illustrate the involvement of the Algerian intelligence services in exaggerating the claims about terrorist threats in the Sahara, and the supposed alliance between this group and Al-Qaeda. Some of the reputation of El Para is also attributed to the Algerian government, as a possible employer, and it has been alleged that certain key events, such as kidnappings, were staged, and that there was a campaign of deception and disinformation originated by the Algerian government and perpetuated by the media.El Para, the Maghreb‚Äôs Bin Laden ‚Äì who staged the tourist kidnappings? by Salima Mellah and Jean-Baptiste Rivoire, Le Monde Diplomatique, February 2005 By March 2005, it was reported that the GSPC \\"may be prepared to give up the armed struggle in Algeria and accept the government's reconciliation initiative.\\"Georges Rassi, \\"End of Insurgency\\", al-Mustaqbal, as reported in MidEast Mirror, 24 March 2005. Quoted in Islamist Terrorism in the Sahel: Fact or Fiction? in March 2005, the group's former leader, Hassan Hattab, called on its members to accept a government amnesty under which they were offered immunity from prosecution in return for laying down their arms.Top Algerian Islamist slams Qaeda group, urges peace, Reuters, 30 March 2006 However, in September 2006, the top Al-Qaida leader Ayman al- Zawahri announced a \\"blessed union\\" between the groups in declaring France an enemy.

Algerian officials and authorities from neighbouring countries have speculated that the GSPC may have been active outside Algeria. These activities may relate to the GSPC's alleged long-standing involvement with smuggling, protection rackets, and money laundering across the borders of Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Libya and Chad, possibly to underpin the group's finances. However, recent developments seem to indicate that a splinter group may have sought refuge in the Tuareg regions of northern Mali and Niger following crackdowns by Algerian government forces in the north and south of the country since 2003. French secret services report that the group has received funding from the country of Qatar.Deep Read: Malian tinderbox ‚Äì A dangerous puzzle. 9 July 2012. Some observers, including Jeremy Keenan, have voiced doubts regarding the GSPC's capacity to carry out large-scale attacks, such as the one attributed to it in northeastern Mauritania during the \\"Flintlock 2005\\" military exercise.US targets Sahara 'terrorist haven', BBC News, 8 August 2005 They suspect the involvement of Algeria's Department of Intelligence and Security is an effort to improve Algeria's international standing as a credible partner in the War on Terrorism, and to lure the United States into the region. Allegations of GSPC links to al-Qaeda predate the September 11 attacks. As followers of a Qutbist strand of Salafist jihadism, the members of the GSPC are thought to share al-Qaeda's general ideological outlook. After the deposition of Hassan Hattab, various leaders of the group pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. Some observers have argued that the GSPC's connection to al-Qaeda was merely opportunistic, not operational. Claims of GSPC activities in ItalyGSPC in Italy: The Forward Base of Jihad in Europe by Kathryn Haar, Jamestown Foundation, 9 February 2006) were disputed by other sources, who said that there is no evidence of any engagement in terrorist activities against US, European or Israeli targets: \\"While the GSPC ... established support networks in Europe and elsewhere, these have been limited to ancillary functions (logistics, fund-raising, propaganda), not acts of terrorism or other violence outside Algeria.\\" Investigations in France and Britain have concluded that young Algerian immigrants sympathetic to the GSPC or al-Qaeda have taken up the name without any real connection to either group. Similar claims of links between the GSPC and Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in Iraq\\"'The Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb': The Evolving Terrorist Presence in North Africa\\", Inquiry and Analysis, Middle East Media Research Institute, 7 March 2007. Retrieved 8 September 2007. were based on purported letters to Zarqawi by GSPC leader Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud.Algerian terror group seeks Zarqawi's help, UPI 2 May 2006 In a September 2005 interview, Wadoud hailed Zarqawi's actions in Iraq. Like the GSPC's earlier public claims of allegiance to al-Qaeda, they are thought to be opportunistic legitimisation efforts of the GSPC's leaders due to the lack of representation in Algeria's political sphere.

At present, the building houses the Park Avenue Christian Church (The Park) congregation of the Disciples of Christ, and United Church of Christ, which also routinely shares its facilities and cosponsors interfaith events with the Reform Temple of Universal Judaism (TUJ), also known as Congregation Da'at Elohim. The Rev. Kaji S. Dou≈°a has served as Senior Pastor since 2016. She is the first woman called to this role and the second African-American after the Rev. Alvin Jackson, Pastor Emeritus. Architecture In 1911, the original owners, the South Dutch Reformed Church, commissioned the firm of Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson, to design the Park Avenue sanctuary. Their designer, English architect William Heywood, was clearly inspired by the features of La Sainte- Chapelle in Paris, which were translated into the stately proportions and the slender 70-foot spire (fl√®che) of its New York counterpart. Buttresses enabled the building to stand without any steel girding. The east stained glass window was designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany for the South Reformed Church's previous location at 38th Street and Madison Avenue, then re-installed here. The other stained glass is the work of Tiffany's one-time employee, artist and businesswoman Mary Elizabeth Tillinghast.pg. 94, After passing through the hands of the Park Avenue Presbyterian Church, the building was finally acquired in 1945 by the Christian Church. The original rectory was replaced in 1963 by a much larger five storey facility which in addition to church facilities also houses the church's day school. A 56-rank organ, built by Holtkamp, was installed in 1982. Major restoration of the sanctuary building was completed in 1993. The building is an architectural \\"landmark\\" of New York City. History The Park traces its descent from a group called \\"the Disciples of Christ\\", formed by nine former members of the Ebenezer Church of New York City in 1810, out of a \\"fervent desire to embrace a pure and simple understanding of church life as found in the New Testament.\\" Beginning with its participation in the movement to abolish slavery during the 19th century, the Church has espoused an ethical commitment to pursue social justice. One of its current emphases is a commitment to diversity, using the phrase ‚ÄúDivinity of Diversity‚Äù as a touchstone statement for this commitment. The Park‚Äôs commitment to justice includes deconstruction of systems of oppression such as white supremacy, xenophobia, sexism, and includes helping to increase the number of Open and Affirming congregations and to eliminate bias regarding sexual orientation. The congregation continues to be committed to the ecumenical movement for Christian unity, community service, interfaith acceptance, peacemaking and a major involvement in the arts, especially music. Since 1989 the church has sponsored a Saturday Lunch Program for the hungry and/or homeless in its facilities. In 2010, The Park became a dually affiliated denomination with both the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ. In 2016, the park called its first female Senior Minister, The Rev. Kaji Dou≈°a. Temple of Universal Judaism TUJ was founded in 1974 by Rabbi Roy A. Rosenberg as a haven for interfaith couples and families, while also welcoming Jews from other backgrounds, as well as non-Jews interested in Judaism. The congregation holds services once a month and on Jewish holidays. As an example of its efforts to follow the imperative of tikkun olam (\\"repairing the world\\") through social action and interfaith cooperation, TUJ holds various events together with The Park, such as the joint annual commemoration in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., and his friend in the Civil Rights Movement, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel.

Jesus: Reborn on Earth to play his part in Armageddon, and becomes Danny's best friend (despite the eternal rivalry of their families from Heaven and Hell). He has refused to do anymore of God's bidding and started a Peace movement to protest the War In Iraq. Unfortunately he fell victim to police brutality and went into a coma for several years. He came out mildly brain-damaged, though he has recently been seen to making a recovery. He was seen explaining socialism and capitalism to 'Fuck Nose' and why one might seem to work while the other doesn't. Jimmy: A talking rabbit. One of Danny's few friends. He tends to torment people online, notably Star Wars fans. In the first issue, while explaining his powers, Danny says he doesn't know why he decided to make a talking rabbit. Pope Jacko: The Pope of the Catholic Church. Australian and wishes to use the forthcoming end of the world to his own advantage. Was chosen only because the other candidate was black. Breaks the traditional vow of celibacy by, among many other deviant sexual acts, being done up the arse by a nun (who is actually the Devil in disguise) with a strap-on. In the \\"Last Enemy\\" one-shot, he sends Brother One to retrieve Jesus in order to help cure him of AIDS. When this plan fails, he dies, and is supposedly taken to Hell by a demon posing as one of his aides. Fuck Nose: A bartender at Danny's favorite watering hole, \\"J. Smith's\\". He makes fun of Jay's condition, so Danny switches his penis with his nose. At the end of the first series, Danny 'fixes' things, but the end result is the man's head now resembles the tip of his penis. In the sequel to the first series, Danny restores the man to normal. His real name is Cedric. Frank Hardy and Nick Puglio: The creative duo behind many of Danny's productions, Frank and Nick have conflicting personalities but work well together. Frank is soft- spoken and polite, Nick belligerent and short-tempered. Their credits include \\"I Fucked the President's Wife\\". The Devil: Danny's father and the ruler of Hell. He is trying to convince Danny to start the Apocalypse. Brother One: Also known as the Killer Eunuch (for rather disgusting reasons), he is an assassin sent by the Vatican to retrieve Jesus in the \\"Last Enemy\\" one shot. He wields a pair of holy daggers, able to harm Danny. After accosting Jesus and Jimmy at J. Smith's, he follows the two to Wormwood's office, where he is killed when Danny launches him out of a window.

His work spanned different fields such as art designer in movies or music and he was mainly known for writing and directing the film Arrebato (Rapture), and for designing the posters and promotion of Pedro Almod√≥var's first movies.  Biography  = Childhood and early career = Iv√°n Zulueta was born Juan Ricardo Miguel due to the Russian origin of that name, which was not allowed by anti-communist Franco's Spanish State, in San Sebasti√°n, Basque Country, Spain. His family was wealthy: his father‚Äôs family had had sugar factories in Cuba for generations. His father was a lawyer; even though he combined his job with other activities, such as director of the San Sebastian Film Festival. His mother was a painter, even though not professionally. Hence, Ivan was surrounded by the arts from an early age. Zulueta moved to Madrid in 1960 and enrolled in decoration courses. At the end of 1963, he was offered the opportunity of traveling in a merchant vessel to New York City. There, he enrolled in Arts Students League for studying oil painting and advertising drawing. Zulueta discovered pop art, Nouvelle Vague, the New American Cinema and artists such as Jonas Mekas and John Cassavetes. Coming back to Madrid in 1964, Zulueta enrolled in the Spanish Cinema School. He directed a couple of shorts in 35 mm. The first one, called Agata, based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. And the second one, called Ida y Vuelta (Round Trip), based on a short story by William Jenkins. However, he did not get his degree and the School was closed by the Francoist State. Zulueta would not be allowed to sign his works until Franco died because of this. = Pop-art and psychedelic = In 1968, Jose Luis Borau, his teacher in the Film School, produced a TV show called Ultimo Grito (Latest Trends). The anchormen were Jose Maria Inigo and Judy Stephen. Ivan Zulueta directed the show. The production means and budget were low and therefore among the methodologies employed for this production was to have friends take on the different positions and creative capacities required for its realization. In 1969, Un, Dos, Tres, Al Escondite Ingl√©s (Hide and Seek) was produced. It was Jose Luis Borau‚Äôs first work as a producer of a full-length movie. The production was carried the same way as in the TV show Ultimo Grito. The film was a musical which made fun of Eurovision contest with a Richard Lester style. It was first released in Cannes Film Festival. = 70s: experimentation = Jose Luis Borau provided Zulueta with unused film from his newly created production company. Zulueta used it for experimenting mainly with tempo and editing. He also used other underground formats like 16mm or 8mm. Most of the time, the experimentation was related to re-filming preexisting material in other formats and rhythms. This visual style was very popular in those years, used by other directors and achieving a peak with the eminent Koyaanisqatsi (1983). At same time, Zulueta started a prolific career as poster designer. Ivan met Pedro Almod√≥var and helped him in his first underground short movies. Zulueta also worked as assistant director for other directors such as Jaime Chavarri or Antonio Drove. Ivan Zulueta proposed to hit other non-underground segments of the public by directing a short movie and releasing it. The result: Leo Es Pardo (Leo is Dark); a short movie recorded with a 16mm camera. It was released in the Berlin Film Festival. Then, Zulueta and his collaborators thought that they could try to put all this experimentation onto a full-length film released as a conventional movie‚Ä¶ = Arrebato (Rapture) = A Spanish architect interested in movies decided to help Zulueta financially. The planning was a 15-day filming. However, it was shot in real interiors owned by Zulueta and other friends, like Jaime Chavarri; and most of collaborators used drugs like heroin, that drove the planning and the budget to be highly increased. Pedro Almod√≥var dubbed one of the female characters, but he was not credited. The relationship between the director and the producer was poorly damaged. Moreover, the film had a lot of problems to be commercially released due to its experimental and underground style; even though the Spanish transition to democracy had already occurred. It was finally released in 1980. Ivan Zulueta was labeled as a problematic auteur and Arrebato became a cult movie. = 80s: silence = Finally, his heroin addiction forced him to retire temporarily. Living in San Sebasti√°n, he declined offers for new projects in filming industry. On the other hand, Zulueta continued with his career as poster designer. It is in these years when he produced his best known works for Pedro Almod√≥var, among others. He also started experimenting with photography. = The come-back: \\"P√°rpados\\" & \\"Ritesti\\" = At the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s, Zulueta directed a couple of episodes for two different TV serials. The first one, called ‚ÄúParpados‚Äù (‚ÄúEyelids‚Äù), was a love story between a couple of twins. The second one, called ‚ÄúRitesti‚Äù, was a horror story. Both were traced by Zulueta‚Äôs style, visual obsessions, circular screenplay, format mixing (film and video) and a fragmented editing which reminded some of David Lynch movies. = Latest years = By mid-90s, Zulueta came back to the silence. He continued his work designing posters. However, at the beginning of the 2000s, some personalities in the Spanish film industry rediscovered Zulueta‚Äôs early work: different expositions (paintings, posters and photography) were organized in different Spanish cities such as Madrid or Barcelona; his films were broadcast on TV and cinema again; his short movies were shown on film festivals and Arrebato was first launched on DVD. \\"Un, Dos, Tres, al Escondite Ingl√©s\\" was released on VHS and some of his experimental shorts were launched on a limited DVD release. His death was reported on 30 December 2009.  References  * Iv√°n Zulueta: la vanguardia frente al espejo, Carlos F. Heredero.

Subtitled as a cin√©po√©me, it features many techniques Man Ray used in his still photography (for which he is better known), including Rayographs, double exposure, soft focus and ambiguous features. Synopsis Emak-Bakia shows elements of fluid mechanical motion in parts, rotating artifacts showing his ideas of everyday objects being extended and rendered useless. Kiki of Montparnasse (Alice Prin) is shown driving a car in a scene through a town. Towards the middle of the film Jacques Rigaut appears dressed in female clothing and make-up. Later in the film a caption appears: \\"La raison de cette extravagance\\" (the reason for this extravagance). The film then cuts to a car arriving and a passenger leaving with briefcase entering a building, opening the case revealing men's shirt collars which he proceeds to tear in half. The collars are then used as a focus for the film, rotating through double exposures. Notes *The film features sculptures by Pablo Picasso, and some of Man Ray's mathematical objects both still and animated using a stop motion technique. *Originally a silent film, recent copies have been dubbed using music taken from Man Ray's personal record collection of the time. The musical reconstruction was by Jacques Guillot. *When the film was first exhibited, a man in the audience stood up to complain it was giving him a headache and hurting his eyes.

Situated near the Mulungushi River north of Kabwe, it was first used in 1958 for a rally of the Zambian African National Congress and then in 1960 for the first conference of the newly-formed United National Independence Party. Since 1964, it has been regularly used by political parties for their annual conventions and meetings. A national symbol, the Rock of Authority is called \\"the birthplace of Zambian independence\\". History Mulungushi Rock was first used for an October 26, 1958 rally of the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC) under the leadership of Kenneth Kaunda. When Kaunda and other nationalists broke away from the ZANC and launched their own political party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP), in 1960, they chose the isolated site to hold their first party conference where it would not draw the attention of the North Rhodesian authorities. The area was centrally located, however, enabling more participants to come from all parts of the country. Situated near the Mulungushi River approximately north of Broken Hill (later renamed Kabwe), the Rock could accommodate up to 2,000 people for outdoor speeches and for lodging in temporary shelters. The river guaranteed a water source for large crowds, as did a small dambo flowing from the north. The conference organizers received a permit to use the land but were not allowed to cut down trees or gather wood for fires; they were required to purchase wood from the Mpima Forestry Offices distant. More than 2,000 people attended that 1960 conference, which put the UNIP on the political map and helped it become the primary party in the Zambian independence movement. Joseph Katampi, party secretary from the Mkushi constituency, recalled in 2014: > \\"When we gathered at Mulungushi Rock, we resolved to take any course of > action by using any means to indicate our seriousness about independence to > the white government ... we resolved not to compromise with the British > government's interest of giving us the Macleod constitution but a > constitution that allowed for one man, one vote\\". After Zambia achieved independence in 1964, the UNIP staged its annual conference and other meetings at Mulungushi Rock, including the 1967 council meeting noted for Simon Kapwepwe's announcing his candidacy for vice-president of the party and Kaunda resigning from the party presidency for a few hours. The UNIP also used the site for major policy addresses, such as the Mulungushi Reforms of 1968 and a major land policy reform in 1975. According to O'Sullivan, the site began to be called the Rock of Authority \\"with the party's decisions handed down with quasi-divine authority as from an oracle\\". The Rock of Authority went on to become the venue for many other political events, including conventions of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy and the Patriotic Front. Labour groups also conduct conferences here. Since 2009, Mulungushi University has held its annual graduation ceremony at the Rock of Authority. Although the Rock is often said to be located in Kabwe, it is in fact located outside that city. In 1994 the Rock was incorporated into the Kapiri Mposhi District, as was nearby Mulungushi University. The Mulungushi River serves as the boundary between Kabwe and the Kapiri Mposhi District. Nearby facilities In 1972 the UNIP founded an institute for labour studies, the President's Citizens College, near the Rock of Authority. A branch of Mulungushi University was established a few kilometres away in January 2008. The university erected a commercial centre to accommodate groups indoors; most political conventions are now held there. The centre includes a conference room with capacity for 1,000 attendees, 21 chalet-style apartments, and a restaurant.

USFR is currently hosted by Tyne Morgan and is based in South Bend, Indiana, along with its daily companion series, AgDay. The program is owned by Farm Journal Media, a Philadelphia-based company that owns a number of agricultural media properties including Farm Journal magazine. Streaming full USFR episodes are available on the station's web site. Format Common topics covered on USFR include market forecasts for various agricultural commodities, weather, agricultural business profiles, and some environmental conservation. The U.S. Farm Report is commonly broadcast in the early mornings on Saturdays or Sundays, but some stations show the program at different times. Each week, two separate half-hour versions of USFR are produced, each with a different focus. Television stations can air either one of the half-hour shows as a stand-alone program or air both shows back-to-back as a single one-hour program. Most stations air the full-hour show.List of U.S. Farm Report affiliates The first half-hour is aimed at producers (particularly those who produce the \\"cash crops\\" of corn, wheat, and soybeans) and focuses heavily on agribusiness and the discussion of market futures, along with a precipitation forecast. The five segments consist of top stories with news anchor Scott Kinrade, two market-related discussion segments in a roundtable format with Agribusiness Director and Substitute Anchor Al Pell, a seven-day weather and climate forecast (geared at farmers and focusing on precipitation) with WNDU meteorologist Mike Hoffman, and commentary by former host John Phipps. The second half-hour is aimed at consumers, with stories on current events, discussion of agriculture-related consumer items, and rural life, as well as a more general national weather forecast. The five segments consist of top stories with Scott Kinrade/weather with Mike Hoffman, a feature story known as \\"Spirit of the Heartland\\", Machinery Minute, Tractor Tales/Country Church Salute, and responses to viewer mail. History USFR was founded in 1975 by longtime Tribune farm broadcaster Orion Samuelson, who produced and hosted it until 2005. At that time, the show changed its name to U.S. Farm Report - Town and Country Living, attempting to expand into such items as outdoor sports and recreation, but it soon reverted to its original title and format. Tribune acquired agricultural magazine Farm Journal in 1993; when Farm Journal was acquired by its management in 1997, Farm Journal Media became the new producer of USFR. USFR was distributed by Tribune Entertainment and carried on Superstation WGN until the end of 2007; at that time, Tribune Entertainment ceased operations, and Superstation WGN became WGN America, replacing the show with sitcom reruns; its time slot (Saturday at 6 a.m. Eastern) is currently held by Singsation!, another long-running WGN program that originally aired on Sundays. In 2009, RFD-TV picked up the show, and airs the program twice weekly, on Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoons. Orion Samuleson and Max Armstrong have had a longtime working relationship with RFD- TV even before the move of USFR. They now host a competing program with a similar format, This Week in Agribusiness, which airs on many of the same stations as USFR.

Bargh (; born 1955) is a social psychologist currently working at Yale University, where he has formed the Automaticity in Cognition, Motivation, and Evaluation (ACME) Laboratory. Bargh's work focuses on automaticity and unconscious processing as a method to better understand social behavior, as well as philosophical topics such as free will. Much of Bargh's work investigates whether behaviors thought to be under volitional control may result from automatic interpretations of and reactions to external stimuli, such as words. Bargh is particularly famous for his demonstrations of priming affecting action. One of the most well-known of these studies reported that reading words related to elderliness (e.g., \\"Florida\\", \\"Bingo\\") caused subjects to walk slower when exiting the laboratory, compared to subjects who read words unrelated to the elderly.J. A. Bargh, M. Chen and L. Burrows. (1996). Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, 230-244 Though cited more than 5,000 times,GoogleScholar, (2019). citations for Bargh et al, 2006 controversy has emerged because several recent studies failed to replicate the finding.S. Doyen, O. Klein, C. L. Pichon and A. Cleeremans. (2012). Behavioral priming: it's all in the mind, but whose mind? PLoS One, 7, e29081 Starting in 2013 and 2014, many additional reports began to emerge of failures to replicate findings from Bargh's lab. These included \\"social distance priming\\"H. Pashler, N. Coburn and C. R. Harris. (2012). Priming of social distance? Failure to replicate effects on social and food judgments. PLoS One, 7, e42510 and \\"achievement goal priming\\" and lonely people's preferences for hot baths. (However, in 2015 there was report, by Bargh and Shalev, of a successful replication of the association between loneliness and bathing habits, published in the journal Emotion, indicating a possible role for cultural differences in this case.) In March 2015 yet another paper from Bargh lab was reported to be unreproducible: Rotteveel and colleagues sought to duplicate two studies by Chen & Bargh (1999) arguing that objects are evaluated automatically, triggering a tendency to approach or avoid.  Education and academic career  Bargh was born in Champaign, Illinois. He attended the University of Illinois as an undergraduate, and the University of Michigan for post-graduate training under Robert Zajonc. He received his Ph.D. in 1981. That same year he was hired as an assistant professor at New York University, where he remained for 22 years. He has since been working at Yale where he has formed the Automaticity in Cognition, Motivation, and Evaluation (ACME) Laboratory.  Research  Bargh was influenced by the work of his PhD advisor at the University of Michigan, Robert Zajonc, who concentrated on the fundamental processes underlying behavior, including an emphasis on affect and cognition. Much of Zajonc's work touched upon processes that occur outside of awareness. Bargh's work in automaticity and unconscious processing further explores the extent to which information processing occurs outside of either intent or awareness. In contrast to Ellen Langer, who denigrated such mental processing as \\"mindless\\", Bargh followed the lead of William James in stating that automatized (or \\"habitualized\\" in James' terminology) processing can be a beneficial adaptation. Bargh's research focuses on the influence of environmental stimuli on perception and behavior, automatic activation, the effects of conscious and unconscious priming, the psychological effects of physiological stimuli, and implicit cognition. Bargh's concentration on the influence of unconscious and automatic behavior and cognition grows from a fundamental interest in the construct of 'free will.' = Influence of unconsciously perceived stimuli = Exposure to stimuli in the environment can influence how individuals make impressions of others. Bargh and Pietromonaco randomly assigned subjects to be exposed to words that were either related to hostility or were neutral. The words were presented outside of the subjects' conscious awareness. In a second task, all subjects were asked to read an ambiguous story about a man and rate him on various measures. Those subjects that were subliminally exposed to words related to hostility rated the man more negatively than those subjects in the control condition. = Automatic activation = Stimuli may be automatically evaluated in ways that affect behavior, an automatic evaluation. In a study conducted by Chen and Bargh, subjects were faster to pull a lever toward themselves (an approach tendency) when a word had a positive valence than a negative valence, and were similarly faster to push the lever away (an avoidance tendency) when the word had a negative valence compared to a positive valence. The \\"sequential evaluative priming paradigm\\" Fazio, R. H., Sanbonmatsu, D. M., Powell, M. C, & Kardes, F. R. (1986). On the automatic activation of attitudes. Journal ojPersonality and Social Psychology, 50, 229-238. refers to the related phenomenon of response times reducing when primed by stimuli with congruent valence. In an examination of the generality of the effects of this paradigm, Bargh, Chaiken, Govender and PrattoBargh, J. A., Chaiken, S., Govender, R., & Pratto, F. (1992). The generality of the automatic attitude activation effect. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62(6), 893-912. show that simply seeing or hearing mention of stimuli triggers automatically activated evaluations. This occurs even when the subject has not been asked to think about their evaluation of the stimulus beforehand. It was further shown that novel stimuli are automatically evaluated and produce the same effect as nonnovel stimuli: when positively valenced novel stimuli prime positively valenced targets, reaction time is faster.Duckworth, K. L., Bargh, J. A., Garcia, M., & Chaiken, S. (2001). The automatic evaluation of novel stimuli. Psychological Science. Stimuli presented outside of awareness have also been suggested to influence the interpretation of subsequent ambiguous and semantically-unrelated stimuli. Thus subjects asked to define homographs after being subliminally primed with positive, negative, or neutral valence words subsequently evaluated the valence of the ambiguous words with that of the prime. In Stereotype priming, subjects are primed with a stereotype or with people associated with those stereotypes. Subsequent behavior tends to be consistent with the stereotype. For instance, subjects primed with the concept of the elderly while doing a simple task, later walked more slowly when leaving the experiment than did subjects in the control group. Subjects that were primed with African American faces reacted with more hostility toward experimenters. (The first experiment in this paper primed the concept of politeness vs. rudeness (vs. a neutral control), and showed that people behaved in line with these primes afterward. These studies are small, though (e.g., Experiment 1: n=34).) The authors are clear in drawing a distinction between the priming used in these studies and the myth of subliminal messages. Whereas the latter were once thought to be able to influence people's behavior in a way out of line with the individual's intended behavior (i.e. to go buy a Pepsi while watching a movie), the automatic activation present in these studies was consistent with the activity at hand and therefore did not cause the subjects to alter their intended behavior. = Perception‚Äìbehavior link = The Chameleon Effect refers to the unconscious tendency to mimic others' behavior. Chartrand and Bargh discovered and named this effect after observing subjects unconsciously mimic confederates.Chartrand, T. L., & Bargh, J. A. (1999). The chameleon effect: The perception‚Äìbehavior link and social interaction. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76(6), 893-910. Subjects perform a task in which they work closely with a confederate that is trained to repeatedly engage in one of two behaviors: rubbing his or her face or jiggling a knee. Subjects tend to mimic the behavior of the confederate, both when the confederate makes eye contact and smiles frequently at the subject and when the confederate does not make eye contact and was non-smiling. Furthermore, when confederates mimic the behavior of the participant, the participant later rates the confederate as more ‚Äòlikable‚Äô than confederates who do not mimic behavior. This effect was shown to be more pronounced in people that are more dispositionally empathetic. The authors suggest that this unconscious mimicry could lead to greater group cohesion and coordination. = Goal formation/activation = Stimuli are often interpreted and assessed based on their relevance to our goals.Bargh, J.A. (1989) Conditional automaticity: Varieties of automatic influences in social perception and cognition. In J.S. Uleman & J.A. Bargh (Eds.) Unintended thought (pp.3-51). New York: Guilford Press. During goal pursuit, objects consistent with that goal are rated more positively than are goal-irrelevant objects tested in a sequential evaluative priming paradigm. These ratings also predict behavior towards those objects.Ferguson, M.J. & Bargh, J.A. (2004). Liking is for doing: The effects of goal pursuit on automatic evaluation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87, 557-572. Beyond this, Bargh suggested that associations between goals, their related behaviors, and environments in which they are consistently pursued, can become linked in memory and be unconsciously activated to influence behavior without conscious awareness.Bargh, John A., and Tanya L. Chartrand. 1999. \\"The unbearable automaticity of being.\\" American Psychologist 54, (7): 462-479.. Unconscious goals are activated with priming, or the presentation of a cue that automatically activates its related mental representation of the goal, which triggers related behaviors. For instance, subjects primed with an achievement or cooperation goal perform better on an intelligence task compared to subjects who are not primed.Bargh, J., Gollwitzer, P. M., Lee- Chai, A., Barndollar, K., & Tr√∂tschel, R. (2001). The automated will: Nonconscious activation and pursuit of behavioral goals. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81(6), 1014-1027. Bargh suggests that unconscious goals are pursued flexibly, and automatically adapt to changing environments during tasks in the experiment.Hassin, R. R., Bargh, J. A., & Zimerman, S. (2009). Automatic and flexible: The case of nonconscious goal pursuit. Social Cognition, 27(1), 20-36. Bargh hypothesized that unconscious goals are represented mentally.Bargh, J. A. (1990). Auto-motives: Preconscious determinants of social interaction. In E. T.Higgins & R. M.Sorrentino (Eds.), Handbook of motivation and cognition (Vol. 2, (pp. 93‚Äì130). New York: Guilford Press. Those mental representation influence behavior. For example, a mental representation of a relationship partner triggers goal-oriented behavior consistent with what is expected for that specific relationship. For example, subjects asked to bring to mind a mental representation of a \\"friend\\" were more helpful to a stranger than those asked to call to mind a \\"co- worker.\\"Fitzsimons, G. M., & Bargh, J. A. (2003). Thinking of you: Nonconscious pursuit of interpersonal goals associated with relationship partners. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84(1), 148-164. Bargh has also found that priming can influence self-regulation. Subject in a group exposed to words associated with \\"reappraisal\\" were contrasted with subjects in a group that received explicit instructions to try to reappraise their emotional state, with the goal of self-regulating their emotions. All subjects then gave a short oral presentation while having their heart rate monitored. Those merely perceiving reappraisal words were reported to have a significant reduction in heart rate, a reduction equal to that of subjects explicitly instructed to use reappraisal to control anxiety.Williams, L.W., Nocera, C.C., Gray, J.R., Bargh, J.A. (2009). The unconscious regulation of emotion: nonconscious reappraisal goals modulate emotional reactivity. Emotion. 2009 Dec;9(6):847-54. = Physiology influencing psychology = Physical sensations may unconsciously translate into psychological interpretations. When subjects were asked to briefly hold a warm coffee mug, and then fill out an evaluation of a person described ambiguously, subjects reported warmer feelings toward the target person versus when they were asked to briefly hold an iced coffee.Williams, L. E., & Bargh, J. A. (2008). Experiencing physical warmth promotes interpersonal warmth. Science, 322(5901), 606-607. In a second study, subjects in the 'cold' condition were also more likely to choose a reward for themselves as opposed to giving the reward to their friend, whereas in the 'warm' condition participants were more likely to choose the reward for their friend. The physical properties of objects that subjects are touching can similarly influence social impression formation and decision- making.Ackerman, J. M., Nocera, C. C., & Bargh, J. A. (2010). Incidental haptic sensations influence social judgments and decision. Science, 328(5986), 1712-1715. Bargh and his colleagues also found evidence of physical warmth influencing how giving and provincial participants were. Those who held the warm beverage were more likely to choose a reward or gift for a friend than for themselves. However three independent studies with larger samples failed to replicate the effect. Bargh and ShalevBargh, J. A., & Shalev, I. (2011). The substitutability of physical and social warmth in daily life. Emotion, are currently addressing how this psychological-physiological link can be used to regulate emotion. Correlation studies show that participants rated highly on a loneliness scale, also tend to take longer showers at higher water temperatures. In a follow-up study, a manipulation of physical warmth to make the subjects colder resulted in an increase on the loneliness scale. Altering one's physical situation can thus result in emotional responses, even without conscious awareness. A paper by Donnellan and colleagues reported 9 failures to replicate the results of Bargh and Shalev. However, Bargh and Shalev have successfully replicated their studies, indicating cultural differences in bathing and showering habits.\\"\\" They also noted that in the 2 studies in which Donellan et al. attempted to most closely follow their original procedure, they did replicate their original results, but not in the other 7 studies in which considerable procedural changes were made. = Free will = In \\"Beyond Behaviorism\\", Bargh and FergusonBargh, J. A., & Ferguson, M. L. (2000). Beyond behaviorism: On the automaticity of higher mental processes. Psychological Bulletin, 126, 925-945. define both automatic and controlled processing as deterministic in nature, the difference being that the former occurs unintentionally and without volition, but that both are deterministic in that they have causes. They argue that most processing, including processing of stimuli that greatly influence behavior and decision making, occurs outside of consciousness. They suggest that only our inability to recognize the powerful activity occurring outside of awareness leads some to believe that they are the masters of their choices. Bargh posits, along with Daniel Wegner and other scientists in the field, that the concept of 'free will' is an illusion. Bargh and Earp J. A. Bargh and B. D. Earp. (2009). The will is caused, not ‚Äòfree‚Äô. Dialogue, 24, make this point explicit: \\"Clearly it is motivating for each of us to believe we are better than average, that bad things happen to other people, not ourselves, and that we have free-agentic control over our own judgments and behavior‚Äîjust as it is comforting to believe in a benevolent God and justice for all in an afterlife. But the benefits of believing in free will are irrelevant to the actual existence of free will. A positive illusion, no matter how functional and comforting, is still an illusion.\\"  Awards  * 2011 - Elected Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences * 2007 - Society for Experimental Social Psychology Scientific Impact Award * 2006 - Society for Personality and Social Psychology Donald T.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Robert McKimson. The cartoon was released on January 28, 1950, and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. The cartoon is similar to the 1942 short My Favorite Duck. Plot Daffy is enjoying his \\"daffy\\" nature around the forest. Later, Porky pulls up and sets up camp to enjoy the countryside. He paints a landscape picture, briefly interrupted when Daffy poses. Taking a hint, Daffy rides off. Daffy then comes back in and tells Porky he may not paint \\"his\\" lakes, but the mountains are okay since he does not own them. Porky resumes painting, but \\"the old man of the mountains\\" comes‚Äîtrying to get the mountains out of Porky's painting. Porky sees through the disguise and tries to use a shotgun against Daffy, but a sheriff calls for an executioner. The sheriff walks out and the executioner appears with an axe. At the last moment, Porky is \\"saved\\" by Pocahontas. However, when \\"Cap'n John Smiff\\" does not agree to marry \\"her\\", Daffy starts making war whoops‚Äîuntil Porky shuts him up. Porky then decides to try fishing, putting a bait attached to a bell. Daffy fools Porky twice by ringing the bell and Porky gets the better of Daffy by trying to chop him with an axe, but Daffy then rings his own bell‚Äîonly to be surprised when Porky does catch a large fish. Daffy then asks about the various licenses Porky has until Porky says he does not have a marriage license. Porky responds by throwing a rock at Daffy, but Daffy makes out like they are in a baseball game, and encourages Porky as Joe DiMaggio to slide for home. Porky realizes too late that he is not really DiMaggio and lands in a mud puddle (\\"My name is Mud,\\" Porky says). Porky then starts packing up his trailer to get away from Daffy and avoid going insane. Daffy climbs into Porky's engine, deliberately throws out the engine and closes the hood. Porky tries starting the car, but gets Daffy's stalled motor sound. When Daffy makes the sound while Porky is out of the car, Porky jumps in, makes some \\"adjustments\\", then climbs back in the car. Having finally gotten the better of the duck, Porky starts the car again, pulling on the 'choke' lever, which causes a mechanical arm to pop out and choke Daffy, who is now wired into the car and is powering it. Daffy mentions that Porky has absolutely no right to do this, until a license appears, showing that Porky has a license to use Daffy as a motor.

He was the owner of the estate Andreevskoe. Biography The middle son of Illarion Vorontsov from his marriage with Anna Maslova. In his youth, Roman Vorontsov served (1733) in the Life Guards Izmailovsky Regiment, in the 1730s, he supported the crown princess Elizaveta Petrovna, took part in the coup on November 25, 1741 (he took away members of the Braunschweig family from Saint Petersburg). At the time of the formation of the Russian Academy, became its member. In 1748, he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna; September 5, 1751 ‚Äì the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky, in 1783 ‚Äì the Order of the Holy Prince Vladimir, 1st class. During the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna, Roman Vorontsov became one of the richest people in Russia, the owner of estates and factories. With the diploma of the Roman Emperor Franz I (dated January 19, 1760), the real chamberlain, Lieutenant-General Roman Vorontsov, together with his brother, the real chamberlain Ivan Vorontsov, was promoted with descending descendants into the \\"Count of the Roman Empire dignity\\". In 1760, Vorontsov became a member of the Legislative Commission, in which, like the Commission on the Rights of the Nobility (1763), he advocated the legislative formalization of class rights of the nobility, including the right to exclusive ownership of serfs.Roman Vorontsov With the advent of Peter III Fedorovich, his position at court was strengthened, since his daughter Elizaveta Romanovna was the favorite of the new emperor; on January 8, 1762, Roman Vorontsov received the rank of General- Chef. Under the reign of Catherine II, he was first in disgrace, was even arrested and deported to Moscow, deprived of a number of estates in Little Russia. New appointments and career Vorontsov was obliged to popular unrest. Pugachevschina revealed many of the shortcomings of the provincial government of the empire. An attempt to rectify the situation was the reform of 1775, according to which 50 provinces were created instead of 23 provinces. The provincial administration was headed by the governor or governor-general, who controlled two or three provinces. The viceroy was given great rights. In March 1778, by decree of Catherine II, Vladimir Governorship was formed, in 1779 ‚Äì Tambov Governorship, and in 1780 ‚Äì Penza Governorship. The first Vladimir, Penza and Tambov governor and governor general was Roman Vorontsov. With his requisitions and extortion, he brought the provinces entrusted to him to the utter ruin, for which he received the nickname \\"Roman ‚Äì big pocket\\". The estate of Roman Vorontsov \\"Andreevskoye\\" (Petushinsky District of Vladimir Oblast) The historian Prince Mikhail Shcherbatov wrote about him:Mikhail Shcherbatov. About Damage to Morals in Russia It came to the point that Catherine sent him a gift with a hint ‚Äì a big wallet, which arrived just on his name day and, they say, acted upon him so much that he soon became ill and died on December 11, 1783. On the other hand, the expression \\"big pocket\\" could have arisen as a result of Count Vorontsov's activities in the Free Economic Society. In his printed articles, he pointed out ways to mitigate the morals of the peasantry, and, referring to his own example, suggested that the landowners organize annual grain stocks in the villages in case of crop failure. The insistent advice of Count Roman Vorontsov to stock up on products fully justifies the nickname \\"big pocket\\". By a registered Higher Decree of April 16, 1797, it was ordered \\"to introduce the clans of the Roman Empire of the Counts Vorontsov among the clans of the counts of the Russian Empire\\". He was buried in the Dmitrievsky Cathedral in Vladimir. Family He was married since 1736 to a rich merchant's daughter, Martha Surmina (1718‚Äì1745) who died of typhus at the age of 26 and left five children orphaned. Widowed, Roman Vorontsov had no desire to engage in family affairs and raising children. The empress made two elder daughters the maids of honor and took her to the palace, the sons lived with the eldest count Vorontsov-grandfather, the youngest daughter Catherine was raised with her only daughter, uncle Mikhail Vorontsov. *Maria Romanovna (1737 ‚Äì April 21, 1779)Central State Historical Archive of Saint Petersburg.

Known for the confrontational nature of its studio audience and topics, it was presented for many years by Nicky Campbell. It was broadcast late on a Friday night in the Central region, and debated various topics and current affairs issues - usually subjects that had been featured in the week's news. Though Campbell was the main host, there were a number of other presenters who joined him throughout the show's time on air. These included Anna Soubry, Adrian Mills, Kaye Adams, Sue Jay, Gregg Upwards, Roger Cook, Bibi Baskin, Paul Ross, John Stapleton, James Whale, Ed Doolan, Victoria Derbyshire, Patricia Mitchell and Claudia Winkleman. The theme music was composed by Andy Quin. History The show was broadcast live from the Central Television studios on Broad Street, Birmingham, although it was later moved to the Nottingham studios at Lenton Lane. It became a popular highlight of the week's television in the Midlands region and enjoyed a 40% share of the viewing audience. Confrontational from the outset, debates could become quite heated and audience members sometimes had to be restrained by on- set bouncers. However, on at least one occasion, the show's floor manager was assaulted by one of the returning guests. In 1987, it became the first British television programme to examine seriously the AIDS virus. Central subsequently produced a drama series on the topic, called Intimate Contact. During the 1992 General Election campaign, Conservative MP Edwina Currie poured a glass of orange juice over Labour's Peter Snape shortly after an edition of the show had finished airing. Speaking about the incident later, Currie said \\"I just looked at my orange juice, and looked at this man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought 'I know how to shut you up.' \\". On another occasion, during a debate on women's football in March 1998, an audience member got drunk and ran amok on set, forcing the show to be taken off the air. 44-year-old Robert Davy was later jailed for 12 months over the incident. In 2001, a complaint was made to the Independent Television Commission after it emerged that an edition of the show had featured fake guests. A debate on the effects of soap operas on the lives of individuals had featured two patients of a \\"soap clinic\\", who it later emerged had been fakes. Similar programmes Due to the programme's popularity in the Midlands, similar shows were aired in other regions. For example, Granada aired a show called Up Front, while Tyne Tees had Late and Live, both of which used the same format. A national version of Central Weekend was also shown throughout the ITV Network for a time during the 1990s. Thursday Night Live went out in a similar late night slot on a Thursday evening, and featured much the same kind of debate as Central Weekend. It was also presented by Nicky Campbell.

It was developed as a prototype of the satellite town concept in the 1960s and is primarily a suburban residential area. The name Langwasser (translated as \\"long water\\") comes from a small stream bordering the area on its eastern edge. Location Langwasser is located in the southeastern area of Nuremberg. History At the beginning of the 20th century, the area that would become Langwasser was heavily wooded and part of the Imperial Forest. After devastating forest fires between 1917 and 1919 the area was cleared and used for farming. =Nazi era= Prior to World War II, the area which had been cleared by fire became an important site for the Nazi movement. Beginning in 1934 it was the site of various tent cities and encampments. The area originally housed a tent encampment of the Reich Labor Service (RAD) and later the Hitler Youth (HJ). Permanent camps for the SS, SA, HJ, and RAD were built near the Nuremberg Rally Grounds. The Langwasser camp, with space for 200,000, was the largest. At the outbreak of World War II, party rallies ceased and the compound was converted into a prisoner-of-war camp known as Stalag XIII-D, which housed up to 150,000 prisoners until closing in 1940. In this camp during August 1940, prisoners of war celebrated a \\"special Olympics\\" called International Prisoner-of-War Olympic Games where prisoners of Belgium, France, Great Britain, Norway, Poland, Russia and Yugoslavia took part.http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1996/oreXXV8/oreXXV8zza.pdf United States military recordsWorld War II Prisoners of War Data File, 12/7/1941 - 11/19/1946 report that 6,676 American POWs were transferred there late in the war. =Post-war period= The history of Langwasser as a district begins after the Second World War in 1949. For ten years the area was a mixture of refugee camps and temporary housing developments. Construction of the first permanent housing developments did not begin until the 1950s. Many German refugees from Silesia and from the Sudetenland made Langwasser their new home. The facilities were used as internment camp by the US occupation army. During the Nuremberg trials 21 witnesses - members of the SS - were moved to the camp on July 17, 1946, from the Palace of Justice to the camp. =Modern times= The modern history of Langwasser begins with the decision of the city of Nuremberg to develop a planned community in the area marketed with the slogan \\"living in the country\\". An architectural competition was held in 1956, with construction beginning the following year. Construction was not fully completed until the 1990s.

In addition, he was the first European to find Kilimanjaro.Rebmann, J., 1858, ‚ÄúBericht einer Reise zum Kilimandscharo‚Äù, in J. L. Krapf, Reisen in Ost-Afrika ausgef√ºhrt in den Jahren 1837-55. Stuttgart, Kornthal. News of Rebmann's discovery was published in the Church Missionary Intelligencer in May 1849, but disregarded as mere fantasy for the next twelve years. The Geographical Society of London held that snow could not possibly occur let alone persist in such latitudes and considered the report to be the hallucination of a malaria-stricken missionary.APG and TANAPA, 2000, Kilimanjaro: Africa‚Äôs Beacon. Harare, African Publishing Group (International) and Tanzania National Parks (Tanapa), 2nd edition. It was only in 1861 that researchers began their efforts to measure Kilimanjaro. Expeditions to Tanzania between 1861 and 1865, led by the German Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken, confirmed Rebmann‚Äôs report. Together with his colleague Johann Ludwig Krapf they were also the first Europeans to visit and report Mt. Kenya.Fitzpatrick, Mary Tanzania (2005) Their work there is also thought to have had effects on future African expeditions by Europeans, including the exploits of Sir Richard Burton, John Hanning Speke, and David Livingstone. After losing most of his eyesight and entering into a brief marriage, he died of pneumonia. Early life Rebmann was born to a Swabian farmer and winegrower on January 16, 1820 in Gerlingen, W√ºrttemberg. The village he lived in was very small, with about 1,500 inhabitants. Even at an early age, he aspired to be a \\"preacher and canvasser of the gospel\\". Later, when Rebmann became a young man, he chose to devote himself to being a missionary, and was trained in Basel. In 1844 he attended the Church Missionary Society College, Islington. The following year he was ordained as a priest by the Bishop of London and he became a member of the Church Missionary Society. Together with fellow missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf, Rebmann traveled in 1846 by a ship called \\"Arrow\\" to East Africa, where he worked in what is now Kenya, as well as at various other locations. Their work was hard, and they had much trouble convincing tribal chiefs to let them speak to the people. Krapf noted (what he called) the \\"surge of Islam\\" that was going through Africa, and wanted to make some sort of Christian standing against its religious influence on the people of the continent. As the radius of the two missionaries' work expanded, plans for Christian missionary outposts in the area began to develop. During his time in Africa, Rebmann kept a diary from 1848 until the end of his life. In the diary, Rebmann writes of the way his trust in his Christianity kept him stable in the continent of Africa, where only very few Europeans had ventured before him. An extract from the diary, which Rebmann in turn took from the Bible (Psalm: 51, 12) reflects Rebmann's belief in his faith: \\"Restore to me joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.\\" Stumbling upon Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya Kibo Summit of Kilimanjaro, the mountain on which Rebmann saw snow In 1848, Rebmann was the first European to see Mount Kilimanjaro. The following year, he saw Mount Kenya together with his colleague Krapf. On the October 16, 1847, the two men set out for the interior of Kenya. With them came eight tribesmen and a local caravan leader named Bwana Kheri. This expedition was designed with the goal of establishing some of the first mission posts in the region. The journey was successful, and the group of tribesmen and the missionaries returned to Mombasa on October 27. Sometime during their journey or their stay in the region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great mountain referred to as 'Kilimansharo', which reached the clouds and which was 'capped in silver'. The two men, like most Europeans at the time, were under the impression that snow and ice could not exist so close to the equator, and failed to realize the significance of the mountain being 'topped with silver'. However, the two missionaries, who had become just as much explorers as they were missionaries, became quite interested in Kilimanjaro, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition to the land of the Jagga, a people now known as the Chaga, who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based. Despite this, Krapf actually did not accompany Rebmann on the journey, so only Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on April 27, 1848. Within two weeks, Rebmann and his guide were within sight of the mountain. He noted in his journal the strange white on the summit of Kilimanjaro, and he questioned his guide on what he thought it was. According to Rebmann's log, the guide 'did not know what it was, but supposed it was coldness'. It was then that Rebmann realised that Kilimanjaro was in fact capped in snow. In 1849, these observations were published, but the findings were not truly accepted by most of the scientific community at the time and even deemed as the result of hallucinations induced by malaria. On November 10, 1848, Rebmann recorded an entry in his log about the mountain: Mt. Kenya was discovered by Krapf in the next year, on December 3, 1849. The finding of this mountain was also met with disbelief in Europe, but the effect of these discoveries was enough to trigger further investigation into other areas of Africa, thereby stimulating a growth of scientific (among other fields) knowledge of the regions, people, history, and geography of the African continent. Other work in Africa  Rebmann stayed in Africa for almost thirty consecutive years. He kept to a policy that, in order to truly affect the African people, and to complete his task as a missionary, much patience was needed. It appears that this policy was the driving force behind his many years of work on the continent. As well as visiting Kilimanjaro, Rebmann and Krapf visited other areas of Africa, including the African Great Lakes and Mount Meru. He married to a fellow missionary, Anna Maria, n√©e Maisch, with whom he spent fifteen years doing missionary work in Africa before her death in 1866, and with whom he had a child (who died only days after his birth). Also during his time in Africa, after his expeditions to Kilimanjaro and around the Great lakes, he learned to speak several native languages, and completed a dictionary (started by his colleague Ludwig Krapf) of the Nika (Mijikenda) language,J.L. Krapf, J. Rebmann A Nika-English Dictionary, 1877. and a dictionary of Swahili (now lost, but of which some material may have been incorporated into Krapf's Dictionary of the Suaheli Language (1882)).Paas (2011) pp.151-171). He also translated the Gospel of Luke into Swahili.Paas (2011), p.151. In addition, after meeting a Swahili- speaking slave known as Salimini, originally from Malawi, in 1853, he compiled the first ever Chichewa language dictionary, which was eventually published in 1877.Rev. John Rebman, Dictionary of the Kiniassa Language, Basle 1877, reprinted Gregg Press, 1967; see Goodson (2011). =Slug map= The Slug Map, illustrating some of the missionaries' findings During their time in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked their way into the interior of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniam√©si) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug. The basis for the map was prepared by the missionary Jakob Erhardt from the reports of his companions Krapf and Rebmann, and from verbal information that he had acquired from local people. Erhardt was struck by the fact that travelers who had gone inland from different points on the coast had all come to an inland sea. In November 1854, while talking about the problem to Rebmann, \\"at one and the same moment, the problem flashed on both of us solved by the simple supposition that where geographical hypothesis had hitherto supposed an enormous mountain-land, we must now look for an enormous valley and an inland sea.\\" On the map that he and Rebmann drew, the three lakes of Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa are shown as one very large L-shaped lake. On the map, several subtle but interesting things can be discovered, including, in the northeast section of the cartograph, a reference to a stream flowing into Lake Victoria, then known by the missionaries as \\"the Ukerewa\\". A note describes how the waters of the stream were very sweet, but stained the teeth a sickly yellow. This note is probably the first known text referring to the drinking water, found primarily around Mount Meru, which has a high content of fluorine and causes a yellow-brown stain to the incisors which cannot be removed. Another piece of writing on the Slug Map ‚Äì \\"From where the Magad [soda] is bought\\" ‚Äì provides evidence that the trade in soda originating in Lake Natron (obviously not known by that name then) was already active at that time. In 1855 Erhardt was repatriated due to poor health, and took his map with him. It was first published in the Calwer Missionsblatt in 1855, and then in the Church Missionary intelligencer in 1856. The map is now in the care of the Royal Geographical Society in London. It is described by the Society as: Later life and death Having almost lost his eyesight for unknown reasons, Rebmann went back to Europe in September 1875. He returned to Germany for the first time in 29 years after being persuaded to do so by a fellow missionary who was working in the area. He then proceeded to take up residence in Korntal near Stuttgart, where he was close to his old friend Krapf. In spring 1876, upon the advice of Krapf, he married the widow of another missionary from India, Louise Rebmann n√©e D√§uble. The marriage did not last long, as on October 4, 1876, Rebmann died of pneumonia. Engraved on Rebmann's tombstone in the cemetery of Korntal are the words (in English) \\"Saved in the arms of Jesus\\" (a photo can be seen here). The legacy that he left behind him is preserved by the Johannes Rebmann Foundation, a religious society devoted to Rebmann and his memory. Rebmann's work in Africa, both as a missionary and as an explorer, allowed other Europeans to follow in his footsteps.

It was recaptured by Finns between 1941 and 1944 during Continuation War but was again ceded to Soviets after Moscow Armistice. This secession was formalized after signing Paris Peace Treaty in 1947. The Viipuri Province was divided, with the larger part ceded to Soviet Union and the smaller part remaining in Finland. The population was resettled to Finland, and population from Central Russia was resettled to populate the Karelian Isthmus. In March 1940 Yaskinsky District with the administrative center in J√§√§ski was established, and J√§√§ski obtained work settlement status. The district was a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, after March 31, 1940 of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. On November 24, 1944, Yaskinsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to Leningrad Oblast. On October 1, 1948 the district was renamed Lesogorsky, and on January 13, 1949 J√§√§ski was renamed Lesogorsky.

It is the site of the original Montgomery Castle, and was built by Roger de Montgomery in 1070. From 1105 the castle was the home of the de Boulers (Bowdler) family, and it is from Baldwin de Boulers that Montgomery gets its Welsh name, Trefaldwyn \\"The Town of Baldwin\\". When the castle was rebuilt in stone (1223‚Äì1234), it was decided to rebuild it on a rocky promontory a mile to the south-east ‚Äì the location of the current town of Montgomery, Powys. The Hen Domen site has been extensively excavated. There are permanent exhibitions relating to both the medieval Hen Domen and Norman Montgomery Castles and their archaeological excavations (with scale models of both castles) in The Old Bell Museum in Montgomery. Location Hen Domen lies on the western edge of the small village of Hendomen roughly northwest of the town of Montgomery, and west of Offa's Dyke. The castle was built on a low hill, only east of the Ford of Rhydwhymanan (an important shallow crossing of the River Severn), and offered good views of the Severn Valley to the north and west, and of the Vale of Montgomery to the east. Description The site of the Hen Domen motte and bailey castle comprises a roughly oval area of by lying in a south-west to north-east direction. The site is surrounded by a roughly oval ditch with a depth of . The motte is in the south west corner and is high, and steeply sided with a flat summit with a diameter of . The bailey occupies an area of roughly . Excavations from the 1960s until the 1990s have revealed traces of a series of grand and complex buildings including a towering timber building on the motte, connected by a bridge to the bailey with a large hall, by . Other evidence and remains include a wooden palisade which stood on the bailey defences, a wooden tower, a gatehouse, a granary and a possible chapel. History Hen Domen was built sometime soon after 1071 when Roger de Montgomery, the first Earl of Shrewsbury, was given extensive areas of Shropshire by William the Conqueror. Archaeological evidence suggests that it was completed before 1100. Roger de Montgomery named the castle Montgomery after the town in France where he came from. Access The site can be viewed from a nearby lane off the B4385, but the site itself is on private land and can only be visited with the permission of the owner.

It was published by Melbourne House. Five programmers worked for 18 months on the title and a Sherlock Holmes expert was employed full-time for a year to advise the team on accuracy.Mike Gerrard: Adventuring into an Unknown World. In: The Guardian, 1984-08-30, section Micro Guardian/Futures, page 13. Technically, the adventure builds upon the 1982 title The Hobbit. Autonomous NPCs and realtime gameplay, two sophisticated features of The Hobbit, are present in Sherlock - as is Inglish, the parser responsible for analyzing the player's commands.http://www.crashonline.org.uk/03/hobbit.htm The game simulated 'real time'; trains ran to a time table and key plot events began at exactly specified moments. There was also an attempt to move beyond 'instructional' communication with characters (in which non-player characters are told or asked to complete actions the player does not wish to or is unable to complete) to 'dialogic' communication in which characters could be questioned, challenged and persuaded with evidence. The latter was an early attempt to simulate changing states of consciousness within an interactive narrative. Plot A double murder has been committed in the town of Leatherhead and Dr. Watson has encouraged the player, who plays Holmes, to investigate. Inspector Lestrade is also investigating.http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/review.aspx?gid=4988&rid;=5217 Bugs The game is notorious for a large number of surreal and amusing bugs due to the complex potential interactions between characters. For example: * Policemen can still talk, and obstruct Holmes, while unconscious; * Hansom cab drivers can blame Holmes for anyone who fails to pay their fare anywhere on the map, can be used to force improper objects (such as trains) to appear inside cabs, and can be confused into driving the player into a null location which is used as the store for nouns, allowing Holmes to pick up items such as \\"innocent\\", \\"your alibi\\" and \\"an opium den\\"; * Inspector Lestrade normally arrests the wrong man early in the game, causing a Game Over unless Holmes has shown the man's innocence; however, Holmes can also wait for Lestrade to get in a cab, then tell his cabbie from outside to drive to a random location, causing Lestrade to freeze because he doesn't know what to do there; * Watson is described as \\"the only character with a memory\\"; unfortunately, if the player allows Watson to see too many events happening, his memory overflows the available RAM of the system and the game crashes.

At in height, it is one of the highest hills in the area. Its heather-covered summit plateau is crowned by a trig point from which there are extensive views over Congleton, Biddulph, Macclesfield, Holmes Chapel and the Greater Manchester area. The Cloud is at the northern apex of a triangle formed by the broken ridge which runs along the border between Cheshire and Staffordshire and the hills stretching south through Biddulph Moor into Staffordshire. To its north, the River Dane wraps around its lower slopes whilst the A523 road runs to its east through the village of Bosley in Southeast Cheshire.  Geology  The summit and upper slopes are formed from the coarse and pebbly Chatsworth Grit, a thick sandstone which forms a part of the Millstone Grit and which dates from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous period. The lower slopes are formed from mudstones which are not generally exposed. The hill owes its shape in part to the passage of ice around its flanks in successive ice ages.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map sheet no 110 Macclesfield & accompanying memoir  Access  View of the Cheshire Plain from the top of the Cloud The summit and adjacent slopes of the hill are owned by the National Trust and so have been available for public access over many years, a situation reinforced by the additional pedestrian access measures provided by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Several public footpaths cross the hill and provide links with the network of minor roads which run around its lower slopes.

In clear weather, the sun sets on the summit of the hill, partially reappears from The Cloud's steep northern slope and soon afterwards sets for a second and final time on the horizon. The occurrence was first recorded in writing in 1686 by Robert Plot in his book The Natural History Of Stafford-shire, and may well have been observed for centuries before then. The spectacle is no longer visible from its traditional observation point because of tree interference, but can still be witnessed on the summer solstice from Leek: from Lowe Hill, on the outskirts of the town, and from the road to Pickwood Hall, off Milltown Way.

Biography  = Family = Fraser was the son of Thomas Fraser, 4th Laird of Lovat, and Lady Janet Dunbar. He was a minor when his father died, and became a legal ward, first, of Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray (d. 1455), and subsequently of Patrick Lyon, 1st Lord Glamis (d.1459), whose daughter, Margaret Lyon, Lovat married. Through her, Lovat's children were great-great-great-grandchildren of Robert II. They had a son, Thomas, and two daughters, Margaret and Egidia, the latter of whom married Ferquhar Mackintosh. Lovat's grandfather, Hugh Fraser (d. 1440), 4th Laird of Lovat, was one of the hostages for the ransom of King James I of Scotland in 1424. = Education and life = In 1450 his father sent him to be educated by Lord Murray. He was certainly known to the Regent Duke of Albany when introduced and knighted by James II, and thence conferred with the Order of the Thistle. Lovat was summoned to Parliament as Lord Fraser of Lovat sometime between 1458 and 1461. In 1464 he made an indenture with kinsman, Alexander Fraser of Phillorth that each would agree to support each other's surviving heir, depending on who died first. It recognised the perilous lifespan of a highlander in an age of bloody internecine conflict. Then on 13 May 1471, the Court Auditor on behalf of Alexander Flemyng ordered Hew fraser to pay for some land purchases granted two years previously. Lovat opposed the chaos in the Isles that occasioned James II's early death and minority of the new king. The Lord of the Isles recruited Viking mercenaries to plunder his lands seize Inverness, march to Athol and burn the Church of St Bride. A resentful tenantry lay siege to Castle Lovat, but his clan remained loyal, easily repelling the invasion. The MacDonalds victory at a battle at Caplach, west of Inverness returned peace to the glen of the Airds. On 31 March 1472, lord Hew Frassare entered into an indenture to protect the citizenry of the hill burgh of Nairn. He contracted to buy ore land for 50 Merks off William Wallace of Craigie, and planted some orchards. But the late medieval period was lawless and violent, and after a period of peace, he was obliged to act for the King in the wars of the Lords of the Isles and his kinfolk. Clannish feuds broke out in Sutherland and Caithness. 18 peasants were killed in a dispute that burnt the priory of Beauly. Some disputes were racial between Norman, and Flemish descendants of the feudal clan system complicated by James III's minority. Two years earlier he was party to a charter that was not ratified until 28 February 1480. Lovat was among the party of nobles who met the King when he crossed the Forth to Blackness in an effort to crush the rebellious incursions. The English defeated James, who was slain at Stirling before his loyal lords could intervene. Lovat lived to old age, but his favourite son was slain at Flodden with James IV. = Death = He died c.1500 and was succeeded by his son Thomas. Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, known as \\"Simon the Fox\\", was among his descendants. Lord Lovat had at least four sons Hugh, Thomas, Alexander and John as well as three daughters and two natural sons.  Notelist   References  * Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

The 200-foot span shown in this image makes it almost certainly the Chain Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill. James Finley (1756Judge James Finley gravestone, Laurel Hill United Presbyterian Church cemetery, Fayette County, PA ‚Äì 1828), aka Judge James Finley, is widely recognized as the first designer and builder of the modern suspension bridge. Born in Ireland, Finley moved to a farm in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, near Uniontown. Elected a justice of the peace in 1784, he went on to become county commissioner in 1789, and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and Senate. From 1791 until his death, he was an Associate Judge for Fayette County.Kranakis, Eda, \\"Constructing a Bridge\\", The MIT Press, 1997 His Jacob's Creek Bridge, built in 1801 for US$600, and demolished in 1833, was the first example of a suspension bridge using wrought iron chains and with a level deck. It connected Uniontown to Greensburg, spanning 70 feet (21 metres), and was wide. Finley is also credited with designing and constructing a chain suspension bridge across Dunlap's Creek in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, in 1809. In 1820, however, the bridge collapsed under a heavy snow combined with the loads from a six-horse wagon team. The bridge was replaced by the Dunlap's Creek Bridge, the country's first cast-iron bridge, in 1835.Structural Iron 1750‚Äì1850, edited by R.J.M. Sutherland, Ashgate, 1998. pp. 18-19.

None of Finley's bridges survive, the one in Newburyport has been replaced with a functioning replica. Finley patented his system in 1808 and also published a paper on the principles of the deck-stiffened suspension bridge.Finley, James, \\"A Description of the Patent Chain Bridge\\", The Port Folio Vol. III, Bradford & Inskeep, Philadelphia, June 1810 References External links * * Image of Finley's bridge Category:American civil engineers Category:American bridge engineers Category:19th-century American inventors Category:1756 births Category:1828 deaths ","title":"James Finley (engineer)"},{"id":"10594406","text":"Adipamide is the organic compound with the formula (CH2CH2C(O)NH2)2.

He was foundation Dean of Education at the University of Sydney. He was a researcher who in thirty-five years managed to catalogue much of Australia's history of Education. As an administrator he oversaw the merging of Sydney Teachers College with the University of Sydney Faculty of Education. Career Turney graduated from Fort Street High School in 1949. At the time, Fort Street was an academically highly ranked school in NSW. His choice of Primary education, which in NSW is from ages five to eleven, or grades kindergarten to year six, did not lack academic rigor. His ability to teach was recognized early, and he was appointed to Haberfield Demonstration School in 1953. Demonstration schools were places where Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education would send their students to witness teacher praxis. Turney's efforts were further recognized as he was appointed lecturer in Education at Sydney's Teacher's College and made Commonwealth Research Scholar in 1956. Teachers in NSW, at the time, did not require a university degree to teach. After nine years of teaching, Turney enrolled at Sydney University, graduating with first class honors for his BA, then first class honors for his M.Ed. In 1964, Turney enrolled in a Ph.D. program for a study in the history of early educational endeavour. Part of his post doctoral work examined the history of Education in Australia. Turney was appointed Senior Lecturer at Sydney University in 1966, and Associate Professor in 1973. By 1976, Turney was appointed Professor of Education 'head of the School of Teaching and Curriculum Studies.' During the early seventies, Turney had edited and co-authored the Sydney Micro Skills Handbook and its accompanying videos. Part of a national re-evaluation of teaching and teacher education, these publications had a major influence on practice in teacher education, in Australia and internationally: :Series 1 Handbook - Reinforcement, Basic Questioning, Variability :Series 2 Handbook - Explaining, Introductory Procedures and Closure, Advanced Questioning :Series 3 Handbook - Classroom Management and Discipline :Series 4 Handbook - Guiding Small Group Discussion, Small Group Teaching and Individualized Instruction A restructure of the Education Sector in 1986 had Sydney University promote its Education Department to a full Faculty. The Department had had more researchers than other faculties. Also, Sydney College of Education merged with the faculty. Turney was foundation Dean during this time. In 1994, with failing health, Turney was made Emeritus Professor Education. He continued his research, and in 2003 was awarded the Sydney University Honorary Doctorate of Letters. He died in 2005, survived by his wife, Roslyn, and two daughters, Jennifer and Catherine.

Olam is among the world's largest suppliers of cocoa beans and products, coffee, cotton and rice. History In 1989, the Kewalram Chanrai Group established Olam Nigeria Plc to set up a non-oil based export operation out of Nigeria to secure hard currency earnings to meet the foreign exchange requirements of the other Group Companies operating in Nigeria. The success of this operation resulted in Olam establishing an independent export operation and sourcing and exporting other agricultural products. The Group's agri-business was headquartered in London until 1996, and operated under the name of Chanrai International Limited. The business began with the export of cashews from Nigeria and then expanded into exports of cotton, cocoa and sheanuts from Nigeria. =Move to Singapore= Between 1993 and 1995, the business grew from a single operation into multiple origins, first within West Africa, and then to East Africa and India. The move into multiple origin countries coincided with the deregulation of the agricultural commodity markets. Olam International Limited was incorporated in Singapore on 4 July 1995 as a public limited company. In 1996, at the invitation of the Singapore Trade Development Board (now Enterprise Singapore), Olam relocated their entire operations from London to Singapore. Furthermore, the Singapore Government awarded Olam the Approved International Trader status (now called the Global Trader Programme) under which Olam was granted a concessionary tax rate of 10%, which was subsequently reduced, in 2004, to 5%. On relocation to Singapore, the Group's agri-business was reorganised to be wholly owned by Olam International Limited in Singapore. =IPO= In 2002, AIF Capital became the first external investor to take an equity stake in the company. In 2003, the state-owned Temasek Holdings, through its wholly owned subsidiary Seletar Investments, took a stake in Olam, followed by International Finance Corporation (IFC). In 2005, Olam International Limited was listed on the main board of the Singapore Exchange on 11 February 2005. Temasek made a further investment in Olam in 2009. As of December 2014, following a Voluntary General Offer Temasek held close to 80% of Olam. By 2020 this had reduced to 53.4%. In 2015 Mitsubishi Corporation acquired a shareholding of 20% making them the second largest shareholder. The management team of Olam has a shareholding in the company approximating 6.3% of the total issued share capital. Olam's free float owned by public shareholders accounts for approximately 15.9% of the total issued share capital in 2020. =Possible merger and divestment= In 2010, Olam International discussed a possible merger with one of its main competitors; Geneva-based Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the world's largest cotton and rice trading company. This idea was abandoned in early 2011. Olam announced in July 2013, that it would sell its cotton assets in Zimbabwe, with the preferred buyer being a private equity company. In 2019, the company announced plans to sell its sugar, rubber, wood products and fertiliser units. = Restructuring = In January 2020, Olam International announced division of its portfolio of diverse products into two new operating businesses, Olam Food Ingredients (OFI) and Olam Global Agri (OGA). The decision followed from its 2019 business review, and a multi-year plan announced early in 2019 to invest US$3.5 billion into key growth areas, such as edible nuts, coffee and cocoa, while shedding other sectors. In the statement released by the firm, Olam Food Ingredients (OFI), will consist of its cocoa, coffee, edible nuts, spices and dairy businesses, Olam Global Agri (OGA) will include grains and animal feed, edible oils, rice, cotton and commodity financial services.  Community Involvement  = Eradicating Child Labour = In 2020, Olam Cocoa, a subsidiary of Olam International, rolled out a new initiative in partnership with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) and local cocoa farming cooperatives to digitally register its nearly 7,000 farmer suppliers in Cameroon and their households. This also include introducing rigorous tractability and reporting systems, educating local communities about child labor, as well as setting up dedicated child labor monitoring and remediation systems (CLMRS). In 2018/2019, Olam found more than 7,000 instances of inappropriate child labor in its supply chain, remediating approximately 70% of them. This is the first instance of professional application of such initiatives at such a scale in Cameroon.https://cocoainitiative.org/news-media-post/olam-cocoa-introduces- the-first-professionalised-child-labour-monitoring-and-remediation-to- cameroon/ Forward, the company plans to expand its initiative to cover nearly 223,000 farmers in three countries across West Africa. = Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) = Olam International currently one of the founding members of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), a multi-stakeholder platform, co-convened by United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the International Rice Research Institute to promote resource efficiency and sustainable trade flows, production and consumption operations, and supply chains in the global rice sector. =Sustainable cocoa initiatives= in order to improve crop yields in its network, Olam Cocoa has implemented a digital information system called Olam Farmer Information System (OFIS) to collect data from more than 160,000 cocoa farmers across 20 countries, tracking a range of farm level data points including cocoa tree age and soil type.https://www.confectioneryproduction.com/feature/25355/olams-cocoa- sustainability-drives-makes-headway-in-ghana/ For the 2020 growing season, Olam Cocoa has joined a program with the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) to distribute locally-sourced fertilizer to cocoa farmers in its cocoa sourcing operations in that country.https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general- news/cocobod-to-purchase-fertilisers-from-local-companies-beginning-next- year.html  Allegations  = Deforestation-linked palm oil, cocoa, and rubber = Between 2011 and 2015, Olam's palm oil trade volume grew by approximately twenty times‚Äîfrom 71,000 tons to 1.53 million tons. Despite Olam's stated commitment to RSPO-certified palm oil, the company shunned transparency as it expanded its palm oil production. A report released by the NGO Mighty Earth and Gabon-based NGO Brainforest on December 12, 2016 revealed that Olam was operating a secretive palm oil trading operation worldwide, particularly with its third party suppliers in Asia. Olam was accused of endangering the forest habitats of gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants due to widespread deforestation. It was revealed that in Gabon, Olam had cut of forest for palm oil. The photos and videos featured in the NGO report show Olam bulldozing Gabonese rainforests for rubber and to establish what they intended to build as Africa's largest palm oil plantation. The analysis found that in Gabon, Olam cleared approximately 26,000 hectares of forest across its four palm oil concessions since 2012 and additional forests for rubber. The two NGOs also documented Olam's cutting down an area the size of Washington DC in what had been an intact forest landscape in Northern Gabon, for rubber in Gabon. On December 16, 2016, shortly after the report was released, Mighty Earth submitted a formal complaint against Olam to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for Olam's deforestation and for violating FSC policies. In response to these allegations, on February 21, 2017, Olam suspended further land clearing of forests in Gabon for at least a year. As a result, Mighty Earth suspended its campaign. The agreement between Mighty Earth and Olam was renewed in 2018. In its inaugural Excellence Awards in 2019, the industry-led Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil recognized Olam International for its conservation leadership in developing sustainable palm oil plantations having a positive impact on forest conservation, species conservation and emission reduction in Gabon. On September 13, 2017 NGO Mighty Earth released a second report documenting findings that Olam purchases cocoa grown illegally in national parks and other protected forests in the Ivory Coast. The report accused Olam of endangering the forest habitats of chimpanzees, elephants and other wildlife populations by purchasing cocoa linked to deforestation.Covey, R. and McGraw, W.

Olam was notified of the findings of Mighty Earth's investigation and did not deny that the company sourced its cocoa from protected areas in the Ivory Coast. In 2020 the FSC, Olam and Mighty Earth commissioned SmartCert Group to perform a retrospective assessment of previous deforestation for Olam's palm oil plantations in Gabon. A second investigation will focus on Olam's rubber plantations in Gabon. =Muddy Waters allegations= In November 2012, Carson Block of Muddy Waters Research accused Olam of \\"deciding to take huge leverage and invest in illiquid positions\\", questioning its accounting practices and accusing its board of an \\"abject failure of leadership\\". Olam called the allegations \\"baseless rumour- mongering\\" and sued Block for libel, but its shares nevertheless fell 21%. =Forced evictions and land clearance in Laos= The company is involved in the production of coffee in Laos and the clearance of forests and villages to plant large plantations. Areas of land that were acquired by the company were previously inhabited and farmed by villagers who had paid their land taxes and were also farming coffee alongside other products. Compensation was only partly paid, with many evicted landholders being paid only in rice. Many landholders are now facing challenges to grow enough food to survive. This development of large industrial plantations at the sacrifice of the small holding family unit is argued by some to be counterproductive to the development of Laos; as it reduces the overall agricultural productivity; and increases poverty amongst the families, while a few officials and the company benefit.

The film depicts a couple (played by Alice Prin, \\"Kiki\\", and Andr√© de la Rivi√®re) acting through scenes that are shot out of focus, and with Desnos himself as the second man in the final scene. Synopsis Almost all of the scenes in this film are shot either off a mirror like the final shot, or through what appears to be diffused and textured glass. After opening to the couple walking along a road, the scene cuts to a caption > Les dents des femmes sont des objets si charmants... (Women's teeth are such > charming things...) A short scene where the female alters her stocking. > ... qu' on ne devrait les voir qu' en r√™ve ou √† l'instant de l'amour. (... > that one ought to see them only in a dream or in the instant of love.) From this point the couple retire to the upper bedroom of a house and the female undresses and retires, at which point the male bids her farewell. > Si belle! Cyb√®le? (So beautiful! Cyb√®le?) The male leaves the house. > Nous sommes √† jamais perdus dans le d√©sert de l'√©tern√®bre. (We are forever > lost in the desert of eternal darkness. √âtern√®bre is a portmanteau of > √©ternel (eternal) and t√©n√®bre (darkness)) The film cuts to a female selling newspapers in the street, this is Andr√© de la Rivi√®re in drag. > Qu'elle est belle (How beautiful she is) A man is shown purchasing a starfish in a jar, returning it home to examine further. > \\"Apr√®s tout\\" (\\"After all\\") The film then changes focus, following newspapers being blown in the wind while a man attempts to pick them up. Scenes from a railway journey appear briefly, tugboats docking at a wharfside followed by a panning city scape. > Si les fleurs √©taient en verre (If the flowers were made of glass) Followed by a montage of various rotating objects, including the starfish in a jar. A few still lifes appear, again featuring the starfish. > Belle, belle comme une fleur de verre (Beautiful, beautiful like a glass > flower) > Belle comme une fleur de chair (Beautiful like a flower of flesh) > Il faut battre les morts quand ils sont froids. (One must strike the dead > while they are cold. cf. Il faut battre le fer quand il est chaud - Strike > while the iron is hot) We rejoin the man as he ascends the staircase to the upper bedroom in the house, leaving the starfish at the foot of the stairs. The film cuts to the woman brandishing a large knife superimposed with the starfish. > Les murs de la Sant√© (The walls of the Sant√©) > Et si tu trouves sur cette terre une femme √† l'amour sinc√®re... (And if you > find on this earth a woman whose love is true...) > Belle comme une fleur de feu (Beautiful like a flower of fire) > Le soleil, un pied √† l'√©trier, niche un rossignol dans un voile de cr√™pe. > (The sun, one foot in the stirrup, nestles a nightingale in a mourning > veil.) We return to the female reclining in the bedroom. > Vous ne r√™vez pas (You are not dreaming) The film then reveals a short end to the characters love triangle. > Qu'elle √©tait belle (How beautiful she was) > Qu'elle est belle (How beautiful she is) The female appears in a mirror with the word 'belle', which shatters. The affair is over, and the film brings to a close. Production Shortly before sailing to Cuba on 21 February 1928, Desnos had written the short poem above inspired by a starfish he owned, and which he viewed as the symbolic incarnation of a lost love. During a farewell dinner held that evening with Man Ray, Kiki and one of her friends, Desnos read out this poem, further elaborated into a scenario comprising fifteen to twenty verses, and using the lines of the short poem as intertitles. Deeply affected by Desnos's reading, Man Ray immediately saw in it the scenario of a surrealist film and promised the poet‚Äîwho therefore entrusted his scenario to Man Ray‚Äîthat it would be completed in time for his return from Cuba a few weeks later. The next day, Man Ray started the project by filming the final scene, featuring Desnos himself. In addition to using the lines of the short poem as intertitles, Man Ray reproduced a phrase from Desnos's Deuil pour Deuil (\\"Les dents des femmes sont des objets si charmants qu‚Äôon ne devrait les voir qu'en r√™ve ou √† l'instant de l'amour\\", where \\"l'amour\\" replaced Desnos's original \\"la mort\\"), as well as other surrealist word games (\\"Si belle! Cyb√®le?\\"; \\"Il faut battre les morts quand ils sont froids\\"), or simply \\"Adieu\\". Man Ray used a gelatine dry-plate process to achieve the effect of textured glass and render the spectral images of the film like a drawing or rudimentary painting, thus also resolving his concern about the censorship of nude scenes. Originally a silent film, recent copies have been dubbed using music taken from Man Ray's personal record collection of the time. The musical reconstruction was by Jacques Guillot.

In addition to various Dutch celebrities who accounted for the majority of the show's guests, Jensen often welcomed international celebrities who were interviewed in English with subtitles in Dutch. On March 29, 2007, Jensen! became a subject of controversy in the United States as the show's guest that day, Snoop Dogg, delivered a few uncensored profanities directed at American TV host Bill O'Reilly. During the course of the interview, the topic of O'Reilly taking Snoop Dogg to task over the rapper's drug and gun possession arrest weeks before, was brought up by Jensen. Snoop Dogg responded by saying \\"fuck Bill O'Reilly\\" and \\"suck my dick\\" among other things, all of which aired uncensored on Dutch TV. Snoop Dogg continued to lash out at O'Reilly while expressing frustration about O'Reilly not inviting him on his show to talk about the arrest, so that he could understand Snoop. The footage gained global notoriety after it was uploaded on YouTube, where it reached more than 1,000,000 views. Bill O'Reilly responded on his show, mocking Snoop Dogg for bashing him and the Netherlands for letting Snoop Dogg in the country, something which increased not only Snoop Dogg's popularity in The Netherlands, but also Robert Jensen's popularity.

Typically, the area of the body corresponds to a point on the primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus). This cortex is typically represented as a sensory homunculus which orients the specific body parts and their respective locations upon the homunculus. Areas such as the appendages, digits, penis, and face can draw their sensory locations upon the somatosensory cortex. The areas which are finely controlled (e.g., the digits) have larger portions of the somatosensory cortex whereas areas which are coarsely controlled (e.g., the trunk) have smaller portions. Areas such as the viscera do not have sensory locations on the post central gyrus. Macaques, a kind of monkey, already exhibit somatotopy in their somatosensory and motor systems at birth. Sensorimotor mapping of the human cerebellum Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to determine areas of activation in the cerebellar cortex in humans during a series of motor tasks. The activation areas for movements of lips, tongue, hands, and feet were determined and found to be sharply confined to lobules and sublobules and their sagittal zones in the rostral and caudal spinocerebellar cortex. The activation mapped as two distinct homunculoid representations. One, a more extended representation, was located upside down in the superior cerebellum, and a second one, doubled and smaller, in the inferior cerebellum.Grodd W, H√ºlsmann E, Lotze M, Wildgruber D, Erb M.

NSPS replaced the General Schedule (GS) grade and step system for the DoD with a pay band system intended to provide more flexibility in establishing pay levels. NSPS had differing policies concerning tenure, hiring, reassignment, promotion, collective bargaining, pay, performance measurement and recognition, etc. It purportedly retained EEO and Veterans' Preference protections although the system was not in place long enough to tell whether or not this was true. There was a significant level of controversy as to whether or not the flexibility gained with the new system was at the expense of the Federal employees within DoD and whether or not the flexibility gained came at a bureaucratic price requiring significantly more effort on the part of managers to document performance and manage compensation. Pay increases that were automatic under the GS system did not exist under NSPS. On October 29, 2009, this pay system was repealed, restoring all DoD employees to the General Schedule by January 1, 2012. Pay schedules NSPS defined several pay schedules (PS) within four Career Groups (CG), all which break down pay into two or more pay bands (PB).NSPS Handbook =Standard Career Group= The Standard career group included four pay schedules: *Professional/Analyst (YA) This PS included positions in both professional and analytical occupations, to include attorneys. It consisted of three PB. *Technician/Support (YB) This PS comprised technician and support work in the CG and included three PB. *Supervisor/Manager (YC) This PS was for employees who supervise work in the Standard CG. There were three PB. *Student (YP) This program provided for noncompetitive appointments of students to Federal positions. =Scientific and Engineering Career Group= The Scientific and Engineering career group covered professional, technician, and supervisory work in the engineering and scientific disciplines. It included three pay schedules: * Professional (YD) Work classified in this schedule was limited to professional engineering and science disciplines. It had three PB. * Technician/Support (YE) This PS comprised specialized technician work in support of professional engineering and scientific work. It had four PB. * Supervisor/Manager (YF) This PS was for employees who supervise work in the Scientific and Engineering CG. It had three PB. =Medical Career Group= The Medical career group consisted of four pay schedules: * Physician/Dentist (YG) This PS was limited to physicians and dentists based on distance compensation practices and career progression. It had just two PB. * Professional (YH). All other professionals in the medical field were covered by this PS. It had three PB. * Technician/Support (YI) This PS included specialized technician and other medical and health support work. It had three PB. * Supervisor/Manager (YJ) Employees who supervise work in the Medical CG were classified in this PS. There were four PB. Only supervisory physicians and dentists were eligible for PB4. =Investigative and Protective Services Career Group= The Investigative and Protective Services career group had four pay schedules: * Investigative (YK) This PS covered investigative and security work and consisted of three PB. * Fire Protection (YL) This applied to fire fighters, fire chiefs, and fire protection inspectors/specialists. It had four PB. * Police/Security Guard (YM) This PS had two PB and applied exclusively to two occupations: police officer and security guard. * Supervisor/Manager (YN) Employees who supervise work in the Investigative and Protective Services CG were classified in this PS. There were three PB. Controversy An analysis of NSPS by Federal Times, a branch of the Defense News Media Group, in August 2008 found that the January 2008 issuance of performance-based pay raises and bonuses, the first large-scale payout under the new system, was filled with inequalities. The analysis found that white employees received higher average performance ratings, salary increases and bonuses than employees of other races and ethnicities. Also, employees working at DoD agencies, such as the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Tricare, the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, earned higher performance ratings and payouts overall than did their civilian counterparts in the three military service branches: United States Army, United States Navy, and United States Air Force.Losey, Stephen, \\"Is DoD's New Pay System Fair?\\", Federal Times, August 11, 2008. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) stated that the analysis supported their concerns about the new system. Brian DeWyngaert, AFGE chief of staff, said, \\"These systems can have a discriminatory impact. Whether it‚Äôs intended or unintended, it happens nevertheless.\\"Losey, Stephen, \\"Is DoD's New Pay System Fair?\\", Federal Times, August 11, 2008. Legislation In June 2009 Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH) was successful in attaching provisions in the House Armed Services Committees‚Äô version of the Fiscal Year 2010 NDAA that would greatly restrict the implementation and potentially the very existence of the NSPS, and the Secretary of Defense would have 6 months to decide if the program warranted keeping. He would have to report to Congress that substantial improvements had been made to the pay-for-performance system. The bill called for returning all employees under NSPS back to the GS system within one year of the bill becoming law. For the full text see House Resolution 2647 RH Section 1112. Repeal On October 29, 2009, President Barack Obama signed legislation repealing NSPS and restoring DOD employees to their previous pay systems. Full implementation of this legislation was to occur no later than January 1, 2012. NSPS superseded by similar systems NSPS provisions have migrated to other systems such as \\"Interim GS\\" or Science and Technology Reinvention Laboratory (STRL) provisions so that the government can continue its experimentation.

It was released in North America on August 28, 2007 and is powered by Vicious Cycle's proprietary Vicious Engine. It features a premise that is a combination of 1940s-style noir and contemporary horror, dubbed \\"twisted noir\\" by the design team. The game is a single-player experience whose title character, Fred Neuman, is a private investigator with the ability to switch heads. Fred has recently been murdered and decapitated, and has few memories of the events leading to his death. The plot follows Fred as he pieces together the clues of his murder and tries to get revenge on the man who killed him. Unlike many action game heroes, Fred has no conventional weapons‚Äîhe relies solely on the powers available to him from the severed heads of fallen enemies. The game received generally positive reviews, with reviewers mentioning its dark humor and noir-inspired motif as high points. It received criticism for its controls and lack of combat depth. In 2008, it won the Writers Guild of America's first-ever award for video game writing. Dead Head Fred was later made available on PlayStation Vita.  Gameplay  Dead Head Fred is a third-person action-adventure game that incorporates a variety of gameplay styles, including combat, platforming, and puzzles. The core gameplay of Dead Head Fred revolves around Fred's missing head and his ability to \\"switch\\" heads by defeating certain enemies, decapitating them, and collecting their heads (referred to as \\"headhunting\\"). As Fred explores the city of Hope Falls, he can collect an assortment of heads, each of which has unique abilities. Examples include the Stone Idol head, which Fred can use as a battering ram, and the Corpse head, which can be used to suck up and spit out water, gasoline, and other materials. Fred uses these heads to navigate the city of Hope Falls, and certain parts of the city are not accessible until certain heads are found. The high level of radiation in Hope Falls has led to a proliferation of grossly mutated worms, which the player can collect and use to upgrade Fred's heads and temporarily increase his fighting abilities, among other benefits. Also collectible are money and special items, which can be earned by defeating enemies or completing various side-missions. There are several minigames unrelated to the plot, such as pinball and fishing, scattered around the city. Fred, with the Bone head equipped, removing the head of an enemy. In combat, players have several attacks at their disposal, depending on the head Fred is equipped with. These attacks include combos, head-specific counterattacks, and ranged attacks. During a counterattack, the player can complete a Quick Time Event to instantly kill an enemy by removing its head, which gives Fred \\"Rage\\" points. Rage energy builds up over time, and the player can use it to unleash powerful attacks on multiple foes. Dealing a large amount of damage to an opponent will stun them, during which time Fred can remove their head. Collected heads can be traded at \\"Head Shops\\" for a usable version. There are several types of environmental puzzles that the player has to solve in order to progress through the game. Each one requires a specific head‚Äîthe Bone head gives Fred sharp claws which allow him to climb on the sides of buildings, while the Shrunken head decreases his size dramatically and lets him navigate platforming levels, such as a saw mill. There is also a mannequin head that Fred must use to socialize with the residents of Hope Falls, because they are terrified of his other heads. There are nine available heads, seven of which are suitable for combat.  Plot  = Setting = Dead Head Fred takes place in Hope Falls, New Jersey, a once- prosperous area based on American cities in the 1940s. The city has steadily fallen from grace since a business mogul named Ulysses Pitt began accumulating power. Pitt has a background of petty crime, and there are allegations that he was somehow responsible for the disappearance of Vinni Rossini, an influential Hope Falls businessman. Pitt's new \\"Nukular Plant\\" has recently finished construction and has caused a high level of radiation in the city, leading to strange phenomena like mutated wildlife and undead monsters. Hope Falls is composed of several areas. The first that Fred has access to is Dr. Steiner's castle, the ancestral home of the Steiner family where Fred has been resurrected. Outside of the castle is a large cemetery that borders the forested area of Creepy Hollow. In Hope Falls proper are the urban areas of Downtown, Uptown, Old Hope Falls and Zombietown. Downtown is the home of Pitt's headquarters, and Fred's office is found in Old Hope Falls. Zombietown, as its name suggests, is overrun with zombies and most of its residents have fled the neighborhood or barricaded themselves in their homes. Two other rural areas border the city: Freak Farms, where Fred owns a small cabin, and the Boonies, a highly irradiated area where the Nukular Reactor has been built. Each area contains several teleporters in the form of sewer manholes, which Fred can use to quickly move from one area of Hope Falls to another. = Characters = The protagonist of Dead Head Fred is Fred Neuman (voiced by John C. McGinley), a private detective. Fred is the only playable character, but since each head gives him a different set of animations, he could be considered nine separate characters. As he does not have a proper face, Fred's mood is portrayed by the tone of his voice and by face-like expressions formed by his eyes and frontal lobes. Fred has a wisecracking, sarcastic personality and occasionally breaks the fourth wall, such as heckling the player when he dies. Ulysses Pitt (Jon Polito), the game's primary antagonist, is a small- time hoodlum turned racketeer. Pitt employs many henchmen throughout Hope Falls, the most prominent of which is his lieutenant Lefty, whose right leg has been amputated and replaced with a tommygun. Fred makes several allies throughout the game, including Dr. Steiner, who resurrected him, his girlfriend Jeanne Rossini (Kari Wahlgren), and his former partner Benny Salazar. Fred's enemies are generally employees of Pitt, like the skeletal \\"bone thugs\\", or creatures created by Hope Falls' radiation, like zombies and animated scarecrows. = Story = The game begins with Fred waking up in the castle of a Dr. Freidrich Steiner, an employee of Ulysses Pitt. Fred soon learns that he has been murdered and subsequently resurrected, and his head is missing. In its place is a liquid-filled jar that contains his brain and eyes. Steiner explains that Fred is a private detective who had been investigating Pitt, but Pitt had discovered that Fred was on to him and had him murdered. Many of Fred's memories are missing as a result of the trauma to his brain, and before Steiner can explain further, Pitt and several of his henchmen arrive. As Fred hides in Steiner's lab, Pitt's thugs apprehend Steiner and announce that he is to be taken to the Horseman, a minion of Pitt's who resides in Creepy Hollow. Fred leaves Steiner's castle and meets a blue- skinned hunchback in the cemetery outside. The hunchback introduces himself as Sam Spade, a gravedigger and \\"head merchant\\" who can help Fred by providing him with quality interchangeable heads. Fred continues to Creepy Hollow, where he defeats the Horseman and rescues Dr. Steiner. Steiner, however, has little information regarding Fred's investigation and suggests that he question the residents of Hope Falls to learn more about his demise. Fred begins exploring Hope Falls, meeting many strange personalities along the way. He reconnects with his old girlfriend Jeanne, who is the daughter of a prominent Hope Falls citizen, Vinni Rossini. Fred learns that Mr. Rossini had been reported missing by Jeanne, and Jeanne had subsequently hired Fred to find him. Fred had eventually followed the trail to Pitt, who had bribed Fred's partner, Benny Salazar, into betraying him. Fred was promptly caught by Pitt's henchmen and shot to death by his right-hand man, Lefty. Armed with the knowledge of his death and the events leading up to it, Fred continues his investigation and recovers a videotape of Vinni Rossini's murder that incriminates Pitt. Pitt learns that Fred is still \\"alive\\" and kidnaps Jeanne to use as leverage against him. Fred confronts the mobster at his headquarters after shutting down the centerpiece of his criminal enterprise, the Pitt Nukular Plant, and defeating Lefty. Lefty, however, was exposed to nuclear waste during the fight and subsequently mutated into a huge beast who comes to Pitt's aid in the game's final battle. Fred ultimately defeats both Pitt and Lefty atop the Pitt Building. Pitt is killed during the battle, but Lefty manages to escape and retreats to the remains of the Nukular Plant. After the battle, Fred's head, which, along with Jeanne, had been held hostage by Pitt, is shown tumbling into an open manhole near the Pitt Building, unbeknownst to Fred. The final scene of the game shows Fred and Jeanne having dinner at a restaurant to celebrate, with Fred lamenting the loss of his head.  Development  = Geo = Geo, the original incarnation of Fred. Dead Head Fred uses the Vicious Engine, a game engine created and maintained by game design company Vicious Cycle Software. Considered \\"middleware\\" in the video game industry, the engine was designed as a simple set of creation tools that could be used across multiple consoles. The game was originally conceived as a platform game based on the character \\"Geo.\\" Vicious Cycle's president, Eric Peterson, and some of his staff developed a conceptual world called \\"Prime\\" where Geo lived. Geo had the ability to switch his head between several different shapes (a cube, sphere, cylinder, and pyramid) that would help him solve puzzles, fight, and move around Prime in his quest to stop the evil King Rhombus, who was trying to destroy Prime. Each of Geo's shaped heads had unique properties that gave him different abilities‚Äîthe sphere head allowed him to roll around very quickly, for example. The Geo concept was described by the development team as similar to other platform games like Rayman or Spyro, and skewed towards a younger audience. When the concept was complete, the development team presented it to several publishers, who stated that they liked the idea but its geometry-based core too strongly resembled \\"edutainment\\", and that they were interested in developing a more edgy, adult premise. The Nintendo GameCube had been an early choice for hosting the game before the PSP was chosen. = Noir setting = Vicious Cycle went back to the drawing board and produced a new concept that they felt was darker and better suited to an older audience. The \\"head-switching\\" game mechanic had been praised by the potential publishers and was kept, but this time the cartoonish, childlike Geo was replaced by an angry, vengeful private detective named Fred Neuman. The world of Prime was replaced with the bleak, film noir-esque city of Hope Falls, where Fred would seek revenge against those who had wronged him. Vicious Cycle presented the new project to Sony, who promptly approved the game for the PSP, despite it not having secured a publisher. Shortly afterwards, the project was picked up by D3Publisher. Vicious Cycle then submitted the concept to art company Massive Black Studios to develop initial character sketches. Massive Black's artists were allowed to use their imagination while developing Fred, but the one stipulation Vicious Cycle made from the beginning was Fred's head‚Äîthe developers wanted it to be a liquid-filled jar with the detective's brain and eyes floating around inside. Massive Black came up with several different versions of Fred, including some with guns, which lead designer Adam Cogan had already decided the game would not include. After receiving the sketches, Vicious Cycle chose several that portrayed Fred with a squat, childlike appearance that retained some of the youthful focus of the scrapped Geo project. The publisher, D3, decided to present all of the concept art to a test group. To the developers' surprise, the test group was much more interested in a darker, more intimidating portrayal of Fred than the cartoonish, playful look they had chosen. The developers decided to flesh out the concept and took the chosen sketches back to Massive Black. This time the art came back darker, with similarities to Dirty Harry and The Matrix and The Evil Dead, and a Norman Rockwell-inspired look that would influence the game's art style towards a more violent theme. = Further testing = D3 provided the development team with more focus groups, and as a result, the game slowly incorporated more combat and less platforming and puzzles. Fred's combat capabilities were revamped to give him more attacks, counterattacks and combinations. D3 also gave Vicious Cycle more time to develop the game, with the hope of receiving better reviews and potentially turning Dead Head Fred into a franchise. The delay pushed back the game's release from January to August 2007. D3Publisher bought Vicious Cycle two months before the game's release, but the company's headquarters remained in North Carolina and the staff was retained.  Audio  = Soundtrack = The music of Dead Head Fred was composed by Rod Abernethy and Jason Graves and recorded at Abernethy's studio, Rednote Audio. Abernethy and Graves had worked on previous games by Vicious Cycle, like Curious George. The composers were interested in developing a sound for Dead Head Fred that was retro-futuristic, and borrowed from other death-themed pieces like Stubbs the Zombie and Beetlejuice. The development team did not have any substantial ideas for the game's music beyond the theme and mood of Hope Falls, giving the composers free rein on the soundtrack's direction. = Voice work = A crucial area of development was the formation of the game's mood, theme, and story to give it a dark, yet humorous quality. Hiring a Hollywood screenwriter to create the script was proposed, but ultimately Vicious Cycle designer Dave Ellis was given the task of writing the game's cutscenes and voiceover script, while Cogan focused on the in-game dialog. Ellis referred to several noir films for inspiration, especially Miller's Crossing and Who Framed Roger Rabbit During this time, Eric Peterson cast several voice actors, including John C. McGinley from the TV show Scrubs and Jon Polito from the aforementioned Miller's Crossing. McGinley was cast as Fred because of his Scrubs character's sarcasm and wit, while Polito was cast in the role of mob boss Ulysses Pitt, which was very similar to his role of Johnny Caspar in Miller's Crossing. The development team then set about recording the game's dialog, which proved to be challenging because of Vicious Cycle's location on the East Coast. All of the recordings were done over the phone at a studio in Hollywood. Despite this, and the fact that Fred alone had over 1000 lines of in-game dialog, the recording went smoothly, with the exception of one unidentified actor who walked out in the middle of a session. The original script had only one instance of the word \\"fuck\\", but several recording sessions with McGinley resulted in a great deal of colorful improvisation. The design team liked the recordings and the script was modified to permit McGinley and other actors to curse more. McGinley focused on portraying Fred as \\"pissed off\\" and \\"having a chip on his shoulder\\" because his head was missing.  Promotion and release  Dead Head Fred was first announced at the Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) video game convention in May 2006, where a trailer was shown to the public. Following this, little was heard about the game until Cogan started a developer diary on Vicious Cycle's website in March 2007. Three diary entries were written by Cogan and Ellis, which provided details about the game's pre- production conceptualization and voice work. In May 2007, D3 announced that John C. McGinley would be voicing Fred, and the next month the company issued a press release stating that the game was finished and ready for mass production. However, the game was delayed, allowing D3 Publisher to show it at E3 2007. It was eventually released on August 28, 2007 in North America after nearly two years of development. It was released on October 26 in Europe, November 2 in Australia, and March 19, 2008 in Japan. In December 2007, D3 reduced the price of the game, and in October 2008 it was made available for download on Sony's PlayStation Network. The soundtrack was released on iTunes by Lakeshore Records on September 18, 2007. = Future = Dead Head Fred was designed specifically for the PSP, and Vicious Cycle intended it to be their \\"flagship\\" title for the system. However, the game's designers hinted that the game could potentially be ported to the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade with a few months' work. As of March 2009, D3Publisher announced a sequel, but the designers stated that subsequent titles were discussed during the game's development. John C. McGinley has expressed interest in reprising Fred. Namco Bandai Games (the parent of D3) were impressed with the game and wanted to publish the sequel because they \\"wanted\\" to test out Vicious Cycle's gameplay on the PSP. Unfortunately, Vicious Cycle was shut down in 2016 and its publisher D3 Publisher of America has shifted its focus to mobile gaming a year before (changing its name to D3 GO!), making the future of the game unknown.  Reception  Dead Head Fred received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game's writing and dialogue were considered the main strengths of the game, with GameSpy's reviewer stating that \\"In the vast sea of PSP titles, Dead Head Fred stands 'head and shoulders' above the rest.\\" IGN said \\"The tale of revenge in a dark world is twisted [and] unapologetically humorous\\". Other publications were not as impressed, however, with one reviewer stating \\"...the overused profanity just makes it feel like it's been designed by teenagers desperately trying to be edgy.\\" The game's supernatural themes elicited comparisons to The Darkness and Grim Fandango. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli felt that PSP games often lacked creativity and that Dead Head Fred was the exception. Many reviewers were pleased with the game's premise and setting, variously describing it as \\"weird\\", \\"wacky\\" and \\"silly\\". Hope Falls, especially the area of Creepy Hollow, was compared to the work of Tim Burton. Dead Head Fred's graphics were warmly received, with GameSpy noting \\"The game looks simply phenomenal on the PSP screen.\\" Pocket Gamer UK said \\"graphically the game won't blow your head off but it is undeniably stylish.\\" Pocket Gamer also felt that the game's level design, with its emphasis on changing heads to solve environmental puzzles, made up for the \\"mediocre combat system\\". The character design was praised; GameSpy said \\"Fred is one of the most interesting and entertaining characters to ever hit gaming,\\" and GameZone said \\"Fred‚Äôs freakish form is like looking at a car crash ‚Ä¶ you really don‚Äôt want to stare but you just can‚Äôt help it.\\" The voice acting, in particular John C. McGinley's portrayal of Fred, was widely praised, as was the rest of the game's audio. GameZone's Natalie Romano said \\"There‚Äôs also some great music in the game and the sound effects are...wonderfully detailed\\". The focal point of reviewers' criticism was Dead Head Fred's gameplay, specifically the combat. It was generally considered tedious and repetitive. Australia's PAL Gaming Network described the combat as \\"one of the poorest elements of the game\\", and Game Informer called the combat mechanics \\"awful\\". The performance of the camera was also criticized, with IGN noting \\"Considering that the camera will sometimes choose some horrible angles for you in battle or during puzzles, it's annoying to have to fight it as well as mutants that want you dead.\\" GameZone said \\"I just wish the camera wouldn‚Äôt be such a hindrance sometimes.\\" Reviewers were also unhappy with Dead Head Fred's loading times; Eurogamer considered them \\"excessively high\\", and IGN said \\"The only downside that crops up when it comes to the visuals are the continual loading times on just about every single area.\\" = Awards = Dead Head Fred was nominated for several awards, including the Writers Guild of America's first award for video game writing, which it won. During E3 2007, the game was nominated for the Best of E3 2007: Best Handheld Game award by the Game Critics Awards, a group of prominent media journalists. Dead Head Fred lost to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS, but was notable for being the only new intellectual property nominated in the handheld category. The audio was nominated for two awards at the Game Audio Network Guild's 6th annual ceremony, Best Soundtrack of the Year and Best Handheld Audio. Dead Head Fred lost to BioShock and Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, respectively.

He was the owner of the Mushandirapamwe Hotel in Highfield, Harare and others. In 1960 he was the first black person to purchase a 1,872.0-hectare commercial farm (Zimdale farm in Marondera) from a white farmer, in the then colonial system by a racist white minority of Southern Zimbabwe He went on to purchase other surrounding farms to Zimdale, namely: Sandra farm, Keal (B) farm and Mhendamu. To mark another historic milestone, having purchased five farms (Sheba, Shaka Hills, Billiard, Vuma and another in Hwedza) in one transaction, Tawengwa and his wife Mabel Rose Tawengwa (n√©e Gwanzura - of Shava totem) were featured in a 1977 edition of the Rhodesia Herald (currently The Herald Zimbabwe) as a prominent couple in the African business community.. Previously he bought two other commercial farms at Chemagora near Gokwe which he bequeathed to his two eldest sons Garikayi and Solomon when he was still alive. Family Tawengwa was a polygamist. He had seven spouses who bore twenty children. Below is a list of children and their respective mothers in chronological order:- First Spouse * Garikayi Chirume Tawengwa (born on 7 July 1937) * Nellia (Neria) Tawengwa (born on 15 June 1940) Second Spouse * Solomon Chirume Tawengwa (born on 15 June 1940) * Gabriel Maoni Tawengwa (born on 23 March 1946) * Felicitas Tawengwa (born on TBA ) Third Spouse * Edwin Tawengwa (born on 24 April 1945) Fourth Spouse * Joseph Tawengwa (born on 14 July 1949) * Tito Tawengwa (born on 4 September 1951) * Dorothy Tawengwa - Makwaza (born on TBA) Fifth Spouse * Christopher Chirume Tawengwa (born on 15 June 1950) Sixth Spouse * Godfrey Maruva Quest Tawengwa - 1st twin (born on 21 April 1954) * Charles Zvidzayi Tawengwa - 2nd twin (born on 21 April 1954) * Aggrey Tichaona Tawengwa (born on 21 March 1956) * George Nhamoinesu Tawengwa (born on 1 January 1958) * Tendayi Edgar Tawengwa (born on 17 November 1959) * Noble Tazvitadza Tawengwa (born 03 Feb 1964) * Bright Mugove Davison Tawengwa (born on 21 September 1966) * Blessing Nyarai. Tawengwa (born on 3 May 1969) Seventh Spouse * Takawira Tawengwa (born on 10 April 1969) * Amon Tawengwa (born on 4 March 1971) Early life and Prophecy Tawengwa was born to Chirume and Maria (Mhariya) of the Gumbo Madyira totem and had an elder brother Takawira Chirume who died within the first two years of birth and a younger brother Bernard Chamunorwa Chirume. His mother died when he was only 4 years old in 1919. It is rumoured she was poisoned, as a consequence of polygamous rivalry. Thereafter the true dynamics of the father and son relationship are not fully known, but were chronicled as not the most cordial. At one point folklore has it that the young George became very ill to the point of death. His father decided to call a prophet to identify and possibly cure him of this affliction. At this time he was now housed in a make shift shelter made of grass and tree branches, some distance from the homestead. Such shelters were designed to protect the dignity and privacy of a very sick person in their last days. However the prophet gave an intriguing revelation on the cause of sickness, as a sign that he had been chosen by the gods for a mission. To reignite a lost cause and to one day handover the baton to the next generation. And would become a very wealthy and prominent person, that will make history. On hearing this, his father and the whole village laughed and dismissed the prophecy as absolute nonsense. However time proved the prophet right. Then when he was about 12 years old, he mistakenly picked a piece of meat from the plate before his father. Who was so infuriated by his disrespect to the point of reaching for his spear and threw it at him. Which inflicted a deep cut on his right calf, of what could have been a fatal strike. It was at that very moment he runaway from home: limping, bleeding, bear footed and crying; with only the clothes on his back. Some days later he ended up at Grinham Farm in Marandellas (Marondera) where Ruzawi School is today. There he started his first job as a shepard, working for Rev.Canon Robert Grinham, the founder of Ruzawi school and Springvale House. It was during this period Mrs Grinham drew a painting of him herding sheep. And she was to bring this painting to him some 40 years later in the late 1960s, at his house, 198 Ruzawi Road, Marandellas (opposite Show grounds) about 3 kilometers from the Grinham farm. Using Tawengwa as surname Because of the disgruntlement with his father he later dropped the surname Chirume in favour of his middle name Tavengwa, which was misspelt in some early documents as Tayengwa, and later anglicised to the current Tawengwa by white District Administrators (DAs). Tavengwa literally translates to, we are hated, given to him by his mother to signify how she was tormented and treated as an outcast by other family members during time she was in a polygamous relationship with Chirume. The two boys George and Bernard are said to have suffered greatly at the hands of their stepmother. Though George had it worse and like his mother Maria, he was also treated as an outcast, never sent school like his half siblings. The still adolescent George left Grinham farm when he was about 15 years and secured his second job at the Meikles hotel where he was employed as a dishwasher. Tawengwa was identified as a clever young man and he was soon promoted to become a waiter. Then Tawengwa lived at Joburg Lines in Harare Township now Mbare. The young and charismatic Tawengwa would get a lot of tips as a waiter and he used the money to buy a wood planer, mesh wire and wood off-cuts to make sieves which people needed to refine their maize mealie-meal amongst other grain mealie-meals. There was a huge demand and ready market for these sieves. And Tawengwa made enough capital for other ventures as chronicled below in the article Successful Man of Business about his early accomplishments in business. The Dream The story that he widely shared with his children, is how he walked on foot between Chingondo in Hwedza and then Salisbury (now Harare) leading a train of donkeys loaded with grain to sell in Harare and bringing back cloths (fabrics) to barter with grain amongst village folk in the Chingondo area. Story culminates on how one day on the return leg he had to sleep enroute to Hwedza in this large white commercial farm. That night he had a dream that one day he would own the very farm he is sleeping in. Given the sheer size of the farm, nearly 2000 hectares, it was his turn to laugh at the prophetic dream. This would have been sometime between 1941 and 1947. However true to this vision, he purchased Rhodesdale farm (now Zimdale farm) in 1960. Pain makes you stronger, tears make you braver, and heartbreaks make you wiser, so thank the past for a better future. - Unknown Successful businessman From Ruzawi in Marandellas (Marondera) he moved to Salisbury (Harare) probably around 1931. To take up employment as a dishwasher, then waiter at Meikles Hotel. It was at this time an idea was birthed that one day he would also own a Hotel. In November 1953 aged 38, The African Parade Magazine (now called The Parade) wrote an article titled \\"Successful Man of Business\\" about his early accomplishments in business. The African Parade Magazine Article of George TAWENGWA titled Successful Man of Business. November 1953 Issue. Here is an extract from article above:- Business accomplishments He later established Mushandira Pamwe Bus Service with a fleet of over 150 buses. The Mushandira Pamwe Buses. Started in 1947 and fleet later grew to over 150 buses. George Tawengwa had several retail outlets throughout Zimbabwe, including his first major building project Mushandira Pamwe Centre in Dombotombo, Marondera. The Mushandira Pamwe Center in Dombotombo, Marondera. Built in the 1960s He was the first black man to own a commercial farm in colonial Rhodesia. He went on to acquire eight more commercial farms, each one averaging at least 1000 hectares each. A year before his death he had set in motion a regional expansion plan first to neighbouring Mozambique, a vision that was never fulfilled. The trading name Mushandira Pamwe means \\"working together as one\\". He believed as one much more could be accomplished. Therefore, unity is key for success. Mushandirapamwe Hotel was at Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, the transitional residence of returning ZANU PF Officials and ZANLA troops. His sons are all entrepreneurs and farmers, with Charles Tawengwa and Solomon Tawengwa having served as mayors of Harare. Solomon Tawengwa served as Member of Parliament for Highfields between 1987 and 1990, a seat that had been made vacant when the then Prime Minister of Zimbabwe was elevated to the Executive Presidency. He also served twice as mayor of Harare, and became Harare's first Executive Mayor.

Death and Burial George Tawengwa Senior. Photo taken in the early 1980s before he passed in 1982 George Tawengwa succumbed to diabetes and died on 13 April 1982 at Parerenyatwa Hospital in Harare, aged 67. He was buried at Zimdale Farm (then Rhodesdale Farm), the first farm he purchased in 1960. May his soul rest in peace and quiet. Origins and Lineage Tawengwa was of Royal ancestry. His totem (mutupo) was Nzou (elephant) and Matemai (matemavi, matemayi) as the honorific name. The totem evolved from Shiri- Hungwe then to Nzou Samanyanga. An account of its origins is necessary to cite historical facts about Nyatsimba Mutota. Who was a prince at Great Zimbabwe, son to the King, Chibatamatosi of the Shiri-Hungwe totem and lineage. When Mutota migrated north to setup in the Zambezi Valley area, with his royal capital at Zvongombe. He proceeded to conquer the Tavara (of the Nzou Nhari une/ine Ndoro totem) assuming their sacred animal title, the Elephant, as a totem, thus becoming Nzou Samanyanga (the Big Elephant). At the same time taking control of the salt deposits and gold mines, establishing the foundations of the Mhunumutapa Empire. Prior to Great Zimbabwe the now Nzou Matemai clan migrated South from Nubia (Sudan today) where the Kings are revered to as Kore, and to this day the tribe in Zimbabwe is referred to as maKore-Kore (the Royals - the Kings). Matemai means Kings of the land. The root word \\"Tema\\" meaning \\"to cut\\" land or distribute land. To this day Chiefs around the Great Lakes region in Tanganyika (Mbire and Mwanza in Tanzania) are referred to as Tema or Temi. The same tribe is attributed to burying Kings in Pyramids as evidenced in the Khartoum desert in Sudan, a practice later grandsized by later Pharaohs. A verse in the Matemai Nzou praise poetry refers to then as \\"those that build stone houses\\" (\\"vachivaka na-mabwe\\" or \\"vano vaka dzimba na-mabwe\\"). Today descendants of TAWENGWA are of the Chief Chikwaka Royal house with their chieftainship in the Goromonzi district. Chief Chikonyora was a son of Chief Chikwaka. Chikonyora bore Manongovere, a great warrior, and the father of Chirume, and Chirume was father to George TAWENGWA. Other notable names in the ancestral lineage are Cheza and Benhura. Origins and Lineage - Cheza and Benhura The significance of Cheza and Benhura in the ancestral lineage, requires understanding of what transpired in the formative years of the Second Mhunhumutapa State. Why King Mutiwaora's (1806) reign only lasted less than a year? Below are names of Kings from the Second Mhunumutapa State beginning 1803 ending 1902: * Changara II (1803-1804) * Mutiwapangome (1804-1806) * Mutiwaora (1806) * Chipfumba (1806-1807) * Nyasoro (1807-1828) * Chimininyambo or Kandeya II (1828-1830) * Dzeka (1830-1849) * Kataruza (1849-1868) * Kandeya III (1868-1870) *Dzuda (1870-1887) * Chioko Dambamupute (1887-1902) In the Nzou Matemai praise poetry (last paragraph) special thanks and mention is only attributed to one of these Kings, Mutiwaora (1806) and acknowledgment of two ancestors, Cheza and Benhura. According to historical facts King Mutiwaora was deposed and killed by Chipfumba (1806 - 1807). After Mutiwaora was murdered, Chipfumba hatched a plan to kill all the descendants of Mutiwaora; to rise in kingship and rulership unopposed. Cheza and Benhura sensing danger decided to flee with Mutiwaora's descendants and seek refuge amongst their maternal uncles, the Tingini's Soko Murehwas of Washawasha. On reaching Murehwa (Chishawasha), a war erupted between the Buja (from Mutoko) and the Murehwa ethnic tribes. As seasoned warriors, the nephews joined their maternal uncles in battle. Fighting fearlessly and ultimately defeating the Buja. As a consequence earning a right to establish a kraal in the Goromonzi district. It is here George TAWENGWA was to be born some 109 years later in 1915 at Mwanza. The Body is the house of God. Man, Know Thyself, and thou shalt know the gods and God. - Ancient Nubian Proverb Nzou Matemai (Mbano Matemavi) Praise Poem Nzou Matemai (Mbano Matemavi) praise poetry was written by W.

Reading had been garrisoned by the Royalists in November 1642, and held 3,300 soldiers under the command of Sir Arthur Aston. On 14 April 1643, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex brought a Parliamentarian army of 19,000 men to lay siege to the town, and began bombarding the town two days later. During the siege, Aston was wounded and command of the garrison passed to Richard Feilding. On 25 April, Feilding requested a truce in order to negotiate the town's surrender. Despite a relief force commanded by King Charles I and Prince Rupert arriving the following day, Feilding held to the truce, and Essex's army was able to repel the relieving army. The surrender terms were agreed on 26 April, and the next day the Royalists left the town for Oxford. Background A map of Reading from 1611 In August 1642, King Charles I raised his royal standard in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension Parliament, to be traitors, marking the start of the First English Civil War. That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years. In October 1642, King Charles returned to Oxford from the indecisive Battle of Edgehill. He then proceeded cautiously towards London, going via Reading.Consequences of the battle of Edgehill. After being repelled from London, he retired back through Reading, where he left a Royalist garrison of 2,000 soldiers under Sir Arthur Aston, who was appointed as governor. Aston was unimpressed with the soldiers available to him, writing to Prince Rupert that he \\"could never have a greater affliction light on me than to be put in command of them\\". Reading, located on the main route between London and Oxford, was strategically significant both due to its location as a 'frontier' between these two military strongholds, and the fact that it was located at a crossing point of the River Thames. Prior to the war, the town had minimal defences, and Aston realised that to have any chance of holding the town, these needed to be improved. Over the winter months, Aston oversaw the creation of a defensive line; a ditch with a raised earthen rampart linking a series of bastions. This form of fortification was known as a \\"continuous bastioned enceinte\\", and was common for Royalist defences during the Civil War. The ramparts were topped with stone from Reading Abbey, where they destroyed the church's nave specifically for the purpose. For the construction of the defences, Aston forced civilians from the town to work alongside his soldiers, and was described by Basil Morgan, his biographer in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, as \\"bullying his soldiers and the citizenry alike\\". Aston maintained strict discipline over his troops, and had several hanged for not meeting his standards. Aside from the forced labour, the Royalist garrison presented other difficulties for the town: at the time Reading had a population of around 5,000, upon which space had to be found to house the 2,000 Royalist soldiers. Furthermore, the building of the fortifications and the army's expenses were charged to the town. Amongst these expenses were Aston's salary, which was so large that he loaned money back to the town with interest. In Stuart Hylton's 2017 A‚ÄìZ of Reading: Places‚ÄìPeople‚ÄìHistory, he claims that: \\"In any list of unpopular figures in Reading's history, Sir Arthur Aston... must surely feature near the top.\\" Prelude In January 1643, the Parliamentarians learnt that Reading was poorly defended, so John Hampden and John Urry led a small force across the Chiltern Hills to scout the town. They only managed to get as far as the River Kennet, which they were unable to cross as it was so swollen. Over the winter, there were growing calls for peace, particularly on the Parliamentary side, and a compromise was presented to King Charles at Oxford in February 1643. Although the proposals were far less demanding than previously made by parliament, the King was unconvinced and responded with demands of his own for the return of his income and military assets. Further discussion ensued, in which the King demanded more and more, and in early April parliament withdrew from the negotiation process. Siege The Parliamentarian army which besieged Reading was led by the Earl of Essex. The Earl of Essex, commander-in-chief of the Parliamentarian army, marched an army of over 19,000 men (16,000 foot soldiers, 3,000 cavalry plus artillery) from Windsor, and arrived at Reading on 14 April. Essex bluffed the Reading garrison, making as though to continue onto Oxford, before he established his army to the south and west of the town, where the defensive works were the weakest, and captured Caversham Bridge, cutting Reading off from the main Royalist forces in Oxford. The Parliamentarians held a council of war, in which Essex sought advice on whether to attempt to storm the town, or to be more cautious and lay siege to it. While the cavalry officers favoured an aggressive approach, the infantry commanders preferred the more cautious path. Essex agreed to be cautious, aware that he could not afford to lose many men, as he would need them for his planned subsequent attack on Oxford. Essex demanded that the town surrender, and in response, Aston said that he would rather \\"starve and die\\" than give up Reading. Accordingly, the Parliamentarians blockaded Reading, and Essex established his headquarters in Southcote. By 16 April, the Parliamentarians had set up their artillery, and began to bombard the town. Two days later, around 700 Royalist musketeers commanded by Lieutenant General Wilmot managed to reinforce Reading via Sonning, to the east of the town. The blockade was subsequently tightened, surrounding the town on all sides. During the bombardment, falling debris struck Aston and apparently rendered him unable to speak. The Royalist historian, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon suggested that the affliction might not have been genuine, but rather a way of maintaining his reputation in a lost cause. Command of the garrison passed to Aston's second-in-command, Colonel Richard Feilding, on the basis that he was the most senior of Aston's colonels. On the morning of 25 April, Feilding displayed a white flag from the town walls, and established a truce in which to negotiate the town's surrender. The same day, a relief force commanded by King Charles and Prince Rupert attacked the Parliamentarian army at Caversham Bridge, but Feilding held to the truce, and the garrison did not join the battle. Feilding was pressured by some of his officers to break the truce and aid the relief force, but he refused, saying that it would be dishonourable, and that he would refuse, even \\"if the king himself should come and knock at the gate, and command him to do it.\\" Essex's army was able to repel the attack, and the relief force retreated. Feilding negotiated generous terms of surrender; he and his men were granted safe passage to Oxford with flying colours. On 27 April the Royalist soldiers marched from the town to Oxford; despite the promise of safe passage, some of the Royalist soldiers were robbed and disarmed, though Essex had tried to prevent such action by promising his men a reward. According to Morgan, Aston regained his ability to speak during the journey. Aftermath On 29 April, two days after leaving Reading, Feilding was court-martialled; charged with \\"several foul suspicious passages\\". At this early stage of the war, siege warfare in Britain was largely ineffective; methods that had been developed and refined in the European wars were applied without the skill and experience required. This led to additional suspicion being placed on commanders who surrendered while under siege. Feilding's trial lasted for two days, after which he was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was reprieved twice on the scaffold before the intervention of Prince Rupert led the King to pardon him. Despite his pardon, Feilding was still stripped of his regiment and position, and had thereafter had to fight as a volunteer. The capture of Reading meant the Parliamentarians could challenge Oxford directly, but Essex and William Waller were unable to coordinate their forces for an attack. Reading was held by the Parliamentarians until October, when they evacuated the town and it was retaken by the Royalists, but they in turn evacuated in the face of a Parliamentarian army the following May, and the town remained in the hands of Parliament for the remainder of the war.

Its hypothesis is that this likelihood is influenced most by the opportunities to settle at the destination, less by distance or population pressure at the starting point. Stouffer's law of intervening opportunities states, \\"The number of persons going a given distance is directly proportional to the number of opportunities at that distance and inversely proportional to the number of intervening opportunities.\\"Stouffer, American Sociological Review, December 1940, p.846 Stouffer theorises that the amount of migration over a given distance is directly proportional to the number of opportunities at the place of destination, and inversely proportional to the number of opportunities between the place of departure and the place of destination. These intervening opportunities may persuade a migrant to settle in a place in the route rather than proceeding to the originally planned destination. Stouffer argued that the volume of migration had less to do with distance and population totals than with the opportunities in each location. This is in contrast to Zipf's Inverse distance law. There are links with Ravenstein's laws of migration 2, 3 and 4.

Most higher education institutions give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools also give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Ford City Junior Senior High School just 33% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Ford City Junior Senior High School, December 2013 Graduation requirements The Armstrong School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 25 credits to graduate, including: a required class every year in math 4 credits, English 4 credits, social studies 4 credits, science 3 credits, Physical Education, Computer Science 0.5 credit, Community Service Learning .25 credit, Public speaking 0.5 credit, Living on Your Own 0.5 credit, Driver Education Theory 0.3 credit and other electives.Armstrong School Board, Program of Studies 2013-14, 1023 Beginning in grade 7, students have the opportunity to make up a maximum of two courses failed during the school year in summer school. Driver Education Theory is scheduled in grade ten as a required course. Behind-the- wheel driving lessons (six total hours) may be scheduled during after-school hours and after the Driver Education Theory course is completed. A $50 fee is charged for behind- the-wheel lessons. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their Individual Education Plan (IEP). Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Armstrong School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the district received $413,503. The district received $181,651 in 2008-09 for a total funding $595,154. Among the public school districts in Armstrong County the highest award was given to Armstrong School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Tuition Students who live in the Armstrong School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates at Armstrong School District for the Junior High Schools and Senior High Schools is $11,468.59. School safety and bullying The Armstrong School District administration reported there were six incidents of bullying in the district in 2012. Additionally, there were three incidents involving local police. There was an incident of terroristic threats and the Possession/Use of a Controlled Substances. Each year, the school safety data is reported by the Armstrong School District Administration to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The Armstrong School Board has provided the District's antibully policy online. By state law, Pennsylvania public schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and the Board is required to review its policy every three years. Additionally, Armstrong School District is mandated to conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Extracurricular activities The Armstrong School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and a costly, extensive sports program. Armstrong School Board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs.

Choe Yun-ui compiled the Sangjeong yemun (Hangul : ÏÉÅÏ†ïÏòàÎ¨∏, hanja : Ë©≥ÂÆöÁ¶ÆÊñá) with another 16 scholars. They collected all courtesies from ancient to present and published 50 copies. The publication of the Sangjeong yemun was very important for the Goryeo dynasty, because it established the system of official uniforms (that was still evolving at the time, during the 12th century), and thus the vertical rank of officials from king to subjects, specially during rituals. This was done to try to prevent conflicts of authority, and social unrest. Sangjeong yemun was published with movable metal type between 1234 and 1241. Yi Gyu-bo wrote postscript on behalf of Choi Yi which show how this book was published with movable metal type. According to this postscript, Choe Yi's father, Choe Chung-heon edited this book again because an older book lost some pages and the letters were unreadable. After he edited it, he copied two books and kept one copy in his home. Another book was kept in Yegwan, a unique research facility of Goryeo dynasty. By the time of the invasion of Mongol, he moved to Ganghwado and brought one copy of this book with him. Later, Cho Yi published 28 copies of this book with movable metal type and sent them to be kept in several local governments' offices. Also, owing to a long history of woodblock printing, Koreans of the period were accustomed to books, and literacy was high. The Chinese visitor X√º Jing, visiting Korea in 1123, observed in his travelogue that Koreans considered it shameful not to be able to read. Goryeo kingdom records indicate that a major printing effort, the 50 volume Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun (Prescribed Ritual Text of the Past and Present) was printed with cast metal around the 21st year of reign of King Gojong of the Goryeo dynasty (around 1234 AD). It is conjectured that some familiarity with movable type must have been available prior to this large effort. Another major publication, Nammyongcheonhwasang - Songjungdoga (Sermons of Song period Buddhist Priest Nammyongvhon) was printed with cast metal type in the 26th year of the reign of king Gojong (1239 AD). However, whether Choe Yun-Ui was involved in this effort or not is not known.

Science in Motion Kittanning Senior High School took advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 Clarion University provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region. College Remediation Rate According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 20% of the Armstrong School District High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment Kittanning Senior High School offers a Dual Enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Pennsylvania Department of Education - Dual Enrollment Guidelines. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions.Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement. site accessed March 2010. http://www.patrac.org/ For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $12,125 for the program. A total of 20 dual enrollment course options are available in the district throughout the school year in areas such as Music, Art, Psychology, Anthropology, Algebra, Calculus, Microeconomics, Spanish, French, History, and Political Science. Armstrong School District partners with Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), Butler County Community College (BC3) and California University of Pennsylvania (Cal U) to offer these courses. The course costs are discounted by up to 75%. Graduation requirements By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school.

Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. Kittanning Senior High School awards credits towards graduation to students who pass the school's AP class. At Armstrong School District the AP courses are weighted credits towards class ranking.Armstrong School District Administration, Advanced Placement Courses information for Parents and Students, 2013 At Kittanning Senior High School 24% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Kittanning Senior High School, December 2013 Wellness policy Armstrong School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006.Armstrong School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, April 24, 2006 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Armstrong School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced- price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 Armstrong School District has adopted a set of standards on foods to be served in schools. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. Armstrong School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. School safety and bullying The Armstrong School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying at Kittanning Senior High School in 2012. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. There were three incidents involving local police. The Armstrong School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online.Armstrong School Board, Bullying Cyber Bullying Policy 253, April 23, 2007 By state law, Pennsylvania public schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and the board is required to review its policy every three years. Additionally, Armstrong School District is mandated to conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Classrooms for the Future technology grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Armstrong School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, Armstrong School District received $413,503. The district received $181,651 in 2008-09 for a total funding $595,154. Among the public school districts in Armstrong County the highest award was given to Armstrong School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Tuition Students who live in the Armstrong School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates at the Junior High Schools and Senior High Schools is $11,468.59. Extracurriculars The Kittanning Senior High School students have access to clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by Armstrong School Board policies and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The district is mandated by state law to post its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website which outlines by sports its spending on sports, not including the cost of facilities.State Board of Education Regulations ‚Äì 22 PA Code Section 4.27, 12.1, 12.4; Discrimination in Athletics, 2012 By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics.

Early years Chanoch Dov Padwa was born on 17 August 1908 (20 Av 5668 in the Hebrew calendar) in Busk, a small town in Galicia (now Ukraine). His father, Eliezer Wolf, named him after the rabbi of nearby Alesk. At five years old, he moved with his family to Vienna to escape the First World War. From an early age, Chanoch Dov was known as an \\"ilui\\" (Talmudic prodigy), studying at the yeshiva of Tzelem, Hungary and in the Belzer Shtiebel in Cracow, Poland. A lifelong Belzer Chasid, he travelled to Belz from Cracow in 1926, to participate in the funeral of the Belzer Rebbe, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach. Besides studying in Vienna under Rabbi Chaim Pinter of Bukovsk, his primary teacher, Chanoch Dov was close to the Tchebiner Rov and the Rabbi of Teplik. With growing recognition as a highly gifted scholar, he married Chana Gittel, the daughter of Naphtoli Gottesman, secretary to the Hasidic master Rabbi Aharon of Belz (date unknown). His first employment was as the rabbi of synagogue in Vienna but he was arrested as an alien and imprisoned when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in the Anschluss of 1938. Rabbi Henoch, as he became affectionately known, was released just in time to escape WWII Europe by catching the very last ship bound for the British Mandate of Palestine. Accompanied by his wife and children he arrived at the port after its departure and was forced to chase the vessel with a small craft to get on board. The potential dangers of staying in Vienna had been so acute that he was advised by the Rabbi of Altstadt that he should even desecrate the Shabbat if necessary to help him leave, as remaining in Europe would be classed as pikuach nefesh. Rabbi Henoch's arrival in Jerusalem in August 1940 was greeted with great enthusiasm and he was nominated as pulpit rabbi of the Brod Synagogue. More importantly, his intellectual calibre was recognised when Jerusalem's Edah Charedis Beth Din appointed him dayan. This prestigious position brought him worldwide recognition and gave him religious jurisdiction over several communities in the Holy Land including the Botei Rand neighbourhood of Jerusalem where he was the designated rabbi. In 1946 while living in Jerusalem, his wife Chana Gittel died of pneumonia. Their five children would be raised by his second wife Yehudis, granddaughter of Jerusalem Chief-Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, whom he married in 1947. Move to England In 1955, Rabbi Dr Solomon Schonfeld, spiritual head of England's UOHC and rabbi of its Adath Yisroel synagogue, sent two rabbis to Jerusalem to select a senior rabbinical figure to head the Union's Beth Din. Rabbi Padwa was widely recommended to them by many, not least by the famed Gaon of Tchebin, as a fitting spiritual leader for London's Orthodox community. Rabbi Padwa accepted and relocated to London, where he would serve devotedly for the next 45 years. He set to work building up key institutions such as schools, synagogues, welfare organisations and homes for the elderly. He served as a teacher, legal judge in cases that go beyond the obvious religious realm, and a role model for the young. It was under his firm leadership that London grew to become a leading centre of Haredi Judaism. His influence was profound, felt throughout Western Europe and beyond. Despite becoming a world-renowned Halachic authority and a household name in the Jewish religious community, he lived modestly in Stamford Hill where he was consulted by rabbinical authorities and Jewish leaders from around the world. Halachic decisor Rabbi Padwa was known for an outstanding ability to issue Halachic rulings, as well as great skill in solving complex halachic problems. Although some of his rulings were controversial and thus well known, many of his most important Halachic decisions have entered the mainstream of Jewish law and are regarded as universal. His method of applying practical and humanist thinking to the code of Halacha was revolutionary and introduced his more modern approach to many chareidi rabbis. His oft repeated rejoinder to those who questioned his perceived laxity and willingness to adapt halachic dogma to accommodate new problems and knowledge was, 'Lo nitna Torah lemalachei hasharet', the Torah was not given for angels [but for human beings]. This sums up part of his philosophy. Still, some of his better known rulings include: * banning television in the home; He perceived TV as a pernicious influence. * opposing pre-nuptial agreements as a way of dealing with the aguna (chained wife) problem, claiming this undermined the fundamental principles of the Jewish marriage bond * opposing the creation and use of a northwest London Eruv after inspecting its outline route, on political grounds (he was not opposed to the concept of an eruv per se). Three volumes of his responsa, Cheishev Ho'ephod, containing many of Rabbi Padwa's halachic rulings, have appeared in print and function as precedents in halachic law. Another popular book on the laws of nidda, Poseach Shaar, written by his son-in-law Dayan Friedman, is credited to his authority. A very popular Sefer Halichos Chanoch entails a collection of halachic rulings, lessons and anecdotes collected by one of his closest students Rav A.Y. Schwartz of Vienna and compiled by his son Rav Zalmen Schwartz, was published in 2011. Death Following the death of his second wife in 1993 he married his third wife Reisel Tauber, a childless widow who dedicated herself to serving a man she respected deeply. She would eventually survive him by several years. In the last two years of his life, fighting growing mental frailty, Rabbi Henoch retired from effective leadership, but kept up religious activities such as officiating at weddings and the like. He acted as sandek (ceremonial holder of the baby) at a bris one day before he died. Rabbi Padwa died on 16 August 2000. Despite its timing and with most of the community away on vacation, his funeral in London was attended by around 2,000 people. His remains were flown to Jerusalem for burial, where a second, much larger funeral was held. The main eulogy there was delivered by Rabbi Shmuel Wosner, who noted the strong bond of friendship which had existed between himself and the deceased for seventy years, ever since they had known each other in Vienna. He stressed that great former Halachic authorities, such as Rabbi Yosef Zvi Dushinsky and the Gaon of Tchebin, had greatly admired Reb Henoch, and that he had gained much practical Halachic experience from serving under them. This, he said, greatly enhanced his abilities, and stature as a posek and precedent setter in Jewish law. He was buried in the rabbinical section of Har HaMenuchot. He was survived by his third wife, three sons, two daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The honorary officers of the UOHC announced the appointment of his youngest son, Rabbi Ephraim Padwa, as the new rabbinical head of the community. They hoped the Padwa name would help hold together an increasingly fractured community that could fast split up with Reb Henoch's death. Another son, Rabbi Yosef is a highly respected rabbinical authority, Rabbi Shalom Friedman, the oldest son-in-law, is a respected rabbi in the community as are many of the Padwa grandchildren.

Morris is known for his series of stories for preteen and teen readers based in the Middle Ages during the time of King Arthur. Collectively called \\"The Squire's Tales\\", the books blend retellings of traditional Arthurian Myths, such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Tristan and Iseult, with original plotlines. The books at the start of the series focus somewhat on Sir Gawain, but primarily on Terence, an original character and Gawain's squire. Although the two characters' roles are minor in some books, they remain throughout series, whereas main characters from the other books are only mentioned or reappear briefly later in the series. His new series, \\"The Knights' Tales\\" is for younger readers and began with The Adventures of Sir Lancelot the Great, published in 2008, followed by The Adventures of Sir Givret the Short in the same year. Next came The Adventures of Sir Gawain the True in 2011. His most recently published book from this series is The Adventures of Sir Balin the Ill-Fated, published in 2012.

Rotunda da Boavista, officially known as the Pra√ßa de Mouzinho de Albuquerque, is a large roundabout in Porto, Portugal. It honours Joaquim Augusto Mouzinho de Albuquerque, a Portuguese soldier who fought in Africa during the 19th century. History and Symbolism Monumento aos Her√≥is da Guerra Peninsular A column in the middle of the rotunda (Monumento aos Her√≥is da Guerra Peninsular) commemorates the victory of the Portuguese against the French troops that invaded Portugal during the Peninsular War (1807‚Äì1814). The column, slowly built between 1909 and 1951, is a project by the celebrated Porto architect Jos√© Marques da Silva and the sculptor Alves de Sousa. The column is topped by a lion, the symbol of the Portuguese victory, which is bringing down the French imperial eagle.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on September 22, 1951, and stars Tweety and Sylvester the Cat. Plot The story opens with Sylvester patiently rummaging through trash cans for food. When he realizes how distasteful the bits are that he is finding, he despondently wanders down to the shipyard and sits by a docked cruise ship. The ship moves up and down with the current and, as the cat ponders things, he becomes aware of a porthole through which can be seen Tweety swinging in his cage. Sylvester grasps the edge of the porthole, opens the window and says, \\"Hello breakfast\\". Tweety slams it shut, causing Sylvester to drop into the water. Sylvester climbs back to the dock and smacks the lobster off on his tail Managing to get aboard, Sylvester enters Tweety's cabin and grabs him, mid-chirp. As he heads out the door, Granny is standing there, demanding to know what he is doing with \\"my little birdie\\". Sylvester chuckles nervously, patting Tweety's head as if he is fond of him. Tweety says, \\"Ooh, what a hypotwit\\". Granny chases the cat, hitting him with her umbrella, and calling him various things, including hooligan and devil. Granny's glasses fall off and, though they are near her on the floor, she cannot see them, and she cannot see anything without them. Sylvester kicks them under the couch and begins pursuing Tweety around the cabin. Tweety runs under the couch and retrieves the glasses; he is able to get them back on Granny just as Sylvester is leaping at the bird. She swipes at him with the umbrella, misses, but catches him in the head after she throws it at him when he runs from the ship. The ship sets sail; Granny and Tweety wave and call goodbye to the crowd on shore. Sylvester, stowed away on a lifeboat with the number 13 on it, waves farewell with a white handkerchief. Soon, Tweety and Granny are taking naps on deck. Sylvester takes Granny's glasses and paints a likeness of the bird on one lens. He opens the cage door and takes Tweety, who flies up calling out \\"Help!\\". Awakened, Granny puts the glasses on and, looking at the cage, is fooled into thinking Tweety is there. Sylvester follows Tweety onto high wires; the bird gets safely across while the cat is struggling with his footing. Tweety springs the wire so Sylvester falls, able to hang on to one wire with one paw. As he is sweating with fear, the bird starts doing an \\"Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe\\" while pulling each 'finger' from the wire. Because the cat has only three, Tweety only reaches 'Miny' before Sylvester falls into the water. Tweety says, \\"Well, what do you know? No Moe\\". Rough seas eventually make Sylvester seasick. When Tweety sees Sylvester's literally green face, he laughs and offers him something for his tummy: a nice piece of salt pork. Sylvester turns a variety of colors and becomes even sicker; he dashes to the medical room to get some seasick remedy. After he downs this, he is instantly better and chases Tweety, who leads the cat below deck and tricks him into running into the furnace. The fire and heat results in Sylvester being ejected through the smokestack. After he climbs back aboard and sees Tweety, Tweety shows Sylvester a picture of a boat on the water. He moves it back and forth, while narrating: \\"It was a tewwible torm. Da boat wocked and wocked. Up one wave and down anudder, wocking da boat. Wocking. Wocking...\\" This nauseates Sylvester, who runs again to the medical room for more seasick remedy. Tweety gets there first and fills the bottle with nitroglycerin. Sylvester drinks it and seemingly realizes something is not right about the liquid. He spits and creates a small explosive spark. Now he chases Tweety, using his spit as a weapon. As they round a corner, Granny is waiting, umbrella in hand; she begins striking at Sylvester but keeps missing. Tweety tries to tell Granny to stop: \\"No, no, no, no! Don't hit 'im, Dwanny! You'll be towwy!\\". The ensuing loud explosion leaves Granny frazzled and Sylvester launched up like a rocket. In the open sky, there is a flash of a firework with a cascade of white sparks before the cat falls back down. The captain, watching through binoculars, uses Tweety's catch phrase: \\"I tawt I taw a puddy tat!\\". Sylvester lands on the captain. Granny, who is now steering the ship, and Tweety reply, \\"You did, you did tee a puddy tat!\\". Granny dons the headgear of an admiral, and Tweety a sailor's cap.

They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing. The Pennsylvania Department of Education compared the SAT data of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania to students in urban areas. From 2003 to 2005, the average total SAT score for students in rural Pennsylvania was 992, while urban students averaged 1,006. During the same period, 28 percent of 11th and 12th graders in rural school districts took the exam, compared to 32 percent of urban students in the same grades. The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test-takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively. Pennsylvania's SAT composite score ranked low on the national scale in 2004. The composite SAT score of 1,003 left Pennsylvania ranking 44 out of the 50 states and Washington, DC. The Pennsylvania Department of Education reported that 71 percent of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania chose to continue their education after high school in 2003, whereas 79 percent of urban high school graduates opted to continue their education. AP Courses In 2013, West Shamokin Junior Senior High School offered 5 Advanced Placement (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education institutions give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools also give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At West Shamokin Junior Senior High School only 9% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - West Shamokin Junior Senior High School, December 2013 Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Armstrong School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the district received $413,503. The district received $181,651 in 2008-09 for a total funding $595,154. Among the public school districts in Armstrong County the highest award was given to Armstrong School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. School safety and bullying The Armstrong School District administration reported there were eight incidents of bullying in the district in 2012. Additionally, there were six incidents involving local police. There were four incidents of terroristic threats, seven incidents of possession of a knife and four incidents of the Possession/Use of a Controlled Substances. Each year, the school safety data is reported by the Armstrong School District Administration to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The Armstrong School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. By state law, Pennsylvania public schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and the board is required to review its policy every three years. Additionally, Armstrong School District is mandated to conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Tuition Students who live in the Armstrong School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates at Armstrong School District for the West Shamokin Junior High Schools and Senior High Schools is $11,468.59. Wellness policy Armstrong School Board established a District-wide wellness policy in 2006.Armstrong School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, April 24, 2006 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each public school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Armstrong School District offers both a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 Armstrong School District has adopted a set of standards which limits foods to be served in schools. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. Armstrong School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. HEALTHY Armstrong is a collaborative group made up of ACMH Hospital, Armstrong School District, Children's Community Pediatrics-Armstrong, UPMC Health Plan and numerous other community partners all working together to increase wellness opportunities for Armstrong County families and youth. Extracurriculars The West Shamokin Junior Senior High School offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Armstrong School Board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. =Sports= The district funds the following sports at West Shamokin Junior Senior High School: ;Varsity and JV: ;Boys: *Baseball - AA *Basketball- AA *Cross Country - A *Football - A *Golf - AA *Soccer - A *Volleyball - AA *Wrestling - AA ;Girls: *Basketball - AA *Cheer - AAAA *Cross Country - A *Softball - AA *Girls' Tennis - AA *Volleyball - A ;Junior High School Sports: ;Boys: *Basketball *Football *Soccer *Wrestling ;Girls: *Basketball *Cheer *Volleyball According to PIAA directory July 2013 References External links * West Shamokin High School Website Category:Public high schools in Pennsylvania Category:Educational institutions established in 2000 Category:Schools in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania Category:Education in Pittsburgh area Category:Public middle schools in Pennsylvania Category:2000 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"West Shamokin High School"},{"id":"10595365","text":"Kenneth Richard Davidson (24 December 1905 ‚Äì 25 December 1954) was an English first-class cricketer, who played thirty 30 matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1933 to 1935, and one game for Scotland against Yorkshire in 1938. Slightly unusually for someone who played comparatively little, he was awarded his county cap in 1935. He was an amateur until after the 1933 season, but turned professional and scored 1,241 runs. He ultimately thought he was too old for a professional career in cricket. Born in Leeds, Yorkshire, and before he played county cricket, he turned out for Bingley and Leeds, whom he captained for a period. He also played badminton, a sport which he helped to promote in the United States. A right-handed batsman, he scored 1,355 runs in all first-class cricket at an average of 31.51, and a highest score of 128 against Kent. His other century, 101*, came against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and he made seven scores of 50 or over. He bowled just five balls, which went for four runs. Davidson died aged 49 on Christmas Day, 1954, at Prestwick Aerodrome, Ayrshire, Scotland, in an air accident.

From Ardrahan and first elected to the council in 1979, he resigned from Fianna F√°il in 2004 when under investigation for misappropriation of funds from the council. He served a prison sentence for this in 2007, but his conviction was overturned in 2011. He rejoined Fianna F√°il in 2018. Early career Fahy owned a 70-acre farm and prior to his trial worked as a salesman for New Ireland Assurance. He was appointed a Peace Commissioner in 1978, and was on the visiting committee of Limerick Prison until 2004. He ran in Galway West as an independent in the 1987 general election, but later rejoined Fianna F√°il. In the 2004 local elections, Fahy was criticised for using thousands of prepaid Oireachtas envelopes to write to voters. He said \\"I wanted to show I had the support of the Oireachtas members and if I hadn't done it like the other candidates, it would seem like I didn't have the same clout.\\" The judge at his 2007 trial alluded to Fahy's \\"quite extensive property assets of great value\\"; his 2010 councillor's declaration of interests lists land at Cregclare, Ardrahan, and Caherduff. \\"Stroke\\" nickname Fahy acquired the nickname \\"Stroke\\" (Irish slang for a sly political manoeuvre) in the 1970s from a local journalist after he convinced the Fianna F√°il national executive to add his name to the local election ticket when the local party had left it out. An advertisement in the Galway Advertiser during his 1987 election campaign has the headline The \\"Stroke\\" For Galway West. In quashing his 2007 conviction for misappropriation, Justice Finnegan noted \\"The name by which the applicant is popularly known and which it is likely was known to some at least of a Galway jury could well exacerbate the prejudice having regard to the nature of the offences with which the applicant is charged.\\" After the success of his 2011 appeal, Fahy's solicitor released a statement: :Cllr Fahy is also particularly anxious to have the media refrain from referring to him as 'The Stroke' in the future. He never took offence at the term in the past, because it was used in the context of a different situation. But he never stood before the people as 'The Stroke' Fahy and he would be grateful if the media would henceforth refer to him by his proper name. Misappropriation conviction In 2002‚Äì03, a road beside Fahy's farm was being widened, using funds allocated from the Community Involvement Scheme. A contractor erected 2,506 metres of fencing on Fahy's farm. Fahy later claimed in court that he had a verbal agreement to supply an equivalent value of rubble from his farm for the roadworks.Fahy guilty on one of five charges RT√â, 10 December 2008 The contractor was paid by the council in 2002 for an invoice of ‚Ç¨7,055, and submitted another invoice in 2003 for ‚Ç¨7,523. After a council investigation, Fahy reimbursed the council for ‚Ç¨7,055 and apologised for any embarrassment. In March 2004, the Galway county manager asked Fahy to pay ‚Ç¨3,000 to charity; he donated that sum to the Ardrahan Lourdes Invalid Fund. An Irish Independent journalist submitted a request for details under freedom of information legislation, and a Garda investigation was begun. When news of this became public in September 2004, Fahy resigned from Fianna F√°il, although local Fianna F√°il TD Joe Callanan and councillor Michael Regan supported him at his trial. In March 2007 at Galway Circuit Criminal Court in Loughrea a jury took 2¬Ω hours to find him guilty on seven counts: * Obtaining by false pretences contrary to section 2 of the Larceny Act 1916 as amended by the Larceny Act 1990 * Attempted theft contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and common law (two counts) * Attempting to make a gain or cause a loss by deception contrary to section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and common law (two counts) * False accounting by production or making use of a document contrary to section 10(1)(c) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 (two counts) On 20 March 2007 he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and fined ‚Ç¨75,000. The judge criticised Fahy for attempting to implicate other councillors and the fencing contractor in his actions. Senator Michael Kitt criticised the severity of the sentence. Fahy was given two weeks to get his affairs in order and make provision for his dependent mother. In this time he was taken ill and received hospital treatment for heart problems, further delaying the start of his sentence. He also launched an appeal. He was taken from hospital to prison on 23 April 2007. Fahy remained a county councillor. The judge had suggested he should be disqualified under subsection 13(1)(m)(i) of the Local Government Act 2001 for \\"fraudulent or dishonest dealings affecting a local authority\\"; however section 13(2)(c) delays such disqualification pending appeals. While section 18(4)(a) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that councillors are deemed to have resigned if they fail to attend meetings for six months, section 18(4)(b)(ii) allows the council to make an exception where the absence was \\"in good faith for another reason [besides illness]\\". The council decided not to move against him pending his appeal. On the register of panel electors for the 2007 Seanad election, his address was listed as \\"c/o Mr. Daniel J. Scannell, Governor, Castlerea Prison, Harristown, Castlerea, Co. Roscommon\\"; he is believed to be the first person to vote from prison in the Seanad elections. Fahy received the full annual representative pay allowance of ‚Ç¨16,600 for the year 2007, although his conference expenses were only ‚Ç¨3,700, for conferences attended prior to his imprisonment. Quashing of conviction and subsequent career On 28 November 2007, the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that evidence that Fahy had claimed to have been offered ‚Ç¨3.8m for a field was irrelevant and thus inadmissible; and further that it was prejudicial as it did not note that the field had been inherited, and thus allowed the inference that \\"wealth apparently so disproportionate to his income and station in life was not acquired honestly.\\" The court quashed Fahy's conviction, released him on bail, and ordered a retrial.Retrial ordered in Galway Cllr fraud case RT√â, 28 November 2007 Senator Terry Leyden was quoted as \\"delighted\\" with the decision. At the retrial, two charges were dropped; on 10 December 2008, Fahy was found not guilty on four charges and guilty on one charge of obtaining the use or benefit of ‚Ç¨7,055 from Galway County Council by false pretences. He was sentenced to time served of seven months, and fined ‚Ç¨30,000. He launched another appeal, and on 31 May 2011 the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled his conviction was unsafe, with Justice Adrian Hardiman saying \\"the evidence before the court was completely different from the case made by the State\\". No retrial was ordered. The Daily Mail reported Fahy was considering suing the state. Fahy's mother Mai, a Cumann na mBan veteran, died aged 99 on 23 December 2008. Fahy was reelected to Galway county council in the 2009 local elections, topping the poll in the Loughrea local electoral area (LEA). In October 2009, a man was convicted of attempting to extort ‚Ç¨5,000 from Fahy by claiming to have tapes of politicians planning to oust or murder Fahy. Fahy was re-elected at the 2014 local elections, to Galway county council and the new subsidiary Loughrea municipal district council. He said afterwards he was considering rejoining Fianna F√°il. Fahy ran as an independent in Galway East in the 2016 general election, receiving 5.2% of the first-preference vote to finish eighth of the ten candidates. He rejoined Fianna F√°il in 2018, and at the time of his death had been selected to run for the party in Gort/Kinvara LEA in the May 2019 local elections.

In 1984 he joined Indexovo radio pozori≈°teIndexovo pozoriste: Ne ostavljajte me samog dok himna svira (1990) (V) (Index's Radio Theatre), a popular Serbian radio programme that eventually grew into a theatrical group. There he began as an actor, but soon became a co-writer with Vojislav ≈Ωanetiƒá, with whom he wrote five original theater plays: Istoƒçno od Rajha (1991), Tamo daleko je sunce (1992), Brat I mir (1994), Svet ili ni≈°ta (1995) and Opro≈°tajni koncert (1999). All of them were hugely popular and played hundreds of times, establishing both Ljubiƒçiƒá and ≈Ωanetiƒá as a pair who could combine hilarious comedy with bitter satire. Advertising In 1985, with a couple of talented friends (Vlada Petroviƒá, Jasminka Petroviƒá, and Dado Pejoski), Ljubiƒçiƒá co-founded and became the creative director of TIM TALENATA Advertising Agency, which still exists and operates as a \\"creative boutique\\", best known for its creativity in Radio and TV commercials. Those radio ads bring them many festival awards through the years, both locally and regionally, and even won the Finalist Award in the New York Festivals, in the 1990s. As a result, Ljubiƒçiƒá himself received the UEPS Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015, and the same year got the Award for Significant Creative Contribution in radio advertising, being one of the first three authors to enter the newly founded \\"Legendarium\\" for accomplished creative individuals. The other two were Slavimir Stojanoviƒá (for print) and Jaka Judniƒç (for TV). Books Ljubiƒçiƒá wrote two very popular books: Nacionalni park Srbija (\\"Serbia - The National Park\\" Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 in 1999 and 2007 respectively). The first one was a bestseller and a sensational hit among those speaking Serbian language, for its sharp humor and strong satire, aided by exceptional illustrations of Dobrosav Zivkovic. The second one is known for its CD containing Audio interviews with several hilarious characters from the book, especially one, the clerk on the counter called \\"Mica Ubica\\" (can be translated as \\"Mrs. Miller the Killer\\"). Both books were published by \\"Kreativni centar\\", publishing house from Belgrade.

He played the role of Josip Broz Tito, who returns from the dead to a Serbia that is ruled by Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, and talks (improvises) with random people on the streets of Belgrade about their current grievances. He provides the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the Serbian dub Toy Story franchise. Music From 1982 until 1985 Ljubiƒçiƒá played in two bands: Petar i zli vuci and Kapetan Belkanto. His first music CD, called Truba... i druge priƒçe (The trumpet... and the other stories), of which he was the author of all but one songs and lyrics, was released in 2005. but cannot be easily found today, except on his official YouTube channel, \\"Micko Ljubicic\\". The channel also contains the music from his second collection of music art Isto nebo, drugi grad (\\"Same City, Different Sky\\"), never published as CD except on YouTube. More multimedia works from the same author can be found there, along with a number of TV interviews. Theatre On May 27, 2011. Ljubiƒçiƒá had a premiere of his one-man-show, the cabaret-monodrama ONE STVARI (\\"THOSE Things\\"), based on a play by Bernhard Ludwig, Austrian sexual therapist. Ljubiƒçiƒá did a major adaptation of the basic text, composed several original songs and made up the character Dr Agoljub, wordplay based on his surname. The public response was extremely positive, and after a two-year tour, he continued performing One stvari sporadically. On September 30, 2016 he premiered Danas nam je divno DNO (\\"Today Is The Lowlife Day\\"),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFub9NCusiQ&t;=3s another theatre play written in collaboration with Voja ≈Ωanetiƒá. It is again a strong satire, combined with hilarious comedy. It is still playing, and is constantly sold out. TV shows In 2007 he had his first TV show on TV B92 called Pozovi M... ili ƒáe on tebe (\\"Dial M... Or He Will Dial You\\"), which consisted of 25 episodes, and still is very popular on YouTube. The concept of making a TV show consist of prank calls is not new, but this was done for the first time in a form that was not rude. M is just sitting in front of the cameras and talking to anonymous people about the things they put in their ads. It's witty and funny, but never goes too far and never reveals the identity of a person on the other side. On March 31, 2015, he started hosting his second TV show, written with Voja ≈Ωanetiƒá, Lekoviti show (\\"The Medicine Show\\"), which consisted of 12 episodes and which aired on TV B92. It is also available on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li6nbSjvFlQ&list;=PLNMjTM1RXDUhv6Ol_iSlkDYN88bknolJ1 At the time of airing, it had problems reaching enough audience, mainly because TV B92 didn't do its homework, promoting it poorly. Some said that it happened because one of the repeating characters was at that time Prime Minister Vuƒçiƒá (later to become President of Serbia). PLji≈Ω During 2017, Ljubiƒçiƒá was asked to create a new weekly talk show on United Group's cable info-service TV N1, so he gathered again with Voja ≈Ωanetiƒá and also with Dragoljub Dra≈æa Petroviƒá (Editor-in-Chief of the daily newspaper DANAS, and popular columnist) and spent some time trying to establish a fresh concept. A few months and a few pilots later, the first episode of the new show called PLji≈Ω (acronym for Petroviƒá/Ljubiƒçiƒá/≈Ωanetiƒá) aired on April 20.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjlA1qqGF4 It became very popular both among targeted audience, and beyond. The first season consisted of 10 episodes, ending on June 22, 2018. The second season began on October 5 and had 13 episodes. The third season lasted for 12 episodes, from March 29 till June 14, 2019. The fourth season had 13 episodes. It started on October 4, 2019. and lasted until December 31.

Transactions on bidorbuy are in South African rands. History bidorbuy was first launched by Andy Higgins in August 1999 at the height of the dotcom boom, in Higgins‚Äô native South Africa. The initial seed funding and continued support were provided by Professor Yair Tauman, Professor Abraham Neyman, Mr Danny Barnea and Mr Zohar Gilon. bidorbuy was officially launched with a massive marketing campaign in January 2000, led by Nitzan Tal as the managing director, and within months made bidorbuy one of the leading e-businesses and one of the strongest internet brands in South Africa. This campaign won 2 APEX awards for the 2000 launch campaign. Between February and April, 2000 Nitzan Tal launched the websites in India and Australia. In 2001, after the dotcom crash, the Australian site was closed and the Indian one merged with the former main competitor, Baazee.com (which was bought by eBay in 2004eBay India Management ). In October 2001 Higgins went on to run the South African operation. At the slowest point, the company employed only one other person. From 2005 things started to change with the adoption of broadband, always-on internet access by businesses and private users in South Africa. bidorbuy.co.za soon became the largest online marketplace of its kind in South Africa and Africa.Your Guide to Buying and Selling on bidorbuy, Zebra Press, 2009 In 2010, bidorbuy made an investment into PayFast.co.za, a local online payment solutions company. In May 2014 bidorbuy invested into the e-commerce company uAfrica.com. Basic concept bidorbuy follows the eBay business model. It is an online auction site and marketplace where users, buyers and sellers, transact with each other. Anyone over the age of 18 can transact on the site, providing they respect the site's terms and conditions. The aim of the consumer-to-consumer auction sites and marketplaces like bidorbuy is to supply a trading model that enables small retailers, or even hobby sellers, to be seen by a larger audience of potential customers, who may be geographically distant. For buyers, such sites supply a place to go to buy commodities at discounted prices, second-hand items or difficult to find collectibles. Types of users =Buyers and sellers= After registering on the site and activating the account, anyone over the age of 18 can become a buyer on bidorbuy. New users can also start selling immediately as basic sellers, with restricted scope of activities. Advanced sellers need to have their bank or credit card details confirmed. =Verified users= Both sellers and buyers can become verified users after submitting a copy of their ID book, signed indemnity form and paying a fee for having their credit standing checked out. Verified users are identified with a green tick mark next to their user name. Only purchases from verified sellers fall under the bidorbuy Buyer Protection Programme, which offers a limited compensation to buyers under specific conditions. =Affiliates= All registered users may participate in the bidorbuy Affiliate Programme. For bidorbuy affiliates to earn commission, the newly registered users referred from an affiliate's web site, blog or invitation email message have to bid on an auction, buy an item at a fixed price, or list an item for sale within 60 days of registration. If a visitor sent to bidorbuy is already a registered user, the referring site gets a small commission every time such a user places a bid on bidorbuy. =Rating System= The rating system is meant to give buyers and sellers an idea about the reputation of their prospective trading partner before concluding a transaction on the site. Buyers rate sellers based on the service and the quality of the product, and sellers rate buyers on the basis of prompt payments and ease of transaction. There are three kinds of ratings on bidorbuy: positive, negative and neutral. For every positive, the users receive a point. For every negative, they lose a point. There is no effect from a neutral rating. Items traded on the site Trading in collectible items, mainly in the auction format, was the foundation on which bidorbuy was built. While collectible items, notably South African coins, stamps, antiques, etc. are still very popular, bidorbuy has branched out into other categories, to encompass all imaginable products that can be traded in legally. In 2008, bidorbuy focused on developing its car section, attracting many car dealerships to list on the site, making it one of the biggest online car shop windows in South Africa. Later on in 2008 the property section of the site was expanded when trade feeds from several online property agencies were incorporated into bidorbuy. There is a purposeful endeavour on the part of the company to distance itself from a site that only offers second-hand bric-a-brac and instead to grow the trade in brand-new items of mass consumption. To that end, bidorbuy has enabled the sellers who have their own e-commerce sites to integrate their shopping cart with bidorbuy and largely automate the listing procedure. As of January 2012, bidorbuy had 32 main categories, each with several sub-categories. With the property subcategories, which are ordered by cities and even suburbs, the total number of categories and subcategories surpassed 3,000. Trading formats * Auctions. In the beginning, bidorbuy featured only online auctions. * Buy Now. In 2001, bidorbuy introduced the buy now format for selling items at fixed prices. * Classifieds. In 2005, bidorbuy introduced a classifieds section where sellers can display items that may not lend themselves easily for sale on the internet, like second-hand cars, property and services. * Buy Now and Auctions with Make an Offer. In May 2015, bidorbuy introduced a Make an Offer functionality, first for Buy Now and later on for Auctions, which allows buyers and sellers to negotiate the price. * Auctions with Buy Now. In November 2015, bidorbuy gave sellers the option to include a Buy Now price in their auction listings. Payment Methods bobPay-EFT (internet transfer) was developed by bidorbuy to enable almost instantaneous internet payments across the four big South African banks: Absa, FNB, Nedbank and Standard Bank (in South Africa, a two or three day delays are a norm in internet banking). bobPay Credit card allows the verified bidorbuy sellers who do not have an internet credit card merchant account to accept credit card payments from customers. Other payment methods are also offered, including shopping on credit and PayPal. Fees bidorbuy does not charge listing fees for listing an item for sale in the auction or buy now format. A success fee is charged only upon a successful sale of the item. This success fee is calculated as a percentage of the actual purchase value. Items listed in the Classifieds section are not subject to paying the success fee. Instead, the sellers who list their items in the Classifieds pay a flat listing fee. Items listed in any of the trading formats ‚Äì auctions, buy-now or classifieds ‚Äì can be ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù (advertised on the home page and other sections of the site on a rotating basis) for a specified flat fee. Charity fund raising bidorbuy allows registered charities or non-profit organisations to raise funds on the site. In 2009, charities raised over R425,000 through sales on this platform. The biggest amount, R300,100 was raised for the Ubuntu Education Fund through the sale of the last VW Citi Golf ever made for the general public by the seller Volkswagen South Africa. In the same year, the Celebrities for Charities Auctions event was held on the site, in which 39 celebrities, most notably the archbishop Desmond Tutu, auctioned their time to raise funds for charities. In 2011, several South African celebrities participated in the Celebrity for Charity auctions benefiting charities including Reach for a Dream and Johannesburg Child Welfare. In March 2016, the Vodacom Blue Bulls rugby team auctioned off on bidorbuy 23 pink jerseys signed by the players, with the proceeds going to the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA). The #SamsungHeroes online event, organised on bidorbuy in July 2016 by Samsung South Africa to mark the launch of Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Injustice Edition, saw three pairs of South African celebrities engage in three charitable auction duels. The celebrities competed to see who would raise more funds for the charity they chose, and the participating bidders stood a chance to win one of three Injustice Edition smartphones. Entrepreneurship advancement activities On several occasions, bidorbuy teamed up with institutions of higher learning to promote entrepreneurship among young South Africans. The bidorbuy representatives gave free introductory workshops to students and guided them through the entire cycle of selling online, from sourcing of the goods to the fulfilment of a transaction. The tutorials, under the name The bidorbuy Auction Challenge, were taken by 60 students of the University of Johannesburg Raymond Ackerman Academy of Entrepreneurial Development in January 2010bidorbuy.co.za Crazy Auction Challenge Video and by 50 students of the Investment Society at the University of Cape Town (InvestSoc) in March 2010. The site reports that up to 20% of the people selling goods on its site now make a living by doing so.

Identity scores are increasingly being adopted as a means to prevent fraud in business and as a tool to verify and correct public records. Identity scores incorporate a broad set of consumer data that gauges a person's legitimacy. Identity score components can include (but are not limited to) personal identifiers, public records, Internet data, government records, corporate data, predicted behavior patterns based on empirical data, self-assessed behavior patterns, and credit records. Business and consumer identity scores Identity scoring was originally developed for use by financial services firms, to measure the fraud risk for new customers opening accounts. Typical external credit and fraud checks often fail to detect erroneous background information. Identity scoring is also being tested as a means for financial institutions to comply with criminal investigations and antiterrorism measures such as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and the USA PATRIOT Act. Usage of fraud verification tools and third-party authentication systems to verify identities and ‚Äúred flag‚Äù suspicious activity is greatly enhanced by identity scoring. Public records, private records, and credit records Identity scores are built from collecting information from a variety of sources and analyzing discernible patterns from the total information. These records can generally be broken down into three categories: Public records, private records, and credit records. Public records can include (but are not limited to) any of the following sources: *Federal, state and local government records *Financial records like bankruptcies, liens and judgments *Property ownership records *Registered Voter Records *Law enforcement records for felony and misdemeanor convictions Private (non-credit) records can include (but are not limited to) any of the following sources: *Bill and utility payments *Collected personal information from marketers or affiliates *Information provided to subscription-based Internet services *Billing information from medical services *Private background checks conducted by human resource departments Private (credit) records can include (but are not limited to) any of the following sources: *Information submitted to any or all credit bureaus or credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, Trans Union, Innovis, etc.) *‚ÄúAuto insurance‚Äù underwriting scores generated from credit records  Components  Each identity scoring system uses individual data components to generate their score, meaning that results can vary wildly even for the same individual. Typical identity score components can include (but are not limited to): * Name components : Personally identifying information such as name, address, etc. * Behavioral use pattern components : Analyzed patterns of behavior from information. * Internet components : Personally identifying information found on the Internet, such as Web sites, blogs, chat rooms, etc. * Hacker and fraud components : Personally identifying information that has been stolen in data breaches and may be used in recognizable patterns of fraud, such as unexplained credit card purchases * Synthetic identity components : Personally identifying information that is being used to create a new false (‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù) identity. Predictive analytics Identity scores are sometimes calculated using predictive analytics, the science of taking behavioral data and comparing it against historical patterns to identify potentially risky or fraudulent activity. By compiling publicly available information and using predictive analytics to gauge the patterns of how the information is used, identity scoring systems can measure the authenticity of a particular identity.  Usage  Identity scoring can be used in a variety of ways, from identity verification and measuring fraud risk on the enterprise level, to preventing fraudulent use of identities and synthetic identity theft on the consumer level. Identity scoring can theoretically provide much more definitive proof of an identity's legitimacy, because of the amount of identifying data it utilizes. Virtually all public information about an individual can be used as data in their identity score. =Credit scores= Credit scores are compiled from information sources relating to credit, such as number of credit accounts held, balances on each account, dates of collection activity, and so on. Credit scores do not measure any financial or personal activity that is not related to credit, and identity fraud that does not involve credit will not appear on your credit report or affect your credit score. Credit scores and the credit scoring system are also very predictable‚Äîthere are specific steps you follow to improve your credit score, dispute errors in credit reports, etc. Identity scores are compiled from much larger sources of information, including criminal records, property records, and so on. Identity scoring enables ‚Äúgrading‚Äù of patterns of behavior via predictive analytics, from which an identity monitoring service can track an individual's or criminal group's activity across several enterprises, instead of being confined to monitoring just one area. Identity scores are also much more mutable and ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù than credit scores, because the source information‚Äîpublic records and personally identifying information‚Äîis constantly changing. Every time an individual changes a job, buys or sells property, or has an encounter with law enforcement, this person's public records are altered. Coordinating the information across so many different sources makes it very difficult to fix errors in one's information once they occur. Where credit scores have a generally accepted model of a three-digit- number (used for the FICO score, the new VantageScore, and credit bureaus' proprietary scores), identity scoring models vary wildly from product to product. =Identity theft= Identity scoring works by matching the information the user provides against billions of records in public databases, ranging from property and tax records to Internet search engines, and calculating it against patterns designed to recognize fraud or identity theft. Example: Wendy's name and Social Security number were stolen by identity thieves who hacked a stolen laptop. They take her Social Security number and combine it with another stolen name, and use it to open a series of new accounts, including credit cards and retail gift cards. An identity protection system that used identity scoring would alert Wendy that her Social Security number had been compromised. Because identity scores include much more accurate information and can predict behavior patterns more definitively than credit scores, the Gartner research firm predicted that identity scoring will surpass credit monitoring as the leading identity theft prevention measure by 2009. However, Gartner research analyst Avivah Litan warned that identity scoring was not a foolproof system, as it still relied on the underlying accuracy of the information used. =Breeder documents= Reliance on ‚Äúbreeder documents‚Äù (documents designed to verify other documents) to verify identities is flawed, as there is no standardized means to verify that information contained in breeder documents is legitimate. Identity scoring can be used as a tool to authenticate identities on an independent level in cases of employment hiring and information verification. Currently there is no standard means to verify that information provided on an I-9 work document is legitimate, for example. The desire for industries to quickly hire cheap labor trumps any incentive a business has to check the credentials of their new hires, leading to a ‚Äúgray market‚Äù for stolen identities and contributing to continuing surges in illegal immigration. Tools that employ identity scoring to verify that a person's name and Social Security number match, or that their I-9 data is correct, could cut down on the sale and misuse of personal information while enabling better enforcement of immigration law. =Business = The following companies make use of identity scoring products or systems in their businesses: *Experian : Experian‚Äôs Fraud Shield product cross- references from their 215-million-entry consumer credit database, and provides risk management and identity verification services from subscriber businesses, as well as an additional score product that combines information from both credit and fraud-related sources. * e-Merges.com : e-Merges fraud prevention product, \\"Electorate\\" is an authentication of self reported data with implicit authorization to access and validate it through public records. *Fair Isaac : Fair Isaac introduced the Falcon ID scoring solution in August 2004. Falcon ID uses predictive analytics in its fraud verification process, and enables cross-business information sharing, a benefit Fair Isaac touted as ‚Äúvery good news for businesses in many industries that are working to protect their customers from identity fraud, and very bad news for their common enemy, the perpetrators of ID fraud.‚Äù *ID Analytics : The company's industry standard ID Score(r) is trusted by leading organizations to identify and prevent identity fraud. MyIDScore.com is a free service that gives consumers immediate insight into their risk of identity fraud. *MyPublicInfo : An identity protection company based in Arlington, VA, MyPublicInfo uses identity scoring as a base for several of its products. The company has announced plans for other consumer identity scoring products in 2007, but has not provided details.

Early life and family Whitehead was born in Reefton, on the West Coast of New Zealand. He was brought up in the mining town of Waiuta, and left school at the age of 14. In 1928, he married Frances Edna Clark, at Greymouth and later moved to Inangahua Junction. They had seven children together. He worked for Transport Nelson. Through his links with the trade unions he moved to Nelson. He served on the Nelson City Council as Deputy Mayor, on the Nelson Harbour Board, and on several school boards. He was the patron of several sporting clubs, including rugby, boxing, soccer, marching, bowls, and rugby league. Whitehead played rugby league for Inangahua and Blackball on the West Coast as a .

He held the electorate until his death in 1976. Whitehead featured along with Sonja Davies in protests over the closure of the Nelson railway line, which Davies wrote about in her book Bread and Roses, and also in the television series of same name. In 1972, Whitehead was asked by Prime Minister Norman Kirk to become the Speaker of the House of Representatives during the Third Labour Government. Whitehead hosted Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at the 1974 Commonwealth Games and had the duty of presiding after the death of Kirk later that year. Following his death, he was succeeded as Speaker by Roy Jack. In the 1976 New Year Honours, Whitehead was appointed a Knight Bachelor, in recognition of his long public service to central and local government. Less than a week later, at the age of 67 years, he died of a heart attack while welcoming a British ship, HMS Berwick. The outpouring of grief from the local people was unprecedented as Nelson stopped for his service which was relayed by loud speakers to the thousands lining the streets outside Nelson Cathedral. Large crowds lined the streets to show their respect when the funeral procession passed. Notes References * * Who's Who in New Zealand, 10th Edition 1971.

The following year he was instead elected to the House of Commons for Saltash, a seat he held until 1802. Lord Macdonald died in June 1824, aged 50. He never married and was succeeded in his titles by his younger brother, Godfrey Macdonald, 3rd Baron Macdonald of Slate. References *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

The festival covers the largest geographic area of any United Kingdom festival, being based in the towns and villages of Dartmoor and Exmoor. History The festival was started in 2001 after the UK critical outbreak of Foot-and-mouth disease closed access to large part of the English countryside. The festival was held to bring some light relief and encourage people to return to the rural areas in Devon. It has become an annual event, with a concerts being staged at venues across Dartmoor and Exmoor. During the preparations for the 2007 festival, on 10 April 2007 a ¬£45,000 B√∂sendorfer piano being delivered to the home of John and Penny Adie, the organisers of the festival, was dropped by delivery company G&R.; A replacement piano was given by the makers for the following years festival. In 2016 the festival programme included the Carducci String Quartet, Opus Anglicanum with reader Zeb Soanes, and the Gildas Quartet. The final night of the festival was planned to be held in Exeter Cathedral with a fundraising reception at the Royal Clarence Hotel. A fire at the hotel on 28 October 2016, meant that neither event could take place. Format The concerts are held at eleven rural towns and villages across Dartmoor and Exmoor, featuring established global performers as well as young, local musicians. There is a competition in the form of the festival's Young Musician's Platform. There are workshops to give local schoolchildren the chance to learn a classical musical instrument. Many of the local schools are unable to offer such lessons, and workshops reach 700 youngsters who would otherwise miss out.

He founded a vast library of documents mainly in the history of international labor and socialist movements. He became a left-wing activist preceding Italy's Years of Lead. Feltrinelli is perhaps most famous for his decision to translate and publish Boris Pasternak's novel Doctor Zhivago in the West after the manuscript was smuggled out of the Soviet Union in the late 1950s. He died violently under mysterious circumstances in 1972. Early life Giangiacomo Feltrinelli was born in 1926 into one of Italy's wealthiest families, perhaps originating in Feltre. His father Carlo controlled numerous companies including Credito Italiano, Edison and Legnami Feltrinelli, which managed vast lumber holdings in central Europe, some having provided sleepers for the enormous extension of Italian railway tracks in the nineteenth century. Carlo died in 1935. At the instigation of Giangiacomo's monarchist mother, Giannalisa, Italian leader Benito Mussolini had him created Marchese di Gargnano at the age of 12 by King Vittorio Emmanuele II, in the 1940s . Feltrinelli's mother married in 1940 Luigi Barzini, editor of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. During the Second World War, the family left the Villa Feltrinelli in Gargnano, north of Sal√≤, to be occupied by Mussolini, and moved to Monte Argentario. World War II The young Feltrinelli first took an interest in the living conditions of workers and the poor during discussions with the staff who ran his family's estate. He came to believe that under capitalism most people could never attain his privileges and were compelled to sell their labour for a pittance to industrialists and landowners.Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, \\"autobiographical profile\\" for PCI, Milan, 1950 quoted by During the latter stages of the war, Feltrinelli joined the Legnano Combat Group and enrolled in the Italian Communist Party (PCI), fighting the invading German Army and the remnants of Mussolini's regime. In the post-war period, the PCI had a great deal of popular support and political influence (after 1948 it became the main opposition). The country was in economic ruins and the party's opposition to Mussolini had gained it great popularity. The PCI was in coalition until 1947. Inheritance His father's will made Giangiacomo heir to three-quarters of his assets, which came fully under his control when he came of age 21 in 1947. Banca Unione (formerly Banca Feltrinelli) was controlled by Giangiacomo until 1968, when it was acquired by Michele Sindona. According to some interpretations Sindona was pushed to buy out Feltrinelli by the Vatican Bank, a minority shareholder embarrassed by cohabitation with a communist partner.^Senato della Repubblica ‚Äì Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi, Relazione del gruppo di Alleanza Nazionale, Roma, 31 July 2000 Library From 1949 Feltrinelli collected documents for the Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Library in Milan, documenting the history of ideas, in particular those related to the development of the international labor and socialist movements. The Library later became an Institute; later still the Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Foundation, possessing some 200,000 rare and modern books, extensive collections of newspapers and periodicals, both historical and current, and over a million primary source materials. Publishing Near the end of 1954, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli established a publishing company in Milan, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore. Its first published book was the autobiography of the first Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. =Dr. Zhivago= In late 1956, an Italian journalist showed Feltrinelli the manuscript of Doctor Zhivago by the Russian writer Boris Pasternak. Feltrinelli's Slavist advisor told him, \\"Not to publish a novel like this would constitute a crime against culture\\". His son Carlo's biography of Feltrinelli records a correspondence between him and Pasternak, as they successfully resisted clumsy attempts by the Soviet regime to halt publication of the novel.The complete Pasternak‚ÄìFeltrinelli correspondence‚Äîmostly intercepted at the time by the KGB‚Äîis given in Doctor Zhivago immediately became an international best seller.. \\"Feltrinelli rushed the Italian translation of Doctor Zhivago to market in November 1957, and translations into English, French, German, and other languages followed in the spring of 1958.\\" Feltrinelli sold the film rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer for $450,000. Produced in 1965, the resulting adaptation became one of the highest-grossing and critically acclaimed films of all time. The communist leadership in Moscow, which had not wanted the book published, criticised Feltrinelli, who in turn decided not to renew his PCI membership in 1957. While Feltrinelli remained on good terms with the PCI, party leaders were reluctant to be seen to condone criticism of the Soviet Union. =The Leopard= Feltrinelli Editore scored another coup in 1958 when it published a book rejected by every other significant Italian publisher: The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. Described by some as the greatest novel of the twentieth century, The Leopard centres on the Sicilian nobility during the Risorgimento of the mid-19th century, when the Italian middle class rose violently and formed a united Italy under Giuseppe Garibaldi and the House of Savoy. Despite these successes, Feltrinelli Editore lost about 400 million lire a year on a turnover of 1.207 billion lire, as Feltrinelli believed in keeping his prices low for maximum readership access. Still, the Feltrinelli Libra bookstore chain had a nominal capital of 120 million lire in 1956. Feltrinelli Masonite, which he chaired, had a turnover of 1.421 billion lire in 1965. Another firm which he advised on real estate development had a capital of 400 million lire in 1970. So ample funds were available from Feltrinelli's other investments. Whatever his own reading tastes, Feltrinelli was always keen to promote the avant-garde, including the works of the influential literary circle Group 63. He also took the risk of publishing and distributing novels banned under obscenity laws, such as Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer. Starting in Pisa in 1957, Feltrinelli built up a chain of retail outlets which after his death became the largest in Italy; it had over a hundred bookshops. In 1960 Feltrinelli married the German photographer Inge Sch√∂nthal, and they had a son and heir, Carlo. Inge eventually became the de facto head of the publishing house as Feltrinelli came to devote himself to clandestine political activity, of which she disapproved. Mother and son still run Feltrinelli Editore together today. Activism In the post-war period, Feltrinelli had joined the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) before returning to the PCI, which he left again in 1957. =Third world activism= Feltrinelli spent the 1960s travelling the world and making links with various radical Third World leaders and guerrilla movements. In the Cuban house of the photographer Alberto Korda, Feltrinelli saw and was given Korda's iconic photo of Che Guevara. Within six months of Che's assassination, Feltrinelli sold over two million posters bearing the image. In 1964, Feltrinelli met the leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro. In 1967 he went to Bolivia and met with R√©gis Debray. Feltrinelli published the writings of figures such as Castro, Che and Ho Chi Minh, and a series of pamphlets on the unfolding insurgencies and wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. He was a close friend of the student leader Rudi Dutschke, whom he invited to convalesce in Italy after Dutschke was seriously wounded by an assassination attempt. Feltrinelli gave financial support to the Palestine Liberation Front, among other causes. =Guerilla activity= In 1968 Feltrinelli went to Sardinia to make contact with left-wing and separatist groups on the island, intending to make Sardinia a socialist republic similar to Cuba and \\"liberate it from colonialism\\". His attempt to strengthen Graziano Mesina's rebel forces was eventually nullified by Italian military intelligence.On the relationship between Feltrinelli and Sardianian separatism see Feltrinelli increasingly advocated guerrilla activity in Italy on behalf of the working class. In 1970, fearing a right-wing coup d'etat, he founded the militant Gruppi di Azione Partigiana (Partisan Action Groups, GAP). GAP would become the second militant organization after the Red Brigades to be formed during the Years of lead. Anticipating assassination attempts by the CIA or Mossad, Feltrinelli assumed a nom de guerre (\\"Osvaldo\\") and went underground. Death On 15 March 1972, Feltrinelli was found dead at the foot of the pylon of a high-voltage power- line at Segrate, near Milan, apparently killed by his own explosives while on an operation with other GAP members. Some 8,000 people attended Feltrinelli's funeral. His death, like his father's 37 years before, was immediately viewed suspiciously, but Barzini had considered and rejected the possibility of it having been a killing at the time of Feltrinelli's death: In 1974 an audio recording found in a shelter of the Red Brigades described Feltrinelli as In 1979, during an anti-terrorist trial, the Red Brigades defendants read into the court record a signed statement that Feltrinelli The defendants denied the thesis of the murder, claiming it was a commemoration of the publisher and his political ideas, and a critique addressed to the circles of the extra- parliamentary left who had tried to deny them.Luciano Gulli, Il giudizio dei terroristi su Feltrinelli \\"Un rivoluzionario caduto combattendo\\", il Giornale nuovo, 1 April 1979. They also admitted that Feltrinelli was not obsessed with a neo-fascist coup, because he wanted to establish in Italy the armed struggle and was one of the first to have had contacts with the German Red Army Faction: finally they affirmed that the relationships between GAP and RB were characterized by the maximum correctness, without competitive spirit.

Afrikaans is a daughter language of Dutch and is spoken by the majority of people in the Western Cape of South Africa and among Afrikaners and coloured South Africans in other parts of South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. Afrikaans was historically one of the two official languages of South Africa, the other being English, but it currently shares the status of an \\"official language\\" with ten other languages. Some Afrikaans authors of note are Andr√© P. Brink, Breyten Breytenbach, N.P. van Wyk Louw, Deon Meyer, Dalene Matthee, Hennie Aucamp, Joan Hambidge, Ingrid Jonker. Many authors writing in Afrikaans were key opponents of Apartheid. History Afrikaans can claim the same literary roots as contemporary Dutch, as both languages stem from 17th-century Dutch. One of the oldest examples of written Cape Dutch is the poem Lied ter eere van de Swellendamsche en diverse andere helden bij de bloedige actie aan Muizenberg in dato 7 Aug. 1795 () while the earliest Afrikaans publications are generally believed to be Zamenspraak tusschen Klaas Waarzegger en Jan Twyfelaar () by L.H. Meurant in 1861 and Uiteensetting van die godsdiens () by Abu Bakr Effendi in Arabic Afrikaans in 1877. Even though the roots of the Afrikaans language movement date from 1875, the movement did not spread in a major way until after the Treaty of Vereeniging in 1902. In the aftermath of the British victory in the Second Boer War, Sir Alfred Milner, the Royal Governor of the newly formed Union of South Africa, launched an effort to use both the government and the educational system to force the Afrikaners to learn to speak English. In response, Afrikaans was standardized as a language and was first used in a standard form in memoirs written by Boers about their experiences in the war. Furthermore, Milner's efforts to culturally assimilate them mobilized the Afrikaners to take back control of both the government and the educational system. During the 1948-1994 rule of the National Party, however, the Afrikaner intelligentsia formed one of the strongest forces in opposition to the ruling Party, and the most acclaimed Afrikaans authors openly criticized the government's domestic and foreign policies. One of the first Afrikaner intellectuals to oppose the National Party was Uys Krige, who first became known as one of the Dertigers (\\"The Writers of the Thirties\\"). Krige's opposition to the National Party went back to the Spanish Civil War, when he campaigned passionately for the Republican side.Nasson, Bill, South Africa at War 1939-1945, Jacana Media, Auckland Park 2012, p.17 He wrote the Hymn of the Fascist Bombers in 1937, which elicited vehement condemnations from both extreme Afrikaner nationalists and from the Catholic Church in South Africa, which opposed the Republican side due to the anti-Catholic religious persecution being perpetrated by the Republican forces (see Red Terror (Spain).Cope, Jack, The Adversary Within, Dissident Writers in Afrikaans, David Philip, Cape Town 1982, pp.33-36. According to Jack Cope, Krige's linguistic and literary talent combined with his passion for modern French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese literature made him the principal translator from Romance languages into Afrikaans during the 20th century. Krige has therefore had a considerable influence on all subsequent Afrikaans literature.Cope, Jack, The Adversary Within, Dissident Writers in Afrikaans, David Philip, Cape Town 1982, p.38. Uys Krige translated many of the works of William Shakespeare from Elizabethan English into Afrikaans. He also translated works by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Lope de Vega and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez from Spanish, works by Baudelaire, Fran√ßois Villon, Jacques Pr√©vert, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul √âluard from French, and the poems of Salvatore Quasimodo and Giuseppe Ungaretti from Italian.Cope, Jack, The Adversary Within, Dissident Writers in Afrikaans, David Philip, Cape Town 1982, pp.37-38. Krige's electrifying encounter with Latin American poetry whilst stationed with the South African Army in Cairo during World War II also led him to translate the poetry of Jacinto Fombona-Pachano, Jose Ramon Heredia, Vicente Huidobro, Jorge Carrera Andrade, Nicolas Guillen, Cesar Vallejo, Jorge de Lima and Manuel Bandeira into Afrikaans from both Spanish and Portuguese.Cope, Jack, The Adversary Within, Dissident Writers in Afrikaans, David Philip, Cape Town 1982, pp.38. The Sestigers movement was an important collective of South African authors, who opposed the National Party and who attempted to bring the literature of the world to South Africa. Authors involved in the movement established a publishing house, Taurus, which printed writings that were controversial and which the government attempted to censor. In her biography of Afrikaner poet Ingrid Jonker, Louise Viljoen has described the Sestigers as nothing less than \\"a cultural revolt in the heart of Afrikanerdom.\\" In 1970, at the height of John Vorster's leadership, a teenaged Antije Krog penned an anti-racist poem for her school magazine: Gee vir my 'n land waar swart en wit hand aan hand, vrede en liefde kan bring in my mooi land (Give me a land where black and white hand in hand, Can bring peace and love to my beautiful land) scandalising her rural, Afrikaans- speaking, and Pro-National Party community and bringing the national media to her parents' doorstep. Described by her contemporary Joan Hambidge \\"as the Pablo Neruda of Afrikaans\\", Krog published her first book of verse, Dogter van Jefta (Daughter of Jephta) at the age of seventeen. Within the next two years she published a second collection titled: Januarie-suite (January Suite). Since then she has published several further volumes, one in English. Much of her poetry deals with love, apartheid, the role of women, and the politics of gender. Her poetry has been translated into English, Dutch, and several other languages. During his imprisonment by the National Party regime between 1975 and 1982, Afrikaner poet and political dissident Breyten Breytenbach wrote the poem, (\\"Ballade of Unfaithful Lovers\\"). Inspired by Fran√ßois Villon's Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis, Breytenbach compared Afrikaner dissident poets Peter Blum, Ingrid Jonker, and himself to unfaithful lovers, who had betrayed Afrikaans poetry by taking leave of it. Louise Viljoen (2012), Ingrid Jonker: Poet under Apartheid, page 136. Ever since free elections toppled the National Party and ended Apartheid in 1994, the status of Afrikaans within South Africa has been much reduced. Afrikaans went from having equal status with English to being just one of 11 official languages, leading to a renewed dominance of English in the public sphere. Attempts to reverse the marginalisation of Afrikaans have been described as a third Afrikaans language movement. Notable authors Notable authors writing or who wrote in Afrikaans include Andr√© Brink and Breyten Breytenbach, Reza de Wet, Etienne Leroux, Jan Rabie, Ingrid Jonker, Adam Small, Bartho Smit, and Chris Barnard. The Hertzog Prize is the highest award for South African literature generally, as well as for literature written in Afrikaans.

Any piece of digital information is representable as a number; consequently, if communicating a specific set of information is illegal in some way, then the number may be illegal as well.  Background  A number may represent some type of classified information or trade secret, legal to possess only by certain authorized persons. An AACS encryption key (09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0) that came to prominence in May 2007 is an example of a number claimed to be a secret, and whose publication or inappropriate possession is claimed to be illegal in the United States. It allegedly assists in the decryption of any HD DVD or Blu-ray Disc released before this date. The issuers of a series of cease-and-desist letters claim that the key itself is therefore a copyright circumvention device, and that publishing the key violates Title 1 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In part of the DeCSS court order and in the AACS legal notices, the claimed protection for these numbers is based on their mere possession and the value or potential use of the numbers. This makes their status and legal issues surrounding their distribution quite distinct from that of copyright infringement. Any image file or an executable program can be regarded as simply a very large binary number. In certain jurisdictions, there are images that are illegal to possess, due to obscenity or secrecy/classified status, so the corresponding numbers could be illegal. In 2011 Sony sued George Hotz and members of fail0verflow for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3. Part of the lawsuit complaint was that they had published PS3 keys. Sony also threatened to sue anyone who distributed the keys. Sony later accidentally retweeted an older dongle key through its fictional Kevin Butler character.  Flags and steganography  The PlayStation 3 edition of the free speech flag As a protest of the DeCSS case, many people created \\"steganographic\\" versions of the illegal information (i.e. hiding them in some form in flags etc.). Dave Touretzky of Carnegie Mellon University created a \\"Gallery of DeCSS descramblers\\". In the AACS encryption key controversy, a \\"free speech flag\\" was created. Some illegal numbers are so short that a simple flag (pictured to the right) could be created by using triples of components as describing red-green-blue colors. The argument is that if short numbers can be made illegal, then anything based on those numbers also becomes illegal, like simple patterns of colors, etc. In the Sony Computer Entertainment v. Hotz case, many bloggers (including one at Yale Law School) made a \\"new free speech flag\\" in homage to the AACS free speech flag. Most of these were based on the \\"dongle key\\" rather than the keys Hotz actually released. Several users of other websites posted similar flags.See :File:Free-speech-flag-ps3.svg description.  Other examples  There are other contexts in which smaller numbers have run afoul of laws or regulations, or drawn the attention of authorities. * In 2012, it was reported that the numbers 89, 6, and 4 each became banned search terms on search engines in China, because of the date (1989-06-04) of the June Fourth Massacre in Tiananmen Square. * Due to the association with gangs, in 2012 a school district in Colorado banned the wearing of jerseys that bore the numbers 18, 14, or 13 (or the reverse, 81, 41, or 31). * In 2017, far-right Slovak politician Marian Kotleba was criminally charged for donating 1,488 euros to a charity.

The Polish Army garrison of the former Austrian fortress of Przemy≈õl (see Przemy≈õl Fortress) managed to halt the advance of the Wehrmacht for three days. The city surrendered on 14 September.  Background  In the Second Polish Republic, Przemy≈õl was an important military garrison, with the headquarters of 9th Military District of the Polish Army stationed here (commandant: General Wac≈Çaw Scaevola- Wieczorkiewicz). Furthermore, Przemy≈õl was home to the 38th Lw√≥w Rifles Infantry Regiment, which was part of the 24th Infantry Division. In the first days of the German Invasion of Poland, the 24th Infantry Division remained in reserve of Polish Commander-in-Chief. On 3 September it was attached to Operational Group Jas≈Ço, part of Karpaty Army. The division was loaded on trains, and transported to Tarn√≥w and Dƒôbica. In the second week of September 1939, the frontline approached the San river, which was defended by troops of General Scaevola-Wieczorkiewicz. His forces, however, were inadequate to defend an extended line, in addition the water level in the river was very low due to hot and dry summer of 1939, and the advancing Wehrmacht units were able to cross the San without difficulty. On 8 September General Kazimierz Fabrycy ordered preparation for the defence of Przemy≈õl. Polish forces in the city were commanded by General Jan Chmurowicz, his chief of staff was Major Michal Gulcz. Military commandant of Przemy≈õl was Colonel Mieczyslaw Sokol-Szahin. On the night of 8-9 September, Polish soldiers manned two defensive lines. Two infantry battalions with 7 cannons defended the district of Zasanie, and their task was to keep their positions on nearby hills until forces of 11th Infantry Division, fighting the Wehrmacht near Dubiecko, reached the safety of the fortress. Second line of defence was temporarily manned by one infantry battalion. Road bridge over the San was ready to be blown up, while rail bridge was barricaded with freight cars and barbed wire. Since the beginning of the campaign, Przemy≈õl was bombed by the Luftwaffe. On 7 and 8 September two raids brought widespread destruction and losses. On 8 September two platoons of anti-aircraft guns were brought to Przemy≈õl from Krosno and Sanok, but on 10 September both platoons were transported to Lw√≥w.  The Siege of Przemy≈õl  On 9 September the evacuation of civil servants began. In the evening of that day, members of paramilitary organization Strzelec marched towards Lw√≥w, and on 10 September evacuation of offices of 9th Military District took place. Due to chaotic situation in the city, army authorities were obliged to use military police to reintroduce order in Przemy≈õl. The situation was worsened by masses of refugees from western Poland, and thousands of soldiers, whose units had been destroyed by the Germans. On 10 September in the morning, German 4th Light Division reached the San near Radymno, and after a short skirmish with weak Polish forces, crossed the river. Next the Germans captured Jaros≈Çaw, after a battle which lasted several hours. On 11 September German 2nd Panzer Division reached the area of Przemy≈õl, chasing Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade. A motorized column of 4th Light Division attacked Przemy≈õl, trying to capture the city by surprise. The attackers were repelled by Polish artillery, but overal situation of Polish forces in the area of the city worsened, as in the south, motorized units of 1st Mountain Division captured Dobromil, and its patrols approached Przemy≈õl on 11 September but failed to seize the city. On the night of 11-12 September, upon order of General Jan Chmurowicz, Poles attacked German artillery batteries, which were located in Kosienice. The raid was a failure, as Polish soldiers, facing German machine guns, had to retreat. On 12 September near Bircza, Polish 24th Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel Boleslaw Schwarzenberg-Czerny, was involved in heavy fighting with 2nd Mountain Division. In the evening of that day, the Germans broke through Polish positions, forcing the 24th I.D. to retreat. On 13 September Polish heavy artillery was taken from Przemy≈õl to Mostyska, but along the way, the transport was bombed by the Luftwaffe. In the night, units of Polish 11th Infantry Division managed to enter Przemy≈õl, after heavy fighting with German 45th Infantry. Polish soldiers rested in Przemy≈õl for a few hours, and in the morning of 14 September marched towards Lw√≥w, leaving behind one infantry battalion with a battery of cannons. On 14 September the defenders of Przemy≈õl consisted of seven infantry battalions, a company of engineers, and six platoons of artillery. Altogether, these forces numbered several thousand soldiers. They came from different units, and in many cases did not know the city they defended. German forces consisted of 7th Infantry Division, and elements of 44th and 45th Infantry Divisions. On 14 September in the morning, the Germans tried to capture the city in a frontal attack, but were halted by machine gun fire and artillery. Main fighting took place in the south, where Germans, after artillery bombardment, crossed the San and attacked the village of Kruhel Maly, which now is a district of Przemy≈õl. After a Polish counterattack, in which bayonets were used, the situation there stabilized in the evening. In the north, German attacks also failed. In the evening of 14 September Colonel J. Matuszek, who commanded the defence of the city after General Jan Chmurowicz, received order of General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, who commanded him to abandon Przemy≈õl and march eastwards, to Lw√≥w. Polish units retreated towards Mosciska, blowing up bridges behind them. On the next day in the morning Germans entered Przemy≈õl. Przemy≈õl massacres The four-day battle was followed by three days of massacres carried out by the German soldiers and police against hundreds of Jews who lived in the city. In total over 500 Jews were murdered in and around the city and the vast majority of the city's Jewish population was deported across the San River into the portion of Poland that was occupied by the Soviet Union.Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team, Przemysl, http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ghettos/przemysl.html  References  https://web.archive.org/web/20130121100558/http://www.kki.pl/pioinf/przemysl/dzieje/dzieje3_e.html http://desertwar.net/battle-of-przemysl.html http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/przemysl/prz371.html Polish War Letters Przemysl Category:Lw√≥w Voivodeship Category:September 1939 events ","title":"Battle of Przemy≈õl (1939)"},{"id":"10595918","text":"Helzel (from ) or gefilte helzel is an Ashkenazi Jewish dish. It is a sort of sausage made from poultry neck skin stuffed with flour, semolina, bread crumbs or matzo meal (when cooked on Passover), schmaltz, and fried onions and sewn up with a thread. Chicken or goose necks are commonly used but duck or turkey necks can be substituted. The stuffing can also include internal meats, such as chopped heart, gizzard, liver. Sometimes the stuffing is flavored with garlic and black pepper. Helzel may be cooked in chicken soup or used as an ingredient in cholent.

He was also a member of the National Assembly, with some interruptions, from 1924 to 1955; Secretary of Comintern from 1935 to 1944; and Political Commissar of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1938. Marty (1921) Early years Marty was born in Perpignan, France, into a left-leaning but comfortable family; his father was a wine merchant. As a youngster, Marty tried to win a place in open competition for the prestigious √âcole Navale, the French naval academy, but failed and instead became apprenticed to a boiler maker. He later joined the French navy, becoming a mechanical engineering officer aboard the battleship Jean Bart. In April 1919, the Jean Bart and another dreadnought, the France, were sent to the Black Sea to assist the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. Black Sea mutiny On 19 April 1919, the crews of the battleships Jean Bart (commander, capitaine de vaisseau du Couedic de Ker√©rant) and France (commanded by Vice-Admiral Jean-Fran√ßoise- Charles Amet) mutinied. Although their sympathies lay with the Reds and not with the Whites, the crews' primary grievances were: (i) the slow rate of their demobilisation (following the end of World War I) and (ii) the small quantity and atrocious quality of the rations. The French government acceded to the mutineers demands but pursued the ringleaders. (Amongst these was Charles Tillon, with whom Marty was to have a life-long association.) With the passage of time, Marty's precise role is unclear. He was nevertheless duly arrested, tried, and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment at hard labour. PCF membership In any event, Marty was pardoned and on his release, in 1923, he immediately joined the PCF. By all accounts, he was a charismatic character and his role in the Black Sea Mutiny did nothing to diminish his aura. He was elected, in 1924, to the French National Assembly for the constituency of Seine-et-Oise and became a member of the PCF Central Committee. In the meantime, following the lead of numerous other Communist leaders, he campaigned against rising French militarism, being arrested and imprisoned in Paris's La Sant√© Prison. In 1931, he became active in the Comintern, the international umbrella group linking national communist parties and, by 1936, had been elected to both its Praesidium (executive council) and Secretariat (administration). Spanish Civil War In 1936, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was sent to Spain to represent sovietic Comintern interests. That October, he was appointed Political Commissar (\\"chief organiser\\"Antony Beevor, Battle for Spain p. 116) of the International Brigades, operating from the Brigade headquarters and training base in Albacete. A Franco-Belgian battalion in the XII International Brigade was named after him. Marty was a strict disciplinarian, ready to execute his men for loss of resolve or ideological soundness. He also developed a tendency to see fifth columnists everywhere. These qualities earned him the title of the \\"Butcher of Albacete\\". Later, \\"Marty... admitted that he had ordered the shooting of about 500 Brigaders,(sic) nearly one-tenth of the total killed in the war, but some question this figure\\".Antony Beevor, Battle for Spain p. 161 In a report in November 1937, Comintern member and head of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, insisted that he should \\"change radically his working methods\\" and \\"refrain from intervening in military and technical matters affecting the Brigades\\". World War II In spring 1939, the Spanish Civil War ended. Instead of returning to France, Marty went to the Soviet Union to work fulltime for the Comintern. He was still there when World War II started. Despite the German-Soviet pact, as an active and very prominent Communist, it was far too dangerous for him to return to Nazi-Occupied France. From May to October 1943, after the success of Operation Torch (a key component of the Allied North African campaign), Marty was sent to Algiers. He served as the PCF's official representative with Charles de Gaulle's Free French Forces, which were based there. After the Liberation of Paris, in August 1944, Marty returned to France. He attempted to take advantage of the chaos that prevailed during the early days of de Gaulle's Provisional Government by starting a revolution. However, it failed to generate support either from other PCF leaders or from the rank and file. Marty's efforts ended when Soviet premier Joseph Stalin vetoed the plan. Postwar Marty was once again elected to the National Assembly though high profile attacks in the press (many by men formerly under his command) had greatly diminished his influence within the party. His career effectively ended when √âtienne Fajon, a prominent Communist deputy and a minor press baron, denounced Marty and his former comrade from Black Sea Mutiny days, Charles Tillon, as police spies. The Affaire Marty-Tillon, as it became known, dragged on for several months with many accusations and counteraccusations from both sides. It ended with Marty's expulsion from the PCF, on 7 December 1952. Fajon's accusations were almost certainly false. It is likely that in a swiftly changing political climate, with the Cold War rapidly heating up, Marty had simply become a political liability.Contemporary article by Michel Pablo He wrote an account of \\"L'affaire Marty\\",Marxists Org: biographical entry which was published in Paris in 1955. Marty remained a deputy until 1955, when he retired to a village near Toulouse. He died of lung cancer on 23 November 1956. Other people's impressions In literature Andr√® Marty is mentioned in Ernest Hemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls in chapter 42. He also figures in the first volume of Peter Weiss's novel \\"The Aesthetics of Resistance\\". In the introduction to \\"Orwell In Spain\\",Orwell in Spain, Penguin Classics, 2002, p. xii his behaviour towards non-Communist Party pro-Republican forces is characterised by Christopher Hitchens as \\"coldly hateful\\".

He was awarded his Yorkshire cap in 1929. Life Dennis was born in Holbeck, Leeds, Yorkshire, and learned his cricket in the Scarborough district. He was a right-arm fast bowler, who took 163 wickets at 29.26, with a best of 6 for 42 against Northamptonshire, one of five five-wicket hauls in his career. He was also an aggressive left-handed batsman who scored 1,500 runs at 19.73, with a best of 95 against the West Indies tourists. He also took 59 catches.

It passes through the Susa Valley and the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel. Together with the French Culoz‚ÄìModane railway it is often called \\"Fr√©jus Railway\\" or \\"Mont Cenis Railway\\". Despite running under the Fr√©jus Pass, it is sometimes called the Mont Cenis Railway because, from antiquity until the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel was opened in 1871, most people used the Mont Cenis Pass to get between France and Italy. From 1868 to 1871 the temporary Mont Cenis Pass Railway ran over the Mont Cenis pass to link the French and Italian railways. History The Victor Emmanuel Railway, which included both the Culoz‚ÄìModane railway across Savoy and the Turin‚ÄìModane railway across Piedmont, was largely built in the 1850s by the Kingdom of Sardinia and named after its king, Victor Emmanuel II. Until 1860 Sardinia included both Savoy and Piedmont.P. J. G. Ransom (1999), The Mont Cenis Fell Railway, Truro: Twelveheads Press, pp 13, 14 The line from Turin to Susa was inaugurated on 22 May 1854. Work on the tunnel began on 31 August 1857 and was completed in September 1871. Work had begun on the line between Bussoleno and Bardonecchia in 1867 and was completed at the same time as the tunnel. The tunnel and line were opened on 16 October 1871. By that time, the Savoy side of the tunnel had become part of France. The decision of the engineers to begin the line at Bussoleno in order to reduce the gradient on the climb near Meana was much criticized for bypassing the city of Susa, which was left isolated on a short branch line. The opening of the tunnel also led to the closure of the short- lived Mont Cenis Pass Railway. In 1865 the line became part of the network of the Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (Upper Italian Railways, SFAI) on its foundation in 1865 and was taken over by the Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean Network) in 1885. Finally in 1905 it became part of the Ferrovie dello Stato network. The line, originally a single track, was doubled in 1908 between Zappa Junction and Collegno in 1909, between Beaulard and Salbertrand in 1911, between Collegno and Alpignano in 1912, between Alpignano and Avigliana, between Avigliana and Bussoleno in 1915, and between Bussoleno and Salbertrand in 1984. Electrification at three phase was completed between 1912 and 1920, but this system was converted to 3,000 volts direct current in 1961. =1917 derailment = On 12 December 1917, a troop train containing 800-1000 French soldiers returning home on leave from fighting in North East Italy, having passed along this line and through the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel into France, derailed at speed near Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne, killing several hundred soldiers. Features The Turin‚ÄìModane railway line is long, fully electrified and double track. It has the standard Italian automatic block signalling system. The mountain section starts at Bussoleno and the two tracks take different routes. Much of the uphill line to Bardonecchia runs through tunnel between Bussoleno and Salbertrand, while the line running downhill from Bardonecchia, has a lower proportion in tunnel and takes a slightly lower route. West of Salbertrand the two tracks follow the same route. The uphill line was designed with \\"S\\"-shaped tunnels in order to reduce the gradient, increasing its length. Between Bussoleno and Salbertrand the two tracks are at the same level at the intermediate stations, except at Exilles, where the platforms are on different levels. This station is no longer in regular use, being separated by the valley from the village of Exilles and its fort. It can still be used if required for historical trains, or to pick up or drop off groups. On the western edge of Bardonecchia is the mouth of the tunnel, with a monumental gateway, enclosed by two round towers, all topped by battlements. In the nearby village of Rochemolles there are signs of the first entrance to the tunnel; it is now bricked up but it has some holes where the tracks inside can be seen. Since 2002, regional train services have ended at Bardonecchia; previously they crossed the border through the tunnel to Modane. This is to allow the enlargement of the tunnel to allow the passage of container trains. Now only TGV trains reach Modane from Italy. Instead of regional trains, there is a replacement bus service to carry passengers to Modane, although this is a limited service. Freight traffic is still well supported. In particular, special freight trains constitute the Alpine rolling road. Low flat wagons carry trucks through the Alps. These trains are fitted with a passenger carriage for the transport of truck drivers. Four pairs of daily trips each day connect Turin Orbassano goods yard and the French terminal at Aiton at the bottom of the Maurienne Valley. The highest point of the line is , inside the Frejus tunnel. The maximum slope is 30‚Ä∞, and the tunnels have a width of and a height of . Future The line is intended to be superseded for long-distance travel by the Turin‚ÄìLyon high-speed railway through the Mont d'Ambin base tunnel, currently under construction.

Parentage Muttlebury was born 29 April 1866 in London, England, the only child of Captain James William Muttlebury (son of Dr James Muttlebury), and his wife, Catherine Elizabeth Stanley Duff (born in Madras, British India; died in 1915, aged 80), daughter of Major Duff, 37th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry (The Grenadiers). He was baptised according to the rites of the Church of England on 4 September 1866 in Holy Trinity, Paddington, London, England. His father, who was by profession a barrister, was trained in Toronto and called to the Bar of Upper Canada as a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada. He practised in Toronto, Canada West (now Ontario), but by 1851 returned to his birthplace Walcot, Bath, Somerset, and by 1856 migrated to the antipodes where he was a solicitor in St Kilda's, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. There he made his fortune, becoming a director of the National Bank of Australasia. He returned to England by 1862, for he was married in Kew that year, and the subject was born in London four years later. Financially able to retire, he lived the life of an annuitant gentleman, dying in Geneva, Switzerland in 1886, when Muttlebury was a freshman Cambridge undergraduate. Education at Eton and Cambridge: A Rower through it all Stanley became a new boy at Eton in the Easter term of 1880 at the age of thirteen. His tutor was the Rev. S. A. Donaldson, and he settled in quickly as a successful sportsman. Winning the school pulling in 1883, and the school sculling and hurdles in 1884, he moved on to row for the Eton Eight (1884), when Eton won the Ladies' Plate at Henley (beating Radley by seven lengths). Stanley also played in the Oppidan and mixed wall games. At Cambridge University, he was admitted to Trinity College, and he was secretary of the Pitt Club. His entry in Venn's Alumni Cantabrigienses reveals some important details: There he excelled above all others as a fine rower. Muttle, as he was called at the varsity and later in life, soon gained the title of a Great Name in rowing circles, and was esteemed as The finest oarsman to have ever sat in a boat. In 1886, 1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890, Stanley rowed in the Boat Race; an unsurpassed five times, only losing the 1890 race. Winning four Boat Races successively set him apart as a record holder in the history of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. Contemporaries writing to The Times to add to his obituary notice called attention to his extraordinary physical prowess and natural aptitude for rowing, traits accompanied by his extraordinary mildness, good manners, and natural kindness (compare Dom Placid Muttlebury above): Muttlebury had a natural aptitude which amounted to a genius for rowing, and, as he was not only massively large and full of courage but herculean in muscular strength, it was inevitable that he should be an outstanding exponent of oarsmanship. Added to this, he came to his prime when rowing was in a transitional stage, when the old methods of the straight back and the body catch, suited to the fixed seat and the short slide, had necessarily to be superseded by methods required by the long-slide. I consider that long-slide rowing sprang suddenly to perfection in Muttlebury, that on him this new (or partially new) art was built... With regard to the man himself ...[he] had the most charming \\"good manners.\\" It was a trait natural to him which all must have noticed... [W]ith this, somewhat unusually, went a refusal to hurt. I have never known \\"Muttle\\" to speak unkindly of anyone; and I have never known him [to] swagger. =Race of 1886= As a freshman, Stanley occupied the sixth position in the Cambridge shell in the 1886 Boat Race. That year, Hammersmith Bridge was under repair. This gave the crew only a few inches to spare should the two crews shoot the bridge abreast. Oxford won the toss and chose the Surrey side, but Cambridge immediately moved in front. Cambridge maintained a spurt when three lengths down at Barnes Bridge, and won by two-thirds of a length in a time of 22 minutes 29 seconds. Stanley had every reason to remember his first success in the Boat Race. =Race of 1887= After winning the Boat Race of 1886, Cambridge College crews swept the board at Henley, and since College crews were the hatcheries from which University material is provided, the strength of the crew for the Boat Race in 1887 was considerable. Stanley again rowed at six and won his second race by nearly three lengths in 20 minutes 52 seconds. =Race of 1888= In 1888, Muttlebury became the President of the Cambridge University Boat Club, a post he held for three successive terms. This year, at the Boat Race, the Cambridge crew won the toss, and chose the Surrey station. The light blues were rated as one of the fastest ever to have appeared at Putney Bridge. They won handily by seven lengths in a time of 20 minutes 48 seconds. =Race of 1889= Stanley was boat club President for Cambridge in his second year for the 1889 race. He had an easy time selecting his shell-mates as exactly the same crew was available to him this year as the one prior, the cox excepted: a unique situation before and since. He maintained not only their names, but their order in the boat. Once again Cambridge won the toss for sides of the river. In a record time of 20 minutes 14 seconds, Cambridge beat Oxford by three lengths. =Race of 1890= The 1890 competition was the most important race in Stanley's rowing career. He started off at a disadvantage due to his being the only Old Blue in residence at the beginning of training. Furthermore, he had no one to stroke the crew. Eventually, he persuaded the stroke of the previous year to come up and perform that important role. On Race day, the toss was won by Cambridge, and they elected to row on the Surrey side. Cambridge lost the race by one length; but it was one length which stood between Stanley and his becoming an unmatched rowing immortal. This was the first race Stanley lost. Nonetheless, his name went down in rowing history as the first man to win four intervarsity Boat Races in a row. =Additional sporting endeavours= In other rowing events at Cambridge, Muttlebury won the pairs in 1886, 1887, 1889 and 1890, and the Colquhoun Sculls in 1888. At Henley he won the Silver Goblets in 1886, 1887, and 1889, as well as being a member of the winning Thames Rowing Club crew for the Stewards' Challenge Cup in 1894. Stanley Muttlebury exhibited an almost faultless style: he used his weight and strength to the utmost. Muttlebury was also involved in other university-level watergoing sports including water polo as is evinced in the following extract from the Cambridge Review of 15 October 1891: > The Inter-Varsity water polo match, is fixed for next Friday, at the Crown > Baths, Kennington Oval, at 7.20 pm. Owing to the want of a covered swimming > bath at Cambridge, Water Polo can only be played at the sheds, and at the > close of a bad season like the present men are necessarily very much out of > practice. Our team will feel the loss of Muttlebury, who is unable to play, > and our opponents have a strong team. Family Stanley Duff Muttlebury married Christina Augusta Parkinson on 30 April 1902 in an Anglican ceremony at Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, London, England. The bride's birth was registered in the Fylde division of Lancashire in the March quarter of 1875. She was the elder daughter of Major General C.F. Parkinson of Bays Hill Court, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and granddaughter of Mrs Nicholson, of Lancaster Gate. The children of the marriage were: Ralph Stanley Muttlebury, who was born in 1903 in Paddington, London, England, and Eileen Joyce Muttlebury (from 1935, Joyce, Mrs William Dalrymple Tennant), who was born in 1905 in Paddington, London, England. Ralph Muttlebury continued with the family tradition of being educated at Cambridge University and was on the committee of the Cambridge Footlights. In 1926, Ralph married Gwen Parsons (from the Parsons Shipbuilding family), of Melcombe court, Dorset Square, London. Gwen Muttlebury (nee Parsons) worked in the Admiralty Operations Room Whitehall during the Second World War. Gwen and Ralph meanwhile, had a son, Peter George Stanley Muttlebury, born on 3 June 1929 (died at home in Yorkshire, 24 August 1975). In 1952, Peter married Gillian Joan Hoare, daughter of W.D.N. Hoare (a descendant of the banking profession's Henry Hoare II). Peter Muttlebury enjoyed a successful advertising career in partnership (MCR Advertising) with John Ritchie, father to Guy Ritchie. Post-University Career Stanley Muttlebury, who was first called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1886, ultimately chose a career as a stockbroker rather than pursuing that of a barrister after coming down from Cambridge. Characteristically perhaps, he seems to have arrived in that profession as a result of his involvement in rowing: Mr. S.H. [sic] Muttlebury, the world- famous coach, is a member of the House. Twenty-five years ago a Stock Exchange crew met the London Rowing Club in a match on Thames; it was there that we captured the Mighty Muttle for the business. Death Muttlebury died on 3 May 1933 at his home in Westbourne Crescent, London, at the age of 67. In his obituary, printed in The Times on Friday, 5 May 1933, Stanley was described as \\"undoubtedly the greatest oar ever produced by Cambridge\\". His funeral, conducted by the Venerable the Archdeacon of London, in St James's Church, Sussex Gardens, was attended by rowing greats, including former Oxford University Boat Club members Guy Nickalls, Harcourt Gold and R. P. P. Rowe. His body lies buried in Putney Vale cemetery, London, England. His widow, who later resided in Basingstoke, Hampshire, survived him until 9 July 1971, when she died, according to The Times, a great-grandmother, in her 97th year. In literature Stanley Muttlebury was an inspiration to many people. His wide circle of friends included Rudolph Lehmann (Founder of The Granta Magazine (Cambridge University) comic writer, rower, barrister, and Liberal MP) and Douglas Jardine, Captain of the England Cricket team. Lehmann paid a warm tribute to his good friend in his book, In Cambridge Courts, describing him as The Mighty Muttle, and that brawny king of men. It is said that Mark Twain drew on this tribute for his Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

She is best known for literary adaptations. In 2009 the screenplay for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, credited to Swicord (story) and Eric Roth (story and screenplay) and based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. Swicord also wrote the screenplay for the film Memoirs of a Geisha, based on the novel of the same name by Arthur Golden, for which she won a 2005 Satellite Award. Her other screenplay credits include Little Women, Practical Magic, Matilda, The Perez Family, and Shag.  Early life  Swicord was born in Columbia, South Carolina, the daughter of Jean Carroll Swicord (n√©e Stender) and businessman Henry \\"Hank\\" Grady Swicord II. Swicord's father was in the military, so the family moved often and she spent a large part of her childhood in Barcelona, Spain, until eventually settling in Florida. She has a brother, Steven Swicord. Swicord said she always wrote as a child, and that later as she continued writing in college, became interested in screenplays because they were visual in nature. She graduated from Florida State University, where she double-majored in English and Theater, with an emphasis on stagecraft. While at Florida State, Swicord worked as a photographer at the school newspaper, Florida Flambeau.  Career  After college, while still in northwest Florida, Swicord made short films, eventually getting work as an industrial filmmaker in Atlanta, Georgia for IBM. IBM liked her work so much that they recommended Swicord for a job at their advertising agency in New York City where she worked as a copywriter. With fellow alumni of Florida State University who were starting a theater company, Swicord wrote and helped produce two plays. An agent named Merrily Kane who saw one of the plays asked Swicord if she had considered writing for film. Swicord gave her a script called Stock Cars for Christ, which was sold to MGM, a job that required that she move to Los Angeles. Although the project was never produced, at MGM she was mentored by Lynn Arost, an MGM development executive who Swicord said gave her the experience and time during which she taught herself the craft of rewriting scripts. Another early mentor was Susan Froemke, an editor who often worked with the Maysles Brothers. Her directorial debut was the 1993 short film The Red Coat, for which she also wrote the screenplay. The film was about her grandmother and starred Theresa Wright and Bridget Fonda. For the 1994 film Little Women, Swicord conducted intensive research into Louisa May Alcott's personal diaries and family letters in order to recreate the period accurately. For over twelve years, she developed the project with film executive Amy Pascal. The studio wanted Winona Ryder to star, so producer Denise Di Novi, who had a longstanding working relationship with Ryder, joined as a producer. Ryder wanted a female director, which was an additional challenge, as the list of women directors from the studio was short. Gillian Armstrong (My Brilliant Career), who was on the list, was hired to direct. During the process of writing the adaptation of The Perez Family, Swicord got to know the world of author Christine Bell's Miami. Swicord worked with her husband, Nicholas Kazan, on the screenplay to Matilda, adapted from the Roald Dahl book, a children's book the couple loved reading to their daughters. Dahl's daughter, Lucy Dahl, was given script approval. Swicord wrote the screenplay for Karen Joy Fowler's 2004 novel The Jane Austen Book Club and directed the film, which was released in the United States on September 21, 2007. The film was her feature film debut. For 2005's Memoirs of a Geisha, Swicord worked collaboratively with director Rob Marshall to adapt Arthur Golden's novel. Although the project had been with other writers and directors, and there were many previous drafts of the script, Swicord said that she and Marshall started from scratch. Swicord was able to use Golden's original research and unedited manuscripts to construct the screenplay, which won a Golden Satellite Award for best adapted screenplay. For over 10 years, Swicord worked on the screen adaptation of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, based on the short story of the same name from F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 collection Tales of the Jazz Age. The project had been in development by producer Ray Stark for 20 years before she began working on the script. Swicord said that the adaptation was so loose that she felt that her work almost became an original screenplay. The script had a very long development period in Hollywood and was attached to many directors, actors, and studios. The eventual director of the film, David Fincher, hired Eric Roth, who rewrote much of Swicord's script. Swicord has said she was influenced by the work of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond (Some Like It Hot, The Apartment) as well as Ben Hecht (Scarface, Nothing Sacred) and Joseph L. Mankiewicz (All About Eve). Her contemporary favorites include Eric Roth, Steve Zaillian, and Callie Khouri.  Personal life  In 1984, Swicord married screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, who is the son of director Elia Kazan. Their daughters are actresses Zoe Kazan and Maya Kazan.

He started his secondary education at Mfantsipim School and completed at Adisadel College in 1940. He then continued to Achimota College, the predecessor of the University of Ghana, where he excelled with an 'Inter BA'. He married Vera Scales in 1949. Police career E.R.T. Madjitey taught Mathematics and Latin at Accra Academy briefly before joining the Gold Coast Police Force in 1948 as one of its first Ghanaian college graduates. In April 1957, he was appointed Superintendent of Police in charge of the then Accra Region. He was the first African to hold such a position. He rose to become Deputy Commissioner of Police in March 1958. On 9 October 1958, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the Prime Minister of Ghana appointed him the Commissioner of Police, replacing Arthur Lewin Alexander, the last British citizen to occupy that position. In January 1964, due to an assassination attempt by a Police constable Seth Ametewe on Kwame Nkrumah, ERT Madjitey and the top six officers in the Police administration were removed from office. Madjitey was later detained, for reasons not established to date, under the Preventive Detention Act by the CPP government. He was then replaced by John Willie Kofi Harlley. Politics The CPP's overthrow on 24 February 1966, led to his release from detention by the National Liberation Council. He was appointed Ghana's High Commissioner to Pakistan later that year. He left the diplomatic service in 1969 and returned to Ghana and entered politics. He was a victorious candidate of Dr. Komla Gbedemah's National Alliance of Liberals for the 1969 elections, making him the Member of Parliament for the Manya Krobo constituency from 1969 till parliament was suspended and political parties banned in 1972 after the army under a Colonel Acheampong overthrew the government of Ghana's second republic. As Dr. Gbedemah had been banned from holding public office by the NLC, the various opposition parties came together as the Justice Party, and Mr. Madjitey became their leader, making him Leader of the Opposition from 1970 to 1972. He also served on the Council of State between 1970 and 1972. In 1977 when Acheampong then a General and Head of State decided to overturn the democratic process with the concept off a Union government dubbed UNIGOV, ERT Madjitey together with William Ofori-Atta, Harry Sawyerr, Victor Owusu, Albert Adu Boahen, General Afrifa, G. K. Agama, Sam Okudjeto, Obed Asamoah and others constituted a small anti-UNIGOV group called the Peoples Movement for Freedom and Justice (PMFJ) to resist this move after a referendum widely believed to have been rigged. Madjitey and some members of the PMFJ were arrested and put in preventative detention. Acheampong however, became so unpopular by 1978 that he was ousted by his military colleagues on the Supreme Military Council in a palace coup and replaced by General Akuffo (July 1978). General Akuffo subsequently decided to return the nation to constitutional rule and therefore set up a Constitutional Drafting Commission and released the political prisoners. Between 1977 and 1978, ERT Madjitey served as a member of the Constitutional Drafting Commission which drew up the Constitution for Ghana's Third Republic. He was also a member of the 1979 Constituent Assembly consequently set up to defend and ratify the Draft Constitution. When the SMC under Gen. Akuffo lifted the ban on political activities. Madjitey helped found the Popular Front Party led by Victor Owusu in 1979 which became the main opposition party in the Third Republic. He was also a founding member of the New Patriotic Party, which was again the main opposition party in the first two parliaments of the Fourth Republic but won power in December 2000.

It is a black comedy about a high school history teacher who attempts to sabotage a manipulative, ambitious girl's campaign to become school president. The novel was adapted into a film of the same title prior to publication, but not filmed until fall of 1998. Synopsis In 1992, amidst the U.S. Presidential Elections that year, students at high school in Winwood, in suburban New Jersey, are preparing to vote for their school president. Tracy Flick is an unpopular girl but very ambitious, intelligent, and manipulative (and even described as attractive and rather buxom by some teachers and fellow students). However, she is not quite as perfect as her classmates assume. She had a heated sexual affair with her former teacher, and after Tracy told her mother of their relationship, his career and marriage were ruined. One of Tracy's current teachers, James \\"Jim\\" McAllister, known as \\"Mr. M.\\" to his students, learns that Tracy is taking part in the election, and feeling that Tracy needs to be taken down a notch, prompts Paul Warren (a student of whom he approves) to run against her. In turn, Paul's outcast lesbian sister, Tammy, begins a reckless campaign to be school president in retaliation to her ex-friend who is now dating Paul. Mr. M ultimately loses his job as a teacher when it is found that he has sabotaged the election by pocketing Tracy's winning votes, making Paul the winner of the presidency. Mr. M then ends up working in a car dealership. Reception The novel was a moderate success and received critical praise. The San Francisco Chronicle called it a \\"darkly eerie and winning new novel\\", and The New York Times wrote that the novel \\"provides gratifyingly exact and telling portraits of the kids themselves. Solid plotting guarantees that the reader really does want to learn who wins when the ballots are finally counted.\\" References Category:1998 American novels Category:American comedy novels Category:Novels about elections Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels by Tom Perrotta Category:Novels set in New Jersey Category:Fiction set in 1992 Category:Novels set in schools ","title":"Election (novel)"},{"id":"10596259","text":"Harry Duncan McGowan, 1st Baron McGowan KBE (3 June 1874 - 13 July 1961) LLD DCL, was a prominent British industrialist who served as Chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries for 20 years.

Later Seuthes apparently revolted; Aristotle mentions a King Amadocus who was attacked by his general Seuthes, probably in reference to these individuals. Seuthes proclaimed himself king at the end of the 5th century. According to Xenophon, who was in the country in the winter of 400-399 BC, Seuthes and Amadocus were then powerful rival rulers who faced off frequently.

The association was founded by Bruce Eriksen, Libby Davies, Jean Swanson, University of Victoria professor Calvin Sandborm and other residents of the Downtown Eastside. Membership was restricted to those who live within the neighbourhood's boundaries. The association's original aims are outlined in its Mission Statement. The group was actively involved with opposition to the 2010 Winter Olympics, and was accused of possessing the Olympic Flag stolen from Vancouver City Hall on March 16, 2007. The association has close ties with the Anti-Poverty Committee, with many APC members having worked for the DERA, and live in DERA subsidized housing. In March 2010, the association was accused of mishandling public money, and failing to pay $500,000 in property taxes and rents from three government-owned social housing buildings that they manage. Since the suit, the three government-owned social housing buildings were handed over to a court-appointed receiver, and an undisclosed settlement was reached between the DERA and BC Housing. BC Housing issued a proposal call in the summer of 2010 to find nonprofit housing societies to manage the buildings in the long term. Former supporters of the DERA, such as Jim Green, a former Vancouver city councillor who led DERA in the 1980s, stated that this settlement likely means the end of the DERA as a housing provider for the poor. After the settlement, DERA disbanded without an official announcement.

During the General Strike of 1926, it was taken over by the government to provide vital services, such as transport and communications. Prelude On \\"Red Friday\\", 31 July 1925, the government avoided a confrontation with the Miners Federation of Great Britain, which was expected to be followed by secondary industrial action by the railwaymen of the National Union of Railwaymen, and wider confrontation. However, as Stanley Baldwin said later, \\"we were not ready\\". The government had an emergency plan but inadequate means of implementing it. It thus established a Royal Commission and provided a subsidy to enable the mineowners to maintain the miners' existing wages and hours of work. In early August, Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks reported to the cabinet on the state of preparations, and his recommendations were approved, but the establishment of a volunteer service was deferred. Formation The OMS had its public origins in the letters page of The Times, where many were calling for the formation of a volunteer organisation to take over the jobs of striking workers, in the event of a general strike, which was widely feared by the conservative establishment at the time, as part of a 'communist plot'. The same page was used on 25 September 1925 by the Home Secretary to announce the formation of just such a group, the new OMS. Nevertheless, he admitted, on 1 October, that he had known of its inauguration for many weeks and that its promoters had consulted him. The government had no objection to it. The organisation, to be run by a committee chaired by Lord Hardinge, was to have branches in every city and to recruit volunteers in five classes, four of which were based on the men's fitness and age. The fifth was for women, who were to be set to work only where they could avoid any \\"rough handling\\". Lord Jellicoe and other top military men sat on the committee, to give the OMS a military discipline and to instill public confidence in the group that such important figures were involved. The organisation was, however, explicitly non-political. British Fascists were barred from joining unless they changed their name, abandoned their military structure and changed their manifesto. That led to a split in the British Fascists, with several leaders leaving to become the loyalists, an organisation that would be absorbed into OMS. Still, it showed apparent independence by employing nobody in government service. Reaction Whilst the scheme was enthusiastically supported by the right-wing Daily Mail it was denounced as a form of fascism not only by the Communist Party of Great Britain but also by the anti- communist Daily Express, which compared the OMS to the Ku Klux Klan and the Blackshirts. An early speech by one of the group's leaders was deemed unfit for broadcast by the BBC, which feared that it would compromise their impartiality. Brigadier-General William Horwood, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police also refused to work with what he believed to be a fascist organisation, and by the end of 1925 the government had informed General Sir Robert McCalmont that in the event of any general strike, the OMS would be disbanded and its membership taken over entirely by the government. Still, the OMS had the confidence of some provincial police forces and branches of the Conservative Party despite its inauspicious start. Development The development of OMS was not regarded as wholly favourable by some government officials, who were concerned at rumours that OMS agents were expecting to supplant official organisations in the event of an emergency. The junior ministers William Mitchell-Thomson and J.C.C. Davidson met the leaders of OMS, who agreed not to establish branches where there were local objections, but to encourage unofficial contacts between the local officials. OMS would concentrate on recruiting lorry drivers rather than those more likely to be employed by local authorities. OMS was short of funds by March 1926, having failed to gain the commercial backing that it hoped. It also lacked the means to train volunteers. General Strike Following the outbreak of the strike and the introduction by the government of emergency powers, it turned over its membership lists to the new government civil commissioners and so became a state organisation. Although the OMS name continued to be used, any notion of independence was abandoned, and it became an arm of government. The group had some 100,000 members registered at the commencement of the strike, but the middle-class background of many of its volunteers meant that they often proved wholly unsuited to the manual work, such as the running railways and ports. It produced slightly over 5,000 volunteers. Car drivers, lorry drivers and power station workers were the largest groups. It managed to produce the British Gazette, a pro-government newspaper, during the strike.The Cabinet Papers Glossary - O from The National Archives website Fascism The British Fascisti (BF), which maintained transport and communications units to be used in the event of a strike, provided an organisational structure for the OMS, but there was uncertainty at government level about allowing BF members to join the OMS given fears about their potentially revolutionary nature.Dorril, p. 198 Members of the BF were allowed to join only if it agreed to renounce fascism and the BF name, which was rejected by the majority of the group's controlling committee, under Rotha Lintorn-Orman. The minority faction, led by Brigadier-General R.B.D. Blakeney and Rear-Admiral A.E. Armstrong, split to form a new group known as the Loyalists (as well as the Scottish Loyalists under the Earl of Glasgow), which was subsumed into the OMS as soon as the strike began. Still, individual fascists obtained high rank within the OMS. BF member and later co-founder of the National Fascisti Colonel Ralph Bingham worked along with Peter Howard, who had published a magazine for fascists in Ukraine and would later be a member of the New Party. They ran an OMS depot during the strike.Dorril, p. 184 The BF's Neil Francis Hawkins, later a leading figure within both the British Union of Fascists and the Union Movement, was also important in the OMS during the strike.Dorril, p. 200 Later organisations The OMS can in some ways be compared to 1970s movements such as Civil Assistance, which played on widespread public fear of trade union militancy.

Drummond is a formerly independent private bank that is now owned by NatWest Group. The Royal Bank of Scotland incorporating Messrs. Drummond, Bankers is based at 49 Charing Cross in central London. Drummonds is authorised as a brand of The Royal Bank of Scotland by the Prudential Regulation Authority. History Goldsmith Andrew Drummond (1688‚Äì1769) founded the bank in 1717. The bank remained within the Drummonds family until 1924 when the bank was purchased by The Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank was the first acquisition for the Royal Bank south of the Scottish border and would be the first step in the bank's development into the largest bank in the world in terms of assets. The bank offers a variety of services to its private clients, including wealth and asset management. It has been based at its headquarters since 1760. Prior to 1758, the site was occupied by the townhouse, Naunton House. In 1758 the Westminster Bridge Commissioners purchased Naunton House and its neighbouring houses, for the purpose of widening the street. The surplus property was sold to Drummond's for ¬£1,100. The building was reconstructed in 1877 to 1881; Admiralty Arch was built and The Mall laid out nearby shortly after. The building is listed Grade II on Historic England's register of listed buildings. In 1992, RBS Holt's branch, Whitehall was absorbed by Drummonds branch; it continues to operate as Holt's Military Banking, based in Farnborough, offering personal banking tailored to the needs of navy, army and air force officers. Drummonds' focus on wealth management led the bank to creating a specialised department for UK National Lottery winners separate from its more traditional practices. Clients As is tradition with most London private banks, account holders' identities are kept a bank secret. Some historical clients have though been revealed, including a variety of distinguished figures: HM King George III and other members of the royal family, Alexander Pope, Benjamin Disraeli, Beau Brummell, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert and James Adam, Capability Brown, Josiah Wedgwood, Ted and Thomas Gainsborough. The bank also holds accounts for organisations and institutions such as the Conservative Party and Royal Academy. Royal account holders Both Coutts & Co. and Drummonds have received royal patronage. King George III moved his account from Coutts to Drummonds during his reign as he was displeased with Coutts for bank-rolling the Prince of Wales from his personal account. Messrs Drummond & Co. honoured the wishes of the King but unsurprisingly when the Prince of Wales became King George IV in 1820 he moved the royal account back to Coutts. More recent known members of the royal family to bank at Drummonds include the late Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Higgins has a broad set of research interests, including motivation and cognition, judgment and decision-making, and social cognition. His more notable contributions to the field of psychology include work on priming, self-discrepancy theory, and regulatory focus theory. He is also the author of Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works, and Focus: Use Different Ways of Seeing the World for Success and Influence (with Heidi Grant Halverson). Career Higgins received a Joint Honors B.A. degree in sociology and anthropology from McGill University in 1967, an M.A. in social psychology from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1968, and a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University in 1973. His early work included the study of priming and accessibility, through which social judgment is influenced through the unconscious activation of social categories. In 1981, he was hired by New York University, where he worked with others to re- build the social/personality psychology program. Among the early hires at NYU during this time were John Bargh, Shelly Chaiken, and Yaacov Trope. In 1989, Higgins returned to Columbia and served as the Chair of the psychology department from 1994 to 2001. At Columbia University, Higgins has worked on the science of motivation and self-regulation. He expanded his prior research on self-discrepancy theory, which examines the impact of the disparities people experience between their actual selves and their \\"ideal\\" or \\"ought\\" self-guides. Self-discrepancy theory acted as the foundation upon which Higgins then developed regulatory focus theory, which posits two distinct self-regulatory systems for approaching gains (promotion) vs. avoiding losses (prevention). In 2000, Higgins developed regulatory fit theory, proposing that people experience fit when using means of goal pursuit that align with their regulatory orientation: vigilant means fit with a prevention focus, whereas eager means fit with a promotion focus. Also in 2000, Higgins and Arie Kruglanski developed regulatory mode theory, which describes two complementary self-regulatory functions: assessment concerns with critical evaluation of options in order to make the right choice of goals and means and locomotion concerns with controlling smooth movement from state to state in order to effect change. These theories have also informed the development of Higgins‚Äô model of motivational effectiveness, which posits that motivation comprises distinct drives for value (achieving desired end-states), truth (understanding what's real), and control (managing what happens). Higgins has also studied shared reality, the motivation to create shared feelings, beliefs, and concerns with others. Selected awards Higgins is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He gave the University Lecture at Columbia University and received Columbia's Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching. He is a member of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology Wall of Fame and was recently awarded the Ambady Award for Mentoring Excellence (Society for Personality and Social Psychology).

Access is from Manzanares el Real, a municipality in the northwest of the Community of Madrid (Spain). Geological forces have created a remarkable boulder field of strangely eroded granitic outcrops, and nearly a thousand rock climbing routes of all difficulties are available to rock climbers, making it an immensely popular locale for rock climbers, especially due to its proximity to Madrid. Hiking is also popular in La Pedriza, especially on weekends. It is one of the largest granitic ranges of Europe and holds numerous peaks, rocky cliffs, streams and meadows. The 32 square kilometres occupied by La Pedriza lies within the Regional Park of the high river basin of the Manzanares, the largest park of the Community of Madrid. In this zone, vegetation is sparse, but there are Mediterranean shrubs like the rockrose, and alpine varieties like fabaceaes. The fauna is rich in birds of prey; the breeding colony of over 100 pairs of griffon vultures is the largest in the Madrid area. This natural area has been the scene of some movie shootings such as El Cid, The Fall of the Roman Empire, or Conan the Barbarian. Restrictions In 2016 the Community of Madrid introduced new measures to protect the park and address overuse, including restrictions to parking and a prohibition on swimming in the Charca Verde, a popular swimming hole of the Manzanares River within the park. In the summer, until September 30, access to the carpark in Canto Cochino is restricted to 7.30-9.30am and 18.30-22.30 or until all spaces are filled (270). During June, July, August and September, no vehicle is permitted to be in the park overnight. From October 1 to May 31, entrance to the park is until 10.30am and after 4pm on weekends and bank holidays.

It was first formed in 1235 on the orders of Sundiata in the Mandinka constitution known as the Kouroukan Fouga. Function The Gbara was made up of 32 members from around 29 mostly Mandinka clans. p.2 Members of these clans had aided Sundiata in his overthrow of Soumaoro Kante and were given a voice in the government of a new Manden federation, the Manden Kurufa. The descendants of these clans occupied posts in the Gbara, and checked the power of the federal emperor, the Mansa. It was presided over by a belen-tigui (or master of ceremonies) who recognized anyone who wanted to speak, including the Mansa. Clans The Gbara was divided into four voting blocs divided among military, political, religious and economic lines. The Djon-Tan-Nor-Woro (sometimes cited as the Ton-Ta-Jon), meaning carriers of quivers, were the military wing of the Gbara, responsible for leading the army and sometimes governing provinces (tinkurus) or counties (kafos). The purely political bloc of the Gbara was the clans of Maghan (literally 'Princely Clans'). This group included the imperial clans and related clans that could also ascend to the throne.

Her maiden name was Yuki Mizoguchi. She was known for her bijinga.  Biography  Ogura was born in ≈åtsu city, Shiga Prefecture and graduated from the Nara Women's Normal School (the predecessor of Nara Women's University). She was employed as a school teacher, but her interest in art led her to study under noted Nihonga painter Yukihiko Yasuda in 1920. In 1926, her painting Kyuri (\\"Cucumbers\\") was selected for an Inten Exhibition by the Japan Fine Arts Academy (Nihon Bijutsu-in) . Ogura became the first female member of the Japan Fine Arts Academy in 1932. She specialized in graceful family scenes, still life, and pictures of women. During the 1950s and 1960s, she painted many large portraits of friends and family members in the nude. Although Ogura never departed from the traditional framework of the Nihonga style, her figure paintings are often described by contemporary critics as \\"modern,\\" both in style and content. A very prolific artist, in 1976, she was selected to become a member of the Japan Art Academy (Nihon Geijitsu-in), and later become honorary chairperson of that organization. She was awarded the Order of Culture in 1980, and is one of only two women painters (the other being fellow Nihonga painter Uemura Sh≈çen) to be so honored.

Biography Maclay was the son of Ebenezer Maclay of Glasgow. He was Chairman of Maclay & Macintyre Ltd, shipowners, of Glasgow. In 1916 he was admitted to the Privy Council and appointed Minister of Shipping (Shipping Controller), a post he held until 1921. Because he was not a member of either house of Parliament, the ministry's spokesman in the House of Commons was Maclay's junior minister Sir Leo Chiozza Money, whose appointment he had tried to resist.See John Grigg (2002) Lloyd George: War Leader 1916‚Äì1918. Maclay thought Chiozza Money, though clever, would be impossible to work with, but, as things developed, the two seemed to have accommodated each other. Maclay opposed nationalisation of merchant shipping (it was instead brought under state control but not ownership, like the railways at the time), and insisted that owners still be allowed to make a profit as an incentive, although excessive profits were taxed. Maclay approved four standard designs of merchant ship and began the process of increasing ship construction, although he was hampered by shortages of steel and labour, and ships under construction in the USA were confiscated when she entered the war. Maclay rejected Admiral Jellicoe‚Äôs arguments that convoys presented too large a target to U-boats, and that merchant ship masters lacked the discipline to \\"keep station\\" in a convoy (from personal experience, he knew the latter to be false).Grigg 2002, p48-9 Maclay was created a baronet, of Park Terrace in the City of Glasgow in the County of Lanark, in 1914 and in 1922 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Maclay, of Glasgow in the County of Lanark. In 1915, he purchased Duchal House and its estates in Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire which remains the seat of the Lords Maclay to this day.D. Roe, Kilmacolm: A History (2007, Birlinn), pp.147 Lord Maclay married Martha, daughter of William Strang, in 1889. She died in 1929. Lord Maclay survived her by over twenty years and died in April 1951, aged 93. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest surviving son Joseph. His fifth son the Hon. John Maclay was a prominent politician and was created Viscount Muirshiel in 1964. Maclay was a devout Sabbatarian, who would not even read newspapers on a Sunday, and whose only publication, in 1918, was a book of prayers for family use.Grigg 2002, p46 References * , photo   , photo  * Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

The road runs north-east from Rushcutters Bay through Edgecliff, Double Bay, Point Piper, Rose Bay and Vaucluse where it finally merges into Old South Head Road. History =Maroo track= Prior to the road's construction the main route to the southern headland was South Head Road, which led to the signal station following the route of modern-day Old South Head Road and Oxford Street. In 1831, construction began on New South Head Road. The road was to follow the route of the Aboriginal foot track Maroo, which contoured between south head and Sydney. Before construction began on New South Head Road, only Aborigines and men stationed at the South Head Lookout Post used the track. =Initial completion= The Remains of Bentley's Bridge today For the first few years of construction progress was slow and only parts of the road began to develop, as work was treacherous with the route offering a range of harsh environments such as the low lying swamplands of Rushcutters Bay, Double Bay and Rose Bay, to the steep cliff faces of Vaucluse and Watsons Bay; in addition, the bush lands surrounding the Maroo Track were reportedly infested with snakes. However, by 1834 efforts had increased, and the road began to take shape. Where the road crosses Rushcutters Creek, a succession of bridges were built, starting with a timber bridge around 1834, followed by a stone bridge erected between 1837 and 1839. Bentley's Bridge, as it came to be known, was built by convicts under supervision of Lieutenant ACD Bentley. By the late 1830s, the road was able to cater for carts and stretched from Rushcutters Bay to Vaucluse, finally providing Sydneysiders a coastal thoroughfare along the southern banks of the harbour. =South Head Road's Trust= Due to the poor condition of the New South Head Road and its southern predecessor Old South Head Road a trust was set up by a government act in May 1848. The trust had the responsibility of maintaining the twenty four kilometres of road under its control. To raise the funds to maintain the roads the Trust set up tolls, one of which was located on New South Head Road in the form of a turnpike gate that extracted tolls from the road users. Unfortunately for the occupants of newly developed suburbs on South Head such as Vaucluse, the trust failed to adequately delegate funds and maintenance of the road remained poor until the trust was disbanded in 1904. =Growing importance= After the completion of New South Head Road, suburbs quickly formed around the road creating a demand for public and private services. In the late nineteenth century a number of schools were established on the road including the Sacred Heart Convent, now Kincoppal, Rose Bay (1882), Kambala School (1884), Ascham School (1886) and Cranbrook School established twenty years later in Rose Bay. As well as this a Roman Catholic church, St. Mary Magdalene, was built in Rose Bay in 1920. Official Government buildings were also established on the road including the Rose Bay Police Station (1930) and the Woollahra Council Chambers in Double Bay (1947). Also a number of recreational facilities were installed along the route including parks, yacht clubs and the Royal Sydney Golf Club (1896). =Expansion= By the early 1930s New South Head Road had become a major route as it linked the wealthy suburbs on the harbour foreshore to Sydney's centre. The road had developed little since its initial completion and its condition had severely worsened since the disbanding of the Old South Head Road's Trust in 1904, so in 1932 a major redevelopment of the road began which included widening the road to cater for modern day motor vehicles. The widening of the road required the creation of seawalls in Rose Bay and Rushcutters Bay, whilst the Rose Bay sea wall had been mainly developed in 1928, the Rushcutters Bay sea wall wasn't completed until later in 1932. The road was again widened in the late 1970s and early 1980s to four lanes (two each way). =Trams= In the late nineteenth century a tram line was added to New South Head Road. The Watson's Bay line began at Wynyard and reached New South Head Road at its starting point in Rushcutters Bay, where a tram depot serving the line was located on the north side of the road. The line was expanded along New South Head Road to Edgecliff in 1894 and reached Watson's Bay in 1909. The line left New South Head Road in Vaucluse as it became a single track down to Watson's Bay. The track was centralized in the late 1920s and early 1930s with the widening of New South Head Road. In 1949, the line from Rose Bay to Watson's Bay was closed, but reopened due to public protest in 1950, though was later along with the rest of the line permanently closed in 1960. =Present day= Today the road serves as a major link to the city from the predominantly upper and middle class suburbs of the Woollahra municipality. The road is often heavily congested with cars especially during peak hours. The road is serviced by a number of bus routes connecting the Sydney CBD to Vaucluse, Watsons Bay and Dover Heights. There is a major bus interchange and train station located on the road in Edgecliff. The Watson's Bay Ferry Route has stops off the road in Rose Bay and Double Bay, providing a popular and quicker option for businesspersons in the area to commute to the city. The road also serves as the major leg of the Sydney City to Surf running event, and is famous for the steep ascent from Rose Bay to Vaucluse known as Heartbreak Hill.

It was first released on his album Imagine, and was later included in the greatest hits compilation Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon. The song was written about his wife Yoko Ono, and features Nicky Hopkins on piano and co-producer Phil Spector on harmony vocal. Lennon plays harmonica for the first time on a solo recording (since the Beatles' \\"Rocky Raccoon\\"), and it would also be the last time he used the instrument in a released recording.  Background  Lennon began writing the song in 1968 during the Beatles' visit to India, but was not fully completed until the sessions for Imagine three years later. The melody was inspired by Lonnie Donegan's \\"Lost John\\", a song Lennon enjoyed and played often. The song was recorded on 25 May 1971 at Ascot Sound Studios. Robert Christgau called it \\"an instant folk song worthy of Rosie & the Originals\\". An uncompleted version of the song can be heard and was recorded on tape at the Sheraton Oceanus Hotel in Freeport, Bahamas, on 25 May 1969. EMI wanted to release the song as a single but Lennon refused. The only single issued from Imagine was the title track in the United States; none was issued in the United Kingdom.

Released theatrically on April 22, 1944, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. Plot Woody arrives at Tony Figaro's barber shop in hopes of getting a victory haircut (a then-contemporary World War II reference). Finding the shop's proprietor out for an Army physical, Woody attempts to cut his own hair and those of other customers. The first customer that comes in is a Native American who asks for a quick shampoo, and Woody then makes a mess shampooing the man's head, which then causes the man's headdress to shrink into a badminton birdie. The angry Indian then threatens to scalp Woody for giving him the bird, but Woody quickly knocks the customer out cold with a mallet and sends him out the door, where he ends up standing perfectly still in front of a tobacco shop. Shortly afterwards, Woody's second and primary customer is a burly Italian construction worker who asks for the whole works. Once Woody blow-torches the man's construction helmet off his head, he proceeds to lather his client's face, chin, mouth, and shoes while singing Rossini's Largo al factotum. Woody then produces a sharp razor and begins shaving the man. Woody elevates the barber's chair to the ceiling while singing an aria, allowing the man to fall to the ground and destroy the chair. Woody then begins liberally swinging the razor at his frightened client, who runs to escape him. A chase throughout the barbershop ensues as Woody doubles the tempo of his singing, until the woodpecker corners the man in the barber's chair and proceeds to give him a shave and haircut at manic speed. The construction worker is dusted off and sent out the door on his way, but the angry client returns to give the woodpecker his karma. The man picks Woody up and slings him through a glass window and back inside the shop, where the woodpecker lands and is bopped by shaving mugs falling from a broken shelf. As a last touch, the barber's pole falls on Woody, whose head is seen caught inside the pole. Production notes The Barber of Seville was the first cartoon to feature a more streamlined character design for Woody Woodpecker, courtesy of veteran animator Emery Hawkins and art director Art Heinemann. In prior shorts, Woody had had a more grotesque appearance, including buck teeth, a receding chin, and thick stubby legs. Heinemann removed these features, and restructured Woody's body to conform to the modern animation standards in use for characters such as those appearing in Disney and Warner Bros cartoons. In tandem with the use of the new Woody design, The Barber of Seville was the first Woody Woodpecker cartoon to use the standardized opening title card, animated by Hawkins, featuring Woody popping out of a log, asking Guess Who?!, and delivering his trademark laugh. The audio for this opening sequence is lifted from Woody's first starring appearance in the 1941 cartoon Woody Woodpecker, in which Woody was voiced by Mel Blanc. Ben Hardaway, also the co- storyman on Barber of Seville, provides Woody's voice for the first time (replacing Kent Rogers, who was killed in a World War II plane crash three months after this short's release), and Lee Sweetland performs as Woody's singing voice. Hardaway would become Woody's sole speaking voice for the remainder of the decade. Finally, The Barber of Seville was the first Woody cartoon directed by veteran animator James Shamus Culhane, who had been working on Lantz's Swing Symphonies for a year prior, Culhane would continue to direct entries in the series until 1946. A parody of Gioacchino Rossini's 1816 opera of the same name, The Barber of Seville is noted for its uses of speed, timing, and music synchronization. During the shaving of the second client, several shots are presented in rapid succession, some lasting only one-fourth of a second. Woody's demeanor and attitude are designed to match the music, during the famous Figaro portion of the tune, Woody splits into three, then four, then five instances of himself, in less than two seconds of screen time. Culhane later called The Barber of Seville one of my most satisfying achievements as a director. By 1944, Rossini's opera was a staple of American cartoon humor, with a noted earlier use in the Looney Tunes short Notes to You (1941) starring Porky Pig. Later cartoons to parody Rossini's music include Rabbit of Seville (Warner Bros.), Kitty Foiled (MGM), and Magical Maestro (MGM). In 1994, The Barber of Seville was voted #43 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time, as voted by 1000 animation professionals and edited by Jerry Beck. It is the only Woody Woodpecker entry included in the list.

Preoccupied with the landscape of leisure he is best known as the creator of Golfers (2000), Wonderland (2003), and Lee Valley Leisure (2005). He has worked commercially throughout his career, creating images for Penguin books, Polydor, EMI, Sony, Adobe, Pfizer, and editorially, working for The Guardian, The Independent and The Daily Telegraph. Robinson was commissioned by Penguin to photograph the dub-reggae poet Linton Kwesi Johnson for the cover of his 2001 modern classics book Mi Revalueshanary Fren. Robinson has also created images of The Divine Comedy for their album Regenerationhttps://www.discogs.com/artist/2283258-David-Robinson-16, and for recent releases by Guillemots. In 2007, he featured in the BBC 4 series Britain in Pictures in which he was filmed whilst photographing ballrooms and other inspirational buildings in the province where he grew up. In 2012, Robinson created a children's book titled The Mushroom Picker, using an experimental 'luminogram' process that produces \\"beautifully intricate, playful and at times surreal\\" images which \\"evoke other worlds, full of magic, menace and a mischievous sense of humour.\\" Robinson's images have been exhibited widely in the UK and beyond, and featured in the US touring show Picturing Eden, initiated by George Eastman House in Rochester, curated by Deborah Klochko. A book of the exhibition is published by Steidl. In 2014, Robinson collaborated with Gorilla Perfume / Lush, creating a Luminogram to help promote 'Mycelium', one of their newly released fragrances. He also featured on The Food Programme ‚Äì BBC Radio 4 discussing his artistic practice and Sporeboys, the Street food kitchen that he co-founded in 2005. Penny Bun Helps Save the World (2018), published by GOST is the sequel to The Mushroom Picker and employs the same visual style. An illustrated book for all ages, it tells the story of a gang of mushrooms and their attempt to save the forest. The protagonist of the fungi tale is Penny Bun, whose forest home is under threat from developers who wish to destroy the fragile ecosystem that supports mushroom, plant and human life. The story is told through analogue luminograms which Robinson creates by placing on photographic paper on the plate of an enlarger and exposed to different light intensities. Each exposure produces a unique print, shaped the interplay of light, colour and texture of the mushrooms. Publications *Golfers. Glass, 2000. . *Wonderland.

The film is about a Chinese martial arts school finds itself outclassed by their rivals, they hire elite ninja from Japan to destroy the school. The lone survivor of the massacre learns the secrets of ninjutsu and seeks revenge against the ninja. Although only starring one member of the famed Venom Mob in Lo Mang, the film very much is in the spirit of director Cheh's later Venom Mob films.  Plot  In ancient Hong Kong about the Yuan Dynasty, Chief Hong challenges his rival, Yuan Zeng, for the title of martial arts master. Their students face off against each other, and when his students are easily defeated, Hong calls in a samurai to fight on his behalf. Zeng's students are initially dismissive of a Japanese martial artist, but he defeats his opponent, whom he goads into committing suicide. Zeng's student Liang Zhi Sheng defeats the samurai, but before the samurai commits suicide, he warns that an allied ninja clan will seek revenge for his death. He tosses his ring at Zeng, who is poisoned when he catches it. As Zeng recuperates, he receives a challenge from the Five-Element Ninjas. Suspecting a trap, he keeps two of his best students, Sheng and Tian Hao, at the school to guard it against an invasion and sends ten others to do battle. As Sheng and Hao help to reinforce the school's defenses and set traps, the ninjas use trickery and guerrilla warfare to defeat their opponents. Hong is overjoyed, but the leader of the ninja, Cheng Yun Mudou, advises that they push their advantage to destroy Zeng's school. Hong agrees, and Mudou sends a female spy, Senji, to infiltrate the school. Sheng convinces a reluctant Hao to take her in after they save her from being beaten. Senji secretly makes a map as she takes various jobs around the school. Distrustful of her, Hao accuses her of hiding his weapon when she cleans his bedroom and demands to taste-test the soup that she has poisoned before letting her serve it to Zeng; to maintain her cover, she intentionally drops it. Once Senji completes her map, she smuggles it to Mudou. That night, Senji offers herself to Sheng, who refuses to take advantage of her, though he agrees that she may play a song for him on her flute. Under the cover of her flute-playing, Mudou's ninja attack the camp, killing many of the students before they are aware of the assault. Senji reveals herself as a spy and mortally wounds Sheng before he can rush to Hao's aid. Mudou kills Sheng and Zeng; Hao, who Senji requests they take prisoner, is the only survivor. Remembering basic ninja training that he received in the past, Hao escapes from his bonds and takes Senji hostage when she comes to tell him that she has fallen in love with him. Hao escapes the ninja and returns to his old ninja master to complete his training. He joins three other students, who help him in his quest for revenge. Meanwhile, Mudou kills Hong and takes his place as martial arts master. Hao delivers a challenge to Mudou, who sends Senji to spy on Hao and report who his new master is; he also sends four ninjas to spy on Senji herself. Hao easily detects her, but when he also sees the ninjas, he accuses Senji of trying to trap him and kills her. After killing the ninjas, Hao and his fellow martial arts students proceed to fight each of the Five-Element Ninjas. Now well-trained in ninjutsu and aware of the ninjas' trickery, Hao and his fellow martial arts students easily defeat the Japanese ninjas and destroy their symbols. Mudou, however, proves to be a difficult foe. As the four Chinese ninjas face off against him, he sneaks leg shackles onto Hao. Hao uses a mysterious key his master gave to him to unlock them, and makes many unsuccessful attempts to put them on Mudou. Finally, channeling his rage over the deaths of Senji, Sheng, and Zeng, he shackles Mudou's legs and pulls him down and while his 3 fellow martial arts students spear him, Hao tears Mudou in half. Hao himself is mortally wounded in the process. As his fellow martial arts students enquire as to why he put himself in front of Muduo's spiked feet, he dies. His brothers destroy the final symbol.

Reception  From retrospective reviews, AllMovie described the film as \\"a legend amongst fans of Asian cult fare and for once, the legend lives up to the hype.\\" The review noted that the plot sticks to simple martial arts tropes, while noting that the \\"actual methods used are so off the wall that no fan will care\\" and that \\"the final twenty minutes is the kind of high-kicking bloodbath that is guaranteed to leave any fan of these films smiling and slackjawed. Thus, Five Element Ninjas is the kind of gloriously over-the-top blowout that every genre fan needs to see.\\" Michael Brooke (Sight & Sound) wrote that the films that contain the word \\"ninja\\" in the title are generally \\"bargain-basement dreck\\" but that Five Element Ninjas was \\"a blissfully entertaining exception\\". The review noted that Five Element Ninjas \\"lacks the emotional intensity of Chang's earlier films\\", but stated that \\"its delirious verve and invention more than compensate. The body count is enormous even by Chang's notoriously gore-drenched standards, though the cartoonishly unrealistic blood-spurts and a disembowelled fighter meeting his doom after slipping on his own dangling entrails smacks more of a Monty Python Peckinpah tribute than anything especially disturbing.\\" James Mudge of Beyond Hollywood wrote that \\"it has pretty much everything that discerning fans could ever want\\".

Its plot concerns a group of twenty-something friends trying desperately to hang onto the friendship of their youth while the responsibility of adulthood is tearing them in different directions. It was written by Patrick Wilde, based on the 1997 Dutch feature film, All Stars, written by Mischa Alexander and Jean van de Velde. Things to Do Before You're 30 is set in Greenwich, London with a large ensemble cast including Dougray Scott, Emilia Fox, Billie Piper, Jimi Mistry, Shaun Parkes, Bruce Mackinnon, George Innes, George Irving, Rosie Cavaliero, Nina Young, Danny Nussbaum, David Paul West & Neil McGuinness. Synopsis In 1913 Don Robson (George Innes) started a \\"special\\" boys football team called crapletes Greenwich. Twenty years later six of the lads are still playing for the team, but things have become so much more complicated. Cass (Dougray Scott), the team's top scorer on and off the pitch, isn't sure he's ready for fatherhood with Kate (Emilia Fox), the love of his life. Adam (Shaun Parkes) still hasn't told the rest of the team he's gay. Colin (Bruce Mackinnon) is desperate to have a onesome (your hand) even though he's just started going out with the lovely Vicky (Billie Piper). Dylan (Jimi Mistry) is in love with the woman his father is about to marry. Billy (Roger Morlidge) is trying to save his marriage. Johnny (Danny Nussbaum) is not ready to accept the fact that his father, who started the team all those years ago, is dying. Whilst it is the Sunday football team that keeps this group of friends together, this is not a film about football. This is a film about complex relationships, and how childhood friends have to change as they mature.'Channel 4 Film Review', Clare Poland, June 2006  Reception  The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2004,Things to Do Before You're 30 (2004) - Release dates and received largely negative reviews, with Channel 4 Film calling it a \\"charmless film full of gender clich√©s and lumpen dialogue,\\" and adding \\"Not one to put on your 'things to do' list.\\"Things to Do Before You're 30 Movie Review (2006) from Channel 4 Film References External links  *Things to Do Before You're 30 at Britfilms.com Category:2005 films Category:British films Category:British comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:British film remakes Category:Films set in London ","title":"Things to Do Before You're 30"},{"id":"10597247","text":"\\"Live for You\\" is a single by Rachael Lampa from her debut album by the same name. \\"Live for You\\" is the highest charting Rachael Lampa single to date.

All efforts, either directly or indirectly, aim to \\"empower development organisations to better integrate ICTs as a strategic, mission focused, tool\\".About Ungana- Afrika - african nonprofit organisation addressing the technology capacity- crisis These service areas are titled as follows: * Centre of Excellence. This term refers to the central source of tools and resources that encourage excellency in technology support efforts. Ungana-Afrika provides program incubation, capacity building and resource development for technology service providers and networks that serve civil society. These beneficiaries may be nonprofit support providers, for-profit small to medium enterprises (SMEs) or related. Service outputs include the creation of public toolkits, resources, trainings and shared support models. * Technology Consulting Partner. Ungana- Afrika delivers technology consultancy and research to the broad ICT4D community. These beneficiaries and partners may include Free and open-source software (FOSS) initiatives, nonprofit and for-profit groups exploring new technologies for developmental applications (such as mobile communications and wireless technologies) and other initiatives addressing barriers of the digital divide.
