The building was begun before 1086 and is Grade I listed. It is notable for containing a large mural dating from around 1170, depicting images of the Last Judgement and purgatory.  Building  The small church is divided into a nave and chancel. The nave has a two-bay arcade on the north and south sides which leads into aisles. The east end of the south aisle leads into a chapel dedicated to St Catherine, while the west end forms the base of the tower and is adjoined by the south porch. A vestry abuts the west end of the north aisle. The east and west walls of the church likely date from the eleventh century, while the remainder of the church is predominantly 12th and 13th century. The major exceptions are St Catherine's chapel, which was partially rebuilt and given a new window in the early 14th century, and the tower built in 1843. There is a blocked arch at the end of the north aisle which suggests there was once also a chapel on this side of the chancel. The church windows have also been altered several times; those in the north aisle date from 1330, the wide chancel window from 1460, and the south aisle window is early 17th century. There is an easter sepulchre in the chancel dating from the fourteenth century, and the pulpit dates from 1657.  Wall Painting  The mural on the west wall of the nave was only discovered during restoration works in 1870-1. The background is of red tempera, while the figures are a lighter red or pink. The mural has been described as 'perhaps the most interesting ancient wall-painting in England' and as 'one of the most important English wall paintings' of its date. A figure of a demon was discovered on the north aisle at the same time, but was destroyed. The overall scheme combines several iconographic subjects, including the Last Judgement, Harrowing of Hell, and the Ladder of Salvation. The painting is divided in two by a cloudy band. The lower half containins demons and depictions of sin, and the upper half the judgement and the salvation of souls. In the centre is a ladder, with Christ in a nimbus at the top. The main figures of the lower half include two demons boiling sinners in a cauldron, two demons holding a saw on which balance sinners, and the tree of knowledge with the Serpent. Representations of the Seven deadly sins surround these scenes. The upper half depicts the Harrowing of Hell to the right and the Archangel Michael weighing souls to the left. Pevsner describes the subject as 'rare' and describes it as a 'Purgatorial Ladder', while Malden links it to a style developed in the Greek Orthodox Church, particularly a type called 'The Ladder of the Salvation of the Soul and the Road to Heaven'.

In the act, the United States' Congress gave the President the conditional authority to lift sanctions against the PLO and ordered the U.S. State Department to monitor the PLO's compliance with the Accords. This was designed to provide aid funding to the Palestinians in hopes of promoting the Middle East Peace Process. History For hundreds of years, the Middle East has been a hotbed of violent disagreement, extremist tactics and nearly continual upheaval. Discord between Jews and Muslims in the region containing their holiest of sites seems like a problem without a solution. In spite of this there have been a long series of attempted solutions to the problem of the Holy Land, from European powers, from the United Nations and eventually the United States. One of the earliest American solutions was the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1993. An attempt to use the economic and finical might to promote the post-Oslo peace, the Act is a fascinating example of the American domestic policy process and how it can effect the nature of world events. Ultimately, the Peace Act would not save the fragile peace planted in the early 1990s, but it would create a precedent of American aid to both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which continues today.

Portrayed by actress Cl√©mence Po√©sy, she is a counterpart for the character Saga Nor√©n (played by Sofia Helin), a police detective partnered with DCI Karl Roebuck (played by Stephen Dillane). Po√©sy has stated that she deliberately avoided watching the original Swedish series from which her character originates, in order to avoid having any outside influences on her portrayal of the character, and that the relationship between Elise and Karl was her favourite part of the series. On her character, she explains that she views her as being \\"so fragile and pure\\" and \\"like a kid.\\" Character Elise starts the series as a Capitaine (Captain) in the DCPJ, but later advances to the rank of Commandant (Commander) following the promotion of her superior, Olivier Pujol. As with her Swedish counterpart, Elise is noted for demonstrating traits consistent with Asperger syndrome, such as difficulty in understanding or recognising social concepts such as empathy, sarcasm, and lying; also, she possesses an above-average intellect, a good eye for detail and a reputation for thoroughness. As with Saga, she frequently engages in casual sex, has a difficult history (in Elise's case, she lost her twin sister in a drowning accident when she was a child), and drives a Porsche (in Elise's case, a Porsche 944). However, there are some differences between the two characters' personalities; Elise is less guarded about her emotions and has less difficulty in forming social relationships (including some romantic ones). As she spends more time with her British colleague, Karl Roebuck (Dillane), he coaches her through social scenarios where she normally struggles, and makes more allowances for her when she messes up. Critics generally praised both Po√©sy and Dillane's chemistry, with Rebecca Smith of The Daily Telegraph comparing their relationship to that of the protagonists of Broadchurch, and James Stansfield of Den of Geek observing that it created a \\"powerful\\" finale. Until series 2, Elise does not show any interest in being involved in a romantic relationship. Her sexual encounters with men are casual. Although in series 2 she starts off with a boyfriend, Ga√´l, who has just moved in with her, he subsequently leaves Elise when he realizes that her commitment to her work is more important. Later in the series, and to her own surprise, Elise develops feelings for Eryka Klein, a German woman who worked alongside a French judge killed in the aeroplane crash she was investigating. Eryka was one of the children born into the notorious Colonia Dignidad colony in Chile, where she had lost her twin brother. Elise finds herself sexually attracted to Eryka and their connection becomes romantic, but their relationship proves to have dire consequences on her case. In \\"Episode 2\\" of Series 3, Elise tells Maya Roebuck that she lost her virginity to a boy when she was thirteen years old, and to a girl when she was fifteen. Storyline =Series 1= Elise first meets DCI Karl Roebuck when a body is discovered at the mid-point of the service side of the Channel Tunnel, with the French side occupied by a controversial French politician, Marie Villeneuve, and the British side occupied by a Welsh prostitute named Gemma Kirwan, who had disappeared several months previously. Their relationship gets off to a frosty start when Elise ignores all social niceties and rudely tells Karl that the operation falls under French jurisdiction (before they discover the second body). As the investigation begins, Elise's eye for detail quickly helps to identify the slaughterhouse where the victims were dismembered, and clear the fascist farmer who owned it as a suspect, when she realises that he doesn't understand English. However, her lack of social skills and bluntness quickly get on Karl's nerves, particularly when she makes an insensitive comment to an elderly woman that they are interviewing when the second \\"truth\\" occurs. In turn, she comes to find his sarcasm and willingness to bend procedure to be obstructive, when he allows another suspect, Charlotte Joubert, to leave when Elise was about to interview her. Over the course of the investigation, however, Karl and Elise develop a much closer relationship, both professionally and personally, as her superior intellect and dedication to the job complements his professionalism and powers of persuasion. In addition, Karl begins to care for Elise when she is shot by the Truth Terrorist - the alias that the killer has given himself - while trying to save Jean-Claude Delplanque, an elderly victim of his \\"second truth,\\" and later when she offers him support when his marriage begins to take strain as a result of his infidelity. However, it takes a severe knock when Karl discovers that his teenage son, Adam, spent the night at Elise's apartment, and is only barely reassured when she explains that she did not actually engage in physical intimacy with him. She later refuses to spend time with Adam when she realises that it has upset his father, and at one point joins Karl's family for dinner. In addition, it is shown that, despite her outwardly unemotional demeanour, Elise continues to be haunted by the death of her twin sister, whose photograph she keeps on her desk. This is seen when she rescues fourteen-year old Sophie Campbell, a runaway who had inadvertently run into TT while staying in the home of a mentally ill man who went on to perpetrate TT's \\"third truth,\\" by tackling her off a pier and into the water beneath. When Karl notices the effect that it has had on her, Elise reveals that her sister had drowned when the two had been dragged out to sea by a riptide when her parents had taken them on a beach holiday, and that they had only managed to rescue her. When a potential lead points to a former French policeman, Fabien Vincent, as TT, Elise organises an ambush to try and take him into custody, but it proves a failure, much to her anger. The investigation is also hindered by the DCRI whom Vincent has been working for in their investigation into a suspected gun-running enterprise. Subsequently, Elise is kidnapped by Vincent and his colleague, so that he can answer her questions and prove his innocence without being taken into custody. They are ambushed by gangsters seeking to kill Vincent, and he manages to take her to safety. When TT is identified as Karl's former colleague, Kieran Ashton, whose wife he had had an affair with, Elise agrees to look after Adam while Karl goes to rescue his wife, who has been placed in a trap by Ashton. When she learns of his recent conversations with his former girlfriend in South Africa, as well as the circumstances around the death of Ashton's wife, Elise realises that Adam is the target, just as he has snuck out to meet his girlfriend. She is unable to get to him before he is kidnapped, and bears witness as a distraught Karl becomes aggressive and snaps at everyone. While he searches for his son alone, Elise has an idea; she tracks Fabien Vincent down and gets details on a property that the organisation that he and Ashton had worked for, Peloton, had used as a safe house. A quick search of the house leads to the discovery of Adam's body. Elise goes to the Tunnel, where Karl is confronting Ashton. She attempts to talk Karl down by informing him that they have found Adam and that he is in hospital. When she approaches, however, he sees evidence that she has been crying, and deduces that his son is dead. Elise manages to talk Karl down, and subdues Ashton. With the investigation over, Karl decides to retire from the police force, and he and Elise bid each other farewell. =Series 2= The Tunnel: Sabotage Series 2 begins about a year after the events of series 1. Elise has been promoted to Commander of her unit after Olivier accepts a new assignment in Paris. Her boyfriend, Ga√´l, is now living with her although she is having difficulty sharing her space with him. While attending a management class (which she takes to improve her leadership skills), she is called to the Folkestone to interview Chloe Fournier, a little girl whose mother, Madeleine and stepfather, Robert, were kidnapped in the Channel Tunnel. She is happy to reunite with Karl, who is in charge of the PPU where Chloe is being kept. Unfortunately, due to her condition, Elise is unable to properly communicate with the traumatised Chloe, and has to rely on the assistance of her colleague. That evening, Elise joins Karl's family for dinner, where she quickly notices that his marriage to Laura is on the rocks. Unbeknownst to the group, Robert Fournier, an ideological anarchist, had actually staged the kidnapping, and after executing Madeleine, leads his team in a major act of terrorism: with the help of some inside agents and his deceased wife's research, he hacks into the autopilot of a passenger plane and crashes it into the Channel, killing all on board. When Elise goes to investigate the wreckage with Karl and the rest of the police force, she bears witness to his violent and hostile reaction to a paparazzo trying to get close to the wreckage. Shortly afterwards, Olivier, who has arrived to assist with the investigation, covertly informs Elise about the truth behind the crash, warning her not to share it with anyone. After a member of Fournier's gang is identified and later apprehended, the team piece together the details of the plot, including Fournier's involvement. However, members of the cell storm the police station and try to break Rosa out. This leads to a hostage standoff, during which Rosa demands that Elise and Karl be brought in return for two hostages. Elise goes in alone, and Rosa questions her over the photo of her twin sister on her desk. Elise, in turn, goads Rosa into attacking her, causing Olivier to order his men in and attack. Before her death from Sepsis in hospital, Rosa lets slip the name \\"Koba,\\" whom Elise believes may be the cell's leader. Meanwhile, a link is made between several passengers on the plane and a human trafficking ring based in Folkestone. One is Paul Bresson, a French judge highly involved in human rights and human trafficking, and the other is a Polish detective who had been investigating the ring at the time, Elise is assigned to interview Eryka Klein, a German national who worked as Bresson's assistant. Initially, she angers Eryka with her questioning, but subsequently learns from her reading material and subsequent questioning of Eryka's background. She had been born and raised on the notorious Colonia Dignidad colony in Chile, where she had been subjected to sexual assault, and had lost her twin brother early in her life. This strikes a chord with Elise, who is likewise haunted by the premature death by drowning of her twin sister when they were children. With the approval of Olivier, she begins seeing Eryka as a friend, although this soon causes her to ignore plans with Ga√´l. Following the failed siege, the team track Robert down to a nearby dock, but he makes his escape. Elise is prevented from pursuing him when she sees the body of a woman he killed floating in the water, and freezes as the image causes her to have flashbacks to the day her sister died. Following the incident, Karl manages to blackmail his boss into providing him with the information of an MI5 investigation into Vanessa Hamilton, the woman managing the organisation that Bresson was investigating. They discover that the organisation has ties to Gregor Baturin, a Georgian arms dealer, who was imprisoned by Bresson. Gregor also has ties to Colonia Dignidad. They realise that Koba is Gregor's son and lawyer, Artem Baturin, and that he is threatening the British government into releasing his father. The aircraft crash was a mere demonstration, and Baturin has a nuclear option to ensure he is not arrested - Edgar Branco, a psychopathic doctor from Colonia Dignidad who possesses a variety of dangerous viruses capable of infecting thousands. Suspicion soon falls upon Eryka, who didn't board the plane due to a supposedly lost passport and had a close relationship with Bresson and his timetable. When Karl and Elise interview Eryka, she eventually reveals in anger that Gregor had been one of the men who raped her in her youth. Despite this, Karl expresses doubt about whether Eryka's alibi adds up. Shortly after this incident, Elise meets Eryka in a bar to finish questioning her. When Eryka arrives, she notices that Elise is wearing makeup, something she has never done before. After discovering that it is Elise's birthday, Eryka insists on buying a bottle of champagne for them to share. Although she dislikes the taste of alcohol, Elise agrees. As they drink, Eryka questions Elise about her sister, and later lets slip that she feels a connection to her, which Elise admits she feels as well. Later, as Eryka walks the slightly drunk Elise home, she blocks her path and stares intently into her eyes, as if she were about to kiss her. Rattled, Elise tells Eryka her boyfriend is waiting for her and quickly makes her exit, leaving Eryka visibly disappointed. The next day, Karl and Elise interview Eryka again. Karl notices the interaction between them is not entirely professional and becomes suspicious when Elise begins to play down the evidence stacking up against Eryka. Sometime later, Ga√´l, having grown fed up of Elise, breaks up with her and moves out. Later that same evening, Eryka arrives to say goodbye to Elise before returning to Hamburg to see her grandmother. On impulse, Elise invites her in. While looking at Elise's book collection, she admits that Gael broke up with her because she didn't love him. When Eryka presses further, Elise accidentally lets slip that she loves her instead. She attempts to backtrack by insisting that her feelings for her are purely platonic, but Eryka gently touches her face, silencing her, and asks if she's quite sure of that. In response, Elise kisses her. Eryka returns the kiss and then takes Elise to bed. The following day, Karl sees that Elise is now defending Eryka more fiercely, particularly when evidence comes in that suggests that Eryka's card was used to buy the tampered phone used to hack into the plane. He eventually asks her point blank if she is having sex with Eryka. Elise erupts in anger at this question, but eventually agrees to look at the evidence. Upon doing so, she sees that Eryka's card was used by the same man who was seen boarding the plane with Bresson, and realises that Eryka was indeed involved in its destruction. Distraught, she calls Olivier to come to her apartment to tell him everything, when Eryka unexpectedly shows up to say hello. Elise confronts her directly. Realising her cover has been blown, Eryka confesses to her involvement, explaining that she sides with Baturin because the United States had been fully aware of the goings on in Colonia Dignidad. Realising she is about to be arrested, Eryka holds the heartbroken Elise at gunpoint and orders her to get out of her way. When Elise refuses, Eryka forces herself to lie to her that she had merely seduced her to keep an ear to the investigation, and that she feels nothing for her. She shoots Olivier in the leg on the way out, forcing him to hospital. The day after this incident, Karl comes to pick Elise up and finds the place has been completely trashed. Elise lies that she was merely looking for the bug that Eryka claimed to have placed there. That night, concerned for the emotionally vulnerable Elise, he suggests she come stay with him, but she politely declines. Later that same evening, Eryka breaks into Elise's apartment and wakes her. She tells Elise that she has come back to tell her that she had been lying, and that she loves her. When she tries to kiss Elise, she slaps her away, but Eryka is undeterred and asks her for one more night. Initially hesitant, Elise accedes, and the two have sex. The next day, she tells Karl of the incident, and expresses sadness at having allowed her feelings to compromise the investigation. He tells her that her behaviour is perfectly understandable, observing that her condition causes her to experience emotions such as love and heartbreak more intensely. After Gregor dies unexpectedly of a heart attack, and their attempt to apprehend Artem fails, Karl is contacted by the MI5 officer investigating him, Neil Gray. Neil orders him to find Branco before Baturin can move him. He and Elise eventually find Branco through a Brazilian rentboy he used, but are taken prisoner when Branco's men show up. Branco takes an unusual interest in Elise's eyes, as they remind him of a previous subject. Wanting revenge, Baturin orders his men to kill them, but Branco convinces him to instead use them as subjects to infect the whole city with one of his viruses. Branco informs the two that the pathogen will become airborne once they die, and will most likely cause a massive outbreak. He carefully inject the virus into the terrified Elise's left eye. At that moment, the police storm the building; out of love for Elise, Eryka had covertly phoned her handlers in Russia and persuaded them to broker a new deal with Neil. The unconscious Elise is rushed to hospital, while Karl and Olivier arrest Baturin, and Neil ushers Eryka onto the helicopter, having agreed to allow her to walk free as part of the new deal. A week later, Elise is out of danger, the virus having been flushed from her system by multiple blood transfusions. Karl comes to visit, and comforts her, informing her that Baturin is facing trial and the truth behind the plane crash will be suppressed. Despite this, Elise is awoken from a dream about Eryka that night. She subconsciously removes the bandage from her eye. =Series 3 = She blows herself up after being a victim of a terror attack her partner had to make a choice to save her or 11 other people in a van she decided to take her own life to save the others and not to place the burden on her partner.

The available documentary sources are not clear enough to distinguish between this site and the castle mound across the river and one or the other was probably built by Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth, in 1177. At that time the river formed the border between Gwrtheyrnion and the independent state of Buellt; the town of Rhayader is on the Gwrtheyrnion side of the river. Rhys had recently conquered Buellt, hitherto ruled by William de Braose, as vengeance for the latter's notorious treatment of Welsh princes at Abergavenny Castle. The exact status of Gwrtheyrnion is unclear, its only recorded ruler having been an unidentified Einion ap Rhys, whose is described as Rhys ap Gruffydd's son-in-law; Rhys did have a son-in-law named Einion, but this was Einion o'r Porth, the son of Einion Clud, and ruler of Elfael. In 1182, however, Rhys and William de Braose made a peace agreement, with Rhys' son, Gruffydd, being wed to William's daughter. They were on sufficiently friendly terms for William to be allowed to re-establish himself in Buellt. Einion o'r Porth joined the Third Crusade in 1188, but was murdered upon his return by his brother Gwalter, who seized Elfael. Einion's cousin, Maelgwn ap Cadwallon, was the ruler of the adjacent state of Maelienydd, and used his forces to destroy Rhayader castle, while William de Braose (who was sheriff of Hereford) brought his forces against Elfael; Gwalter was successfully deposed. Rhys rebuilt the castle in 1194. In 1196, Rhys died, leading to a succession dispute between Gruffydd and his older bastard brother, Maelgwn ap Rhys. Although traditional Welsh law allowed acknowledged bastards to inherit, Rhys had wanted to follow the English practice, and pass Deheubarth to his eldest legitimate son, Gruffydd. Rhayader Castle was again destroyed. Gwenwynwyn ab Owain, heir of Powys Wenwynwyn, was an ally of Maelgwn ap Rhys, and invaded the lands to the immediate south of Powys Wenwynwyn - Arwystli, Cedewain, and Maelienydd. King Richard I, already unhappy with hegemonic behaviour by Gwenwynwyn, and Rhys before him, gave troops to Roger Mortimer, a nearby magnate, who used them to conquer Maelienydd, and push Gwenwynwyn back to Powys Wenwynwyn. Gwenwynwyn was expelled from Rhayader by them in about 1200. Mortimer either rebuilt or started a new building on the site, but records indicate that it was captured two years later by the welsh; they do not say whether it was by Maelgwn's forces or Gwenwynwyn's. In 1230, Ralph Mortimer, the son of Roger, married the daughter of Llywelyn Fawr. The following year, Llywelyn destroyed Rhayader castle, and it was not rebuilt. The remnants are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The surviving motte is a roughly rectangular flat- topped mound about . Approaches to the castle were protected by steep slopes or crags above the river on the north-west and southern sides. A rock-cut ditch at least deep and up to wide defended the other sides. This ditch is the only visible remnant of the fortifications.

The art of Pandemonia herself is that of a constructed figure placed in the landscape of media, fashion and art events that has instigated the media response by feeding back to the media its own language, imagery and ideals. The growth of Pandemonia's celebrity is one of the themes in her art, which also explores archetypes of pop myth and reality. Pandemonia's art is not only cross-media (sculpture, digital art, photography, and performance), but also cross-generational as she ties the earliest moments of Pop Art to the most current worlds of celebrity, fashion and contemporary art, creating an arc and evolution which continues its ongoing exploration.

In areas such as the Sacred Valley, 89% of children with disabilities don't go to school.  Law and policy  Articles 7, 16 and 23 of the Constitution of Peru address disability. Article 7 states that individuals have the right to health protections and if they are unable to care for themselves, has rights for care, rehabilitation, security and respect. Articles 16 and 23 address the rights of the disabled to have access to education and employment respectively. The general law that covers people with disabilities is Law No. 27050, created in 1998. This law established the National Council for the Integration of Persons with Disability (CONADIS). It also established hiring quotas for companies employing more than 50 people. CONADIS also helps disabled people find jobs by promoting them through their job board network. The Ministry of Labor and Promotion of Employment (MINTRA) helps young people find jobs. Despite quotas, some employers get around the law by counting people with glasses or frequent headaches as \\"disabled.\\" Law no. 29392, signed into law on September 9, 2009 by President Alan Garcia Perez, expands on Law No. 27050.

The company's \\"Automatic Enunciator\\" loudspeakers were employed at the receiving end. A test commercial installation was established in southside Chicago in 1913, but the project was short-lived and did not prove to be financially successful. This was the last significant attempt to set up a \\"telephone newspaper\\" to transmit entertainment over telephone lines in the United States, prior to the development of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s. History John J. Comer, inventor, demonstrating the Chicago Musolaphone transmission equipment.\\"Increasing the Revenue Producing Efficiency of a Plant\\" by Stanley R. Edwards, Telephony, October 11, 1913, pages 21-23. In 1910, the Automatic Electric Company, an established firm best known for making automatic telephone switchboards, announced its development of a new loudspeaker, called the \\"Automatic Enunciator\\", which was envisioned to have multiple potential uses. In part, Joseph Harris, president of the company, predicted: \\"An automatic enunciator, by which a man talking in New York can be heard in every part of a large room in Chicago... may make it possible for a public speaker to address a million or more people at one time... Running descriptions of baseball games, or prize fights can be sent over long distances for the entertainment of sporting fans of all varieties.\\"\\"Replaces Bell Boy\\", The (Culbertson, Montana) Searchlight, July 22, 1910, page 6. In 1910 the Automatic Enunciator Company was formed in Chicago to market the invention.Robert D. Fisher Manual of Valuable and Worthless Securities: Volume 6 (1938), page 75. Initially, Automatic Enunciators were employed in public address systems, for making announcements in establishments such as department stores, factories, and railroad stations. In 1913, multiple units were installed throughout the Comiskey Park baseball field in Chicago, both for announcements and to provide musical interludes.\\"Loud-Speaking Telephone Enunciators in Baseball Grand Stand\\", Electrical World, August 2, 1913, page 251. The next step was to expand the system to distribute programming to multiple sites, initially under the name \\"Multa Musola\\". Company publicity included the following description: \\"The object of the Multa Musola service is to distribute music by telephone wires from an instrument at the central office, so it can be easily heard in any part of a room without having to listen carefully.\\"\\"An Interesting By-Product for Telephone Companies\\", Telephony, August 10, 1912, pages 190, 192. The summer of 1912 saw a series of Multa Musola demonstrations in Portland, Oregon,\\"Have You Heard the Multa Musola?\\" (advertisement), Sunday (Portland) Oregonian, August 4, 1912, page 10. and in the spring of the next year, advertisements for the Oregon Enunciator Company appeared, promoting both home and business service. This would have competed with another telephone-based news and entertainment service, the Oregon Telephone Herald Company's \\"telephone newspaper\\", but there is no evidence that the Multa Musola system ever began operation. Moreover, later that year, Oregon's Corporation Commissioner, R. A. Watson, acting under the state's \\"Blue Sky\\" law, prohibited both the Oregon Enunciator Company and the Oregon Telephone Herald Company from doing business in the state, due to concern about their financial viability.\\"Blue Sky Law Applied\\", Morning (Portland) Oregonian, August 29, 1913, page 6. However, an experimental commercial Musolaphone service was established in south-side Chicago in 1913, working in conjunction with the Illinois Telephone & Telegraph Co. Two features that were superior to the Telephone Herald \\"telephone newspaper\\" systems was that listening was done over loudspeakers instead of headphones, and the system did not need dedicated, separate telephone lines, because \\"as soon as connection is made in the telephone exchange to the subscriber's line upon which the service is being given, the other equipment is automatically disconnected.

John J. Comer, former General Manager of a similarly designed Tel-musici installation at Wilmington, Delaware, was described as the inventor. An early 1914 report reviewed the Chicago Musolaphone's daily schedule: > \\"From eight to twelve in the morning, announcement of special bargain sales > at the leading stores is made, and the principal news items are read from > the morning papers including the United States weather report, stock market > quotations, announcements of special events happening during the day, etc. > At twelve o'clock the announcement of standard Western Union time is made. > From twelve to one-thirty is given up to a musical program, especially > adapted to cafes, restaurants, dining rooms, etc., and following this is a > running description of ball games of the home team and scores by innings of > other teams in both leagues during the baseball season.

(For comparison, at this time issues of the Chicago Tribune newspaper cost one cent on weekdays and five cents on Sundays.) Eventually interactive communication was established, as one report stated: \\"There is in Chicago a teacher of languages whose pupils have grown so in number recently that personal attention to each pupil has come to be out of the question. An arrangement was made with the Automatic Company's studio for connections and service and now the lessons are all transmitted by telephones, service can be cut in any time for the purpose of asking questions or more information on certain points and in all ways the telephone service proves as flexible as the ordinary arrangement in a studyroom.\\"\\"Metered Music and Oratory Over Automatic Phone\\", Buffalo (New York) Express, March 12, 1914, page 8. A challenge was submitted to the Chicago Counsel about the legality of the Musolaphone's operation on Sundays, and the fact that the telephone company was partnering with a service that charged extra beyond the normal telephone rental fees, but a ruling did not sustain either of these objections. An additional complaint was made to the City of Chicago by \\"a prominent news bureau... which protested that the music interfered with the news service\\". Again the city ruled in favor of the Musolaphone operation, while further noting that \\"The company, however, discontinued the music service.\\"\\"Telephone Report: Service Standards: Measured Service Study\\" (M. Ferry, October 5, 1914), The Telephone Bureau of the Department of Public Service City of Chicago: October 1, 1914, page 10. In early 1914, it was announced that the Federal Telephone Company of Buffalo, New York was planning to establish its own Musolaphone service, but it appears that no other systems were ever established. However, Automatic Enunciator loudspeakers continued to be marketed, with the emphasis returning to their use in public address systems. The Musolaphone Corporation's Delaware charter was repealed on January 27, 1919 for failure to pay taxes for two years,\\"Proclamation by Governor John G. Townsend, Jr.\\" (January 27, 1919), Laws of the State of Delaware Passed at a Special Session of the Ninety-sixth General Assembly, vol. 30, part I (1919), page 736. and the Automatic Enunciator Company was dissolved in 1926.

This daughter would marry Chief White Cloud of the Ioway, producing a chiefly line among that tribe. ... The kinship networks established between St. Louis independent traders and ranking native families in the years between 1800-1825 consolidated authority among the clan leaders linked to trader interests.

It was bought during Art Basel from M√ºnzen und Medaillen, A.G., October 17, 1963.Crane With flat handles decorated with depictions of ivy, and a double layered foot, it qualifies as a type A amphora. Dated circa 510 BCE, it was likely created by a member of the circle of Euthymides in Athens.Crane It is an early example of red-figure pottery which had been invented only ten years previously. It is regarded by scholars as one of the best examples of the vases that influenced artists in Etruria.Vermeule, 153 It is in excellent condition, but lacks an original find-spot. Depictions This vase consists of two scenes on either side of the vase, separated by a floral border. Side A shows the tussle between Apollo and Herakles over the Delphic Tripod, a common subject in painted vases. These bronze tripods were used for sacrifices, and were a very common votive offering at Archaic Greek temples; large numbers have been found at Apollo‚Äôs important cult site of Delphi, where this legend is set. Herakles is attempting to steal the particular sacred tripod of Delphi after the Pythian oracle refused to tell Herakles how to cure himself of a disease. Apollo attempts to stop Herakles and an argument between the two half-brothers devolves into a wrestling contest. This fight is eventually broken up when the two are separated by one of Zeus‚Äô lightning bolts. Side A depicts the moment when Apollo first grabs Herakles‚Äô bicep to stop him from absconding with the tripod. With an open mouth, he seems to beseech Herakles to reconsider his actions. Herakles wrenches his arm from Apollo, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. The sacred palm in the middle of the frame serves as a barrier between the two figures and as a marker of the sacred site of Delphi. The words HERAKLEOS, KALOS, and APOLLONOS which mean Herakles, Beautiful, and Apollo respectively.Boston MFA page Professor Warren G. Moon has noted that the depiction of Herakles silhouette and movement bear similarities to depictions by the Rycroft Painter on black-figure pottery work. Side B shows a common motif among Archaic pottery - a scuffle between a maenad and a group of satyrs. The ithyphallic satyrs defend themselves from the blows of the maenad‚Äôs grape vines as they advance upon her.Crane This composition of this side, with three figures evenly spaced, with varied and expressive poses, is a type adapted by Etruscan artists in their tomb paintings, as well as vases made in Etruria.Vermeule, 153-156 Notes References *Crane, Gregory R.

During her 26-year career, she produced nearly 200 new hardy hybrids of lily, lilac, crab apple, iris and rose plants for Canada's cold climate. While female plant breeders were rather rare in her day, she quietly challenged gender bias and set the stage for new generations of breeding programs at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and elsewhere. Biography Isabella Preston was born on 4 September 1881 in Lancaster, England where her father worked as a silversmith. As a child, she attended boarding school in Liverpool and later studied at the University of London. She gardened from an early age, helping her father on the family farm. Her only formal education in horticulture was obtained through a course at Swanley Horticulture College in Kent which she completed before emigrating to Canada in 1912. She was 31 years old when she and her sister Margaret immigrated to Canada following the death of their mother. Margaret had accepted a position as a music teacher in Guelph, Ontario, and encouraged Preston to join her. Preston found her first job in Guelph picking plums, peaches, and raspberries on a fruit farm. She enrolled at the Ontario Agricultural College the same year to study plant breeding and was one of the few women pursuing the subject at the time. Within her first year, Preston transitioned from class-based study to hands-on work under the supervision of under James W. Crow, then head of the Department of Horticulture. In 1913, Crow hired her full-time to work in the greenhouses. Throughout World War I, plant breeders intensified their focus on fruit and vegetable plants. Government campaigns urged increased production in order to feed military personnel. Preston worked on breeding fruit that ripened quickly and was more resistant to insects and disease. From her enrollment at the OAC until 1920, Preston contributed to the successful breeding of various vegetables, fruits and ornamental plants including garden lilies. She gained international recognition by introducing the acclaimed \\"George C. Creelman\\" lily and became the first professional woman hybridist in Canada in 1916. The \\"George C. Creelman\\" lily was the first hybrid lily well suited to the Canadian climate. Preston wrote numerous articles on various horticultural subjects, and in 1929 published Garden Lilies, the first book about lily cultivation in Canada. During World War II, Preston acted as an advisor to the Royal Canadian Air Force on plants for comouflaging aircraft hangars. She died on 31 December 1965 in Georgetown, Ontario. Following her death, 139 of her gardening and plant books, along with her personal archives, were donated to the Royal Botanical Gardens Library in Hamilton, Ontario. Career In 1920, (at age 40) she relocated to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and worked as a day labourer for the federal government at the Central Experimental Farm (CEF). Her work was noticed by W.T. Macoun, Dominion Horticulturalist, and she was soon offered the position of Specialist in Ornamental Horticulture. She was the first person to focus solely on breeding ornamental plants. Preston enthusiastically shared her knowledge with amateur and professional gardeners and regularly gave tours of the Central Experimental Farm‚Äôs ornamental gardens. In 1922, she advised Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on landscape design at his Kingsmere estate in Gatineau Park. Over the course off her career Preston produced roughly 200 plant hybrids working with lilies, lilacs, crab apple trees, peonies and roses. She developed many of the 125 different strains in the Central Experimental Farm lilac collection. Her lilac and crab apple hybrids are also still seen flowering on the Central Experimental Farm each spring along with two of her roses. Preston‚Äôs hybrids were disease-resistant and well suited to geographic regions within Canada since one of the mandates of the CEF was to produce plants hardy enough to survive northern prairie winters. Preston Retired from the Central Experimental Farm in 1946 but continued to act as an advisor. Her achievements include: *The Preston lilacs - 52 varieties that were hardy and late-bloomers, many named for Shakespearean characters. Most of these can be seen in the CEF's lilac collection today. (The varieties of lilac that were commonly seen in Europe bloomed too early in the Canadian climate and the buds or blooms were frequently nipped by late spring frosts.) Eighty of Miss Preston's late- blooming cultivars are recorded in the International Lilac Register although only about one-half of these were distributed to other institutions or nurseries. Cultivars ‚ÄòAudrey', 'Elinor' and ‚ÄòIsabella' received Awards of Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society, London, England, in 1939, 1951 and 1941, respectively; 'Bellicent' was awarded a First Class Certificate in 1946. *The Stenographer lilies series ‚Äì named after the 7 stenographers working at the CEF at the time. These lilies had dark red or orange flowers that faced outward and upward, which was a unique characteristic of this type of plant. Five of the Stenographer series lilies won Awards of Merit from horticulture societies in London and Boston, and were widely distributed commercially. * Fighter Aircraft lilies ‚Äì named for second world war Allied planes * Canadian Lake crab apples (or Rosyblooms) ‚Äì 15 hardy crab apple trees with coloured leaves and pretty flowers named after Canadian Lakes. Some of these rosyblooms, planted as early as 1928, can still be found in the Arboretum and Ornamental Gardens at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa. * Siberian irises - named after Canadian Rivers * Preston roses ‚Äì at least 20 hardy varieties, many of which were named after Canadian native tribes (Agassiz, Algonquin, Antenor, Ardelia, Caribou, Carmenetta, Chippewa, Conestoga, Cree, Erie, Huron, Iroquois, Langford, Micmac, Millicent, Mohawk, Nascapee, Orinda, Patricia Macoun, Ojibway, Poliarchus, Regina, Rosania, Sylvander and Valeria). While her roses never won her awards, they provided an excellent stage for the work of Dr Felicitas Svejda who worked at the CEF from 1956‚Äì86 and became known as Canada‚Äôs rose expert. Honours and awards Preston was hailed as the \\"Queen of Ornamental Horticulture\\" and a new hybrid species of lilacs, \\"Syringa prestoniae\\", was named in her honour. This was the result of a cross between wild species from China and put Canada on the lilac \\"map\\". In 2005 the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa created the \\"Preston Heritage Collection\\". In February 2007, Canada Post released two new stamps featuring a lilac variety developed by Ms. Preston. She was co-organizer of the North American Lily Society. The Isabella Preston Trophy was established by the North American Lily Society in recognition of her work. She received awards from many Canadian and international horticultural societies including lifetime memberships from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and the Canadian Iris Society. Notable awards include the Veitch Memorial Medal in Gold (Royal Horticultural Society, London, 1938), Jackson Dawson Medal (Massachusetts Horticultural Society, 1946), Lytell Cup (Lily Committee, Royal Horticultural Society, 1950), and the EH Wilson Memorial Award (North American Lily Society, 1961).

Produced by keyboardist Jordan Fish and vocalist Oliver Sykes, it was featured on the band's 2015 fifth studio album That's the Spirit. The song was also released as the fifth single from the album on 26 February 2016, reaching number 95 on the UK Singles Chart and topping the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. Promotion and release \\"Follow You\\" was first revealed in a short teaser trailer, alongside another for That's the Spirit opening track \\"Doomed\\", on 28 August 2015. Alternative Press writer Tom Bryant described it as \\"an emotional ballad littered with skittering electronics\\". Andy Biddulph of Rock Sound described it as \\"a love song ‚Äì or the closest thing to it that this band has ever written\\", and as a \\"cross between PVRIS and Linkin Park\\". In a pre- release review of the album, Gigwise's Amy Gravelle noted that \\"Follow You\\" sees Sykes \\"pour[ing] out his heart in an emotional epilogue\\". It is categorized as a pop rock song with hip hop influenced beats by Emmy Mack of Music Feeds. On 26 February 2016, the track was released as a single in the form of a limited edition 7\\" vinyl. Composition and lyrics Bring Me the Horizon vocalist Oliver Sykes and keyboardist Jordan Fish originally started writing \\"Follow You\\" at around the same time as they wrote \\"Drown\\", which was released as a single in 2014. According to Sykes, the song's lyrics were based on his relationship with his wife during \\"a particular rough patch, when things weren't looking too good\\"; during a track-by-track commentary of the album for Spotify, he explained that the overarching message was that \\"no matter how bad being together can sometimes get, the alternative is just so much worse\\". Music video The music video for \\"Follow You\\" was premiered on 16 March 2016 via the band's Vevo channel. Co-directed by Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes and Frank Borin, the video depicts a series of violent events described by a number of commentators as leading to the end of the world, including seemingly random acts of violence, murder, arson and property damage, as a young man listens to the song, dances and sings in the street, oblivious to the events around him. Loudwire's Joe DiVita proposed that while the video was \\"brutally graphic\\" and \\"NSFW\\", this served as \\"the perfect juxtaposition\\" to the \\"somber and emotional song\\" to which it was the visual accompaniment. Alternative Press writer Caitlyn Ralph merely described it as \\"intriguing\\". The video was noted by many critics for its graphic nature. Rock Sound writer Andy Biddulph, for example, described the video as \\"horrifying\\", noting that it contained \\"gore, death, guns and violence against animals\\". Similarly, James Hingle of Kerrang! warned that it was \\"not for the faint- hearted\\". Of particular contention was a scene in which a Golden Retriever is shot and killed by a mail carrier. Fuse's Zach Dionne reacted to the video simply with the phrase \\"What the fuck\\", before berating it as \\"an immense misstep\\" by the band. Emmy Mack of Music Feeds displayed shock at the video, describing it as \\"a gruesome, NSFW fucking bloodbath\\", although did praise the production by noting that \\"The whole thing is a god damn motherfucking horror movie. But at least it's a blockbuster one.\\" Bring Me the Horizon later responded to the controversy on Twitter, joking about the dog's fate. Critical reception Critical response to \\"Follow You\\" was generally positive. Bradley Zorgdrager of Exclaim! praised the song for \\"reigning in the force while remaining impactful\\", in contrast to much of the rest of the album which he criticised for sounding too similar to bands such as Thirty Seconds to Mars and Linkin Park. MTV's Mike Pell described the song as \\"One of the tamer, more anthemic singles\\" from That's the Spirit. Reviewing the album for DIY magazine, Sarah Jamieson identified \\"Follow You\\" as one of the album's tracks which sees Bring Me the Horizon \\"stepping further out of their comfort zone than ever before\\", describing it as \\"atmospheric\\". Commercial performance \\"Follow You\\" entered the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart at number six on 18 September 2015, following the release of That's the Spirit, when it also registered on the main UK Singles Chart for a solitary week at number 95. After moving up and down the top ten for a number of months, it later topped the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart on 25 March 2016, replacing A Day to Remember's \\"Paranoia\\". In the United States, the track reached number 34 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart.

This area became incorporated into the Sierra Leone Protectorate in 1888, and is now part of the Moyamba District of the independent Sierra Leone nation. Early life and education Canrah Bah Caulker was born into one of the most powerful family dynasties among the Sherbro people, in the territory now known as Moyamba District, Southern Province, Sierra Leone. Canrah Bah, also known as Richard, was born into the Caulker family of Sierra Leone. The men had become major slave traders in the 18th century during the commercialisation of the Atlantic slave trade with the West Indies and North America. Descended from English colonial official Thomas Corker (1670-1799) and Seniora Doll, a Sherbro chief's daughter, the mixed-race family became one of the wealthiest in the region because of such trading. The young Caulker likely attended Sierra Leone Grammar School, as British colonial authorities encouraged education among the leading families. He entered his family's trading business and became a merchant. Adult life Caulker married and had a family. He sent his son, Thomas Caulker (1846-1859), as a young boy to England to be educated at a school founded by an evangelical Englishwoman. He lived with a minister and his wife. However, Thomas had eye problems and other health issues; he died at the age of 13 and was buried in the non-denominational garden cemetery, Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington. Later in the early 1850s, Caulker, as Chief of Bompey, was working with some other chiefs of the Sherbro country (including his relative, Thomas Stephen Caulker, Chief of the Plantain Islands), to suppress the slave trade in this territory. They came to agreement with the Governor of the British colony of Sierra Leone in 1853, and the abolition of the regional trade was enacted into British law two years later by an Act of Parliament dated 14 August 1855. This authorized the British navy to intercept on the high seas any suspect slave trading vessels originating from or belonging to, inhabitants of Bompey, or to territories ruled by the other Sherbro signatories. Slaves liberated from such ships were generally resettled in Sierra Leone. Bompey was incorporated by the British into the Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate in 1888. In the 21st century, the Bumpe Chiefdom is part of the Moyamba District of the nation of Sierra Leone.

The evaluation team published their report in March 2006, titled Progress on global access to HIV antiretroviral therapy: a report on \\"3 by 5\\" and beyond. It found that 1.3 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment in the target countries by December 2005, up from 400,000 before the start of the initiative. The evaluation team also found that many of the worst-affected countries were still far from containing their AIDS crises. It also credits the 3 by 5 Initiative with establishing antiretroviral treatment as an essential public health intervention. The evaluation team attributes some of the difficulties in achieving the goals of the Initiative to an initial lack of secured funding (resulting in delays) and an unstable management of the HIV/AIDS program (due to the high turnover rate of WHO directors). The 3 by 5 Initiative has been criticized by Arthur J. Ammann for focusing only on treatment of HIV (instead of also focusing on testing and prevention), for the high costs of the program, and for being \\"top down\\" instead of allowing target countries to take charge of their own AIDS programs.

The ESP‚Äîprovides on-site (in situ) collection and analysis of water samples from the subsurface ocean. The instrument is an electromechanical/fluidic system designed to collect discrete water samples, concentrate microorganisms or particles, and automate application of molecular probes which identify microorganisms and their gene products. The ESP also archives samples so that further analyses may be done after the instrument is recovered.  HAB-related toxin detection with an Environmental Sample Processor  The MBARI-designed Environmental Sample Processor was the first underwater robotic instrument to provide autonomous detection of both a HAB species and its toxin. This ability allows scientists, in near real-time, to determine whether or not an algal bloom is toxic, thus allowing better prediction and treatment of public or ecosystem health threats. = The NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory = The NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) will deploy the first ever freshwater ESP in Lake Erie. This ESP will measure concentrations of particulate microcystins in the western basin of the lake, every other day. It can also genetically detect Microcystis and archive samples for future processing. With the addition of information from the ESPs, NOAA's suite of Lake Erie HAB products, (i.e. weekly Lake Erie HAB bulletin), and the Experimental HAB Tracker]), will have the ability to provide water managers with bloom location, projected direction, intensity, AND toxicity before the water reaches the intake.  Deployments  Initial deployments of the ESP took place in 2016: the first field tests of the communications and the microcystin detection happened in July. The ESP was re-deployed in August near the Toledo water intake crib for its first full mission. The Lake Erie ESP is deployed on a custom-built, underwater stationary mooring assembly. It samples the surface and in the water column, allowing the detection of microcystins as they relate to recreational risk (surface concentrations) or drinking water intake risk (at depth concentrations). After QC/QA, data is uploaded to NOAA‚Äôs Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) \\"HABs and Hypoxia\\" page to inform decision making by water managers and other stakeholders in near real-time.  Advantages over other monitoring methods  Managers without access to ESP data rely on 'in house' toxin testing, weekly sampling, surrogates (i.e. using algal pigment concentrations to infer risk of microcystins), or a combination of those. Toxins detected 'in house' are already either just outside the intake or present in the system. The ESP can provide managers earlier warning of blooms and toxicity. Correlations between data collected on toxicity and chlorophyll concentrations will be monitored in an effort to develop an experimental forecast of bloom toxicity.  Development and Funding  The Lake Erie ESP was purchased by GLERL with funding from the EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS)] leads development of algal toxin sensors for ESPs. The technology to detect microcystins by ELISA assay) was developed by NCCOS, GLERL, and the Cooperative Institute for Limnology and Ecosystems Research. The viability of ESP technology to assist in monitoring and forecasting of marine HABs and their related toxins in California and the Gulf of Maine has been supported by NCCOS funding.

She documents the day she lost her virginity after sitting on her front lawn in a candy-striped halter top, hip- hugger jeans and platform shoes and agreed to go to the movies that night with the first man who approached her - Brian, a man in his 30s. When she was 15 she began seeing a boy, called \\"Jimmy\\" in the book, who was in a committed relationship with another girl, \\"Chrissy.\\" However, almost every night Jimmy would pick up Kathy from her home, his car already full with his friends who were drinking and smoking. He would drop the friends off at the Teen Center where they spent their afternoons, and then he would take Kathy to an empty park. A few months into the relationship, Kathy writes that instead of dropping his friends off, Jimmy drove the whole group to the park, forcing them to get out of the car while he had sex with Kathy. Then, Jimmy and his friends gang raped her. She was ostracized by her peers at the Teen Center, who quickly heard of what transpired in the park that night. She knew her life would never be the same, so she turned to writing and embraced her life as a self-proclaimed loner. The memoir ends with her documenting her life as it is currently - her row house in Brooklyn, her eclectic roommates and neighbors, and the boyfriend who lives across the Brooklyn Bridge - a distance she says she appreciates.

He took portraits of many icons of his time including President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Sigmund Freud, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Albert Einstein, H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi of India, and many others. His portrait of President Roosevelt became the image used as the model for the American dime. He served as \\"Private Photographer to the Belgian Royal Family\\" beginning in 1935 and his images of the royal children were printed on Belgian postage stamps, which bore his name. Active from 1934 until his death in Christianburg, Virginia in 1956, his 22-year career spanned a tumultuous period in modern history. He began his life as a journalist, turning later to photography to capture events around him. While not a photojournalist in the traditional sense, his portraits of the world's political and cultural elite offered a glimpse into the personalities shaping events of the 20th century. Over the course of his professional life, he developed a technique for using light, positioning, and a contemporaneous interview of his subjects to create not only a striking image of an individual, but one that allowed for personality, emotion, and experience to be visually expressed. Early life and education Born in Hungary in 1899, Sternberger came of age in the early days of World War I. Hailing from a family of Hungarian patriots, he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army upon graduating high school and served as an intelligence officer. When post-war borders shifted, the Sternbergers found their territory had been reappropriated to Romania, and the family consequently moved to Budapest. He studied law there until political and religious persecution compelled him to flee to the Czech border. After a stint studying history in Prague, Sternberger attended the Sorbonne in Paris as a law student, ultimately earning a PhD. He began his journalistic career there writing for leading newspapers and magazines. In 1932, he went to Berlin in the last days of the Weimar Republic where he met film student Ilse Naumann. They wed hastily in 1933, just before the Nazi confiscation of Jewish passports, and then returned to Paris. It was Ilse's gift of a Leica camera in 1934 that prompted Sternberger's interest in photography. A handheld Leica was to remain his camera of choice throughout his career. Career =Belgian royal family= An assignment from Le Soir sent the Sternbergers to Belgium. It was there that his career in photography began in earnest. Through the suggestion of the mayor of Antwerp, Camille Huysmans, Sternberger was invited to photograph the Belgian Royal Family. It was his first professional assignment, and he was subsequently named \\"Private Photographer to the Belgian Royal Family.\\" His 1935 portrait of Queen Astrid taken shortly before her untimely death in a car accident endeared him to the family, with a print displayed in the King's private bedroom and five copies ordered by the Queen Mother as personal gifts for Christmas His images of the royal children: Josephine Charlotte, Baudouin and Albert, were printed on Belgian postage stamps. =England= Anticipating Nazi expansion in 1936, the Sternbergers moved to London with their two children. His career as a portraitist flourished, and he photographed many famous sitters including George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, Anthony Eden, and Sigmund Freud. =United States= Albert Einstein and Marcel Sternberger, Princeton, New Jersey, 1950 In 1938, he photographed U.S. Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, who used Sternberger's photograph in a Christmas card he sent to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt consequently invited Sternberger to Washington, DC to shoot the portrait which was to become the image embossed on the American dime. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Sternberger found himself stranded in North America, unable to return to England due to his Hungarian citizenship. In time, he was able to bring his family to join him in the United States, ultimately leaving behind most of their money and belongings. He continued to photograph intellectual, political, and cultural leaders of the time among them Albert Einstein, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, and the Shah of Iran. He also went on to make portraits of MGM and 20th Century Fox movie stars. In 1940, Sternberger began teaching a series of lectures at New York University entitled \\"Applied Psychology in Photographic Portraiture.\\" It was an opportunity to formally present the psychological methods he had honed over years along with the lighting and positioning techniques he employed in his practice to infuse a photographic portrait with the personality of the sitter. He was later to write an unpublished manuscript on the subject, through which he intended to describe how the essence of a sitter could be captured through precise technical and psychological procedures.

The soundtrack of the film has been composed by Jeet Gannguli. The film stars Dev and Nusrat Jahan in lead roles. The film is a remake of the 2013 Telugu movie Venkatadri Express. Plot The film focusses on a family living in Kolkata whose head is Ram Shibo Prasad (Victor Banerjee), a retired head master. He is a disciplined person and always tries to make his relatives behave in the same way. To avoid bad remarks from the society about his family, he sets up a family constitution of discipline. His mania for discipline is such big that if any one of his family members commit 100 Mistakes, that person would be banished from the family and that mistake can be anything which Shibo Prasad hates which includes laughing out loudly. Thus all of the family members maintain a disciplinary life to avoid being banished from the house. In detail, the family consists of Shibo Prasad's wife Aparna, an Asthma patient; his daughter Kavita, his son in law Vikas and their kids. Apart from them are Shibo Prasad's two sons Ananada (Saheb Chatterjee) and Raktim Prasad (Dev). Since Shibo Prasad's brother Ram Prasad (Shankar Chakraborty) was alleged to be committed 100 Mistakes though he didn't, he is sent away from home. While all of the family members commit mistakes less than 20, Raktim commits 99 Mistakes and one more, he is out of the family. So to avoid that Raktim starts leading a careful life. Ananda's marriage is scheduled at New Jalpaiguri and the whole family boards Paharia Express at Howrah. Raktim's mother forgot the Sindor at the house and Raktim goes away to bring it back. Moreover, to his convenience, Raktim is in S4 while others are in S3. So Raktim goes outside the station and waits for an Taxi, But none accepts to go to his area. Meanwhile, a miser techie Neelasha (Nusrat Jahan) reaches Howrah railway station to board the Paharia Express and the taxi driver goes to bring the change in order to pay her off the balance amount after receiving the fare. Raktim gets into the vehicle and goes to his home. He breaks the house's lock with a stone as he has no keys to open it. He takes the Sindoor and goes back to Howrah Railway Station. Neelasha catches yet another Taxi and reaches to the station. There she pays off the fares of both the vehicles and goes to board the train. Meanwhile, a passenger Dulal (Kanchan Banerjee) asks Raktim to take care of his bag till he gets into the train after buying a water bottle and Raktim accepts it. They both save each other's Mobile numbers so that Raktim can give a missed call to Dulal if the train leaves the station and due to that, Dulal would board the train. However a tiffin vendor and a customer quarrel. Raktim in order to avoid committing the 100th mistake keeps quiet. The story shifts to next day morning around 9:30 in the Morning at New Jalpaiguri Railway Station. Shibo Prasad and his entire family travel in two cars which are led by two baaraat bands. Shibo Prasad, Aparna, Kavita and her younger daughter travel in one car and Raktim, Vikas, Ananda, Vikas's son Bhokai and their servant travel in another car. Raktim's shirt has Blood stains and when Anando, Vikas ask the reasons for the stains, Raktim narrates the story which happened in the past 12 hours. To compromise and stop a quarrel, Raktim gets down from the train and starts speaking with the aggrieved persons. Neelasha misguides the customer that Raktim is a Robber and goes along with the customer to complain on Raktim. Meanwhile, Raktim is thanked by the tiffin vendor. But to Raktim's misfortune, Paharia Express leaves the platform. So with the help of the tiffin vendor's friend and good transporter Kesto (Rudranil Gosh), Raktim goes to Burdwan. While Raktim reaches Gura, Kesto goes to the nearby Bar and quarrels with the local police calling their brandy as cheap liquor. Raktim saves Kesto in time only to realize that the vehicle's keys are in the Bar. Yet again Kesto insults the police. In the meanwhile time Raktim is informed by Dulal that Train left Burdwan and is heading towards Bolpur. Raktim and Kesto unknowingly get into a car and drive away to Bolpur in order to catch the train. However once again to Raktim's misfortune, They robbed the Police's vehicle and the police are following them. They leave the car and reach the station of Bolpur. A Drunken Kesto gets into Paharia Express making Raktim miss the train again. In the process Raktim gets hurt and faints. On gaining consciousness, Raktim is shocked to see that he is been taken to Burdwan police station by those Police. Yet again Raktim escapes and hangs on a Private Bus. The Bus stops and Raktim gets into it for travelling to Rampur hat Junction, yet another important stop of Paharia Express. To his shock Neelasha is his co-passenger. Both unnecessarily quarrel and hence are forcibly dropped out from the Bus. They board a car whose Tyre gets punctured. Raktim goes away with the Tyre telling that he would get it repaired but in turn reaches Rampur Hat Junction Railway Station. Yet again luck misfires and he boards the Paharia Express which goes from New jalpaiguri to Howrah. He gets down from the train in time and goes to the next platform to board the Paharia Express which goes to New Jalpaiguri. But he couldn't go as he forgot the Bag of Dulal and more to it Neelasha reaches to Rampur Hat Junction with the bag only to stop Raktim from boarding the Train. Raktim in agony slaps Neelasha and yells at her that he needs to reach New jalpaiguri in time. Neelasha too responds rashly that Raktim too left her on a highway without any mercy at midnight not even thinking about her safety. Both come to an Understanding later and travel. In the mean way while Raktim is away for a nature call, Neelasha is kidnapped by some men. Luckily Raktim reaches in time and rescues her. Raktim and Neelasha flee away using one of the goon's bikes and reach Kishangunj next morning. Paharia Express was said to be late for 1 Hours. In the balance time, Raktim narrates his whole story to Neelasha who now understands his situation. At the railway station Raktim and Neelasha save two eloped lovers from the henchmen of the girl's father. They escape from the railway station and with the help of a Thrill seeking Cab owner Popu (Kharaj Mukherjee), Raktim conducts the lovers' marriage and gives away the Sindoor which he has to give to his brother. Anando is furious after listening this but after that Sundeep shows yet another Sindoor and continues the story. After the happy ending of the lovers' marriage, Raktim and Neelasha are worried about the future consequences and are just 15 km away from New jalpaiguri. But Dulal informs them that Paharia Express is scheduled to arrive in nearly 10 minutes. Now they find that Ram Prasad is a lorry driver who gave them lift to reach the station. Ram prasad is a bachelor who dreamed to get married and he gives away the Sindoor he takes while leaving the house. Raktim reaches on time and boards the train just before it stops in New Jalpaiguri Railway Station. He acts as if though he was sleeping and the rest happened. Now the marriage of Ananda is being conducted and Neelasha, Ram prasad attend the marriage. The bride's father (Supriyo Dutta) is in worry as the bride eloped with her lover and his men are searching for her. To the shock of Raktim, the bride is none other than the girl whose marriage was conducted by him and Neelasha at Kishangunj. Now Shibo Prasad comes to know that the girl eloped with her lover and the marriage is halted. Aparna comes to know the fact that the girl's marriage was conducted by Raktim and gets a severe Asthma attack. She is joined at the Private Hospital. When Aparna was taken to the Hospital, the bride's father comes to know about Raktim's act by his henchmen and is furious. In the chase, Ananda comes to know the fact and Kesto who reached New Jalpaiguri in Paharia Express is following the chase. During the chase, Shibo Prasad lets Raktim escape Red Traffic Signals and a Traffic Constable is hurt by them. After she admitted into the Hospital, Raktim fights with the bride's father's henchmen and Shibo Prasad doesn't stop him from doing so.

History It was the residence of the descendants of the Khavas family of Navanagar State to whom this estate belonged during British period. Amran is an ancient town and is celebrated as containing the shrine of a Muslim saint or pir called Daval Shah. This man was the son of one of the nobles of Sultan Mahmud Begada of Gujarat Sultanate, named Malik Mahmud Kuraishi. His own name was Malik Abd-ul-Latif, but he had received the title of Davar-ul-Mulk from the Sultan. He was faujdar of Ambran and had subdued the neighboring Rajputs. He was assassinated by a Rajput in 1509, and was made a saint after his death by the title of Daval Shah. Daval is doubtless a corruption of Davar in his title of Davar-ul-Mulk. His tomb is a place of pilgrimage to this day.

It deals with the attention services for the study and investigation of the prehistoric times and archaeology in the Asturias. The library preserves a specialized fund in prehistorical times and archaeology in relation with the collections of the museum. It also has an automated catalogue of the funds and a reading room. The Library of the Archaeological Museum of Asturias has been from the beginning, an important piece for the museum, which since the middle of the 19th century to the current days, has experienced a deep transformation, and an internal renewal that has its reflection in the management of its collections as in the management of the information.  Objectives  180x180px The basic objectives are: * Upgrade the museum. * Collect, sort, classify, catalog and register in a management system and spread all the information of interest for the study, analysis and investigation of the possessions deposited in the museum. * Conserve and preserve its documentary collections. * Integrate in the documentation area its archives and library which are the main axis of the information sources of the museum. * Spread the funds for its enhancement, through publications and especially through websites. * Establish relations of cooperation and collaboration with other institutions. * Update, by using technologies, the services that it offers to the users through its website.  History  The library of the Archaeological Museum of Asturias was born with the Provincial Commission of Monuments, an organism created by the real Order of July 24, 1844. After the desamortizaci√≥n of the ecclesiastical possessions in 1836, it was necessary to organize a public system in order to protect the buildings and artistic objects that had become property of the State. It had the objective of the conserving cultural heritage, gathering data of the buildings, monuments and antiquities worthy of conservation, and also caring for books, documents, pictures, statues, medals, etc. To know the life of the library, we have to follow the life of the museum marked by successive headquarters and events. =The Library in times of the COMMISSION MUSEUM (1844‚Äì1878)= The first collection was gathered 150 years ago and it started as an auxiliary library. It has been taken care by the University of Oviedo librarian Manuel de Prado y Tov√≠a, encharged in 1854, and later by Aquilino Su√°rez B√°rcena. In 1868, it was allocated, as the first building to house the collection of the museum and the library, the Chapel of the Third Order of the Convent of San Francisco of Oviedo whose reform and installation was prolonged for seven years. =The Library in times of the ANTIQUITIES MUSEUM (1878‚Äì1918)= On September 21, 1878, Day of Saint Mateo, the museum was opened with a simple installation, a total space of 124 m2. The Library was an attention focus in the museum, as it said Fermin Canella Secades in 1882: \\"it has enriched enough in these last years, with books of history, archaeology, fine arts, etc., and between these, we found the remarkable publication of architectural Monuments of Spain and a special section of works, brochures and historical asturian papers\\".Canela Secades, Ferm√≠n (1887). Plane of Oviedo with the situation of Normal Schools and Museum in 1908 Of this headquarters it moved in 1889 to the Normal Schools, with a space of , formed by a playground and two rooms, one of them destined to archive and library and the other, to a living room of sessions. In 1902 the library opened to the public and to the loan, it turns into a circulating library. But the Normal Schools needed more space, so the library moved again. =The Library in times of the PROVINCIAL MUSEUM (1918‚Äì1951)= The building assigned in 1918 was provisional, and it was the low floor of the Dean's house, Benigno Rodr√≠guez Pajares, in the plazuela de la Corrada del Obispo. From this moment the library, the archive and the collection of pieces of the museum remained there with restricted access; this situation propitiated the fact that the building did not suffer extreme damage by the violent attacks of the Revolution of October, in 1934 and the Civil War. In 1939, the Deputation took care of the reconstruction and restoration of the building of the Benedictine Monastery of Saint Vicente, the final site for the Museum, with a work commissioned by the architect Luis Men√©ndez-Pidal. thumb =The Library in times of the PROVINCIAL ARCHAEOLOGIC MUSEUM (1952‚Äì2003)= On San Mateo's day, in 1952 it was inaugurated the museum. In this new place, the library occupied an important place as the institution required. The control of the library is the director's function, as well as the management of the museum's collection. As well as the acquired funds, the library initiated a new stage with the deposit of bibliographic funds. With this new stage, it established relationships with national and foreign entities for the exchange of bulletins and qualified publications. In 1972 disappeared the commission and its functions were integrated by the Deputation. The competences of the Provincial Museum, were transferred in 1991 to the Government of the Asturias Princedom. 129x129px =The Library in time of the ARCHAEOLOGIC MUSEUM OF ASTURIAS. (2011‚Äì)= After 8 years of closing and of internal work, on March 21, 2011, the Archaeologic Museum of Asturias reopened to the public in its historical headquarters, rehabilitated and expanded with a building of new plant. The museum, besides, endows of a modern permanent exhibition and of a group of public equipment and interns that will allow the suitable operation of the institution. With the renewal of the museum could say that the library incorporates to the modernity. The library opened to the public, its catalogues were accessible in the network and its historical bottoms have begun to digitalize.  Physical space  A view of the museum's library. The library is located between the first and second floor of the museum. The access is made through the ancient stairs of the monastery. The space is distributed in two great areas: one of them dedicated to query, and the other one to the deposit. The query area has seven seats for reading, in which users can consult the funds of the bibliographic collection and the archive. The Internet access is available, and it also has a computer in case of need of reprographic printing. This space also completes with a working zone for the library staff. The library is free to access and it offers the service of query from Monday to Friday, so the problem of the restricted access to the public, kept since a lot of years, is resolved. The library is also a polyvalent place, where it can be celebrated meetings and didactic workshops.  Collection  Copy from the library The library is specialized in archaeology, prehistory, ancient history and medieval history, with a special reference to Asturias. Its catalogue is integrated in the Collective Catalogue of the Network of Libraries of Asturias and its query can be done through the Collective Catalogue of the Libraries of Asturias. The bibliographic collection possesses a great chronological amplitude, that goes from 1650 to actuality. The documentary typology is varied and although the weight is made by monographs and magazines, it also has cartographic material, images, audiovisual supports, drawings, plates, pictures, posters and manuscripts. The main linguistic coverage is the Spanish but it also has English, French and Italian publications. It is formed by 15.000 volumes. The bibliographic collection is grouped in several sections individualized by its thematic, typology or origin. * Copy from the libraryHISTORICAL FUND or LIBRARY of the CPMHA. It constitutes an own section, and it is known as the Library of the Commission. It is formed by near 3.500 registers, gathered from 1844 to 1952 which answer to the interests of the institution, in a determinate period and by those who were at the top of the shopping and acquisitions (Ciriaco Miguel Vigil, Ferm√≠n Canella, Fortunato de Selgas, Rafael Altamira, etc.). It predominates the following matters: epigraphy, numismatist, antiquities, classical archaeology, history of art, medals, ivories, fine arts, Asturian subjects, etc. The majority were printed between 1870 and 1930 and the origin is diverse. it entered by purchase, by donation of its author or possessor and by exchange between history institutions, local studies or of provincial museums. There are French editions of art encyclopedias, of classical art, antiquities, editions on the first archaeologic excavations in the 19th century, and the main works of the 19th century in matter of prehistory and archaeology. It conserves an extraordinary work: Architectural Monuments of Spain, considered the most ambitious project from the bibliographic point of view of ones tackled in Spain. This work was printed to study and spread the artistical heritage of the country, specially the Asturian. It was published under the direction of a special commission created by the Ministerio de Fomento, between 1856 and 1881. In its graphic part it was employed with big precision the technics of the intaglio, the lithography and the cromolitograf√≠a. Also it stands out factitious editions that gather documents and varied brochures, grouped by subjects of interest: Subjects of Asturias, political Writings, History, etc. There are documents of interest written in Asturian language, that allowed the study of this language: loose leaves, poems and manuscripts. And also handwritten texts, speeches, sermons, letters, and historical documentation. Other curious materials that integrate the collection of the library are ephemeral and difficult to achieve materials like brochures, small format publications, posters, loose leaves, etc.Biblioteca del Museo Arqueol√≥gico de Asturias. * Francisco Jord√° Cerd√°, director of the museum.GENERAL FUND. The general fund of the library is formed by monographs and reference works. There are about 9.000 volumes that covers all the areas of knowledge, although history and art are the most represented, specially referred to Asturias. The typologies are varied: manuals, memories of archaeological excavations, catalogues of exhibitions, museums, records of congresses, thesis, tesinas, homages, etc. The Archaeologic Museum of Asturias has the function, conferred by the Law 1/2001 of Cultural Heritage, of protect all the rests and archaeological objects that are exhumed in the excavations that makes the Princedom of Asturias. It also has the obligation to carry out the promotion of the investigation and Asturian archaeology. In relation with this function, in the collection abound the Excavations Memories and the monographic studies of archeological sites that attract many requests of query from users. Since the 1980s, the increase of the management archaeology and the projects and archaeologic plans, as well as the interventions of conservation and monument restoration in all the country, propitiated a big development of publications that collects the plans and memories. Cultural Heritage services of each region develop and issue publications and newsletters with this detailed information for its diffusion, as the result of a lot of archeological sites needs years of excavation campaigns. * PERIODIC PUBLICATIONS. It has an important collection formed by of 152 titles in permanent growth. A great part of the fund enters through the agreements of exchange, with more than 70 Spanish and foreign institutions. Some are previous to 1900, like the Bulletin of the Academy of the History, the Bulletin of the Spanish Society of Excursions : Art, Archaeology, History or the Bulletin of the Royal Academy of Saint Fernando, The Galician and Asturian illustration, the Magazine of Archives, Libraries and Museums, etc. During the first 30 years of the 20th century, the most frequent titles are, between others, Revue of synth√®se historique, Upper Board of Excavations and Antiquities, Museum : monthly magazine of ancient and modern Spanish art and of the contemporary artistic life. Since 1944 there is a strong worry to keep alive the collections and acquire new titles, which enters by purchase. Magazines of institutions that have established exchange agreements, enters by donation, ensuring its continuity: Artistic Historical bulletin of Lugo, Hispanic Archaeologic Record, Annals of the Museum of the Spanish Village, Spanish Archive of Archaeology, Hispanic Archaeologic Newscast etc. However, in the last years, the economic crisis affected a lot the budget items for the editions in paper, so since the last three or four years, it is frequent the query of digital magazines through the website of the institutions. * OTHER MATERIALS.

It became a Grade I listed building on 16 December 1952. The house dates back to the 12th century, when it was constructed as a single-storey dwelling. Location Llanmihangel Place is located in the Nant Llanmihangel Valley, built on a southward facing slope. It is situated between the towns of Cowbridge and Llantwit Major in the Vale of Glamorgan. History Llanmihangel Place dates back to the 12th century; the first recorded building on the site was a one-storey structure which was owned by a Norman knight. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the site underwent a significant expansion which incorporated the original Norman structure into the basement. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the house was owned by the Thomas family, a prominent aristocrat family. The last of the family to own Llanmihangel was Sir Robert Thomas, 2nd Baronet who lost a vast amount of the families fortunes. In 1697, Llanmihangel Place was sold to the Lord Mayor of London, Humphrey Edwin. The building remained in the Edwin family before becoming the home of John Franklin, a judge, and becoming the property of the Earl of Dunraven. In 1988, it was bought for ¬£139,000 by hew owners who renovated the property. in the early 21st century, the House was being used as a bed and breakfast. It was listed for sale in 2018 for ¬£1.3 million. Layout The main house is a Grade I listed building, while the terrace, steps, barn and stable are all Grade II listed. The description of its listing states that the house is an \\"exceptionally rare survival, intact and largely unaltered\\". The building is built of lias limestone and features a pitched slate roof. In its current form, the house features 12 bedrooms, split over four floors, a study, servants quarters and a dining room, two kitchens and a drawing room. The grounds of the estate are around 10 acres.

It became a Grade I listed building on 16 December 1952. It is believed to have been built during the Elizabethan era. The walls are of rubble and the roof is slate. The house has two storeys in some places and three in others, is L-shaped, and has stone mullioned windows. During the 18th century it was owned by the politician Francis Gwyn, who inherited it from his father, Edward Gwyn. On Francis's death it passed to his son, Edward Prideaux Gwyn. Although the fabric of the house is mostly of the 16th and 17th centuries, it was enlarged and refurbished during the Georgian period. However, when the last member of the Gwyn family died in 1846, the entire contents of the house were sold to a wealthy merchant who used only five rooms, allowing the rest of the house to deteriorate. It subsequently passed through several generations of the Roper family, who helped restore the house and gardens. Within the grounds of Llansannor Court is the local parish church, the Church of St Senwyr, the only one in Wales dedicated to this particular saint. The house has been used as a filming location for many television programmes, including multiple episodes of Doctor Who, such as \\"The Unicorn and The Wasp\\", \\"The Woman Who Lived\\" and \\"Tooth and Claw\\".

There are a pair of gates at the entrance to the drive which is at the junction of the B4268 and the B4270. There is a forecourt in front of the property. The house has long been the property of the Carne family. Sir Edward Carne lived here at the time the house was built at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Over the ensuing five centuries it has seen a number of adaptations and refurbishments but has retained its sixteenth and seventeenth century character. It is a two-storey building with attics, mostly built of local limestone and with sandstone window surrounds and slate roofs. It is now H-shaped but would have been T-shaped at an earlier date. Some of the windows are mullioned and there is a coat of arms over the main doorway. The staircase is late sixteenth century and stands at the rear of the hallway, and the finest room is the panelled parlour. The manor was designated as a Grade 1 listed building on 16 December 1952.

It became a Grade I listed building on 22 February 1963. History St Donat's Church was originally a small 12th century church with and apsed chancel. By the early 14th century the tower was added which was followed towards the late 14th century by the Lady Chapel, now known as the Stradling Chapel. In the 15th century the chancel was rebuilt and the nave the following century. In 1878 Dr. Nicholl-Carne paid for the restoration of the main body of the church. In 1907 the then patron of the church, Morgan Stuart Williams, order the reconstruction of the towe. A heating chamber was later added to the tower at this time but this was reconstructed in the late 20th century. The church has a long standing association with the Stradling baronets, whose home, St Donat's Castle, overlooks the church. Several monuments to the Stradlings from the 17th and 18th century are found within its walls. The church was granted Grade I listed building status in 1963, with the reason stating that it was \\"...highly graded as an important early medieval church with the particularly fine Stradling Chapel and for its historic associations with St. Donat's Castle\\". Architecture Original built in the 12th century, St Donat's retains architectural features from all five of its different stages of growth. The chancel arch is evidence of its 12th century construction, plain, round-headed with primitive caps. The double headed double-chamfered tower arch is believed to be early 14th century, while the north chancel chapel, with its square-headed three light eastern window, was added later that century. The chancel was reconstructed in the 15th century with many features from that build still in evidence: the piscina (altar basin) with cusped ogee hood, the nave with its north porch, the corbelled parapets to the nave with gargoyles and the corbelled tower battlements. The work from this period also shows comparisons to the late 15th century hall at the castle. The body of the church was restored in 1878 and the tower in 1907. Other features of note include the circular font with roll top and bottom with scale patterned sides. A medieval wooden lectern, not original to the church, which was bought in 1913. The eastern window is of stained glass and displays an image of Saint Donat (circa 1862), believed to be by Clayton and Bell, but its providence is uncertain. Monuments and art St. Donat' Castle overlooking Saint Donat's Church, 1814 The churchyard contains several structures of note, several of the having listed building status. One of the oldest features is a complete 15th century preaching cross mounted on a three stepped plinth. The cross is also listed as a grade I listed building recognised '...for its special interest as a complete medieval cross with a rare medieval gravestone beside it.' A memorial cross to Mary Anne Nicholl-Carne, a former owner of St Donats Castle who died in 1879, has grade II listed status and is found to the north west of the church tower. The walls and railings surrounding the churchyard are also grade II listed, of 19th century build but includes some sections of earlier 17th century design. Within the church, held in the Stradling Chapel, are three painted family portraits on panels, depicting Sir Edward Stradling (1529-1609) and his wife, the others his fore-bearers, dated 1590 and signed by Byrd. These items were stolen from the chapel in 1991, but subsequently recovered; those presently on display are now photographic copies. The chapel also contains the tombs of Sir Edward Stradling (1699-1726) and Sir Thomas Stradling (1710-1738), last of the Stradling line.

It became a Grade I listed building on 28 January 1963. Records of 1180 describe the church as a chapel confirmed to the Abbey of Tewkesbury. By 1563 it was known to have served as a parish church for the community. In 1603 it was considered to be a chapel of the church at Llanblethian, but by 1764 it received a stipend from Queen Anne's Bounty and was described as a curacy. 19th century As early as 1859, the church was reported as being in need of repair. In 1890, a local newspaper reported that the church was in such poor condition it was \\"unfit for use\\". The news story also noted that it would undergo a major restoration; this was done by Kempson and Fowler and completed the next year with opening ceremonies held 14 October 1891. A local newspaper story detailed the structural problems with the church prior to the start of restoration. The church's open oak roof was unsafe, plaster was falling from its walls and the floor was continuously damp. The window glaze needed work and water came in through the tower, which was cracked and unsafe. In addition, there was neither heat nor light in the building. The restoration of 1891 restored the oak roof, repaired the windows' glaze and freshly re-plastered the church walls. The flooring problem was resolved and repairs were made to the tower where it was deemed necessary. New lighting, a new heating unit and two new windows were installed, as well as a new pulpit altar, lectern and much new seating throughout. 20th century to present day In 1893, the local newspaper published a request for donations to help with additional renovations needed at the church. The story said no provisions were made for control of rain water in the 1891 restoration and it was seeping into the walls from parapets and gutters. The restoration work completed in 1891 also did not include all needed repairs to the tower; it was reported that work on the tower would be postponed because the most immediate need was to control the rain problem. The church received new lighting and a new organ along with other restoration in 1915. The church was re-plastered in 1996; during this process, the church was stripped of its old coat of plaster, leaving the entire structure bare to stones and mortar. This became an opportunity to do further dating on the building by examining the old mortar. It was thought that the church was constructed some time in the 15th to 16th centuries. but it became apparent that the windows and doors from that time frame were inserted into older walls by examining the mortar. A chancery wall gave evidence of having two lancet windows at one time; this was an indication that at least this portion of the building was constructed in the 13th century. The churchyard wall became a Grade II listed building on 21 December 2004.

It became a Grade I listed building on 22 February 1963. The church is said to have been built in 1111. The earliest mention of this parish church comes in the form of an 1141 confirmation of a donation made to the church by Maurice de Londres. The church and all of its possessions were given to the Abbey of Gloucester; this was confirmed circa 1200 when the Bishop of Landaff assigned a resident chaplain to the church. In 1254, the church was listed with a valuation of five marks. By 1291, it was combined with the valuation of Ewenny Priory. The church has many medieval wall paintings. Traces remain on the west wall of the chancel arch, depicting the consecration of St. Nicholas, Bishop of Myra and the story of the young mother who left her baby in the bathtub to attend the service and whose baby was miraculously saved from death by boiling while his mother attended the bishop‚Äôs consecration. Other subjects are interpreted as St. Vitus and the Enthronement of Thomas Becket. The building was restored in 1879. Henry J Williams of Bristol carried out the work, in the course of which the rood loft was discovered and the doors at the entrance and upper level were replaced and a new door placed in the porch. New windows were inserted in the nave, the old stone pulpit was replaced by an oak one and a new oak communion table, lectern and chancel furniture were installed. The contractor was Thomas Thomas of Colwinston and the cost of ¬£800 was defrayed by Mrs Mary Collins Prichard who had recently come to live at Pwllywrach and, as patron of the \\"living\\", wished to put the church in a good state of repair. In 1881, when additional accommodation was required for the then 64 parishioners, the architect John Prichard reseated the church with open benches at a cost of ¬£120. Many of the church's furnishings date from this time. The wall paintings are reckoned to be 600 years old and are painted in tempura on a fine lime plaster. After the Reformation, when a wooden holy table was often substituted for the original stone ‚Äòmensa‚Äô or altar table, the stone altar of St Michael's was thrown into the churchyard and lies on the south side of the churchyard at right angles to the gravestones. The Pre-Reformation bell which the square medieval tower with its battlement was built to carry has survived with its Latin inscription ‚ÄúSancte Michael ora pro nobis‚Äù (Pray for us St Michael), invoking the saint to which to church is dedicated. There were originally 3 bells in the tower but two were broken and the metal sold in 1722 to pay for the reseating of the church. In 1971, the church was damaged by a fire. To prepare for the 2000 Millennium, the church was redecorated and reroofed; a new north vestry and entrance were also part of this project. The churchyard cross and wall were both listed as Grade II buildings on 23 July 2003.

Education and academic career Twomey attended the Edinburgh College of Art from 1991 to 1994 and received an MA in Ceramics and Glass from the Royal College of Art in London in 1996.Oxford Art Online In 2011 she became a Research Fellow in the School of Media, Arts and Design at the University of Westminster, where she is affiliated with the Ceramics Research Centre.  Work  Twomey's work typically involves intense research, collaboration in fabrication, and interactive presentations. A recurring theme in her work is the relationship that binds people to things. Her use of the medium of clay involves various forms of the material, including raw clay and powder, and techniques and processes including slip cast and factory production. Twomey sees her practice as research: she has explained that she is \\"engaged in a process of inquiry, an exploration of ideas, predicated on exploring characteristics of clay.\\" Selected works = Consciousness/Conscience = Between 2001 and 2004 Consciousness/conscience was exhibited in a variety of places including the Tate, Liverpool; Crafts Council, London; and Icheon, Korea. At each of the sites of installation, between 3000 and 8000 hollow bone china tiles were created to be displayed on the floor. As the viewer walked through the installation, the tiles were crushed underfoot, causing the viewer to be an active participant in shaping the work and challenging the viewer's perception of both the gallery space and the permanence of the work. The artwork was thus completed through the destruction of the tiles. Consciousness/Conscience has been interpreted as showing how the artist's work is \\"influenced by observations of human interaction and political behavior and peruses her interest in space, architecture, intervention and the gallery as destination.\\" = Trophy = In 2006 Trophy was exhibited at the Victorian and Albert Museum. This one-day exhibition displayed 4000 sculptures of cast bluebirds that were created at the Wedgwood Factory. Each bluebird was stamped with a W for where it was made, V&A; for where it would be exhibited, and CT for the artist's initials. Viewers became collaborative performers when they were asked to take one of the birds home as a 'Trophy.' These active participants who took these trophies were asked to send a photograph back to Twomey of the birds in their new home. \\"Trophy continues to develop as is spreads out across hundreds of private locations\\" = Monument = In 2009, Clare Twomey created the work Monument for the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art as part of the exhibition Possibilities and Losses: Transitions in Clay, which she helped to curate.Dickson, Amy, Liesbeth den Besten, Clare Twomey, George Hall, and Erik Schilp. 2009. Monument: Clare Twomey. [Enkhuizen]: Zuiderzee Museum. This exhibition included Keith Harrison, Linda Sormin and Neil Brownsword. For Monument, 30 cubic meters of ceramic waste were piled up 8 meters high. Inspired by looking at a pile of broken china from the Johnson Porcelain Tile Factory in Stoke-on-Trent, this piece was made up of discarded seconds and manufacturing mistakes. The scale of the pile created tension in the work because the pile seemed as though it could crumble at any moment. = Forever = In Twomey's first solo American Show (2011), Twomey observed the Frank and Harriet Burnlaps collection of 1,345 pieces of ceramics at the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art. In this exhibition she explored permanence, responsibility, memory, desirability, the value and process of making through looking at one specific item from the collection, a sandbach cup. Twomey worked with the ceramic company, Hartley Greens and Co. Leeds Pottery to cast 1,345 cups. Working from a similar conceptual framework as Trophy, Twomey created a system where viewers could apply to own a cup if they signed a contract promising to take care of the cup forever. = Collecting the Edge = In 2011 Twomey created a museum wide installation at the Denver Art Museum in conjunction with Overthrown, Clay without Limits. This group show included artists such as Annabeth Rosen, Kristen Morgin, Jeanne Quinn, Walter McConnell, Heather Mae Ericsson, and Kim Dickey as well as many others. Collecting the Edges brought attention to the museum's architecture by creating a visual intervention which highlighted corners, ceilings and other spaces in the museum. Collecting the Edges piled red, powdered, Colorado clay into these specific spaces spreading the exhibition throughout the whole museum. In an interview in Ceramics Now, Twomey stated \\"When visiting a site, one must arrive with a very open mind, I had our first visit with no planned ideas for the work. I made a response to the architecture experienced, and this was vastly influential with the development of the concept.\\" She then goes on to state that she sees this piece as \\"A reminder of a moment in time, rather than a demand.\\" = Humanity is in our Hands = For Humanity In Our Hands, Clare Twomey, along with many other artists worked with the Keep the Memory Alive project, whose mission is to pair survivors of genocide with artists to bring their stories to life for the next generation. Twomey was paired with Siskc Jakupovic, who survived the Omarska Concentration Camp in the Bosnian War. In one of their exchanges Jakupovic shared a story about how in the concentration camp, they carved spoons for each other out of wood and shards of broken glass. From this story, and with the analogy that spoons can nurture and feed each other, Twomey created her piece Humanity is in our Hands. On 27 January 2015, Holocaust Remembrance Day, Twomey distributed invitations to people walking over Westminster Bridge. \\"Today you are invited to be part of a new work, your words will be placed on thousands of beautiful porcelain objects that will be made in the coming year. These objects will be handed back to the public as gifts on Westminster Bridge, on this date one year from now, 27th of January 2016. The recipients will become custodians of your thoughts.\\" The question she asked the pedestrians walking over the bridge was 'What human qualities allow society of flourish?'

The church was probably built by the Reigny family; earliest records of it date to the Taxation of Norwich in 1254, where it was referred to as St Michael de Renny and was valued at four marks. The parish at one time consisted of the Manor of Michaelston-le-Pit and the church was an advowson included with the manor in the 15th and 17th centuries. By 1563, a cleric was in residence. The church was known by a variety of names over time: \\"Michaelstowe\\" and \\"Michaelstown\\", which changed with the name of the land owner. In the 16th century it was called Michaelston le Pole, as the De la Pole family owned the manor before 1493. The present name is likely taken from le Peyt; the le Peyt family owned the land before selling it to the Reignys. The church has many items which date to medieval times, including a baptismal font which was lost at the time of the Battle of St Fagans and was later discovered in a local field. It also has the only triple decker pulpit found in the Vale of Glamorgan.

Biography Thomas Tanner GM: War Reserve Police Constable, Maryleborne Lane Police Station (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 1730) Thompson was born in Dunedin in New Zealand and attended the Dunedin School of Art, where he was taught by Alfred Henry O'Keeffe. Thompson worked as a cartoonist for the local Otago Daily Times newspaper and as a commercial artist. He enlisted in the New Zealand Army, and during World War One served as a sergeant in the 3rd New Zealand Rifle Brigade in France. While in France, Thompson completed several cartoons which were published in the army magazine Chronicles of NZEF and in a Christmas publication New Zealand at the Front. On the 7 June 1917, Thompson was badly wounded at the Battle of Messines and was sent to England to recover. During his convalescence, Thompson made sketches of the medical staff treating him and these were published in a collection called Light Diet which was sold to support the work of New Zealand war artists. After the War, an Army scholarship allowed Thompson to attend the Slade School of Art from 1919. He also studied etching under Frank Short at the Royal College of Art, where he won a prize for his work. Thompson also attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts and was an engraving finalist for the Prix de Rome prize in 1923. Thompson worked as a staff member at the Central School of Arts and Crafts from 1941 until 1966 and also taught part-time at other art schools including the Hornsey School of Art and also at Highgate, Willesden and at Harrow. Thompson was also employed by the National Art Gallery of New Zealand as its London representative and for many years recommended artworks for the Museum to acquire. In the Second World War Thompson served as an Air Raid Warden during the Blitz. In October 1941, the War Artists' Advisory Committee commissioned Thompson to produce three portraits of police and civil defence workers for 10 guineas each. Thompson produced a fourth portrait which he gifted to the Committee. For many years Thompson lived in Long Crendon in Buckinghamshire, where he died in 1971.

Ringquist creates embroidered artwork and runs her own design company, Dropcloth. Her work extends the traditional processes of Fiber art by dealing with vintage fabrics, utilizing the sewing machine, and applying hand-embroidery techniques. Ringquist was a professor for seven years in the Department of Fiber and Material Studies at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.Fiber and Material Studies, School of the Art Institute of Chicago She is also the author of Rebecca Ringquist's Embroidery Workshops: A Bend the Rules Primer.  Life and work  Rebecca Ringquist was born in Michigan. Ringquist received a Bachelors of Special Studies Honors in Art and graduated cum laude from Cornell College in 2000. While pursuing her undergraduate degree she became interested in feminist theory and embroidery. In 2003 she earned her M.F.A. from the Art Institute of Chicago in fiber and material studies. At the Art Institute of Chicago Ringquist developed an understanding of fiber arts within a historical context; she is very interested in how material could convey its own history and meaning. This led to Ringquist utilizing her embroidery for political and conceptual works as well as re-creating stories about her life and relationships. The imagery in her work comes from a multitude of books, dictionaries, nature guides, autograph books, valentines, and fairy tales.http://www.chicagoarts-lifestyle.com/qa-with-rebecca-ringquist-a- narrative-fiber-artist/#more-749 Her techniques involve layers of color and texture while making use of vintage textiles that have previously been embroidered. In addition, she finds new uses for classic stitches such as the running stitch or French knot. The embroidered pieces Ringquist creates amalgamate multi-layered fabrics, overlapping narratives and technicolor stitches that characterize Ringquist's repertoire of work. She incorporates both standard and unconventional techniques by working with a sewing machine as well as by hand. She views embroidery used in this manner as similar to painting; her stitches overlap creating many layers and textures. The work makes use of decorative cloths, vintage fabrics and old hand-stitched cloths made by other embroiderers. In re-using such materials, she removes them from their original context and thus alters their meanings. The re-constituted cloths help create the sense of fairy tale or myth. The stories as told by her stitches insinuate many narratives, but never reveal the entire story. Outside of her own atypical practice, she is known for encouraging her students and workshop attendees to break the rules. She is more concerned about the students getting started than having the perfect technique. Ringquist sees knots in the thread as additional way to add texture to the fabric. Her workshops teach a variety of techniques such as how to transfer a design to a canvas, create three-dimensional stitches, use non-traditional threads and fabrics, intermix both machine- and hand-stitching, and draw with thread itself. In April 2015, Ringquist had her first book published. The book, entitled, _Rebecca Ringquist's Embroidery Workshops_ is a resource for a generation of embroiderers interested in a variety of both time-tested and unique new techniques. The book is based on the classes Ringquist leads throughout the county. It features instructions for a multitude of projects as well as a cloth sampler that was designed specifically for the book. She also sells samples and pre-printed patterns on Etsy as well as through her design company, Dropcloth.

It was also known as Koch's Museum.  Location  The museum was located on the third floor of Wyman's Hall on Market Street in St. Louis, Missouri, opposite the Court House. Near where this museum once stood is the current location of the Museum of Westward Expansion under the Gateway Arch.  Museum Directors  According to The History of Science in St. Louis, Edward Wyman initially established the museum under the direction of J.P. Bates. Wyman collected natural history specimens for many years and was skilled in preparing and arranging the objects. Bates was also devoted to natural history, making frequent trips to Europe, South America, and the tropics to collect birds, quadrupeds, and other specimens. The museum held nearly 2500 specimens, many of which were speculated to not exist anywhere else in the country. Museum collections included curiosities from the East Indies and South Sea Islands, paintings and statuary, and minerals and shells. In a contrasting article, The Living Museum states that Dr. Albert C. Koch opened the museum in 1836. Koch was a German immigrant from Saxony who settled in St. Louis. Koch's father was also interested in natural history and kept specimens in a cabinet in their home. In addition to Koch's scientific interests, he was also a museum proprietor with a flair for the spectacular who fostered a vaudevillelike atmosphere at the museum. He also fabricated several extraordinary skeletons from smaller remains of known species, and fraudulently displayed them as antediluvian creatures. Despite his showmanship, Koch played a significant role in scientific endeavors of the 19th century and his museum contained many important natural history collections.  Collections  Among the collections at the St. Louis Museum were a collection of American Indian costumes, weapons, pipes, instruments, and other items collected by General William Clark during his explorations of the Mississippi River with Meriweather Lewis. It is thought that Koch took possession of these items upon Clark's death. A second notable collection at the museum contained hundreds of fossils including one of the American mastodon. The fossils came from many locations, but most of them were discovered at three locations in Missouri. It was during excavations at Pomme de Terre River in Missouri between 1838 and 1840 that Koch found what came to be called the Missouri Leviathan, or Missourium. It was larger than an elephant with unique tusks. Later, anatomists found that this newly discovered specimen was merely a misassembled mastodon skeleton with a number of extra bones. A contemporary drawing of Koch's \\"hydrarchos\\" or Zeugledon A museum specimen of particular note was a fossil, the Hydrarchos or Zeuglodon, which the Complete Guide to the St. Louis Museum called \\"the greatest fossil in the world.\\" The Zeuglodon was constructed mainly from basilosaurus fossils discovered in 1848 in a field in Alabama. After they were extricated from the rock in which they were found, Dr. Koch purchased the fossils for the St. Louis Museum. The fossils were shown to Yale chemist Benjamin Silliman, likely before being rearranged by Koch. Silliman, who had recently lectured on the basilosaurus, wrote a letter to Koch about his find. A broadside promoting the exhibit took Silliman's letter out of context and presented the hydrarchus as \\"Leviathan of the Antediluvian World\\". Professor Joseph Leidy also attested to the authenticity of the fossils, though it's not clear if he saw them before or after Koch's rearrangement. Professor Jeffries Wyman eventually exposed the hoax, and Silliman wrote another letter to Koch asking not to be associated with the exhibit. The hydrarchos continued to be displayed and was taken by Koch to Dresden, where it was destroyed by Allied bombing of that city during WWII. A smaller model was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire. Koch spent much of his time hunting fossils, and his time away from the museum lead to declining attendance. He was disappointed in the interest in his newly discovered Missourium specimen and some encouraged him to exhibit the specimen in Europe. This caused Koch to sell the St. Louis Museum in January 1841 and he left St. Louis. Koch toured the United States with his collections and later traveled to Europe where he exhibited the Missourium in London and Dublin. He later accepted an offer from the British Museum to purchase parts of his fossil collection, including the Missourium, for 1300 pounds. Today the Missourium is still standing in the British Museum, in correct anatomical order. With Koch's departure, the museum fell on hard times and faded into history. Building After the museum's closure, Wyman's Hall became a concert venue and dance hall. The third floor, which housed the museum, was the city's primary concert space. The building burned down in June 1866, causing damages valued at $140,000.

Its churchyard cross is a Grade I listed building, listed on 22 July 2003. The church is believed to date from the 12th or 13th century. It is said to have been rebuilt in 1820, but by 1875 it was described as being deserted and full of insects, snails and weeds. A publication four years later stated that the church was \\"about to be removed\\" because the population had moved away from the area. The church is said to have been extensively rebuilt in 1856 with more work being done in 1869. Many of its original features were destroyed during this time period. A school room was added to the structure in 1881. In 1909 a pre-Norman cross was discovered in the garden of the church rectory. The cross is believed to date from the ninth century; it was not intact when found but was pieced together. The church rectory, where the Celtic cross was found, became a Grade II listed building 22 July 2003. In 1932 a stained glass window was installed behind the altar to the memory of Reverend David Jones, the parish priest and an early supporter of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism, who was known as the \\"Angel of Llangan\\" for his religious work in the village. The church has two bells, one possibly dating from medieval times and one cast in 1891; both were rehung in the bell tower in 2005. The church vestry had been closed for some time because it was in extreme disrepair. In 2010 a grant to aid community projects was received and the vestry was able to be repaired. It now serves as a meeting place for the church and the community.

The second speech Against Stephanos, preserved as Demosthenes' 46th, was certainly not composed by Demosthenes, but the authorship of the first speech is disputed. The speeches are part of a dispute between Apollodoros and his stepfather Phormion. Authorship The second speech was not composed by Demosthenes, but by the same author of five of Apollodoros' other speeches preserved among Demosthenes' speeches. Most modern scholars consider that Apollodoros himself was the likely author of these speeches. The first, however, stylistically resembles other authentic speeches of Demosthenes more than it does the remainder of Apollodoros' speeches. On these grounds, some scholars such as Jeremy Trevett argue that it is authentic. Douglas MacDowell, however, disputes this, arguing that it is unlikely that Demosthenes, who composed For Phormion against Apollodoros, would have been asked by him to compose a speech against Stephanos in the same dispute. Therefore, MacDowell suggests that it too was written by Apollodoros. Finally, it has been suggested that the first speech Against Stephanos was composed by neither Demosthenes nor Apollodoros, but a third orator. Hypereides, for instance, has been put forward as a possible author. Konstantinos Kapparis believes that Demosthenes wrote the first of the two speeches Against Stephanos, and suggests that he was specifically chosen by Apollodoros because of his success with For Phormion. He suggests that Demosthenes agreed to write the speech because the two men were at the time politically aligned over what was to be done with the theoric fund. Background In 370/69 BC, the banker Pasion died leaving two sons: Apollodoros, the litigant in these speeches, and Pasicles. In his will, he arranged for Phormion to become one of the guardians of his younger son Pasicles. The guardians of Pasicles also took on the responsibility for managing Pasion's property, which was to be split between his sons when Pasicles came of age. Some time around 350/49 BC, Apollodoros brought a suit against Phormion claiming that he still owed Apollodoros 20 talents from Pasion's estate. Apollodoros lost this case, and so brought another suit, this time against Stephanos, one of the witnesses who had testified against him as part of Phormion's case. Case against Stephanos Apollodoros accused Stephanos of making a false testimony in the lawsuit between himself and Phormion. He brought the case to court soon after the end of the suit against Phormion, and so the speeches against Stephanos probably date to 350/49 BC. The first speech begins with a complicated argument on probability, which MacDowell doubts the jury would have been able to follow. Apollodoros then proceeds to attack the character of first Stephanos and then Phormion. The second speech, according to MacDowell, \\"concentrates more closely on what is really the only substantial point in his accusation\\". The case made by Apollodoros against Stephanos in the two speeches has been judged unconvincing by modern commentators. According to MacDowell, Apollodoros fails to demonstrate that Stephanos was guilty of giving false testimony.

It was delivered on Phormion's behalf, possibly by Demosthenes himself, probably in 350-49 BC. It is the thirty-sixth speech in the Demosthenic corpus. Contents Phormion was a former slave who had been given his freedom as a reward for his good service. When Pasion, his former owner, died, Phormion was named in the will as one of the guardians of Pasion's youngest son, who was still a child, in which position he was responsible for the management of Pasion's estate. For Phormion deals with a dispute between Pasion's elder son, Apollodoros of Acharnae and Phormion, over the handling of Apollodoros' inheritance. Apollodoros had claimed that Phormion had never paid back an 11 talent loan, and prosecuted Phormion to compel him to repay it with interest - a total of 20 talents. To block this, Phormion counter-sued, claiming that Apollodoros had previously made a formal declaration that all Phormion's debts to him had been fulfilled. Apollodoros, he claimed, therefore did not have standing to sue. For Phormion was written to deliver as part of this countersuit. The speech was composed to be presented by a supporter of Phormion, rather than Phormion himself. Phormion had apparently been unable to speak, either due to his poor Greek or incapacity due to illness or old age. Though it is not certain whether the speech was delivered by Demosthenes or another friend of Phormion, the orator Dinarchus writes that Demosthenes did give a speech on behalf of Phormion in a trial; it is likely that this is a reference to For Phormion. For Phormion is one of the few speeches from ancient Athens for which we have any information about the result of the case. Apollodoros' first speech Against Stephanos shows that Phormion's countersuit was successful, and he won the case. Notes References Works cited  Paley, F. A.; Sandys. J. E.

His father, Henri van Heurck (1839‚Äì1909), was a renowned botanist who wanted his son to follow in his (scientific) footsteps. Emiel, however, was more interested in journalism and writing and particularly in Belgian folklore. He suffered from depression, and never finished his engineering studies, taking a day job in an office where his lack of diploma prevented his advancement. He studied folklore nightly, he said, from 7:30 to 11:30, and he maintained a connection to the Volkskundemuseum in Antwerp. With Gerrit Jacob Boekenoogen (1869‚Äì1930) he published three volumes on popular imagery, including Histoire de l'imagerie populaire Flamande (1910). In 1930 they published a companion volume on Dutch imagery, Histoire de l'imagerie des Pays-Bas. Van Heurck also collected such prints and images. Van Heurck was on intimate terms with Belgian writer Julius P√©e (1871‚Äì1951) from 1893 to 1896, when the friendship was disturbed for unknown reasons, until an exchange of letters in 1930, not long before Van Heurck's death. P√©e was a scholar of the Dutch author Multatuli; Van Heurck shared this interest, having translated Multatuli's work into French for Mercure de France, and the story \\"La sainte vierge\\" for Le Spectateur catholique. He was made a knight in the Order of Leopold, and died on 30 July 1931, after a long and painful illness. He is buried at Schoonselhof cemetery.

As a songwriter, he co-wrote many hits around late 1980s and early 1990s such as the song \\"Waiting for Love,\\" which became a successful single for the band Alias in the early 1990s. Also, the songs \\"One Night Alone\\", \\"Charmed Life\\" and \\"Cryin\\" from Vixen's self-titled debut album were all covers of Paris songs, that had originally appeared on his Wired Up album (a fourth Paris composition, \\"Give It Away,\\" which he had first featured on Race to Paradise, was also included as a bonus track on the same Vixen album). \\"Cryin'\\" became one of the Vixen album's two big hits (following up their first hit single, \\"Edge of a Broken Heart\\").

In May 1968 all universities, except Bocconi, were occupied. In the same month a hundred artists, including Gio Pomodoro, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Ernesto Treccani and Gianni Dova occupied for 15 days the Palazzo della Triennale.cfr. pag. 67 di Almanacco di Storia illustrata, 1968  Movement '68  The background of the movement came from the newly transformed economy of Italy. The country had recently increased industrialization and a new modern culture began to develop. The movement has its roots in the strikes and university occupations of the 1960s, along with international headlines about socialist political triumphs in the Cold War. Students of working or peasant backgrounds mainly drove the movement in an effort to change traditional capitalist and patriarchal society. The new education system allowed for a large populus to be educated and with such an education, question societal functions. The unrest began with student protests which were initially underestimated by politicians and the press, this soon turned into \\"the struggle of workers\\".Nicola Rao, La fiamma e la celtica, Sperling & Kupfer Editori, 2006 In the first moments of the student protest, the right-wing in the universities were among the movement's leaders. The Battle of Valle Giulia at Rome University on 1 March 1968 was the last action in which students left and right-wing were together, because on 16 March following the assault on the University La Sapienza, there was a gap between \\"movementists\\" and reactionaries.Nicola Rao, La fiamma e la celtica, Sperling & Kupfer Editori, 2006 The left came to dominate the movement and the right-wing debates on what actions should be used to further the movement.annipiombo07  Aftermath  The counter-cultural attitudes of the movement end up creating conflicts within the Italian Left.Vi √® poi chi ha ritenuto di leggervi anche una valenza contestatrice nei gruppi di destra verso il MSI-DN: Giorgia Meloni, Il Sessantotto visto da destra (L‚ÄôOccidentale, 25 November 2007).

To this end, the study can include, but is in no means limited to: the physical excavation of video-game hardware, the use of archaeological methods within game worlds, the creation of video-games for or about archaeological practices and outcomes or the critical study of how archaeology is represented in video-games. Virtual and augmented reality applications in archaeology might also be subsumed within its rubric. M. Dennis states that archaeogaming is ‚Äúthe utilization and treatment of immaterial space to study created culture, specifically through videogames‚Äù which ‚Äúrequires treating a game world, a world bounded and defined by the limitations of its hardware, software and coding choices, as both a closed universe and as an extension of the external culture that created it. Everything that goes into the immaterial space comes from its external cultural source, in one way or another.‚Äù Taking this into consideration the archaeogaming framework indicates that there is no functional difference between studying archaeology in the physical, material world, and implementing it with regards to the study, critique and creation of video-games for and about archaeology. As such it is said that archaeogaming ‚Äúrequires the same standards of practice as the physical collection of excavated data, only with a different toolset. It also provides the opportunity to use game worlds to reflect on practice, theory and the perceptions of [archaeology].‚Äù History The first recorded use of the term ‚Äúarchaeogaming‚Äù appears on June 9, 2013 on Andrew Reinhard‚Äôs blog, in which he discusses the archaeological underpinnings of World of Warcraft and extrapolates that there is the potential to explore the gameplay and construction of these worlds using an archaeological methodology. The term went on to be retroactively applied to work previously carried out within the umbrella of video-games and archaeology, for example, the ethnographic investigations conducted by E. Johnson in Skyrim. The term has been developed by various academics since the first inception and development is ongoing. Though Reinhard is credited with first applying the term to this study it is noted here that many other academic enquries have previously tackled the topic under different names such as gaming archaeology and game-archaeology. Types of Archaeogaming There are many forms or sub- categories within the wider archaeogaming discipline, ranging from the study of the material culture of video-games through to the creation of video-games as a means to think about or represent archaeological practices, processes or outcomes. The core categories will be discussed in turn below. = Archaeology of video-games (real-world excavation) = The archaeology of video-games in the physical world entails the excavation of material culture using conventional and specialist archaeogaming methodologies. Excavation of the Atari video game burial, which uncovered E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial cartridges from the New Mexico landfill site, is an example of this form of archaeogaming. =Archaeology in video-games (digital excavation)= The archaeogaming sub-category of digital excavation refers to using archaeological methods to dig into how video-games operate. An example of this method can be found in J. Aycock‚Äôs use of computer-science methods to explore the construction and implementation of features within video-games. Douglas Heaven wrote about the archaeology of rubbish/garbage within virtual worlds for New Scientist. The June 2016 release of No Man's Sky (Hello Games) will also see the launch of the No Man's Sky Archaeological Survey, the first formal archaeology project undertaken within a procedurally created universe. = Critical Examination of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage in video-games = The critical study of how archaeology has, could and should be used in video-games is perhaps the broadest and most widely represented sub-category of the archaeogaming group in academic and popular literature. Proponents of this sector discuss how archaeology has been represented in externally produced games and construct frameworks which aim to develop better representations of archaeological material, practices and outputs. Cultural heritage is also explored in an archaeological way via archaeogaming, from critical reviews of games such as Subnautica and Never Alone, to online playthroughs of games such as Far Cry Primal by professors and students of archaeology. Contributors have also explored aspects of game design and creation in relation to the discipline of archaeogaming, exposing parallels in the development of titles like Day Of The Tentacle Remastered to the archaeological process. =Creating archaeological video-games= There are two key branches within this sub-grouping: the practice of creating video- games which represent archaeological material, practices or processes or the creation of video-games to serve archaeological needs. The former of these categories can be seen in the production of games for museums, exhibitions or online sites, usually with the express aim of educating or informing an audience. The latter of the categories focusses on how video-games, as a media form, can be used to supplement, overcome or provide novel methods for recording, expressing or communicating archaeology for academic purposes.  Media Reception  Archaeogaming began receiving global attention upon the publication of an August 2015 article on Vice Motherboard by Kathleen Caulderwood, \\"The Archaeologist Who Studies World of Warcraft\\". The story received wider circulation courtesy of a follow-up piece on the video game site Kotaku, \\"Actual Archaeologist is Digging through World of Warcraft, Skyrim\\". Guokr, a Chinese science and technology news site reported on archaeogaming shortly thereafter, followed by German technology site Technology Review. Archaeogaming has been the subject of two national radio broadcasts in Canada and Ireland, first on CBC's Spark radio program with Nora Young, \\"We're Kind of making it up as we Go Along\\": What it's like to be a Video Game Archaeologist\\" and then on Ireland's Lyric FM Culture File with Eleanor Flegg, \\"What is Archaeogaming?\\" Current Developments In April, 2016, a group of academics gathered at Leiden University, Netherlands, as part of the VALUE conference on interactive pasts. The purpose of this conference was to present current research, engage in critical discussion of archaeology and video-games and to develop a manifesto for the development of the necessary theoretical, methodological and practice based frameworks involved under the broad term of archaeogaming. The core tenets of the first draft of the manifesto (1.0) are as follows: * To create a common language for describing the intersection between archaeology and video-games * To develop the methodological, practice-based and theoretical paradigms required for effective analysis, critique and development * To develop effective methods for communicating with the game development industry regarding the use of archaeological entities * To develop ethical frameworks for engaging with archaeological material within video-games * To curate and provide data-sets, information and modes of communication which are accessible to developers wishing to access archaeological material * To develop platforms whereby the public can access integral archaeological information about and for video- games * To preserve games, game culture and game history using appropriate archaeological method and theory * To approach the study of the public perception of archaeology in / of video-games as well as their surrounding culture (including conventions, cosplays, fanart etc.) with due care and appropriate methodological approaches. * To engage with the development history, the developer culture and the impact which this has on the game development practice through an archaeological lens * To develop the field of archaeogaming on an academic, public and industry level through effective knowledge sharing, centralization and open information.

Surviving on only volunteers and donations, the Coalition sponsored workshops on self- defense, legal rights, women's history, health issues, childcare, feminism, assertiveness training, and consciousness raising. After gaining momentum and publicity, the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee received its first substantial funding outside of small donations. They received a $1,000 grant from the Catholic Campaign for Human Development and a $500 grant from the United Church of Christ for educational purposes. The IBM Corporation donated printing equipment worth $1,700 and, in the largest contribution to date, United Community Services bestowed a $3,200 grant on the Coalition to develop further programming. These forms of funding allowed the Coalition to hire its first paid staff positions in 1974.  Projects  = Women's Crisis Line = Chris Doerfler, Director of Women's Crisis Line 1981 The first project of the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee, still running today at Milwaukee's Good Samaritan Medical Center, was started to provide people with help that was not being given by other existing social services and was set up as a feminist institution. Approximately thirty volunteers served at all times to cover alternate four-hour shifts and all workers at the Women's Crisis Line were women. This was because the center was created for women and was therefore run by women; additionally these women could relate to the other women in need. The information provided by the callers and workers was used to identify where there was help needed in the community which then led to the formation of the Sexual Assault Counseling Unit, the Sexual Assault Treatment Center, and the Task Force on Battered Women. The crisis line was a successful first project for the Coalition because the Coalition bylaws strived \\"to develop alternative institutions within the women's movement.\\" The center, being a feminist institution, also adapted a feminist philosophy as The Crisis Line's policy statement stated, \\"No matter what your personal views, when counseling, you should suggest all the alternatives to a particular woman's problem (non- sexist, of course) and leave the final decision up to her ... As women, we feel this society treats us with disrespect, treats us as if we are sick or crazy because we do not fit the mold they have made for us ... Women in this country for too long have had other people (men) make their decisions, and we will at no time perpetuate this ...\\" The Women's Crisis Line was not only helpful, it was successful. \\"In its first month of operation, the Crisis Line received 119 calls, and one year later, in January 1974, the monthly total reached 755. By mid-1977, the Crisis Line reported that the number of calls received each month averaged between 1,200 and 1,500. The major areas of concern expressed by callers included relationships, family conflicts, divorce, depression, legal issues, and pregnancy and other health concerns. Many callers sought referrals to local professional and social service providers knowing that Crisis Line staff made referrals only to those individuals and services with an established record of fair and sensitive treatment of women. Sexual assault accounted for 30‚Äì35 calls per month, and potential suicides constituted 10 calls each month.\\"Crisis Line workers participate in gay pride parade, 1979 Due to gaining of momentum, idea of the Women's Crisis Line to go independent and break off from the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee stemmed from Crisis Line Director Karen Coy. The group wanted to become independent mainly because of financial reasons though not all members were in favor of the split. In May 1975 it became an independent organization but remained in close communication with the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee by continuing to work with them on other projects in the Milwaukee area. Though split, the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee is often referred to as the independent organization's 'mother' agency. The organization then transferred to the Counseling Center of Milwaukee as they found sponsorship in 1979 and later became affiliated with the Women's Health Institute at Good Samaritan Medical Center in 1986. The Women's Crisis Line not only helped the community, it also raised awareness which started other programs as a result. One of the programs that was created through the crisis line was the Sexual Assault Counseling Unit in the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office. Previously, there had been cases of officers of the Milwaukee Police Department being insensitive and even discriminatory when approaching cases of sexual assault. The tipping point of the Coalition was when Sharon Senese observed a police officer approach a victim of sexual assault saying \\"If women want to prevent rape, they should keep their legs crossed... How many rapes do you really think are rapes?\\". The Anti-Rape Council was then formed because of the initial efforts of Sharon Senese which influenced members of the Crisis Line, Coalition, NOW, League of Women Voters, YWCA, and other women's groups to join in her efforts. The creation of the Anti-Rape Council further increased the awareness of sexual assault and other crimes that were previously ignored which resulted in more legal action taking place. With this raised awareness the Sexual Assault Treatment Center of Greater Milwaukee was created independently in 1976. = Task Force on Battered Women = Guest speaker Lisa Leghorn at the Wisconsin Conference on Battered Women, 1976Initially started by Nova Clite and Virginia Ray, the information collected by the Women's Crisis Line indicated that there was a clear need for a place to help women that encountered violent abuse. Usually brought on by the victim's spouse, the Coalition felt as though there was not nearly enough awareness of this problem and that victims of domestic abuse did not have a safe place to go. The Women's Coalition of Milwaukee then started the Task Force on Battered Women in 1975 in order to provide counseling, shelter, advocacy, and other services for battered women and their children. The Coalition tried to focus on why this issue was so prevalent in the community and why women were primarily affected. They came to the conclusion that \\"woman battering was seen as a manifestation of the imbalance of power relations between the sexes, as an overt, physical expression of the subjection of women. Task Force members believed only an overall transformation of society in which men shed their dominant role and attitudes and women were accorded equal treatment and respect could ultimately redress this social problem. While feminists at the Coalition used educational and agitational methods to work toward the long-term goal of social change, they realized that immediate relief and social services were necessities for battered women in Milwaukee\\". The Task Force gained momentum in 1976 when donations were gathered to increase its budget to $13,000. This increase in budget lead to increased training for counseling workers and helped to create the first Wisconsin Conference on Battered Women that featured feminist writer Lisa Leghorn at the Milwaukee YWCA on October 2 and 3, 1976. Similar to the Women's Crisis Line, the Task Force on Battered Women also sought independence from the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee in November 1976 and moved location to West Fond du Lac Avenue. Official independence followed through for the Task Force on Battered Women in 1979 and relocated again to Mitchell Street. The organization continued to thrive after cutting ties from the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee and even influenced other organizations to form such as the Sojourner Truth House and other shelters for victims of family violence in the Milwaukee area. thumb = Sojourner Truth House = Initially created as an immediate escape for women in potentially dangerous situations, Sojourner Truth House was created as a result of Rosemary Caravella's previous efforts. She had started an unofficial setup of homes in the Milwaukee area that served as a safe space for victims but could not provide enough care for these people as a shelter would. This fueled the creation of the Sojourner Truth House. Though eventually prosperous, the project was not fully supported for nearly three.years. \\"The new contacts with lawyers, politicians, and social service personnel facilitated what was, nevertheless, a laborious process. The labyrinthine negotiations with contractors, insurers, city zoning and building authorities, lawyers, bankers, funders, and neighborhood associations took almost three years. Family Hospital finally leased a building to the Task Force for a minimal sum and localfoundations, along with United Way and federal Housing and Urban Development grants, supported the new shelter.\\" The first facility opened its doors July 1978 and contained enough room for 18 women and children and later expanded in 1981 with enough room for 32 women and children. The efforts of Sojourner Truth House also influenced other organizations within the community, \\"after Sojourner Truth House opened, two other shelters (not directly affiliated with the Task Force) were established in the Milwaukee area, the Milwaukee Women's Refuge and Waukesha's Sister House. In addition, three major hospitals, Children's, Northwest General, and Good Samaritan, responding to the need first identified by feminists, developed special units for the treatment of domestic abuse and child abuse victims\\". The shelter originally started by the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee aimed to help victims of family abuse and stimulated the community by raising awareness for people in these situations. \\"In 1987, the Task Force on Battered Women continues to offer counseling, support groups, and referrals for battered women in Milwaukee. The total number of individuals aided has risen steadily each year since the Task Force began. In 1976, approximately 400 received aid. According to Task Force Co-Director Connie Corrao, by 1983, the yearly total of clients jumped to 6,000, and during 1986, the Task Force aided a total of 10,700 battered women and their children. Corrao noted that the dramatic increase does not necessarily mean the problem of woman battering is becoming more widespread. Rather, the increase is due largely to successful community education efforts which familiarized battery victims with the many new support services available.\\" This extremely charitable organization is remains up and running today and still thrives in the Milwaukee area.

It currently remains a legal punishment in several countries and regions, all of which have sharia-based criminal laws. Being prescribed by the law does not necessarily mean that the penalty is carried out in practice. Gay people also face extrajudicial killings by state and non- state actors, as in Chechnya in 2019. Imposition of the death penalty for homosexuality may be classified as judicial murder of gay people, which can be analyzed as a form of genocide. In current state laws As of July 2020, the following jurisdictions prescribe the death penalty for homosexuality: * Afghanistan. A new Penal Code enacted in February 2018 explicitly criminalises same-sex sexual conduct. Sources cited by ILGA indicate that there is a \\"broad consensus amongst scholars that execution was the appropriate punishment if homosexual acts could be proven‚Äù. The sharia category of zina (illicit sexual intercourse), which according to some traditional Islamic legal schools may entail the hadd (sharia-prescribed) punishment of stoning, when strict evidential requirements are met. The Hanafi school, prevalent in Afghanistan, does not regard homosexual acts as a hadd crime, although Afghan judges may potentially apply the death penalty for a number of reasons. No known death sentences for homosexuality have been passed since the end of Taliban rule in 2001. * Brunei's Sharia Penal Code, implemented in stages since 2014, prescribes death by stoning as punishment for same-sex relations. After international backlash, in May 2019, the Sultan of Brunei explained that a \\"de facto\\" moratorium on the execution of the death penalty has been in force in the country for the last two decades. This moratorium can be lifted at any time. * Iran. Homosexual intercourse is declared a capital offense in Iran's Islamic Penal Code, enacted in 1991. Articles 233 through 241 criminalise both female and male same-sex activity; the death penalty only applies to some cases of male-male penile-anal intercourse, with female-female activity and other cases of male-male activity being punished by flogging instead of execution. Though the grounds for execution in Iran are difficult to track, there is evidence that several people were hanged for homosexual behaviour in 2005-2006 and in 2016, in some cases on dubious charges of rape. * Mauritania. According to a 1984 law, Muslim men can be stoned for engaging in homosexual sex, though no executions have occurred so far. The country has observed a moratorium on the execution of the death penalty since 1987. * Nigeria, where several northern states have adopted sharia-based criminal laws, though no executions are known. * Saudi Arabia, which does not have codified criminal laws. According to the country's interpretation of sharia, a married man who commits sodomy, or a non-Muslim who engages in sodomy with a Muslim, can be stoned to death. There are unconfirmed reports that two cross-dressing Pakistani nationals were killed by Saudi authorities in 2017, which Saudi officials have denied. * Somalia (), where Islamic courts have imposed sharia- based death penalties in some southern regions. * : Article 354 of the Federal Penal Code states: \\"shall be sentenced to death penalty, whoever used coercion in having sexual intercourse with a female or sodomy with a male.\\" In addition, same-sex relations fall under the traditional Sharia category of Zina, which encompasses any sexual intercourse outside of marriage, all of which are banned in the UAE. Although application of Zina provisions in the UAE appears to be limited to prosecution of rape, some courts have gone beyond codified laws and passed sentences of stoning or flogging, thus making same- sex relationship also liable to death penalty. Extrajudicial killings In some regions, gay people have been murdered by Islamist militias, such as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in parts of Iraq and Syria and the Houthi movement in Yemen. Anti-gay purges in the Chechen Republic, a predominantly Muslim region of Russia, have included forced disappearances ‚Äî secret abductions, imprisonment, and torture ‚Äî by local Chechen authorities targeting persons based on their perceived sexual orientation.

Most jurisdictions removed capital punishment, although in Victoria it remained a capital crime when committed with violence or to a person younger than the age of fourteen until 1949. The last person arrested for homosexual sex in Australia was a man in 1984 in Tasmania. The last part of Australia to legalise consensual homosexual sex between adults was Tasmania in 1997. In 2017, homosexual marriage was legalised. Seven men are known in Australian history to have been executed for sodomy; however, six of those seven cases involved the sexual abuse of minors.Those six cases being: # John Mead, hanged at Sydney on 29 November 1836 for the forcible sodomy of a ten year old boy # William Gibson, hanged at Launceston on 31 January 1859 for sodomy of a ten year old boy # Hendrick Whitnalder, hanged at Hobart on 20 February 1863 for sodomy of a fourteen year old boy # John Kelly, hanged at Beechworth on 4 May 1867 for sodomy of an eighteen month old boy # Thomas Ross, hanged at Launceston on 30 January 1861 for an \\"unnatural crime\\" against a \\"little boy\\" of unknown age # Dennis Collins, hanged at Launceston on 11 August 1863 for an \\"unnatural crime\\" against a seven year old boy In the remaining case, Alexander Browne was hanged at Sydney on 22 December 1828 for sodomy with his shipmate William Lyster on the whaler Royal Sovereign; Lyster was also convicted and sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted before execution. Additionally, Joseph Fogg was hanged at Hobart on 26 February 1830 for an \\"unnatural crime\\", but the nature of the crime is unclear (the term could refer to consensual sex between adult males, same-sex rape, sexual abuse of minors, or bestiality). =Nazi Germany= Despite numerous countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia beginning to decriminalise homosexuality by the mid 20th century, Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party, with intense far-right nationalist support, outlawed homosexual groups and included homosexuals as one of the minority groups sent to death camps. An estimated 3000-9000 homosexuals died in concentration camps between 1933 and 1945, with another 2000-6000 survivors made to serve the rest of their sentence in prison under Paragraph 175. = Sudan = In July 2020, the sodomy law that previously punished gay men with up to 100 lashes for the first offence, five years in jail for the second and the death penalty the third time around was abolished, with new legislation reducing the penalty to prison terms ranging from five years to life. Sudanese LGBT+ activists hailed the reform as a 'great first step', but said it was not enough yet, and the end goal should be the decriminalisation of gay sexual activity altogether. =United Kingdom= From 1533 the capital felony for any person to \\"commit the detestable and abominable vice of buggery with mankind or beast\\", was repealed and re-enacted several times, until it was reinstated in 1563, remaining unchanged until 1861. The last execution took place on 27 November 1835 when James Pratt and John Smith were hanged at Newgate Prison in London. One source claims the last execution for sodomy in the British Empire happened in the Colony of Tasmania (now part of Australia) in 1867. =United States and colonial America= Colonial America had the laws of the United Kingdom, and the revolutionary states took many of those laws as the basis of their own, in some cases verbatim. The last law where the death penalty was on the statute books was South Carolina, the old British law was not repealed until 1873, twelve years after the mother country. The number of times the penalty was carried out is unknown. Records support two executions, and a number of more uncertain convictions, such as \\"crimes against nature\\".

He played the power forward and center positions during his playing career. Stutz played for the Windsor Express and the Niagara River Lions of the NBLC, being named Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2016. He competed with Butler County Community College and then Washburn University at the collegiate level. He played high school basketball for Plaza Heights Christian Academy in Blue Springs, Missouri.  Early life  Logan was born on May 27, 1988 in Blue Springs, Missouri to Valerie and Bill Stutz. He grew up playing sports in his backyard with his siblings; an older brother, a younger brother Garrett and a younger sister. Stutz later attended the small private school Plaza Heights Christian Academy in his hometown, where he played high school basketball as a point guard and graduated in 2007. His father was the head coach, and the team faced about three losses in Logan's entire career with Plaza Heights.  College career  Stutz first attended Butler County Community College in El Dorado, Kansas, where he played college basketball for the Grizzlies for one season in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). He believed that he could compete in the NCAA Division I, but he instead played at a lower level so that he could develop as a player and receive more offers. With the team, Stutz averaged 13.5 points and 5.2 rebounds per game, shooting about .480 from the field. His season drew attention of more high-level programs, but he chose to continue playing basketball in Kansas after meeting his future wife. Starting in his sophomore year, Stutz attended Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. He played basketball with the Ichabods at the NCAA Division II level. By the end of the season, he was averaging 5.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 29 games. Stutz saw improvement as a junior, with averages of 11.3 points, five rebounds, and one steal per game. He carried Washburn to an appearance at the MIAA Tournament, putting up 23 points. Stutz developed into the Ichabods' leader during his senior season, averaging 20.0 points and 7.1 rebounds, both team-highs. He earned first-team All-MIAA honors in addition to first team All-NABC accolades. Stutz also led the MIAA in scoring.  Professional career  Stutz began playing professional basketball with BG Topstar Leitershofen/Stadtbergen of the ProA, the second-best basketball league in Germany. He displayed prowess as both a scorer and as a rebounder with the team. Initially, he had trouble transitioning from the college level, but he eventually adapted. Following his time with Topstar, Stutz remarked, \\"It was a pretty smooth transition, especially because I got a little time in Germany my first year out.\\" He finished off his season with WBC Wels of the Austrian Basketball League. For the next season, Stutz would return to the ProA to compete with ETB Wohnbau Baskets, where he averaged a team-high 20 points and eight rebounds. He was later named Most Valuable Player, after the season concluded. On June 15, 2013, Stutz signed with LF Basket of the Basketligan in Sweden. Coaching career On August 9, 2018, Stutz was named the first head coach and general manager of the Sudbury Five, an expansion team in the National Basketball League of Canada (NBLC).

Originally scored for five woodwind instruments (flute, oboe, cor anglais, clarinet, and bassoon), it is most often performed in an arrangement for the conventional wind quintet of flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon. A performance lasts about eleven minutes. History Villa-Lobos composed the work in Paris in 1928, during the same period in which he was working on the series of fourteen Ch√¥ros. The first manuscript fair-copy score is titled simply \\"Quintetto para flauta, obo√©, corn'inglez, clarinete e fagote\\". The subtitle was added only after the premiere in 1930 . Although it was not originally intended as part of the Ch√¥ros series, some writers (e.g. , , and ) have treated it as related. It was first performed on 14 March 1930 at the Salle Chopin in Paris, on the same concert (part of the Festival de Musique Moderne) with the premieres of Ch√¥ros bis (for violin and cello), the Cirandas (for piano), and the Chansons typiques br√©siliennes. The performers in the Quintet were Gaston Crunelle, flute; Louis Mercier, oboe; Paul-Gustave Brun, cor anglais; Louis Cahuzac, clarinet; and Auguste Lenom, bassoon. The score was only first published in 1953, by Max Eschig, in an edition that includes alternative passages to facilitate the substitution of the (French) horn for the cor anglais (; ). This alternative scoring for conventional wind quintet undoubtedly improved chances for performances . Analysis The Quintet consists of a loose succession of five large sections played continuously, each of which can be parsed into smaller subsections. The change from one large section to the next is marked by a decided change of texture and tempo . A free rhythmic organization, reflected by frequent changes of metre and tempo and reinforced by a deliberate tonal freedom, produces a quality of spontaneity .

History  When the Welsh Church Act 1914 was passed to disestablish the Church in Wales, the responsibility for maintenance of burial grounds and churchyards were transferred from the church to local authorities, though the Church in Wales' Representative Body retained a number of ancient churchyards. Often local authorities did not accept legal responsibility for them, and the burial grounds were vested in the Welsh Church Commissioners. As a result, the Church in Wales continued to look after them despite having no legal obligation to do so. In 1944, the Church in Wales informed the Government of the United Kingdom that they would be prepared to take responsibility for the burial grounds that had not passed to local authorities. Parliament passed the Welsh Church (Burial Grounds) Act 1945 unanimously to allow for the transfer of churchyards and burial grounds from the Welsh Church Commissioners back to the control of the Church in Wales.  Provisions  The Welsh Church (Burial Grounds) Act 1945 stated that the Church in Wales would be responsible for the maintenance of burial grounds that were transferred to it under the provisions of the statute. The Church in Wales' Representative Body delegated that requirement to individual parochial church councils. The Act also granted local authorities the power but not the duty to take the burial grounds back from individual churches if they became full or the church became redundant. The restoration of the legal rights to burials to a disestablished church was viewed as the Church in Wales retaining several \\"vestiges of establishment\\" despite being separate from the Church of England.

She's best known for depiction of rebellious Iranian women in her Girls in Cars and Miss Hybrid series of photographs. Biography Aliabadi was born in Tehran, Iran in 1973 to Maymanat and Iraj Aliabadi. Her mother, Maymanat is an artist and taught at Tehran University. Her father, Iraj was a poet who worked for an insurance company. She was also mentored by older brother who coached her on art, music, and pop culture. Aliabadi grew up surrounded by artists and intellectuals, and the standard of living for the family was high until the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Her parents lost their jobs, but were still able to send her to study in Paris. Aliabadi studied art history at the University of Paris, where she also earned a master's degree in art history. Aliabadi married Farhad Moshiri, another artist in 1993. She commuted between Paris and Tehran for most of her career, but was primarily based in Tehran where she was represented by The Third Line gallery in Dubai for more than ten years. Her work has appeared in solo exhibitions in Dubai, Tehran, London, Switzerland and Denmark and in group exhibitions at the in Paris, the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow, at Frieze New York, at the Chelsea Art Museum, in Monaco, in Rio de Janeiro, in Copenhagen, in Italy, in Norway, in Estonia, in Germany, in Switzerland and in Spain. Her work is held in the collections of Deutsche Bank AG in Germany, the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery and the Farjam Collection in Dubai. Shirin Aliabadi died on 1 October 2018 in Tehran, Iran after a battle with cancer. Artwork Aliabadi's art, which includes photographs and drawings, explores the competing effects on young urban Iranian women of traditional values, religious restrictions and globalized western culture. Aliabadi is well known for her photographic series Girls in Cars (2005), which portrayed women riding around in cars, ready to party. I was stuck in traffic one weekend in a pretty posh part of Tehran, Ms. Aliabadi said in a 2013 article for Deutsche Bank, where her works were on exhibit. We were surrounded by beautiful girls made up to go to a party or just cruising in their cars, and I thought then that this image of women chained by tradition and the hijab is not even close to reality here. They all had music on and were chatting to each other between the cars and making eyes and conversation with boys in other vehicles. Although respectful of the laws, they were having fun. This contradiction between the heavy restrictions imposed by Iranian laws and young women having fun, playing with western-style fashion and accessories is the kind of subject matter Aliabadi is known for. Her work includes playful elements with more serious ones, mixing the political and the personal. In 2006, Shirin Aliabadi also collaborated with fellow artist and husband Farhad Moshiri on a project called Operation Supermarket, which was shown at the 2008 Singapore Biennale. That photographic series focused on packages and advertising images manipulated so that the labels included loaded phrases, commenting on failed capitalism and consumerism. For example, a chocolate bar reads \\"intolerance\\", and dishwasher soap label reads \\"Shoot First\\". Her Miss Hybrid (2008) series portrays young Iranian women in somewhat unconventional ways. For example, some of the photographs in this series portray women with bleached blonde hair, blue contact lenses, perfect makeup, and brightly colored headscarves, in stark contrast to the more commonly projected images of Muslim women swathed in a dull colored chador with no makeup and no hair showing. The women often have bandaids across their noses, a nod to a fashion statement among Iranian youth connoting the increasingly common incidence of plastic surgery. The photographs are depicted similar to studio portraits, portrayed from the mid- torso against dark backgrounds. The portraits are hybrids between traditional attire and contemporary fashion trends, commenting on artificial beauty and the sartorial confines of some Muslim women. As Aliabadi continued making artworks that balanced femininity, beauty standards, consumerism, and tolerance, she turned to drawing in her next series \\"Eye Love You\\" (2009) in which schoolgirl-esque drawings of exaggerated eye makeup in which brides are commonly adorned on their wedding day. The drawings are reminiscent of idle daydreams of school girls, with the eyes embellished with brightly colored eyeshadows, glitter, sticker gems, flowers, butterflies, swans, etc. Popular Iranian motifs are mixed with airbrush-style swirls and motifs reminiscent of American-style automobile bodywork. Aliabadi's next series returns to photography, with \\"City Girls\\"(2011). The series of photographs includes young women with symbols of western consumer society: Starbucks, iPods, hermes. According to Aliabadi, \\"Banal as the symbols of consumer society may seem: Starbucks, bags by Goyard or iPods,‚Äù she explains, ‚Äúin Iran they become a subliminal instrument of the so-called cultural invasion from the West, which the Iranian authorities equate with the ‚Äõgreat Satan‚Äô. For the young generation, in particular for the women, such fashion accessories become ‚Äì in a beguiling manner ‚Äì a kind of passive rebellion. This is the moment when fashion is not only fashion ‚Äî in this context the message is not superficial.‚Äù This subtle rebellion is unfortunately only really accessible to the more prosperous parts of Iranian society, and these subversive items are somewhat of a subculture of modernity and status symbols.

History  Huxley was built by Smiths Dock Company, North Shields in 1899, and purchased by George Parker Bidder III. The vessel was leased to the MBA by Bidder, who used the profits to fund the Ray Lankester Investigatorship at the MBA. Huxley was originally a commercial steam trawler named Khedive, but was renamed Huxley in honour of Thomas Henry Huxley in 1902 to assist the newly- created fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft. Her fish-hold was gutted and turned into cabin accommodation for sea-going 'naturalists' and their assistants, and a laboratory was provided on deck, so setting the pattern for many subsequent fishery research vessels. Huxley was the first research vessel acquired by the MBA that was able to venture into open waters, and was thus used to survey the southern North Sea, the English Channel, and the area west of Plymouth. This was England's contribution to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Scotland, the northern section, was treated differently). Service as a fishery research vessel Fishery investigations began in September 1902 under the directorship of Walter Garstang. The work consisted of systematic exploration of the North Sea trawling grounds at different seasons of the year, together with studies of growth and migration of plaice Pleuronectes platessa based on tagging experiments, examination of the food of fish and the nature of the seabed. Detailed catch records from North Sea survey stations between 1902 and 1903 were summarised in a report published by Garstang in 1905.Garstang, W. (1905). Report on the trawling investigations, 1902-3, with special reference to the distribution of the plaice. First Report on Fishery and hydrographic investigations in the North Sea and adjacent waters (southern area), International Fisheries Investigations, Marine Biological Association, UK, 67‚Äì198. Research continued until 1909. Data from these early surveys have now been digitized as part of the Trawling through Time initiative at Cefas. More than 150 hand-written ‚Äònaturalists logbooks‚Äô spanning 1902-1909 have been re-discovered in the Cefas archives. Plaice and other fish were caught, labelled, and released, and when they were subsequently re-caught by trawlers, the location of recapture was marked. Within the first year, 1,463 plaice were marked in this fashion, 19% of which were recaptured - proving that a significant proportion of the North Sea fish stock was being caught by fishermen each season. It was also discovered that immature fish did not breed on the Dogger Bank, and there was a suggestion that moving immature fish from inshore areas to the bank would result in more catches the next season for English fishing vessels. Service from 1910 onwards In January 1910, on instruction from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, HM Treasury passed responsibility for North Sea fishery investigations to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (later MAFF), who in-turn were required to come to an agreement with the Marine Biological Association (MBA) as to how scientific investigations could continue into the future, in support of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). On 1 April 1910 staff at the fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft moved to 43 Parliament Street, London, becoming civil servants. The Association closed the Lowestoft fisheries laboratory and sold the RV Huxley to W. Crampin for ¬£2,400. Consequently, from then onwards the now London-based staff were forced to make their research voyages aboard chartered commercial vessels. In June 1915, Huxley was requisitioned by the Royal Navy along with hundreds of other trawlers, and armed with a single 6-pounder AA gun. Her main role was to look for submarines, similar to an Admiralty trawler, but built to different specifications. Following the war, Huxley was sold to a succession of different fishing boat owners in Grimsby.Tyne built ships: A history of Tyne shipbuilders and the ships that they built. http://www.tynebuiltships.co.uk/K-Ships/khedive1899.html. Retrieved 07 November 2018 In an account of \\"Wrecks of the Pentland Firth\\" it is suggested that in 1926 Huxley, a Grimsby trawler outward bound, went ashore at Duncansby Head. She was refloated by Stroma fishermen but was so badly holed that she had to be run ashore west of the Ness. She was again refloated by Stroma fishermen and towed to Longhope by the salvage vessel Iron Axe, piloted by the Stroma men.Wrecks of the Pentland Firth 1918-1933, by W. Bremner & D. G.

She was known primarily for creating relationships with leading natural philosophers associated with the University of Bologna and the Istituto delle Scienze .  Early Years  Laura Bentivoglio and her sister were the last direct descendants of the Bentivoglio family that ruled over Bologna before their exile. In 1708, she married Francesco Davia (1677-1753), an ex-soldier, against her family wishes, and their relationship lasted until 1715‚Äì1726. Most of her life, however, she lived with her husband's uncle. cardinal Giovan Antonio Davia in Rimini. There she was educated by the Riminese physician Giovanni Bianchi in modern philosophy, and became involved in Cardinal Davia's scientific academy  Development of a Woman Philosopher Francesco Davia played a major part in Laura's development into a philosopher. Francesco was unsure about Laura's love towards him. He would go to such extremes such as challenging men who have talked to Laura. He went so far as to dress up as a priest to listen for a confession to find out if she was unlawful. He was caught and the event led him incarcerated for years. While he was in jail in 1711, she traveled back home with her son to separate from Francesco. When her husband was released from jail in 1715, he brought his unlawful wife's actions to Pope Benedict XIV. She had three choices, wither return to her husband, enter a monastery, or live with her husband's uncle Giovanni Antonio. In the end, she chose to live with Giovanni Antonio where she began her steps to become a philosopher. b. Davia was the queen of aristocratic woman who were attracted to philosophy in the beginning of the eighteenth century. Because Italian women philosophers of that era were independent, those that had rebellious minds had were fighting for social freedoms. During her stay with her uncle, she participated in some of the most interesting philosophical debates during that period.  Education  To start, Davia immersed herself in her uncle's library. Women were not ridiculed for learning but encouraged in the philosophical community. Many scholars were eager to tutor aristocratic women in sciences. One of these tutors was the physician Giovanni Bianchi (1693-1775). Laura was Giovanni's only female student, learning under his household which focused on scientific and philosophical learning. As Bianchi's intellectual credibility rose, so did his school and their knowledge branched out to questioning astronomy and philosophy to problems in anatomy. Most of the history of Biachi's schools activities and accomplishments are lost, however Davia's history can be retraced. As she grew as a philosopher over the years, she had been praised and gossiped about during the eighteenth century. For instance, Francesco Maria Zanotti wrote a poem about her, praising the philosopher and declaring that no woman in history would be able to accomplish what she had done. Eventually, he also became one of her other tutors. In Zatnotti's opinion, he characterized her as independent, yet strong-headed because of her disdain for male philosophers when debating them. In addition, her popularity was so widespread that her name was heard outside of Rimini. Her studies and her philosophical education had paid off, gaining recognition from the highest of nobility. She was one of the few women philosophers that had her own opinions and was able to debate with male philosophers on an equal platform. Davia was a firm advocate of not only Cartesian philosophy, but also of the idea that mind and body were separate entities. Through Cartesian science but also through conversations with colleagues, her opinion began to solidify towards its Newtonian counterpart, which focused on planetary motions and the possibility of a vacuum, also on the different aspects of human beings, including the psyche, and how nature reflects its divine creator. By the 1730s, Bentivoglio Davia was able to firmly establish her reputation as the leading female patron of science in the City of Bologna. She was unmoved by the results of Newton physics and her stance towards it was firmly cemented because her \\"rival\\" Bassi supported it.  Laura Bentivolgio vs Laura Bassi  During the spring of 1732, Laura Bassi started to gain momentum in the philosophy community. Laura Bassi(1711‚Äì1778), became the first woman to graduate from the University of Bologna and later the first woman to hold a university chair in Europe. Bentivolgio was annoyed of her success. Her criticisms of Bassi were spread throughout the community that the community took offense. She had to make a public apology because she feared that she would be stoned by her fellow citizens for not accepting Bassi. Due to the changes of Italian philosophy and education in the eighteenth century, it forced Davia's hand to reject Bassi and her views. In addition, Davia was backing Cartesian philosophy. She belonged to an international community of learned women who earned the approval of the Republic of Letters in the preceding century who previously included such people like Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia and Queen Christina of Sweden. Between the two there is a generation gap, therefore, they couldn't see eye to eye. Also, because Bassi wasn't an aristocrat, she was garnering more praise from critics than Bentivolgio which fueled her resentment towards Bassi.  Reputation  Her reputation as a philosopher was hard to maintain. Her unwillingness to accept Laura Bassi's ability hurt her status as a philosopher, and she gained less recognition over the years because of her arrogance. Unlike Bassi, she was not admitted in Bologna Academy of Sciences, and could only attend those debates that was available to the public After Laura Bassi took Davia's position as a philosopher, Davia changed her status to becoming a patron of philosophy. She engaged in philosophical correspondence and asked questions about multiple natural phenomena from the concept of light and electricity to why one person wears three pairs of socks. Because her position was lost, it is a possibility that she was barred from participating from philosophical discussions, to the point that she had to demand what were the new topics were from other philosophers whether they be of high status or not. During the late 1740s and 1750s, Davia became ill and her tutor Bianchi took the role as her physician. She gave him details of her physical condition and home-remedies that she'd tried. Essentially she became an experimental test subject, being analyzed by the medical community of Bologna until her death in 1761. Bibliography 1\\\\.

The countries have had diplomatic relations since 7 April 1973. Sweden has had a long-term commitment in North Korea and its relations with the country are exceptionally close among Western nations. Sweden is one of the major contributors of humanitarian aid to North Korea. History Sweden took part in the Korean War by providing the Swedish Red Cross Field Hospital and participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The Swedish Red Cross Field Hospital was the name given to the Swedish mission sent to Korea to deal with the humanitarian situation created by the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953. Following the temporary resolution of the war in 1953, Sweden was heavily involved in maintaining the armistice through its position in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Left-wing politicians in Sweden were campaigning for the recognition of North Korea on the basis that Sweden had already recognized South Korea in 1959. North Korea established an information bureau in Stockholm in 1970 and also held an exhibition presenting the country at the . Sweden and North Korea established formal diplomatic relations on 7 April 1973. In the 1970s, North Korean diplomats were discovered to run smuggling of cigarettes and liquor in Western Europe as part of the country's illicit activities to earn currency. Out of these smuggling rings, the largest one was in Sweden. Swedish prime minister G√∂ran Persson visited North Korea, as the first Western leader in history, in 2001 to head a European Union delegation for talks with then-leader Kim Jong-il. In early 2018, North Korea's deputy foreign minister visited Sweden to discuss the upcoming 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit with foreign minister Margot Wallstr√∂m and prime minister Stefan L√∂fven. His visit was followed by North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho in March 2018. Embassies North Korea has an embassy in Sweden, and Sweden has one in North Korea: * * Sweden was the first Western country to establish an embassy in Pyongyang, in 1975, and remained the only one for 26 years to maintain ambassadorial presence. Few Western nations still have an embassy in Pyongyang, and the fact that Sweden does testifies of its important present-day role in the country. Through its embassy, Sweden represents consular interests of Australia, Canada, Italy, the Nordic Countries as well as the United States. Sweden often acts as an intermediary in negotiations between North Korea and Western countries, and has been especially active in improving the ties of North Korea and the United States. Trade In the 1970s, Sweden began to see North Korea as a lucrative market. Swedish companies like Volvo, ASEA, Kockums, Atlas Copco, and Alfa Laval wanted to export their products to the country and held an industrial exhibition in Pyongyang. During that decade, North Korea imported various items, including about 1,000 Volvo automobiles that were never paid for, prompting Soviet diplomats to call it \\"largest car theft in the human history\\". These Volvos were a common sighting in Pyongyang until the 2010s. They have since become increasingly difficult to maintain. North Korea still owes 2.2 billion Swedish kronor (234 million euros) to Sweden from these imports. Out of all countries, the North Korean debt to Sweden is the largest, followed by Iraq whose debt is a billion kronor smaller. Civil society , a former vice director of the Swedish National Bank, had visited North Korea in 1971 as a journalist and written about his visit in a book, Bilder fr√•n Nord- Korea [Images from North Korea]. At that time, the book was criticized for being anti-Korean and too critical of North Korea. Later, it has been opposed as being too sympathetic toward the country. Bergstr√∂m has never regretted the book, despite it being called inappropriate for a person holding such a high office.

It was previously the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Gravina. Since 1986, along with Altamura Cathedral and Acquaviva Cathedral, it has served as a co-cathedral of the Diocese of Altamura-Gravina-Acquaviva delle Fonti. In August 1993 Pope John Paul II granted the cathedral the status of a minor basilica.GCatholic.org History A cathedral was built here at the end of the 11th century by Humphrey of Hauteville, Count of Apulia and Calabria, and thus lord of the town. This church was destroyed in the years 1447-1456 by a fire followed by an earthquake, after being refurbished in a Renaissance-Romanesque style. Of the original church only a few Byzantine capitals and frescoes remain. The present cathedral was built in the thirty years following, under the supervision of the bishop Matteo d'Aquino. The main fa√ßade has a large rose window. The altarpieces are made from 17th-century intarsia with polychrome marble and mother of pearl. The ceiling has framed canvases. The church has an altarpiece carved in Bitonto stone (1468) by Guido da Guida. There is a San Michele (1538) carved in mazzaro, a local stone, and attributed to Stefano da Putignano. Along the north nave is a Byzantine fresco of the Madonna del Piede. The oak choir-stalls were made in the 15th century and rebuilt by Bishop Antonio Maria Manzolio (1581-1593). The adjacent sacristy has a ceiling refurbished by bishop Manzolio, and elaborate presses. The bell-tower was built from a Norman watch tower.Comune of Gravina , entry on Cathedral.

Career Semu is largely self-taught as an artist and film-maker. In 1994 Semu was included in the landmark exhibition Bottled Ocean (1994), curated by Jim Vivieaere. His work for Bottled Ocean was a graffiti- inspired corrugated iron work that reflected on the 'gritty realities of Pacific communities living in suburban Auckland'. In 1994 Semu also directed the music video for New Zealand hip hop group Sisters Underground's classic song ‚ÄòIn the Neighbourhood‚Äô. In 2007 Semu was invited to be the inaugural artist in residence at the newly opened Musee du Quai Branly. The museum invited Semu to respond to a piece of advertising collateral, the 'Bonded by Blood' poster, which had been gifted to Quai Branly, to commemorate the All Black‚Äôs 2006 tour of France and the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The 'Bonded by Blood' poster depicts the All Blacks performing their signature haka 'Ka Mate Ka Mate' in a rain forest setting with ancestral MƒÅori figures silhouetted in the foliage. In what curator Reuben Friend describes as \\"an act of subversion\\", the photographs Semu produced show \\"fictitious scenes of MƒÅori ‚Äòwarriors‚Äô engaged in battle, seemingly celebrating the fighting spirit of MƒÅori while addressing the objectionable stereotypes of Pacific people as 'primitive' and 'savage'.\\" The series, titled The Battle of the Noble Savage, has been shown at a number of galleries, including City Gallery Wellington and Te Manawa in New Zealand. Semu has also worked as a commercial photographer. In 2010 he took portraits of New Zealand-born Polynesian rugby league players for a calendar produced by the Casula Powerhouse as a fundraiser and community outreach project for the Pasifika community. In 2012 Semu placed an archive of his negatives, proof sheets and film reels, diaries and ephemera, and examples of his commercial work, on long-term loan to the Auckland Art Gallery.

Part of his ongoing exploration of the colonisation and Christianisation of the Pacific, these works also reference the genre of European history paintings from this period.

Education Smith was educated at the University of Cambridge where she was awarded a PhD in 1978 for research into the effect of anaerobiosis on plant metabolism. Research Smith studies the metabolism in plants of starch and sucrose ‚Äì the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis that fuel plant growth. Her research has uncovered metabolic pathways responsible for the synthesis and degradation of starch granules in plants. She showed that these processes in leaves are subject to complex control by the circadian clock over the day-night cycle, ensuring the availability of carbohydrate to fuel metabolism during the night. Her focus is now on the mechanisms underlying this control, and the way in which carbohydrate availability is integrated with other sources of information to determine rates and patterns of growth and development in plants. Smith uses information from her fundamental studies to examine starch turnover in crop plants. Current research on starch synthesis in cereal grains has the potential to increase crop yield, and to change important functional and nutritional properties of flour. Her lab is also investigating the genetic, biochemical and molecular control of starch degradation in leaves and storage organs, and how this is coordinated with plant growth, germination and sprouting. With George Coupland, Liam Dolan, Nicholas Harberd, Jonathan D. G. Jones, Cathie Martin, Robert Sablowski and Abigail Amey, Alison is a co-author of the textbook Plant Biology. Awards and honours Smith was appointed Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to plant biochemistry in the 2006 Birthday Honours and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2016.

He is well known for his investigative pieces on an array of topics such as WikiLeaks, the Iraq War, Tiversa, U.S. military experimenting, and genocide. His long-form piece \\"Azzam the American,\\" which appeared in The New Yorker, is one of his most notable works. It was published on January 22, 2007, and was nominated for a National Magazine Award in Profile Writing. Early life Khatchadourian was born in Long Island, New York. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He also earned an International Relations master's degree from Columbia University. Early career Khatchadourian began his journalism career in Moscow, where he worked at an English weekly called The Russia Journal. While there, he worked as the chief copy editor and wrote news and editorial articles. He has contributed freelance work to a number of publications after returning from Moscow, including The Nation, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Baltimore Sun, Cond√© Nast Traveler, Smithsonian magazine and Salon. Khatchadourian spent time in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in 2001 in order to report on U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan for The Nation and the San Francisco Chronicle. In 2003, prior to joining the staff at The New Yorker, Khatchadourian wrote a five-segment piece for The Village Voice on the construction of an oil pipeline through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. Khatchadourian was a fellow at the International Reporting Project (IRP) in 2005. The project, which is run by the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C., \\"provides opportunities for journalists to report internationally on critical issues that are under covered in the news media.\\" The New Yorker Khatchadourian began working for The New Yorker in 2003 as a staff fact-checker. He wrote his first piece for the magazine, \\"Azzam the American,\\" in 2007 and transitioned to a staff writer in 2008. Since then, Khatchadourian has written a number of investigative pieces for The New Yorker on a range of topics. =\\"Azzam the American\\"= \\"Azzam the American\\" is the first piece Khatchadourian wrote for The New Yorker, the year before becoming a staff writer for the magazine. The piece was nominated for the Profile Writing category of the National Magazine Awards. It investigated the story of Adam Yahiye Gadahn, a California-born U.S. citizen who joined Al-Qaeda. Gadahn became an English spokesperson for Al-Qaeda's media, serving as \\"translator, video producer and cultural interpreter,\\" Khatchadourian reported. Although Khatchadourian did not speak with Gadahn himself, he offered an in-depth profile using a number of sources. He spoke to terrorism experts such as Randy Parsons, who was in charge of the Los Angeles F.B.I.'s counterterroism division from 2002 to 2006. The article also cited people who knew Gadahn's family. Most importantly, though, Khatchadourian scoured through essays, videos and audio recordings Gadahn had made in order to learn more about him. =\\"No Secrets\\"= In 2010, Khatchadourian wrote \\"No Secrets\\" for The New Yorker. The investigative article profiled Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. In the piece, Khatchadourian wrote that Assange wanted to be as transparent as possible concerning his work at WikiLeaks. He captured this as he told Assange's story, from starting WikiLeaks to keeping an eye out for the next leak. Khatchadourian spent time with Assange, and his team at the time, in Iceland. They were working on a leak, code named Project B, regarding two U.S. airstrikes in Baghdad, which took place on July 12, 2007. The video revealed that, along with the intended targets, the airstrike killed Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen, two war correspondents for Reuters. The leak was given the title Collateral Murder upon release. Assange also revealed his own personal story to Khathcadourian. At the age of 16 he began hacking under the name Mendax, with a group called the International Subversives. Khatchadourian also reported, from a meeting with the WikiLeaks founder on a bench in Bryant Park after the release of Collateral Murder, that Assange was working on a new project: Project G. =Operation Delirium= Another of Khatchadourian's investigative pieces for The New Yorker, titled \\"Operation Delirium,\\" shed light on U.S. military experimenting during the Cold War. The article, written in 2012, focused on Colonel James S. Ketchum, and his involvement with the Edgewood Arsenal human experiments. Khatchadourian unveiled the extent to which a vast assortment of different chemicals were being tested on, often unknowing, U.S. soldiers. The experiments were executed in an effort to create a viable form of psychochemical warfare. Ketchum told Khatchadourian about the experiments that took place at Edgewood. Soldiers were given drugs without any preparation or knowledge of what they were taking; they were studied, and then released without counselling or warning of potential effects. Ketchum also told Khatchadourian of an experimenter at Edgewood Arsenal by the name of Dr. Van Murray Sim. Sim believed that the type of psychochemical testing they were involved in required subjects not to have any preconceived expectations. He often gave unwitting people, including high-ranking officers, LSD, without informed consent. Despite disagreeing with Sim's methods, and struggling with his own conscience, Khatchadourian reported that Ketchum defended his work at Edgewood.

The leaves are alternate with two lateral veins beginning from the base, prominent and parallel to the midrib, crenate to crenate-serrate, or petiolate. The spikes are axillary or terminal, or both. The bracts are leaf-like. There are no petals. The flowers are pistillate with 3-5 sepals and a 3-locular ovary. The staminate flowers with 4 sepals and 8-16 stamens. The capsules are broader than they are long.Radford, Albert E., Harry E. Ahles, and C. Ritchie Bell. Manual of the Vascular Flora of the Carolinas. 1964, 1968. The University of North Carolina Press. 664-665. The plant grows up to 0.8m high. The stems are freely branched and densely pubescent with short incurved (or appressed) ascending trichomes. The leaves are elliptic to elliptic-lanceolate which are 2‚Äì6 cm long and 0.5‚Äì2 cm wide, obtuse, crenate.

The earliest surviving record of it is in the registers of the Bishops of Exeter for 1321 when it was licensed to Master William de Wolleghe, Rector of Yarnscombe. He was permitted by the licence to say mass therein but was forbidden from administering the sacraments there and was obliged to attend the parish church on Sundays and Feast Days. Mention of it is made later in the registers of Bishop Stafford in 1400 and of Bishop Lacy in 1426, in which latter year a licence was granted to John and Elizabeth Haache (i.e. Hatch) who at the same time were also licensed for their private chapel of St Andrew at Hele (now Great Hele Barton) in South Molton.Coulter, James, The Ancient Chapels of North Devon, Barnstaple, 1993, pp.20-1 Descent =Domesday Book= Uluelie (Woolleigh) is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the 41st of the 176Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.)

Before the Norman Conquest of 1066 it had been held by the Anglo-Saxon Alsi. Woolleigh was thus a member of the feudal barony of Okehampton, whose later barons were the Courtenay Earls of Devon of Tiverton Castle. The descent of Woolleigh was as follows: =Murdake= The holder of Woolleigh first recorded by Risdon (died 1640) was the Murdake family of Compton Murdake in Warwickshire, \\"where Thomas Murdake dwelt\\". Risdon asserts that a member of this family was Henry Murdac (died 1153), Archbishop of York. ;Sir Thomas Murdack : Sir Thomas Murdack of Woolleigh and of Compton Murdake in Warwickshire,Pole, p.415 died without male children leaving a daughter and heiress Wenlian Murdack, who married Thomas Hatch of Hatch in the parish of South Molton, Devon. =Hatch= Arms of Hatch: Gules, two demi-lions passant guardant in pale orVivian, p.455; Pole, p.485 The family of de Hatch succeeded Murdake at Woolleigh. The de Hatch family descended from Robert Atwater, son of William Atwater of South Molton, Devon, by his wife Jone de Wolrington, daughter and heiress of William de Wolrington of Hatch (alias Hach, Hacche, etc.) in the parish of South Molton. According to Risdon, Hatch was the \\"lord of the royalty\\"Risdon, p.306 of South Molton, thus the principal estate within that royal manor and borough. The Wolringtons were themselves heirs of the original de Hatch family, which died out in the male line. On receiving his maternal inheritance Robert Atwater adopted the surname de Hatch, or Hatch. Robert's son was Thomas Hatch, who married Mabill Leigh, daughter and heiress of Thomas Leigh of Leigh, near Tiverton. ;Robert Hatch : Son and heir of Thomas Hatch and Mabill Leigh.

Sir John Basset was the son and heir of John Basset (1374‚Äì1463) by his wife Joan Beaumont, daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont of Umberleigh and Heanton Punchardon and sister and heiress of Philip Beaumont of Shirwell. The Beaumonts had inherited Umberleigh from the Poulton family who had inherited it from the Willingtons.Risdon, p. 317 The Basset family were amongst the early Norman settlers in England.

Although himself an important figure in the Westcountry gentry, Sir John Basset is chiefly remembered for his connection with the life of his second wife and widow Honor Grenville (died 1566), who moved into the highest society when she remarried to Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle KG (died 1542), an illegitimate son of King Edward IV, and an important figure at the court of King Henry VIII, his nephew.

After that Woolleigh appears to have been used as a residence of elder sons and heirs apparent whilst their fathers were still alive and living at Killerton.

The Maloof family opened the Fiesta on December 14, 1994, with 100 rooms and a casino. The resort was popular among local residents, prompting a expansion that began in 1995. The expansion included a drive- through sportsbook, a remodeled buffet, and a larger casino. A $26 million, expansion took place in 1999, adding a food court, a parking garage, and additional casino space. At the time, a majority of the Fiesta's slot machines played video poker, and the casino had been proclaimed as \\"the Royal Flush Capital of the World,\\" having paid out over 118,500 royal flushes won through its video poker machines. Station Casinos purchased the Fiesta in 2001 and renamed it as Fiesta Rancho to differentiate it from its new sister property, Fiesta Henderson. History =Fiesta (1994‚Äì2001)= George J. Maloof Jr. had wanted to own a casino in Las Vegas, and he convinced his family to build one there. The Maloof family chose to build in a location off of the Las Vegas Strip, where real estate prices were significantly higher. The property for the eventual hotel-casino ‚Äì at the northeast corner of North Rancho Drive and West Lake Mead Boulevard in North Las Vegas, Nevada ‚Äì was purchased by the family in 1989. The Maloof Companies announced the $15 million Fiesta in 1990, with initial plans to include an RV park. Construction was scheduled to begin in spring 1991. However, George Maloof ultimately spent three years trying to obtain financing for the project: \\"It was tough to put it together. A lot of people questioned the location. I looked at the growth in the area and was convinced it could work. I just had to convince other people.\\" Because of the financing issue, construction was later scheduled to begin in early 1993, with completion approximately 10 months later, at a cost of $20 million. Groundbreaking eventually began in April 1994, with the completion and opening scheduled for December. The hotel-casino was constructed at a cost of either $25 million, or $35 million. The Fiesta opened to the public on the night of December 14, 1994, eight hours after a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Fiesta was the first hotel-casino to open in North Las Vegas, Nevada, and only the second hotel-casino in the northwest Las Vegas area, after the nearby Santa Fe, also on North Rancho Drive. A future competitor, the Texas Station, opened across the street from the Fiesta in 1995. The Fiesta had a Mexican theme, and the hotel featured 100 rooms in a five-story tower. The casino consisted of , with 608 slots, 14 table games, and a bingo hall. Garduno's, a Mexican restaurant chain in the Maloofs' home state of New Mexico, was among the five restaurants in the Fiesta, which also included a steakhouse and a buffet. The Garduno's restaurant was the first location to open outside of New Mexico, and it became popular among customers, with waiting periods up to four hours. The Fiesta was owned and operated by the Maloof family, while George Maloof served as the president of the hotel-casino. The hotel-casino had 700 employees. Upon opening, the Fiesta aimed to appeal to the video poker market. 1995 expansion George Maloof, speaking about the casino's success, said, \\"We figured out quickly that it was too small when we opened.\\" The Fiesta was located within a five-mile radius of 180,000 local residents. In response to the Fiesta's success with residents, a $10 million, expansion was announced in March 1995. Gavin Maloof, the brother of George Maloof, said about the locals enjoying the Fiesta, \\"They don't have to go to the Strip and battle the crowds and the traffic. They enjoy our casino and they have really loved the food. We'll be expanding the buffet and adding some storage in the back. We've been having to store food in trailers in the back to keep up with the demand.\\" Other features in the planned expansion included an entertainment lounge, an additional 200 or 300 slot machines, a larger casino pit for more table games, and a race book that would be added to the sportsbook. The expansion was expected to begin within 30 days, and was expected to be complete in approximately six months. George Maloof enjoyed spending time on the casino floor so he could get customer flowback, and that led to him having the buffet remodeled as part of the expansion project, which ultimately was expected to cost between $15 million and $20 million. Sports on the Run, a drive-through sportsbook addition that uses pneumatic tubes, was built at a cost of over $500,000 and was opened in September 1995. The St. Louis Post- Dispatch noted that it was probably the only drive-through sportsbook in the world. The resort's expansion was completed in early 1996, and it added to the resort, including the 600-seat Festival Buffet and a larger casino area, with an additional 700 slot machines. In 1998, the Nevada Gaming Control Board considered fining the Fiesta for participating in illegal betting practices on horse races. Later that year, the Gaming Control Board filed a 17-count complaint against the Fiesta. 1999 expansion In February 1999, Maloof announced plans for a $22 million expansion, to be completed by mid-December 1999 for the celebration of the New Millennium. By July 1999, the expansion was expected to cost $26 million. According to Maloof, \\"The thrust of our expansion is entertainment, things we didn't have before. It's going to be highly themed and entertainment-oriented. It'll appeal to different markets, some younger crowds. You build these things for different times of the day.\\" At the time, the Fiesta included 1,400 video poker and slot machines, and five restaurants, and was among nine other Las Vegas casinos to offer SportXction, a new interactive betting system. Up to that point, the casino had paid out over 118,500 royal flushes won through its video poker machines, and had been proclaimed as \\"the Royal Flush Capital of the World.\\" At that time, 1,000 of the casino's 1,400 slot machines played video poker. The casino's sign would also give passers-by the casino's current total of royal flushes paid out. The $26 million expansion was scheduled to open on November 30, 1999. The expansion was constructed on the east side of the property, and featured the addition of a food court with six restaurants. Also added was Roxy's Pipe Organ Pizzeria, which featured a large 70-year-old pipe organ that was once part of the Roxy Theater in New York. The pizza restaurant also served as a concert venue. Ahead of concerts, the pipe organ had to be temporarily removed by a hydraulic lift to make room for entertainers. Garduno's was moved to the expanded area and renamed Garduno's Restaurant, Cantina and Margarita Factory; the new location included what was billed as the world's largest tequila bar. The expansion also increased the casino by , for a total of . The number of slot machines was raised 500, to nearly 2,000 machines. A four-story, 1,000-space parking garage was also added, which allowed direct access to the food court. Maloof hired 250 new workers for the expansion, bringing the Fiesta's employee total to approximately 1,300. Maloof said, \\"We didn't think we'd be expanding as quickly as we have since we opened. You never expand just to expand. There's got to be demand.\\" The Fiesta had received approximately 8,000 customers a day, but Maloof projected the number to increase to 10,000 after the expansion. Maloof's future expansion plans for the Fiesta included the addition of a 500-room hotel tower and an additional of gaming space. In March 2000, the Fiesta became the first casino to field test a new type of coinless gambling machines, when 50 of its video poker machines were converted to a completely coinless format. According to George Maloof, \\"For someone to make a whole floor coinless, the market's not ready. But there's a certain person that doesn't want to mess with coins any more. That's perfect for them.\\" If successful, it was anticipated that the Fiesta could switch up to 300 of its machines to a coinless format. Later that year, Maloof said the casino's coinless slot machines had been successful with customers. Sale After six years of successful operation, the Fiesta's clientele was 99 percent local, and George Maloof wanted to expand the Fiesta brand with a new location on property he owned on Flamingo Road, west of the Las Vegas Strip. Maloof had met with Station Casinos chairman Frank Fertitta III and Las Vegas Sun editor Brian Greenspun ‚Äì who owned a company that was building a hotel-casino in Green Valley, Henderson as a joint project with Station ‚Äì to discuss possible joint ventures; their talks evolved, and Station ultimately announced in July 2000 that it would purchase the Fiesta. Maloof planned to use the money from the sale to fund his new $250 million hotel-casino on Flamingo Road, which eventually became the site of his Palms Casino Resort. Before the sale, the Fiesta's 1,100 employees were required to reapply for their jobs, as 412 employees from other Station casino properties had applied for a transfer to the Fiesta; Station planned to hire only 1,016 people. In October 2000, Station agreed to purchase the Reserve hotel-casino in Henderson, Nevada, and considered redesigning it and renaming it as another Fiesta location. Station's $185 million purchase of the Fiesta was finalized in January 2001, followed later that month by the company's $70 million purchase of The Reserve. After the acquisition, the Fiesta's 1,100 employees were laid off and replaced with employees from other Station casino properties as part of an attempt to \\"Stationize\\" the Fiesta. The Fiesta's \\"Royal Flush Capital of the World\\" tagline was also discontinued. =Fiesta Rancho (2001‚Äìpresent)= In March 2001, the hotel-casino was renamed Fiesta Rancho. In April 2001, Station announced that The Reserve would be renamed as Fiesta Henderson, as the company had hoped to turn Fiesta into a successful brand name. Station Casinos' chief financial officer said that some day, there would \\"almost certainly\\" be more than two Fiesta casinos in the Las Vegas Valley. By August 2001, the Fiesta Rancho's profits had declined in part because of competition from the new Suncoast Hotel and Casino ‚Äì which took an estimated 20 percent of the Fiesta Rancho's customer base ‚Äì and from Carl Icahn's Arizona Charlie's Decatur hotel-casino. The decline was also attributed to the layoffs of 1,100 employees, many of whom personally knew the casino's regular customers; an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 regular customers attended the Fiesta up to five times a week, but it is believed that many of them were alienated by the layoffs. The Fiesta also had a reputation among local gamblers for its loose video poker machines, but many customers felt that this was no longer the case after the sale to Station. Anthony Curtis, publisher of the Las Vegas Advisor, said, \\"Any time there's a little change, these people (local gamblers) are very fickle. They'll fly off the handle, get crazy and leave. All of a sudden, they don't feel at home anymore.\\" Station launched a large- scale marketing plan to promote the Fiesta Rancho and bring back its clientele. The Fiesta Rancho's sister property, the Fiesta Henderson, opened on December 29, 2001. By December 2003, Station planned to remove the ice arena from its Santa Fe Station, as it was not financially viable. Instead, Station planned to begin construction on a 1,400-seat ice arena at Fiesta Rancho in April 2004, for an autumn 2004 opening. The ice rink opened under the name SoBe Ice Arena. In February 2008, the casino's table-game minimums were lowered and its \\"Royal Flush Capital of the World\\" tagline was reintroduced as part of a new promotional tactic to promote the casino as its own brand, distinct from Station. At the time, the casino still operated Sports on the Run, which accounted for 10 to 15 percent of race and sportsbook income. As of 2017, the casino is . On June 14, 2019, employees voted in favor to unionize the property by 85 percent. It was organized by the Bartenders Union and the Culinary Workers Union and supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. Awards From 1996 to 2000, the Fiesta provided scholarships, known as the Fiesta Casino/Hotel Scholarship Awards, to two local students each year. During the 1990s, the Garduno's restaurant was a five-time winner of the Las Vegas Review-Journals \\"Best of Las Vegas\\" award for Mexican restaurants. In 1997, the casino won the Las Vegas Review- Journal's staff poll for \\"Best-Paying Slots\\" and \\"Best Video Poker,\\" while readers named the casino \\"Best Slot Club.\\" In 2003, the Fiesta Rancho was chosen by readers and staff of the Las Vegas Review-Journal for \\"Best Video Poker\\". In 2006, the Fiesta Rancho was chosen by the Las Vegas Review-Journal for its \\"Best Blackjack\\" award. From 2009 to 2011, Fiesta Rancho and Fiesta Henderson were voted \\"Best Video Poker\\" by readers of the Las Vegas Review- Journal. The Fiesta casinos were also chosen by the Las Vegas Review-Journal for its 2011 \\"Best Bingo\\" award.

It is an endorheic basin and more marsh than lake. Whitewater Lake was previously called White Lake due to the color of the salt flats exposed during dry periods. Whitewater Lake covers approximately 22,000 acres on average and only reaches depths of about . The lake is fed by several small streams which flow into it from the Turtle Mountains but has no natural outflow. The alkaline lake was vulnerable to drought having dried up several times including 1857, 1913-1915, 1934-1940 and 1989-1992. In 1989 Ducks Unlimited Canada began partnering with Manitoba Conservation and other partners to enhance the sustainability of the lake, investing more than two million over the following years. Dikes and water control structures were added to the east side of the lake to ensure the permanency of the water even during dry years. As of 2016, Whitewater Lake was at a peak of 1633 ft which is five feet above the average long-term level. These high levels have seen the lake claim more farm land and resulted in significant erosion of the dike and park space structures on the lake's southeast side. Whitewater Lake WMA The Whitewater Lake Wildlife Management Area (WMA) is 8,257 hectares in size. It includes Whitewater Lake and a managed marsh east of the lake. A wildlife viewing site has been developed at the southwest corner of the managed marsh cells. Whitewater Lake IBA Whitewater Lake is designated a globally significant Important Bird Area (IBA) by Bird Studies Canada because of the number of waterfowl and shorebirds that congregate there during migration. Huge numbers of waterfowl, including a significant number of Snow geese and Tundra swans, have been observed during fall migration. The largest shorebird concentrations in southern Manitoba occur on this lake when water levels are low. In 1988, 10,000 White-rumped sandpipers were recorded there; 2.5% of the known winter population of the species. Whitewater Lake is nationally significant as a nesting site for Black-crowned night herons with 1.7% of the estimated Canadian population for this species recorded nesting there. Other significant nesting populations include Franklin's gulls and Eared grebes.

It was formerly placed in the genus Luciola. Its habitat is still water, and the larvae are aquatic. Taxonomy The species was described as Luciola ficta by Ernest Olivier in 1909. The type locality is Pin-fa, Guizhou. In 2010, Fu, Ballantyne and Lambkin transferred it and three other Luciola species to the new genus Aquatica. Description A. ficta has an elongate-oval body that is long and wide. The male and female have the same colouration. The pronotum is orange, and the elytra are dark brown, with yellowish brown fringes. The legs have yellowish brown femora. The venter is yellowish brown and dark brown. The male has an oblong aedeagal sheath, around long, and elongate and subparallel genitalia. The larva has gills and glands that secrete protective substances. Distribution and habitat A. ficta is found in Guizhou, Fujian, Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is commonly found in still water and rice paddies, and the larvae prefer muddy substrate. Adults occur all year. In Taiwan, they are most common in April and August. Behaviour The larvae are aquatic; not being able to swim, they crawl at the bottom of water. They go through six instars. They eat small invertebrates and carrion. The larvae probably burrow in mud during dry periods. The adult's light is green-yellow. The males fly to look for mates while the females usually do not fly, remaining on the ground. About 100 eggs are laid on moist soil or plants. In one experiment, the life cycle was completed in about 120 days. A 2010 study recorded about 390 days, the larval stage spanning about 330 days.

Biography Florence Lucinda Carpenter was born in 1850 in Munnsville, New York, and raised in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Her first writings were poems published in a local newspaper and in Peterson's Magazine. After her marriage to a man surnamed Dieudonn√©, she traveled in Europe; letters that she sent back for publication in various newspapers enhanced her a reputation as writer. Dieudonn√©'s first book was the long poem entitled A Pre-Historic Romanza (1882). She also wrote several cantatas with music by J. B. Carpenter. Dieudonn√© is best known for two novels of speculative fiction: Rondah, or Thirty-Three Years in a Star (1887) and Xartella (1891). Rondah in particular is notable for prefiguring 20th century science fiction in its descriptions of another planet, and it was well ahead of its time in its sympathetic portrayal of extraterrestrial life. Rondah is about four people who are ported to a new planet still in the process of formation that is inhabited by bird people. It was inspired in part by theories about a possible disintegrated planet between Mars and Jupiter. Xartella is more in line with late Victorian supernatural fantasy and exotic-location adventure novels by such writers as H. Rider Haggard. Set in Egypt, it is centered on a triangle of characters: an immortal Egyptian of that name who is able to reanimate mummies, an old man, and the woman they both love, Artossa. The story is narrated by a later explorer who encounters the old man and becomes involved in events when he accidentally reanimates Xartella's wife Aphiah. Dieudonn√© lived in Washington, D.C., where she was president of the Parzelia Circle, a literary club. She died in 1927 in California.

It was given its world premiere at Avery Fisher Hall on May 3, 2012 by the pianist Yefim Bronfman and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Alan Gilbert. Composition The piano concerto has a duration of roughly 30 minutes and is written in three connected sections. It was composed between 2011 and 2012, and was Lindberg's fourth and final commission for the New York Philharmonic as its composer-in-residence. Lindberg has cited Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand as inspiration for the piece. =Instrumentation= The work is composed for solo piano and a large orchestra comprising three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, three clarinets (3rd doubling E-flat clarinet), bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets (3rd doubling trumpet in D), three trombones, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, and strings. Reception The concerto has received mixed praise from music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times called it \\"a surging, mercurial 32-minute work\\" and wrote, \\"The concerto has great stylistic diversity: elusive atonal stretches; writing for the piano that evokes the spiky style of Stockhausen one moment and the voluptuous colors of Ravel the next; orchestral flourishes with the sweep of Rachmaninoff; episodes recalling Mr. Lindberg's earlier work in which he explored extremes of complexity.\\" He added, \\"Yet for all the shifts in language and style, the concerto comes across as organic and inevitable. I kept waiting for this teaser of a piece to break out. It never really did, but I look forward to hearing it again.\\" John Allison of The Daily Telegraph similarly described the concerto as \\"disappointingly conventional,\\" but noted that \\"it still excitingly captures all the tussle inherent in the concerto form.\\" However, the work was highly praised by Georgia Rowe of the San Francisco Classical Voice, who said, \\"...it emerged a work of tremendous power and considerable allure.\\" She continued: References Category:Concertos by Magnus Lindberg Category:2012 compositions Lindberg 2 Category:Music commissioned by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the New York Philharmonic ","title":"Piano Concerto No. 2 (Lindberg)"},{"id":"50403841","text":"Shree Gyanodaya Secondary School is a school in Kawasoti, Nawalparasi, Nepal It was established in 1984 A.D .

The Residential School caters to boarding education for children from the valley as well as outside. It has about 350 students studying from Grade I to X. It is on its own premises at Kawasoti, about 30 km on the outskirts of Chitwan and easily accessible by road. It is in a land sprawling an area of over 100 ropanies surrounded by the forested slopes of the Hatiban hills in the southwest and verdant agricultural cultivation in the terraced slopes of the hills in the northeast. The school is equipped with playgrounds, auditorium, IT access, audio-visual aids, science laboratory and a library. It has a team to attend to the health needs of the hostel inmates. ;Gyanodaya Higher Secondary School The higher secondary wing by the name Gyanodaya Higher Secondary School was registered with the Higher Secondary Education Board in 1996 and started the 10+2 classes in the three streams of science, management and humanities. Initially, the classes for 10+2 were conducted in the same premises of Gyanodaya Secondary School at Kawasoti but a separate infrastructure has been developed with its own compound at Nawalparasi. ;Gyanodaya College The college has a Bachelor‚Äôs wing called Gyanodaya College, established in 2015 as an affiliate of Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu. It runs a three-year management programme leading to a bachelor's degree in Business Studies (BBS). ;Gyanodaya Social Service The Social Service Division was inaugurated at kawasoti. This marked the culmination of years of Gyanodaya's informal involvement in social service and community work to uplift the condition of the deprived and underprivileged as well as help in the rehabilitation of the victims of natural calamities. At the community level, it means the realization of the education aspirations of many underprivileged and backward community children and illiterate women. The division has a pre-primary school with classroom, teaching aids, play area and library. It provides free uniforms and footwear to children attending the school. It runs informal education classes for women at the centre every day from Sunday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Presently, some 30 children and a sizeable number of women are benefiting from the programmes run at the centre.

Their first home was a log structure, non-extant, located northeast of the present house. The present house is a two-story, brick structure with a gable roof. The wooden porches on the front and back of the house date from 1898 to 1900. The large barn measures , and was built in 1856. It is composed of board and batten construction from oak that was milled on the site. It was used largely as a granary, rather than a shelter for farm animals. Three other buildings included in the historic designation include the summer kitchen, woodshed, and a small outdoor privy. The dates of construction for the three frame buildings is unknown. The farm remained in the Nelson family until 1941 when it was abandoned with most of the original furnishings intact.

It runs from Sj√¶l√∏r Boulevard on the rear side of Vestre Cemetery in the east to Gammel K√∏ge Landevej in the wast. The street is lined by a mixture of converted industrial complexes from the beginning of the 20th century, building society developments and modern apartment buildings from the 2010s. History Carl Jacobsens Vej is the backbone of an industrial zone which developed along the north side of a freight railway line opened in 1909. Many of the factories had short railway arms providing them with direct access to the railway network. There were plans to replace many of the industrial buildings with modern offices in the 1980s but the plans were given up after public opposition. The buildings were instead adapted for other use. Carl Hacobsens Vej developed into a popular location for art galleries and creative businesses in the 2000s, but most of the art galleries moved closer to the city centre during the Financial Crisis in 2009. In the 2010, Carl Hacobsen has been subject to extensive redevelopment with many new apartment buildings. Notable buildings and residents Building society houses on Kl√∏berbladsgade On the north side of Carl Jacobsens Vej is a development of building society houses built by Frederiksberg Arbejders Boligforening (Frederiksberg Workers' Building Society) for blue and white collar workers at the nearby Carlsberg and Trekroner breweries in 1902-05. It consists of 26 houses located on Karensgade, Gerdasgade, Kl√∏verbladsgade and Trekronergade. They were designed by Ejner Blytmann and originally contained a total of 104 dwellings which has been merged into half as many in connection with a renovation. The Kl√∏verbladsgade Building, now home to Bjarke Ingels Group The large industrial complex which extends north along the west side of Kl√∏verbladsgade is the former headquarters of Dansk Pressefabrik from 1923. The factory produced bottle tops both for the beer and dairy industry. Several creative businesses are now headquartered in the complex, including the architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group. The building is owned by DADES. The Sukkertoppen Building The former premises of K√∏benhavns Sukkerfafinaderi (Mo. 25), a sugar refinery from 1913-14, are now known as Sukkertoppen. Its Gr√ºnderzeit buildings were designed by Arthur Wittmaack were adapted for use by Copenhagen Technical College by Kristian Isager in 1991. A four-story high, covered rambla connects the old and new buildings. The artist Henning Dangaard-S√∏rensen has created artworks for the complex. Henkel's former main building No. 29-37 is the former premises of Scandinavian Henkel. Henkel's old Neo-Baroque main building with its large, rounded pediment was originally built for Skandinavisk Fr√∏kompagni in 1918-19 to design by Ole Falkentorp and F. Freese. It is attached to a former warehouse from 1930 and an administration building from 1938. It has housed the Danish Maritime Authority. To the rear is a large, four-story factory building attached to a watertower to the northeast. It is still used by the Henkel subsidiary Ecolab is still using the factory buildings. New buildings include an apartment building at No. 16 by Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects (2015). Transport Sj√¶l√∏r station is located just south of the beginning of the street.

Lady Sei Shonagon, woodblock print by Kobayashi Kiyochika, 1896 Form Hateful Things was written in the form of a list of the author's dislikes.Mark Vickers, \\"The Pillow Book ‚Äì Sei Shonagon\\" (educational notes), University of Indiana This short essay is an example of her preference for a list-based style of writing. She lists her hates within topics such as etiquette, women, men, and society. Sei slowly begins by explaining some habits she feels are intolerable that are practiced by others. She uses a comical sense in some of her points giving it a twist to what a simple list can be. At the end of the short essay we can understand that everything bothers her. The author uses hyperbole to illustrate her hates. Shonagon's tone throughout her listing is frank and critical. She writes openly about sensitive subjects: for example, one of her topics is the boorish behavior of men having affairs. She starts by stating the issue, then illustrates with an example of the issue. Theme This short essay was written to express Sei Sh≈çnagon's own dislikes. She focuses on topics such as respect, the poor, children, and parenting. She criticizes practices of her time and place to inform the reader what others may think when they fall into her categories. Her purpose of writing this list is to entertain the reader with a comical view on a need for change. Sei writes with a cautious tone of dreaming of change within society. She describes the way Japanese society functioned and her opinion towards it. Culture and time period Sei Sh≈çnagon was a Japanese lady in the court of Empress Consort Teishi (ÂÆöÂ≠ê) ( during the tenth century. Her exact birth dates are unknown. She lived during the Heian era, when there was much literary activity, and she found herself in rivalry with the novelist Lady Murasaki. Sei was an outstanding and independent woman, who used her skills to be outspoken and wrote Hateful Things with no filters. During this time-period she also wrote several other pieces to express her opinions in a similar form to Hateful Things, including Depressing Things and Elegant Things. This short essay is part of her famous piece The Pillow Book, a meditation on her personal beliefs about social life. Imitations Modern-day literature students sometimes choose or are tasked to imitate the form of Hateful Things.

New Yorker. Web. The inspiration for the story came to Williams after she read an article in a Montana newspaper about an incidence of fossil theft Williams' article details fossil trader Eric Prokopi's efforts to sell a Tarbosaurus bataar skeleton. Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj filed suit against Prokopi, claiming the fossils had been smuggled from a Mongolian dig site. Prokopi says the fossils had been shipped to him by British dealer Chris Moore, who listed the skeleton's origin as Great Britain on customs forms. Because of the investment Prokopi had made to refurbishing the fossils, seizure by the Mongolian government threatened to destroy his business. He responded by making a legal claim on the specimen. The stand-off ended when \\"about two dozen federal agents and sheriff's deputies arrived at [the estate], got Prokopi out of bed, and arrested him on three counts involving smuggling.\\" Prokopi pleaded guilty to mislabeling the skeleton and was subsequently forced to forfeit his claim. Williams says she first approached the story \\"from a crime angle but then got completely sucked in by the science.\\" Much of her pre-reporting for the story involved examining paleontological texts and legal documents that included Prokopi's case file and building permit for his fossil workshop. Her reporting fieldwork for the piece involved shooting photographs and video of paleontological excavations in Wyoming, South Dakota and Badlands National Park for references. After the publication of the New Yorker article, Williams sold the pitch for The Dinosaur Artist to Hachette Book Group. The book would expand on Prokopi's story to further examine the world of black-market fossil sales.

Named as a portmanteau of \\"road\\" and \\"rodeo\\", these competitions have been held for a range of different vehicles since at least 1937. Typically, drivers compete to pass through a variety of obstacles in the smallest amount of time, although the competitions may include other components, such as a written test.  Etymology  The term \\"roadeo\\" is a portmanteau in which the word rodeo is combined with the word road which here represents motor vehicles i.e. motor vehicles are normally driven on a road. A \\"roadeo\\" is then a \\"rodeo for cars\\" in that roadeos involve the handling of motor vehicles just as rodeos involve handling livestock. According to Louise M. Ackerman writing in American Speech, the word \\"roadeo\\" was probably first used in the 1950s, and its introduction was partially driven by the popularity of rodeos. Of course, roadeos are also held for a variety of other vehicles, such as buses (including transit buses and school buses) and trucks (especially semi-trailer trucks).  History  The first roadeos were mainly events for truck drivers. For example, the National Truck Roadeo (now the National Truck Driving Championships, also known as the National Truck Driving Championships Roadeo) was founded in 1937 by the American Trucking Associations for the purpose of publicly displaying the \\"incredible degree of safety, courtesy, and driving judgement [that drivers] had achieved\\". Since the earliest roadeos, roadeo competitions have been started for a wide variety of commercially operated vehicles. In addition to transit and school buses, competitions are available for minivan drivers and paratransit bus drivers, to name only two of the classes of vehicles served. Even within truck roadeos, vehicles are usually divided by class, such as the International Bus Roadeo, which divides transit buses into 35- and 40-foot divisions, and various truck roadeos, which divide trucks by length and weight. One roadeo was held in Orlando, Florida for motorscooters and small motorcycles.  Obstacles  The obstacles that drivers have to navigate may vary among competitions, but usually measure drivers' abilities to negotiate narrow paths, tight turns, or both while under a time limit. At times, the clearance drivers are given by an obstacle are quite small; one obstacle that bus drivers have to navigate requires them to stop with their front bumpers less than six inches away from a traffic cone. Minimum speed requirements, besides the time limit usually imposed on a course as a whole, can also be used by obstacle course designers to increase the difficulty of an obstacle. The obstacles in a roadeo are usually meant to test drivers' ability to handle situations that would come up during usual day-to- day driving. Some transit bus roadeos include simulated bus stops, school bus roadeos tend to include simulated loading and unloading events, and most roadeos require drivers to navigate very tight spaces in their vehicles, such as those that would be encountered while driving an eighteen-wheeler.  Other components  Some roadeos go beyond merely testing driving skills. Most roadeos have a written component, usually a test drivers have to take before they compete in the driving events. Maintenance competitions are part of many roadeos, especially those involving transit buses; for instance, the International Bus Roadeo includes a bus maintenance challenge in which bus maintenance teams have to diagnose and repair bus mechanical issues. Adding to the challenge, mechanical issues sometimes need to be diagnosed under a strict time limit. It also has added a \\"Customer Service Challenge\\", which \\"allows bus operators to test their customer service skills in some distinctive customer interface scenarios\\".  Safety  Since the first roadeos, one goal shared by nearly every roadeo is safety. Many roadeos require drivers to have an excellent safety record in order to be able to participate in them. Some, like the International Bus Roadeo and the National Truck Driving Championships, require drivers to have been completely accident-free for a year before the competition, counting accidents that were not the driver's fault. = In management = Roadeos have been praised as a safety training exercise. Benefits of roadeos include encouraging safety and productivity in the truck driving workforce, as well as improving morale. As it was implemented in one region, bus employees \\"completed a written examination, an oral interview, a pre-trip inspection, and demonstrated their driving skills through a prescribed course\\".  Notable roadeos  In the United States, there are a number of national-level roadeos for which drivers qualify by doing well in regional roadeos. These national roadeos usually serve one or a few types of vehicles; for example, the International Bus Roadeo only allows transit bus drivers to compete. = International Bus Roadeo = The International Bus Roadeo is hosted by the American Public Transportation Association and includes bus driving and bus maintenance competitions. = National Truck Driving Championships = Described as a \\"glorified trucking championship\\" and as an \\"annual Super Bowl of knowledge, truck driving skills, and safety habits\\", the National Truck Driving Championships is the final level of the American Trucking Associations-sponsored roadeos, above the state-level Truck Driving Championships. The championships have a number of similarities to the International Bus Roadeo regarding how it operates, including the requirements for drivers (i.e. one accident-free year) and the pre-trip inspection test.

He became one of the first Armenian members of Turkey's parliament in decades alongside Markar Esayan (AKP) and Selina √ñzuzun Doƒüan (CHP). Life Garo Paylan was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1972 to an Armenian family originally from Malatya. He graduated from Istanbul University's School of Business. He then became a director of various Armenian schools in Istanbul. Thereafter, he became a director for a project that promoted multilingual education. Political career Garo Paylan first joined the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) in 2011 and was one of its campaign supports. He then represented the interests of Armenians within the party and soon joined other activists starting the People's Democratic Congress, becoming a member of its Central committee. =Peoples' Democratic Party= Garo Paylan became one of the founding members of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and was part of its central committee. =Member of Parliament= On June 7, 2015, he was elected into the Grand National Assembly as a representative of Istanbul's 3rd electoral district. He became among the first Armenian members of the Assembly in decades alongside Selina √ñzuzun Doƒüan (CHP) and Markar Esayan (AKP). He was re-elected in the snap elections of November 2015. Garo Paylan speaking at a conference dedicated to the Armenian Genocide and Hrant Dink He was re-elected to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in the Parliamentary Elections on 24 June 2018. He is currently a member of the Turkish parliament's Planning and Budget Committee. Brawl in parliament Several days after his speech concerning the Armenian Genocide, Paylan was involved in a fight with members of the AKP which forced the parliament to be suspended. Paylan blamed the AKP party for instigating the violence against opposition party members so as to \\"rule the parliament using brute force instead of diplomacy and politics.\\" Paylan also expressed his fears that the violence would intensify. A week after, on 2 May 2016, another fight occurred during a meeting for constitutional reform in which the Minister of Justice, Bekir Bozdag, blamed Garo Paylan for starting the fight the previous week. Paylan responded by saying Bozdag's remarks were slanderous. Following the incident, Paylan said that many racist remarks were made about his Armenian identity and that the attack against him was planned. He concluded that he was attacked because of his ethnic Armenian identity. The Human Rights Association of Turkey released a statement condemning the violence against Paylan. The condemnation, released by its Committee Against Racism and Discrimination, stated that the attacks against him were due to his Armenian origin. The statement also condemned various racial slurs that were said to him such as \\"the Armenian bastard\\".  Views  Upon getting elected Paylan vowed to fight against Armenian Genocide denial and demands that the Armenian Genocide be acknowledged in Turkey. In April 2016, during a speech in parliament he made concerning the 101st anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Paylan counted the names of Ottoman Armenian politicians who were deported and killed during the Armenian Genocide. He supports the movement of the Saturday Mothers (), who demand answers to the whereabouts of their \\"disappeared\\" relatives in Turkey.

Like Crypt Records' Back from the Grave series, the Last of the Garage Punk Unknowns entries include the raw and aggressive numbers characterized by the use of fuzztone- distorted guitars and rough vocals, yet the songs tend to be more melodic and inclusive of the diversity of the genre. As indicated on the front sleeves, most of the songs were recorded by American groups, between 1965-1967. The series tends to follow the packaging format established by the Back from the Grave series in that each volume includes detailed liner notes that include basic information about each song and group, such as origin and recording date.

Pietro Ferrero was born in Grugliasco near Turin on 12 May 1892. In 1905 he joined the Social Studies Centre in the Barriera di Milano neighbourhood in Turin, which transformed itself into a Modern School along the principles developed by the Spanish libertarian Francesc Ferrer i Gu√†rdia. Ferrero, Pietro, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 47 (1997) In 1918 he was hired at the Fiat automobile factory.Ferrero, Pietro, 1892- 1922, at libcom.org (Retrieved 1 October 2017) During World War I Ferrero was active in the General Confederation of Labour () militating in the revolutionary current against the reformist wing of the union. Since 1915 and for the duration of the war, he worked as a militarized worker at the Turin Arsenal, carrying out an active propaganda against the participation of workers in the Industrial Mobilization Committees (). In 1917, together with anarchist comrades of the Barriera di Milano neighbourhood, he took part in the riots in Turin against the employers and the war. In 1919 he was elected secretary of the Turin section of the Federation of Metal Workers Employees (). Ferrero, who began collaborating with the journal L'Ordine Nuovo, headed by Antonio Gramsci, from 1919, became one of the most prominent dissidents at FIOM congresses. He was involved in much workplace agitation and many strikes. In April 1920, he is active in the strike against the unilateral decision of Fiat to shift working hours from standard time to daylight saving time leading to the occupation of the factories in September 1920, during the Biennio Rosso. As a proponent of an intransigent line, Ferrero refused any compromise solution and therefore opposed the decision to hand over occupied factories following the agreement between the employers' federation Confindustria and the General Confederation of Labour at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti in Rome, which led to the end of the factory occupations. At the national congress of FIOM, convened in Milan from 16 to 21 September 1920 to ratify that agreement, Ferrero fought hard but in vain against the agreement. On 18 December 1922 he was killed by fascist gangs under command of Piero Brandimarte during the massacre in Turin. After being tortured, fascists tied Ferrero to a truck and dragged him, presumably still alive, at full speed through the Corso Vittorio Emanuele. After that Ferrero was dumped at the foot of the statue of King Vittorio Emanuele II. His unrecognizable corpse (identified only by a document he was wearing) was found at the foot of the statue.

First developed as a potential cancer chemotherapy, it was subsequently identified as a senolytic (a drug that selectively induces cell death in senescent cells). The Bcl-2 family is most notable for their regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, at the mitochondrion; Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are anti-apoptotic proteins. Because many cancers have mutations in these genes that allow them to survive, scientists began working to develop drugs that would inhibit this pathway in the 1990s. ABT-737 was one of the earliest of a series of drugs developed by Abbott Laboratories (now Abbvie) to target this pathway, based on their resolution of the 3D structure of Bcl-xL and studies using high-field solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that revealed how the BH domains of these proteins interacted with their targets. ABT-737 was superior to previous BCL-2 inhibitors given its higher affinity for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. In vitro studies showed that primary cells from patients with B-cell malignancies are sensitive to ABT-737.Vogler, Meike, et al. \\"Bcl-2 inhibitors: small molecules with a big impact on cancer therapy.\\" Cell Death & Differentiation 16.3 (2008): 360‚Äì367. In animal models, it improved survival, caused tumor regression, and cured a high percentage of mice. In preclinical studies utilizing patient xenografts, ABT-737 showed efficacy for treating lymphoma and other blood cancers. Unfortunately, ABT-737 is not bioavailable after oral administration, leading to the development of navitoclax (ABT-263) as an orally-available derivative with similar activity on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines. Navitoclax entered clinical trials, and showed promise in haematologic cancers, but was stalled when it was found to cause thrombocytopenia (severe loss of platelets), which was discovered to be caused by the platelets' requirement for Bcl-xL for survival. Subsequently, it was reported that ABT-737 specifically induces apoptosis in senescent cells in vitro and in mouse models.

He is said to have been the son of the cacique of Ramiriqu√≠; Baganique. During that time, Ramiriqu√≠ was part of the zacazgo of Quemuenchatocha of the northern Muisca Confederation. Pacanchique's fianc√©, Azay, is said to have been kidnapped by Quemuenchatocha and Pacanchique did all to get her back, eventually leading the Spanish conquistadores to Hunza to beat Quemuenchatocha.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2013, Ch.19, p.103  Background  In the centuries before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, the central highlands (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) of present-day Colombia were ruled by zaques (northern Muisca Confederation) and zipas (southern territories). Other areas were ruled by caciques, one of which was the ruler of Ramiriqu√≠.  Mythography  Pacanchique, who lived in the times of the rule of zaque Quemuenchatocha, had a beautiful fianc√©, Azay. Quemuenchatocha organised pilgrimages to the Temple of the Sun, built by Goranchacha. At the temple human sacrifices were performed; young boys of twelve years old were offered to worship Su√©, the god of the Sun of the Muisca. These rituals took place at the Cojines del Zaque (\\"Cushions of the Zaque\\"), two round stones of equal rock type, and were accompanied by music and dances with flutes, ocarinas and drums. At one of the celebrations, the delegation of Ramiriqu√≠ composed of the cacique Baganchique, his son Pacanchique and his fianc√© Azay, together with other leaders of the area around Ramiriqu√≠, came from Sorac√° to the temple to worship the Sun. The celebrations started at dawn; when Su√© was rising in the east. Zaque Quemuenchatocha kneeled down on the Cojines to start the ritual. The hearts of the young boys were pulled out and sacrificed to the Sun, while Quemuenchatocha drank their blood. The zaque saw the beautiful Azay and ordered his servants to bring her to his palace (gran boh√≠o) that night. The choice for Azay was considered a great honour according to the Muisca traditions and was arranged by the gods and Azay was captured that same night.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2013, Ch.19, p.104 = Pacanchique's artifices = Desperate for the loss of his lover, Pacanchique needed an artifice to get Azay back. After consulting his father, he went to the swamps of Sorac√° where the Muisca cultivated their medicinal and psychoactive plants. He took two types of plants from here and went to the palace of Quemuenchatocha where he found Azay crying for help. He gave her one of the plants and she immediately fell asleep. When Quemuenchatocha entered and found his conquered beauty dead, he and his shamans tried to save her life, but their attempts were unsuccessful. With a sad funeral march, Quemuenchatocha brought back the body of Azay to Baganique in Ramiriqu√≠. There Pacanchique gave her the other plant he picked from the swamps and Azay came back to life. When Quemuenchatocha found out his conquered lady was not dead, he sent his guecha warriors to Ramiriqu√≠ to find her and punish the culprits of the plot. Pacanchique fled the village but Azay and Baganique were captured by the soldiers and taken to Hunza. The protests of former friend Baganchique and his people were in vain; the zaque ordered Azay and Baganique to be hung at the gallows on \\"Gallow Hill\\". Shortly after the conquistadores led by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada reached the Muisca territories and found the hanging bodies. Pacanchique wanted revenge on the deaths of his father and fianc√© and led the small army of De Quesada to the domains of Quemuenchatocha where he was found sitting in on his throne with gold, emeralds and expensive cloths. Pacanchique also showed the Spanish troops the way to the Temple of the Sun in sacred city Sugamuxi. Pacanchique died close to Bonza by the sword of one of the Spanish soldiers.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2013, Ch.19, p.106 Other chroniclers call Azay \\"Nagant√°\\".

They showcase her voice to its fullest and best.\\" Carley Hall of The Music said \\"Some tracks delight in their new setting, while others come off sounding oddly hamstrung by some of the orchestration that, really, should augment them to greater heights, and it's particularly and sadly true of the older hits. For instance, the George inclusions like \\"Special Ones\\", \\"Breathe In Now\\" and \\"Spawn\\" lack that edgy, feisty attitude they debuted with. But the dramatic strings that haunt \\"Quiet Day\\" and \\"Bluebird\\" fit extremely well beside Katie's piano and pitch-perfect vocal.\\" Track listing # \\"Quiet Day\\" - 2:56 # \\"Sweet One\\" - 4:48 # \\"Breathe In Now\\" - 3:56 # \\"Bluebird\\" - 3:54 # \\"Special Ones\\" - 4:03 # \\"Tip Of Memory\\" - 5:08 # \\"Slowly\\" - 3:31 # \\"Love‚Äôs My Song For You\\" 4:40 # \\"Emperor‚Äôs Box\\" - 4:07 # \\"Spawn\\" - 4:15 # \\"Untitled\\" - 2:04 # \\"My Own Time\\" - 4:11 # \\"Time\\" - 4:54 # \\"Janet\\" - 3:45 # \\"Let You In\\" - 4:27 References Category:2013 albums Category:Katie Noonan albums ","title":"Songbook (Katie Noonan album)"},{"id":"50404267","text":"Delvin P√©rez Dippini (born November 24, 1998) is a Puerto Rican baseball shortstop in the St. Louis Cardinals organization. Career P√©rez attended the International Baseball Academy in Puerto Rico. He started playing shortstop at 14‚Äì15 years old after starting out as a pitcher. During the fall of 2015 he played in the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in Jupiter, Florida. P√©rez was considered one of the top prospects for the 2016 MLB Draft. He has been compared to Carlos Correa. Leading up to the draft he received help from former MLB player Carlos Delgado. Prior to the 2016 MLB draft, P√©rez won the Most Valuable Player award in the V√≠ctor Pellot Excellence Tournament, guiding his team to the championship by batting .556 (including several extra-base hits) and leading the tournament in RBIs and runs scored before the highest ranked prospects in Puerto Rico. One day before the 2016 MLB draft, media reports claimed that P√©rez had failed a drug test for performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). His agent, Melvin Rom√°n, was vocal in denouncing the news as gossip and insisted that his client had not failed any tests. P√©rez was selected 23rd overall in the first round by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2016 MLB draft. After signing, he made his professional debut with the GCL Cardinals where he batted .294 with a .745 OPS, along with 12 stolen bases. In 2017, P√©rez began the season with the Johnson City Cardinals. However, after slashing only .140/.275/.186 in 13 games, he was demoted to the GCL Cardinals.https://www.ksdk.com/article/sports/mlb/cardinals/no-reason-to- panic-for-delvin-perez/456079516 He returned to Johnson City in late July. In 34 total games between both clubs, he batted .203 with nine RBIs and five stolen bases. He spent 2018 with the State College Spikes, batting .213 with one home run, 21 RBIs, and eight stolen bases in 64 games.

It is directed by Mo Scarpelli and Alexandria Bombach. It had its world premiere at the South by Southwest 2015 Festival in Austin, Texas, and was nominated for a 2015 Cinema Eye Honors Award in the category ‚ÄúSpotlight Award.‚Äù In late 2012, Scarpelli and Bombach traveled to Afghanistan to film a documentary short about photographers. This turned into the feature-length film Frame by Frame, a personal look at the lives of four Afghan photographers working where photography was formerly banned by the Taliban government. Scarpelli and Bombach raised more than $70,000 using Kickstarter to bring Frame by Frame to life. The film was shot in a cinema v√©rit√© style, which presented a unique challenge to the filmmakers because they did not speak the native language; oftentimes, they wouldn‚Äôt know exactly what they had filmed until they got to the editing room and worked with a translator. Both filmmakers have said that being foreign women and having an all-female crew gave them unique access and allowed them into places that foreign men would have had a much harder time entering. Because of Scarpelli‚Äôs background in journalism, she characterizes the film as long-form journalism. ‚ÄúThe point of it is to inform and spark dialogue about local journalism under fire.‚Äù Frame by Frame was shown at over 50 film festivals including Hot Docs Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival and BFI London Film Festival. Scarpelli and Bombach received enthusiastic praise from film critics. The Hollywood Reporter called Frame by Frame ‚Äúa work of profound immediacy, in sync with the photographers‚Äô commitment and hope\\" and BBC Culture proclaimed ‚Äúthe film features photographers passionate about telling stories of the true identity of Afghanistan ‚Äì whether they are newsworthy or not.‚Äù Scarpelli has said she was influenced by character-driven films with strong narratives, including films like Cutie and the Boxer (2013), Virunga (2014), Stories We Tell (2012), and After Tiller (2013).

The first church on Hundv√•g island was built at Austb√∏, about east of the present site of the church. The church was probably a small Romanesque stone church. The church was no longer regularly used after the mid-1600s and from then on, the islanders had to travel to the nearby Frue Church on the mainland. By 1745, the church had become a ruin. In the 19th century, the stones from the old church were used to help restore the nearby Stavanger Cathedral, and at that time, the foundation was leveled and all traces of the old church were gone. Over 100 years later, a new church was built on the island at a more central location, about to the west of the old church site.

History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the 1270s when King Magnus determined that there would be a new church built in Stavanger that was dedicated to St. Peter (in addition to the already existing Stavanger Cathedral). The new church stood a short distance east of the cathedral on a ridge east of Skolebekken. Some time later, the king donated the church to a hospital and it became a hospital church. The local bishop also gifted some land to the hospital church and built a house for the priest and a servant. The hospital church was in use throughout the middle ages and records in the 1740s show that the hospital was still in use. It included the church and several small houses that housed the patients. By the 1800s, the city of Stavanger had grown considerably and in need of a new church, so the old church and hospital were closed and a new, much larger church was built.

Antiquity has been reimagined in many ways and these recreations have been met with great public success regardless of their individual achievements. The plot lines of epic poetry are even more appealing with their enthralling battles, heroic characters, monsters, and gods. And now, with modern technology and computer-generated imagery (CGI), our ability as a society to recreate Greek mythology on screen has improved greatly. As a scholar of Homer put it, > \\"At the beginning of literature, when heroic poetry reach society as a > whole...society listened; in the twentieth century society views... the > modern heroic medium is film, and not necessarily the productions that are > held in highest critical regard.\\"  Homer's Iliad  The ancient Greek epic poem the Iliad (·º∏ŒªŒπŒ¨œÇ) details the final year of the decade-long Trojan War. The war began due to divine interaction with mortals: Eris, personification of strife and discord, presented a golden apple to the goddesses Aphrodite, Athena and Hera but instructed that only the fairest of them could keep it. Zeus sends the three women to Paris, the prince of Troy, who decides to award the apple to Aphrodite, who promises to make the beautiful Helen ‚Äì wife of Greek King Menelaus ‚Äì his wife. Paris' taking of Helen begins the fighting between the Greeks and Trojans. Although the initial rivalry exists between King Menelaus and Paris, the epic poem highlights the argument between Greek hero Achilles and the Greek King Agamemnon, Achilles' inner turmoil about whether or not he wants to engage in the fighting, and the overall heroic desire for kleos (Œ∫ŒªŒ≠ŒøœÇ, \\"glory, fame\\") and eventual nostos (ŒΩœåœÉœÑŒøœÇ, \\"homecoming\\"). = Helen of Troy (1956) = Helen of Troy is a 1956 epic film based on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Filmed in parts of Rome, the film retells the story of the Trojan War, despite some major changes from the Iliad storyline. = Troy (2004) = Troy is an American epic adventure war film directed by Wolfgang Peterson. Based on Homer's Iliad, the film describes the story of the Trojan War following the attack of Troy by Greek forces as well as the stories of those involved. Although the Iliad describes the story of the rivalry between Achilles and Agamemnon in the ninth year, Troy tells the story of the entire decade-long war. The film's ending is not taken from the Iliad but from Virgil's Aeneid, showing Hector‚Äôs death and funeral instead. The film‚Äôs cast includes actors Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, and Eric Bana.  Homer's Odyssey  Another Homeric epic often used in modern film, the Odyssey (·ΩàŒ¥œçœÉœÉŒµŒπŒ±) serves as a sort of sequel to the Iliad. The poem narrates the journey home (or nostos) of Greek hero Odysseus after ten years of fighting in the Trojan War. Like the Iliad, the poem begins in medias res, or \\"in the middle of things,\\" beginning = Ulysses (1954) = Ulysses is a fantasy-adventure film based on Homer's Odyssey. The film tells the story of Ulysses‚Äô attempt to return home after the Trojan War, as well as the adventures that ensue. In the film, actor Silvana Mangano plays both Penelope, the wife of Ulysses as well as the sorceress, Circe. The 1954 film also features actors Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn. Ulysses was a tremendous success which later led to the production of the film Hercules in 1958, which was credited with igniting the Italian sword- and-sandal craze in the 1960s. = The Odyssey (1997) = The Odyssey is a British-American fantasy-adventure television series based on Homer's ancient Greek epic poem, The Odyssey. The miniseries won a 1997 Emmy Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe. The two-part NBC miniseries was filmed in Malta, Turkey, parts of England, as well as places around the Mediterranean where the story took place.  Apollonius Rhodes' Argonautika  = Jason and the Argonauts (1963) = Jason and the Argonauts is an American-British fantasy film made in 1963. Known for its fantasy creatures and iconic fight scenes, the film was released by Columbia Pictures in association with Morningside Productions. The film tells the story of the Greek hero as he leads a team of adventurers in a quest for the legendary Golden Fleece. = Hercules (1958) = Hercules is an Italian epic fantasy based upon both Hercules and the Quest for the Golden Fleece myths. The film's screenplay is based loosely upon the myths of Hercules and the Greek epic poem Argonautika by Apollonius of Rhodes. Hercules tells the tale of the Greek hero as he sails with the Argonauts, experiencing adventure and romance.

Toronto Theatres and the Golden Age of the Silver Screen. Charleston: The History Press, 2014. History Odeon Cinemas was founded in 1928 by Oscar Deutsch in Brierley Hill, England. In 1938, the company was bought by J. Arthur Rank, and shortly after this time, a Canadian arm of the business was opened, called Odeon Theatres Canada. Toronto's first Odeon theatre was the Odeon Fairlawn, located at 3320 Yonge Street, and was also designed by Jay English. The Odeon Fairlawn opened on 14 August 1947. A year later, Odeon began construction on a new flagship theatre which was designed by English. The Odeon Theatre Toronto contained 2,318 seats, a restaurant, and Odeon's Canadian offices. The theatre opened on 9 September 1949 with the North- American premiere of Oliver Twist.https://tayloronhistory.com/2013/08/09/torontos-great-old-theatresthe- odeon-carlton/ The screening was attended by Patricia Roc and Trevor Howard, the posters and newspaper ads boasting that it was, ‚ÄúThe Showplace of the Dominion.‚Äù It contained a restaurant on the mezzanine level, the first theatre-restaurant in Canada. In 1956, the theatre's name was changed to the Odeon Carlton, which it would remain until its closure. By the early 1970s, the cinema was struggling financially. For a brief period, the city of Toronto considered purchasing it as a home for the Canadian Opera Company.

Durum wheat semolina or flour, common farina or flour, or combination of both is mixed with water and eggs (for egg noodles) and other optional ingredients (like spinach, tomato, herbs, etc.). Usually 25‚Äì30 kg of water is added per 100 kg of semolina. The amounts are measured by computerized dispensers. The mixture is then kneaded by auger extruder equipped with mixing paddles and kneading blades to obtain a homogeneous mass, and after that is extruded through various shaped dies. Drying process begins immediately after the products are shaped to prevent deformation and sticking. The pastas are dried completely in drying chambers and stabilized, then ready for packaging. In modern factories, dry pasta is processed using automatic continuous lines.  Mixing In this level wheat semolina and water are mixed by the ratio of 3 to 1. Water should be pure, with no off-flavor and suitable for drinking. Its temperature is about 35-45 ¬∞C to help speed up absorption. For egg noodles, eggs are added in the form of fresh eggs, frozen eggs, dry eggs, egg yolks or dry egg solids. If eggs are added to the mixture, the amount of water is modified. Adding egg improves the nutritional quality and richness of the pasta. Disodium phosphate is also added to reduce the cooking time. Mixing the semolina and water takes place in two stages. First, the ingredients are measured and added to a pre-mixer, and then they are transferred to a mixing chamber which finalizes the mixing process and produces a homogeneous mass. =Measuring the raw material= The exact amount of raw materials is very important. Semolina dosing is done by two methods: volumetric feed (measurement by volume), and gravimetric feed (measurement by weight). In volumetric feed, a specific volume of semolina is measured by variable speed screws or rotary air-lock valves. This method is not very accurate since the amount depends on the density of the semolina. In gravimetric feed, semolina is weighed by a variable speed transport system, which is equipped with a device measuring the flow. Although this method is more accurate, it is more expensive and needs to be isolated. There are different ways to determine the flow in gravimetric feeds: Conveyor Belt Feeds: in which one specific portion of the belt is weighed and the speed of the belt is used to calculate the semolina flow. Loss-in Weight Feeds: in which the change in weight of the hopper which the semolina is poured from indicates the semolina flow. Slanted Surface System: in which the movements of variable speed extraction elements (like screws and bolts) are measured by the electronic devices and are converted to the semolina flow. The exact amount of water needed for the dough depends on the final shape of the pasta. Long pastas should have less moisture content (and therefore less water) so they will be able to stretch during the extrusion. Short pastas need less moisture content due to rapid cutting. Various dosing systems are used to pump the water to the mixture. The most common ones are piston pumps in which the water flow rate is controlled by adjusting the piston stroke, screw feeder, and gear and lobe pumps where the speed of the rotation determines the water flow. In more advanced systems, electronic devices are used to regulate the water flow. =Pre-mixer= The measured amounts of water and semolina are mixed together in pre-mixer to form a crumbly dough. The traditional type of pre-mixer is a trough with a cylindrical section inside which rotates a mixing shaft with blades. More advanced systems use a high-speed (centrifuge) pre-mixer in which water and semolina are sprayed into the chamber, so that each particle of semolina absorbs the correct amount of water. =Final mixing= The final mixer is a trough with shafts which are equipped with mixing blades. Both shafts and blades are made of stainless steel. The shafts run at a low speed (70 rpm) to mix the raw ingredients into a dough. This process usually takes 10‚Äì20 minutes. Some mixers work under atmospheric pressure and others under vacuum. If vacuum is used, the mixture goes directly into the extrusion chamber. When the mixer works under atmospheric pressure, a vacuum unit (vacuum mixer) conveys the mixture to the extrusion chamber. Extrusion Extrusion is the process of kneading and shaping at the same time and in the matter of a few minutes. This process takes place in an extruder which is a grooved extrusion cylinder equipped with an extrusion worm which is a shaft with deep thread around its core. The extrusion worm kneads and moves the dough forward and presses it through the dies in the head of the extruder. The longitudinal grooves in the cylinder reduce the friction and improve the movement of the dough. Both the worm and the cylinder are made of stainless steel, but the worm has a Teflon coating to decrease friction. The temperature of the dough should remain between 40-45 ¬∞C. If the temperature exceeds 50 ¬∞C the gluten network would be damaged, which has a negative effect on the quality of pasta. Since extra heat is generated by pressure and friction, there are water jackets around the cylinder and head. A large amount of water with high speed and temperature of 38-40 ¬∞C is circulated in jackets. The cylinder also has an air vacuum chamber, which removes air bubbles from the dough before extruding. Otherwise small bubbles will form in the pasta and decreases the mechanical strength which cause breakage from hours to days after drying. The air also oxidizes the carotenoid or xanthophyll, which results in a white, chalky appearance of the pasta. Forming There are different types and shapes of dies to form various shapes of pasta. Generally, pastas are categorized into two large groups: long pasta (like spaghetti, fettuccine, linguine, etc.) and short pasta (like elbow-shaped macaroni, penne, shells, etc.). Circular dies with rotating blades underneath them are used for short products, where long rectangular dies form the long products. The dies are made of Teflon-coated bronze. The extruder pushes the dough through the dies and blades or trimmers cut the dough in the desired length. Various patents cover machinery for extruding pasta of different shapes. Drying Drying is one of the most difficult and critical parts of making pasta. If the pasta dries too fast, it may crack during or after the drying process and acquire a poor appearance and lowered mechanical strength. If the pasta dries too slowly, it may spoil and become moldy. Thus, the drying process must be carefully executed in order to avoid the two aforementioned consequences. When the pasta leaves the dies it has the moisture content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried pasta is about 12%, in order for the pasta to be rigid and have a long storage life. The drying process is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, pasta is exposed to hot air to dehydrate the pasta. ‚ÄúPre-drying‚Äù starts immediately after extrusion where the pasta hardens on the outside but still soft on the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole drying time, and one third of the excess moisture is lost in this stage. ‚ÄúFinal drying‚Äù removes most of the moisture and gives the pasta a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing helps the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through the pasta and prevents cracking. =Long pasta drying= Dried pappardelle. The spreader hangs the strands of long pastas on the metal sticks where heated air flow is blown to prepare the product for high temperature. Pre-dryer reduces the moisture quickly (from 30% to 18%) in about an hour. Heat is produced by hot water radiators and centrifugal fans. For the first phase of the finish drying, product goes into a dryer with multi rows of hot water circulation plates. This phase decreases high rate of moisture and pasteurized the product. In the second phase warm air are blown to the product in an isolated multi-tier dryer and removes all the excess moisture. =Short pasta drying= Short pasta pieces fall on the shaker conveyor and powerful hot air is blown to them immediately after the extrusion. This reduces the moisture content by 5% and prevents the pieces from sticking and flattening. Shaker then carries the product through tiers with dry hot air and buckets collect the pasta and spread them on the upper tier of the multi-tier drying unit. This unit has four areas which periods of intense moisture extraction alternately followed by periods of rest occur at eight drying/stabilizing cycle in total. Process ends in cold air chamber for stabilizing. Packaging There are two main packaging systems for dried pasta: cellophane bags which are moisture-proof, easy to use in automatic machines, but difficult to stack, and boxes which are easy to stack and print advertising, and protect the fragile pastas. In packaging line the product is first scaled, then sealed in the package, detected for open flap and metals, double-checked the weight and last packed in large cases. Long pasta packaging: First the product is weighed by about five scales on a packaging line, then transferred to mechanical buckets which are fitted to the opening of the cartons. The system which is used for long pasta packaging is called horizontal cartoner in which buckets and cartons are both move forward on the packaging line and pasta is poured to the cartons by a mechanical pushing device from the bucket. The cartons then are closed and sealed. Short pasta packaging: The process of packaging for short pasta are similar to those used for long pasta except that vertical cartoner is used in which the scaling unit is located over the cartoner and weighed pasta is dropped to the passing cartons using only gravity. Flexible poach packaging: Both long and short pasta can be packed in flexible plastic packaging materials. The system is called standard form/fill/seal system which is similar to carton packaging. Plastic overwrapping packaging: The weighed product is manually placed onto a shallow rigid plastic tray and a plastic film is wrapped around the tray and overwrap the package. It then passes a heat tunnel which causes the film to shrink around the pasta.

It is located on Piazza Ascanio Condivi. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Gregory the Great and to Saint Margaret. It was formerly the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Ripatransone but is now a co-cathedral in the Diocese of San Benedetto del Tronto-Ripatransone-Montalto. History and decoration The main layout of the cathedral was erected between 1597 and 1623 by the architect Giuseppe Guerra. The octagonal tiburium (corridor across base of cupola drum) dates to 1786, the Neoclassical fa√ßade to 1842, while the bell- tower was built from 1884 to 1902. The architect of the latter was F. Vespignani. The interior was frescoed in the 1950s by the brothers Michelangelo and Marcantonio Bedini. The spandrels depict the four evangelists. while in the dome are the four cardinal virtues. They also painted the apse frescoes. The wooden pulpit with panels depicting the five glorious mysteries was carved by D. Bonfini of Patrignone. The apse has wooden choir stalls (1620) by Agostilio Evangelisti. The main altar has two paintings, a 17th-century canvas depicting San Gregorio Magno and an 18th- century Nativity. Among other works in the church are a polychrome wooden crucifix putatively donated by Pope Pius V in 1571 and attributed to Giovanni Battista Casignola. There is also an altarpiece by Orazio Gentileschi. There are three canvases depicting the Madonna and Child, St Peter, St Roch, St Antony of Padua, and John the Baptist (1579) by Simone de Magistris; a Carlo Borromeo (1623) attributed to Alessandro Turchi; and an altarpiece S. Ciannavei di Ascoli Piceno (active 18th‚Äì19th centuries). The musical organ (1783) was made by the Venetian Gaetano Callido. It was originally made for the Church of the Magdalene (Chiesa della Maddalena) of the Franciscans. From the cathedral one can enter the Diocesan Sanctuary of the Madonna, known also as the Sanctuary of San Giovanni (patroness of the city since 1893). The sanctuary was erected in 1846‚Äì58 by design of G. Carducci of Fermo, and it houses four statues by Luigi Fontana. The aedicule, designed by Francesco Vespignani in 1881, houses the venerated Simulacro (1620), a work of S. Sebastiani. The crypt of the cathedral has a polychrome ceramic crucifix by Giuseppe Marinucci.Comune of Ripatransone, tourism entry.

HarveyCordelia Adelaide Harvey (1824-1895) is most well known for her advocacy for Wisconsin Union soldiers as an American Civil War nurse. Following her involvement in the war, she took on the challenge of finding homes for children of fallen soldiers.  Early life  Born on December 27, 1824, as Cordelia Adelaide Perrine, she grew up in Barre, New York. In 1842 she moved with her family to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where they owned a prosperous farm. It was there that she taught school until 1845, when she met fellow teacher Louis P. Harvey. The two were married that same year, and briefly moved to Clinton Junction, Wisconsin, where Louis Harvey owned and operated a county store. Their next home was in Rock County, where they had one daughter who died in infancy. Once Louis was elected secretary of state in 1859, they moved to Madison, Wisconsin. Cordelia became the 7th First Lady of Wisconsin when her husband was elected governor in 1861. After only 94 days in office, he drowned on April 19, 1862, in the Tennessee River while visiting wounded soldiers from Wisconsin in the South. The last letter Cordelia received from her husband, dated two days before his death, he wrote, \\"Yesterday was the day of my life. Thank God for the impulse that brought me here. I am well, and have done more good by coming, than I can well tell you.\\" Cordelia received the devastating news while aiding a destitute family in Madison.  Wisconsin Angel  Following the death of her husband, Cordelia decided she must finish the work he had begun with wounded soldiers. It was at this time she was appointed an agent of the Western Sanitary Committee at St. Louis. In this new position, she visited Union Military Hospitals along the Mississippi River and Wisconsin Regiment Hospitals. At each stop, she would send for supplies to treat the numerous needs of her patients. On one of her tours, she caught camp fever and had to return north to recover. After a quick recovery, Harvey would not be dissuaded in her conviction that wounded soldiers should have the same chance to recover in their home state. She was met with resistance, as army harbored the belief that soldiers would desert if they left the camps. Harvey argued that the soldiers were more likely to die, than to leave. With the humid, disease-ridden air, ill-staffed hospitals, and insufficient food the south proved to be a death sentence for most. Harvey traveled to the White House to speak with President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton on the matter, but they refused to alter their procedures. It was not until her fifth visit that she was finally able to persuade them to authorize the construction of hospitals away from the front. Three hospitals were built in Wisconsin as a result of her efforts- one in Milwaukee, another in Prairie du Chien, and the final one in Madison, which was named Harvey United States Hospital. When she returned to the front, she was recognized by the black cape she often wore. She was referred to as the \\"Wisconsin Angel\\" by soldiers, both Union and Confederate alike. Soldiers' Orphans Home, formerly Harvey Hospital in Madison Just a few years after the war, the book Woman's Work in the Civil War: A Record of Heroism, Patriotism and Patience in which Harvey is recognized, \\"In years to come, the war-scarred veteran will recount to listening children around the domestic hearth, along with many a thrilling deed of valor performed by his own right arm, the angel visits of this lady to his cot, when languishing with disease, or how, when ready to die, her intercessions secured him a furlough, and sent him home to feel the curative power of his native air and receive the care of loving hands and hearts.\\" The Harvey Hospital in Madison had treated over 630 patients by the time the war ended. Once the war ended, Harvey took it upon herself to find homes for the children who lost fathers on the battlefield. When the Harvey hospital closed in 1865, she decided it was perfectly suited for a children's home. She convinced the government to purchase the building for $10,000. Through private donations, she furnished and operated the home, opening its doors on January 10th, 1866. The building housed dormitories as well as a classroom for 150 students, and an infirmary. Harvey began with 84 children as the superintendent, and had as many as 300 at certain times. As the children were placed in foster care the numbers dropped to just 40, and the home was closed in 1875. In the nine years it was open, 683 children between the ages of 9 and 14 called it home.  Final years  After the home closed, she married Reverend Albert Chester in 1876, and lived with him in Buffalo, New York until his death. She then moved back to her and Louis' home in Wisconsin, where she taught Sunday School. On February 27, 1895, Cordelia died at the age of 70. She was buried next to her first husband in Madison. Today, there is a historical marker near Kenosha that reads \\"Cordelia A. P. Harvey: Wisconsin women rallied to support the Union during the Civil War.

Later she was owned by other companies, including Halliburton Canada. She is currently beached on the banks of the Mackenzie south of Inuvik, near the beginning of the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road. GSI Mariner was built in 1971 in Edmonton, and taken up in sections to Great Slave Lake later that year to be launched onto the Mackenzie. GSI ran surveys and did seismic research with her during the summers and beached her over winters, voyages that continued as Halliburton took over GSI and then after the company was reincorporated. Whether she will sail again is not known. Characteristics GSI Mariner is built on a steel hull laid in carvel style. She is long and deep with a beam. She has a gross tonnage of 308 with a net tonnage of 115. In the engine room power is provided by two diesel engines. Together they deliver to the twin-screw propellers. The vessel can make .

History Davey Einarsson, a GSI executive and lifelong employee of the oilfield services company, returned to Canada from Libya after the 1969 coup d'√©tat that brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. He was assigned to the company's Arctic operations, off the coasts of Alaska and Canada in the Beaufort Sea. At the time the company had only one boat to serve its clients, the MV Grebe, a modified former submarine chaser. He decided the company needed its own bigger and newer boat. During the winter of 1970 Alum Construction of Edmonton built GSI Mariner in sections. The following summer the company placed those sections on trucks and took them up from Alberta to Hay River, Northwest Territories, where they were welded together and launched into the waters of Great Slave Lake. From there her maiden voyage took her up the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean doing seismic analysis. The company continued to operate during summers in the 1970s and '80s, even as GSI became part of Halliburton. In 1982 its encounter with a pack of bowhead whales while taking seismic shots off the coast of Alaska was used in scientific research suggesting the species is quite tolerant of offshore oil and gas exploration taking place near its habitat. During the winters she was moored in ice near Tuktoyaktuk, where the Mackenize drains into the Arctic. By the late 1990s she became the property of an Inuvik man and was beached on the east shore of the river's eastern channel south of Inuvik, where the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road begins. In that capacity she was often seen as a landmark on the second season of the History Channel series Ice Road Truckers, which took place in the area.

(2010). In their July, 2009 journal, Camilo Jos√© Cela University compared his works to that of Truffaut and Comencini.http://www.ucjc.edu/files/pdf/press/resumendeprensa7-8jul09.pdf He originally started in the arts by writing and performing his own musical compositions. The transition from music to film came from his love for combining and juxtaposing the two art forms in order to make something greater than the two by themselves. Since those first small scenes, he has gone on to release ten feature films and numerous publicities, videoclips and short films. All of the movies, despite their different plots, characters, and other thematic elements, share the commonality of confronting moral issues without yielding to the conventions of political correctness.  Early life  Noel was born in 1968 in Beirut. His mother was Australian and his father was of French and British descent. He is fluently triligual.\\"Con ni√±os actores locales se viene filmando ‚ÄúLimbo‚Äù: una pel√≠cula sobre vampiros\\" His family was well-to-do but \\"nomadic resulting in him attending 8 different schools in as many countries.http://www.artsploitationfilms.com/film/children-of-the-night/ He has a BA in music and education from the University of York, specializing in soundtrack composition, having studied amongst others with Wilfred Josephs.http://www.lebrijadigital.com/web/component/content/article/268-uncategorised/1438-mas- de-400-personas-acudieron-a-los-dos-pases-con-que-conto-el-preestreno-de- brecha-de-ivan-noel and began his career as professor in the field of music, composing and giving concerts as a solo classical guitarist and piano accompanist in Paris.  Film making  Noel entered the audiovisual world first through the production of short films. He won important prizes in Europe both for his photography (Best New Artists at the Petit Palais‚Äô ‚ÄòSalon d‚ÄôAutomn‚Äô exhibitions, Paris), but also his compositions (finalist winner of the British Songwriting competition in 2006.http://www.artsploitationfilms.com/film/children-of-the-night In 2006 he decided to sell his house to finance the filming of his first feature film, In Your Absence (2008). About that film he said he is in debt to the realism of director Ken Loach . This film was shot between Jerez and the Sierra de C√°diz. It was a low budget production made with unknown actors, but it woke the interest of critics. The film was featured in several festivals, including Vancouver, Palm Springs, Chicago, Bahamas, Athens, etc. In Vancouver the film finished fifth out of more than 200 films. Vanguard International Cinema distributed the film in North America.https://www.amazon.com/EN-AUSENCIA- GONZALO-SANCHEZ-SALAS/dp/B001TK2986 The film has not been released or distributed in Spain. For the next project, the director moved to a town of Seville, Lebrija. He lived there for a year to study the local people so that cast them correctly. For funding, Noel, lacking a budget, raised the money through donations. He arranged free rentals of shooting locations and the actors volunteered to work for free. It was recorded during the summer of 2008, and was released in 2009 with the title of Gap later to be changed to Brecha. It opened to small premieres in Spain, and was received with praise by its audiences.http://www.lebrijadigital.com/web/component/content/article/268-uncategorised/1438-mas- de-400-personas-acudieron-a-los-dos-pases-con-que-conto-el-preestreno-de- brecha-de-ivan-noelhttp://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-andalucia- sevilla-teatro-juan-bernabe-abanderara-preestreno-brecha-film-rodado-lebrija- frances-ivan-noel-20090225133337.html In 2010 he released ¬°Primaria!, his third feature film. He shot it in the school San Francisco de Paula in Seville. He spent a year there teaching the children art. Since it was the first time in film making history that the same teacher of the children was also their director in a film, Noel believed that this would increase the naturalness in the representation of scenes by the child actors, creating a very favorable context to get real emotions and situations experienced. In this sense, Noel likes to say this film is \\"a story with children where nothing is invented, even the most unlikely thing.\\"\\"Ivan Noel graba su tercer largometraje en el sevillano colegio San Francisco de Paula\\" Noel defines the film as \\"a comedy about the bowels of the primary starring three students, Jose Joaquin, Carlos and Carmen.\\" The film also portrays the life of the faculty, focusing mainly on three of them. Noel manages to convey the personal lives of these teachers beyond their work without reaching the use of narration. With Vuelve, commercially released in 2012, Noel moves into the horror genre. Filmed in Argentina , it is about a boy who loses his mother under strange circumstances. She communicates with him from beyond the grave, seeking a reunion. The film premiered on October 12, 2011 at the Festival of Unusual Cinema of Buenos Aires.http://www.asalallena.com.ar/festivales- all/noticias/programacion-vii-festival-de-cine-inusual-de-bs- as/http://festivaldecineinusual.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/horarios-vii-festival- de-cine-inusual.html His next project, Limbo was released in 2013. One reviewer noted: They Returned turns on the strange disappearance of three children from their small town, and their reappearance three days later in a strange state. When asked about how he responds to the controversy surrounding his films he said: Ivan Noel runs the film production company Noel Films, who, aside from the feature films listed below, have produced a dozen commercials and as many videoclips, including one for the Icelandic group Sigur Ros.

It was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in June 2013 to fill the planned premiere date of Oliver Knussen's then delayed Cello Concerto. The work was first performed in the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, on October 18, 2013 by the Finnish cellist Anssi Karttunen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen. Composition The concerto is composed in three numbered movements and has a duration of roughly 20 minutes. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo cello and an orchestra comprising two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, trumpet, trombone, and strings. Reception The cello concerto has been positively received by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times remarked of the work, \\"The solo cello writing has a slightly autumnal flavor ‚Äî maybe too autumnal for a vital 55-year-old composer (he was born three days before Salonen). But this is also brilliantly mature cello writing that takes full advantage of Kartunnen's natural grace unruffled by even the most extreme virtuosic demands.\\" He added, \\"Mainly, Lindberg exploits the cellist's mastery of nuance. The orchestra is of modest size (no percussion). Unlike in his first concerto, where cellist and orchestra are in fierce contrast, Lindberg removes conflict by painting with glowing instrumental colors an exotic sonic landscape around which the cello dives and dances and exults.\\" Theodore Bell of Culture Spot LA called it \\"a wonderful concerto\\" and opined, \\"Its intensity derived from the occasional expressionist motifs mixed in with delightful tonal snippets. Themes would bounce back and forth between the orchestra and Karttunen, but the orchestral writing was relatively conventional in comparison to his endless variations of timbre and effect.\\" Andrew Mellor of Gramophone similarly wrote, \\"Where Lindberg's First Cello Concerto is a more thick and integrated work than its successor, the Second varies its moods more despite restrained scoring. It has moments of blossoming lyricism, and greater spread and intensity in its solo writing, particularly in the cadenzas.\\" References Category:Concertos by Magnus Lindberg Category:2013 compositions Lindberg 2 Category:Music commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic ","title":"Cello Concerto No. 2 (Lindberg)"},{"id":"50405540","text":"XHJP-FM is a community radio station on 107.9 FM in Santa Mar√≠a Tlahuitoltepec, Oaxaca.

As a historic street and part of a historic precinct it has a number of listed heritage buildings that look out over the Albany Harbour, including Argyle House. Stirling Terrace has appeared on maps of the town since 1834 and is named after James Stirling, the first Governor of Western Australia. Corner of York Street and Stirling Terrace in 2016 The 1835 Hillman survey plan established the road as the prime location in the town, with a variety of social, commercial, leisure, institutional and service functions. The town jetty and railway station both had frontage along Stirling Terrace making it a transport hub of the town. The Empire theatre was also built along Stirling Terrace. Royal George Hotel in 2006 During the 1870s and 1880s much of the frontage along Stirling Terrace to the east of York Street was filled. John Moir built a store, the Argyll buildings were erected, and a branch of the National Bank (known as Vancouver House) was constructed in 1881. Alexander Moir established Glasgow House and Edinburgh House in 1882, the Union Bank of Australia building (known as Albany House) was built in 1884, followed by the Royal George Hotel in 1885 and then the White Star Hotel. The Commercial Bank building, later a branch of the Western Australian Bank, was built in 1891. The 1897 development of Jubilee Gardens along the slope between the upper and lower terrace made the area created a recreational centre for the area. The Jubilee Bandstand, found within the gardens, was opened in 1898. Albany Courthouse London Hotel on the left and Albany House on the right It was the main street of early Albany and by 1900 four hotels, three banks, three department stores, shipping agencies as well as numerous other small businesses were found along the Terrace. The laying of the foundation stone for the Albany Courthouse was held in 1896, with the building completed and opened in 1898. The London Hotel was built along Stirling Terrace in 1909. It was built on the site of the Chusan Hotel which had stood on the site since 1849 and was rebuilt in 1871. The Empire Buildings were constructed on the corner of Stirling Terrace and York Street in 1912, comprising a 1,000-seat theatre and shops. To the west of the intersection with York Street is the Albany Courthouse. To the east of the intersection, there are a number of heritage properties including the Jubilee Bandstand and Albany Post Office on the southern side of the terrace and the White Star Hotel on the northern side.

Haines arrived in York in 1905 where he became very successful at selling shoes. Referred to as the \\"Shoe Wizard\\", Haines shared his wealth with his community and employees. A local residential subdivision and adjacent road are named after him. His most evident legacy is the Haines Shoe House in Hallam, which is readily visible from U.S. Route 30 east of York. Early life Haines was born in Old Washington, Ohio on March 5, 1875. His father died a few months later. His widowed mother, Elizabeth Ann Morrison Haines, changed his name to that of his father. The family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1882 and lived above a store she owned on 11th Street SE; it was there that Haines worked for much of his early life. The store's profits helped pay for his education and Haines enrolled at Maryland Agricultural College (now known as the University of Maryland) in 1892. That same year, his mother built a much larger department store in Washington, advertised as \\"the largest store in the world, built, owned and controlled by a woman\\". Haines left college in 1894 to begin his adult life. After his mother denied his request at age 28 to become a business partner, he went to California and was a sales representative for several clothing stores in the West. Becoming engaged, Haines moved to Ohio to get married. When the relationship was broken off, he began a bicycle trip back to Washington to get his old job back. Haines later summarized his status then as \\"single, penniless and alone\\". Business 1920s hand fan promoting Haines' business Arriving in York, Pennsylvania in 1905 ‚Äì the year he turned 30 ‚Äì Haines' bicycle broke down. He reportedly sold his engagement ring, bought ten pairs of shoes, and sold them at a farmers market. Haines initially rented a 3rd-floor apartment at 473 W. Market Street. After borrowing money to begin a business, he was bankrupt within two years. He then obtained a consignment of shoes for $127 from the local D.S. Peterman & Co. warehouse. With a combination of hard work and gimmickry, Haines became very successful in the shoe business. A particular gimmick for which he was known was his use of a customized Ford as a mobile retail store, which he would drive to the outer edges of town to show his products. By December 1917, Haines had saved enough to buy of what became a farm east of York in Springettsbury Township. Named Haines Acres, along what would later be named Haines Road, he built his home on the farm in 1922, the year he accumulated 30 stores. By 1931, Haines had the largest shoe store chain in the United States, and there were 50 Haines Shoe Co. stores across Pennsylvania and northern Maryland by 1935. Six of Haines' stores were within the city of York (117 South George, 231 North George, 101 East Market, 241 West Market, 725 East Market, and 13 West Philadelphia Streets), with three of them in buildings he owned, all designed by John A. Dempwolf. The three-story \\"Haines Building\\", opened in 1915 on North George Street, also served as headquarters for his shoe company; it was torn down in the 1960s for off-street parking spaces. He built another four- story Haines Building at 101 East Market Street in 1922 and sold it in 1954 after having donated the shoe store space to organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Bundles for Britain; as of April 2017, the building was being renovated for business use with ten new apartments on the upper floors. Haines had the five-story building on West Philadelphia Street built in 1925 as a 45-room hotel; he converted it to an apartment building in 1940 and it endures as of 2016 with its \\"Haines\\" name across the original main entrance threshold. Philanthropy and legacy A depiction of Haines in the shoe house's door glass Haines regularly gave back to his customers and community. In 1922, Haines ran as the Republican candidate from Pennsylvania's 22nd District to the U.S. House of Representatives, though he lost to Democratic challenger Samuel F. Glatfelter. =Yorkshire= In October and November 1924, Haines bought of land which became known as Yorkshire Ranch. After the Great Depression in 1929, he built streets through this ranch land and offered free housing lots to those unemployed who agreed to build homes there, as he began developing the Yorkshire neighborhood. Haines built a 2-room brick schoolhouse in the development in 1930, initially leased for $1 per year to the township's Independent School District. Expanded over the years since, these original school buildings were torn down to create playgrounds for the new Yorkshire Elementary School build adjacently in 2010. In the late 1920s, he donated a plot of land which became part payment for the first permanent Springetts Fire Company station. Haines hosted a celebration in September 1938 to commemorate his 33 years in York. Applying his \\"Shoe Wizard\\" nickname, Haines placed a half-page ad in newspapers throughout York County announcing a week-long series of evening entertainment for the public at his expense. =Boy Scouts= Haines owned of fields and woodlands in eastern York County and beginning in 1941, he hosted a special \\"Haines Safari\\" gathering of area Boy Scouts there about every five years to celebrate his birthday. After the fifth such gathering in 1960, Haines donated the land to the York-Adams Area Council of Boy Scouts. Known as \\"Wizard Ranch\\", the scouts have year-round camping on the grounds and continue to organize \\"Wizard Safari\\" events there every four to five years, drawing thousands of attendees. Haines received the Silver Antelope Award from the scouts in 1944. Haines Shoe House in 1999 =Shoe House= It was in 1948 that he began construction of the Haines Shoe House in Hallam with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. Via a newspaper ad in July 1949, he publicly thanked 20 local businesses that had a part in the project. Its exterior modeled after a work boot, Haines lived in the house briefly before using it to host older couples and honeymooners affiliated with his shoe stores, providing them with a free weekend in the house, the service of his staff, and a free pair of shoes. The house was offered to the public for rent in the 1950s. =Alma mater= In late 1948, Haines \\"took a very active part in the Chapter meeting of Agricultural alumni\\" at his Maryland alma mater and stated \\"he would personally pay the subscription cost for any agricultural alumnus who did not feel financially able\\" to request the alumni publication. =Haines Acres= Haines' former home, now part of Eastminster Presbyterian Church Haines sold his York home to a local surgeon in 1952. The surrounding farm was sold to local real estate firm Epstein & Sons in November 1953, and it was developed into the Haines Acres subdivision. He gave $2,500 to the Boy Scouts in exchange for the housing development being named after him. The farm buildings were ultimately demolished and their land became part of the development in the 1970s. Haines' home remains as part of a Presbyterian church at 311 Haines Road. Haines Acres Shopping Center, constructed beginning in 1962 in the southwest corner of the subdivision, also bears his name. =Employees and others= After selling a cattle ranch in South Dakota in 1960, Haines gave his shoe business to 28 key employees. He also gave substantial gifts to farmers of his land, boy and girl scouts, YMCA, YWCA, his church, and York Hospital. Upon dying, Haines gave the Haines Shoe House to his employees. The house has since had a series of owners and is currently a museum and an ice cream and gift shop open from March to October. Personal life Haines married June Brown Irwin (1885‚Äì1951) of Union County in 1909. They had three children: Stanley Emerson (1910‚Äì1966), Mahlon Nathaniel II (1912‚Äì1960), and June Irwin (1916‚Äì1918). Haines married Grace Marianne Churchill of London, England in 1957. In 1953, Haines was featured in the short Paramount film The Spirit of Seventy, which promoted the value of physical exercise. Haines founded a \\"Three Quarter Century Baseball Team\\" for senior citizens in St. Petersburg, Florida, near a winter home he had in Snell Isle. He attributed his own success at the game to staying fit and abstaining from alcohol and tobacco. The film was shown before featured attractions nationally to 1955, and first in York at the Elmwood Theatre. Haines died on October 31, 1962 while under intensive care after collapsing with a \\"heart ailment\\" a few days after undergoing \\"a successful operation\\". In addition to his son Stanley and second wife Grace, he was survived by \\"three grandchildren and a number of nieces and nephews\\".

We proceeded in a direction 35¬∞ west of south; after a mile of ascent over rolling ground, we struck the margin of a vast plain surface extending indefinitely to the southwest, and slightly inclined towards us; after coming about four miles, we met one of the guides, who stated that Leroux was at a stream seven or eight miles more to our right, near the mountain range; that the \\"Mimbres\\" had not been found, &c; I then took his course, southwest, proceeded about five miles, where he bent more to the right, and finally, near a mile, short to the right into a valley where a stream running from the hills and mountains to the right loses itself in the sand. Nearly above is a fringe of timber, cottonwood, ash, &c; The prairie to- day was generally covered thick with large gravel, with intervals of clay, all well covered with grass, both gamma and buffalo, in places quite green and luxuriant. (We come through prairie dog villages, always found with buffalo grass.)\\" :\\"... Just in the camp is apparently the foundation of a house; the stones, though large, are rounded; it rises a foot or two from the ground. Close by, besides fragments of earthen pottery, is a broken mortar of a very hard red stone, resembling a burr stone; all the exterior is apparently in its natural rough state; there seems to be no other similar stone near.\\" :\\"November 15 ‚Äî 8 o'clock, a. m. ‚Äî The guides are behindhand; it rains a little, and there is no fuel at the next camping ground; there being good grass and fuel here, I have reluctantly concluded to lay by to-day; but I have no doubt of its being for the general advantage. Leroux, Mr. Hall, Dr. Foster, the interpreter, Charboneaux, and three Spaniards have gone, and I have urged the necessity of an active and more distant examination of the country.\\" :\\"Evening. ‚Äî It has blown a gale all day, raining, snowing, and shining alternately. It is very cold, although the wind is but little west of southwest. I sent for an ox which was left yesterday, \\"given out,\\" and had it slaughtered and, together with the smallest and poorest beef, issued as a ration; gaining thereby about a third of a ration.

In 1965 they recorded the song \\"There She Goes\\" as Moss & the Rocks for a single released on the local Icon label (later re-recorded in 1966 for Chattahoochee Records). After changing their name to Public Nuisance in 1967, they began to incorporate psychedelic elements into their sound and a series of mostly unreleased songs recorded at various sessions from 1968-1969 that went for years unissued, but finally saw the light of day in 2002 with the release of the Gotta Survive anthology. Since then, their work, both as Moss & the Rocks and Public Nuisance, has attracted the attention of garage rock and psychedelic enthusiasts worldwide. History Public Nuisance formed in Sacramento, California in 1964 as an instrumental surf rock band called the Jaguars, but after the advent of the British Invasion and folk rock they adopted the use of vocals and changed their name to Moss & the Rocks. \\\\- reprinted from article that appeared in the Sacramento News And Review Their lineup consisted of David Houston, their principal songwriter, on guitar, keyboards, harmonica, and vocals, Jim Mathews on guitar, Pat Minter on bass and vocals, and Ron McMaster on drums and vocals. Even when the Jaguars the group were known for their stage antics. David Houston would sometimes smash his guitar on stage, and the group wore hairstyles that were considered extremely long for 1964. The group's manager was Gary Schiro, who had connections in Los Angeles and managed two other local bands, the New Breed and the Oxford Circle. Moss & the Rocks won a battle of the bands contest and were able to gain free recording time at Ikon Studios, a small label in Sacramento, which hosted numerous garage bands in the area. As Moss & the Rocks they recorded the folk rock-influenced single, \\"There She Goes\\" b/w \\"Please Come Back,\\" released on Ikon. The session was engineered by Eirik Wangberg, who was from Norway. Later that year, they re-recorded both tunes for a single released on Chattahoochee Records. In 1967 they changed their name to Public Nuisance. In early 1968 the band recorded a series of demos which for years remained unreleased. These recordings saw the group augment their raw garage rock sound with experimental psychedelic elements. Their lyrics, when not exploring more conventional love themes, saw the band engaging in social commentary that addressed topical concerns of the era. They became a popular live act throughout much of California during this period and opened for the Doors, Buffalo Springfield, Sonny & Cher, as well as the Grateful Dead. Later in 1968, they taped several demos at Fantasy Records in San Francisco, but were not signed to the label. Eventually Gary Schiro arranged a contract with Equinox records, a label run by producer Terry Melcher, who was noted for his work with the Byrds and Paul Revere & the Raiders. The Label was distributed though ABC/Dunhill. At the end of 1968 and the beginning of 1969, they commuted back and forth to-and-from Los Angeles where they recorded an album's worth of songs, but like their previous outings none of the recordings saw release‚Äîin this case because producer Terry Melcher, who had sub-letted houses to director Roman Polanski and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, became emotionally distraught after Polanski's wife Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson, and wished to cease recording commitments he had made with Wilson for Equinox (Wilson had previously socialized with the Manson family), so Melcher closed down the label. Public Nuisance soldiered on and played gigs including several shows at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, but disbanded in 1970. Guitarist David Houston went on to become a producer and played keyboards with the new wave band the Twinkeyz in the late 1970s before going on to produce records by Steel Breeze and Club Nouveau. Bassist Pat Minter died in 1994. Public Nuisance went for years virtually unknown to all but a select few, but in 2002 their complete recordings were compiled by Frantic Records on the double-CD Gotta Survive anthology, which also included their tracks recorded as Moss & the Rocks for Ikon and Chattahoochee. Moss & the Rocks' \\"There She Goes\\" \\"Please Come Back\\" were issued on the CD compilation, The Ikon Records Story - America's #1 Unsung Garage Label 1964-1966, put out by Frantic Records in 2015 and \\"There She Goes\\" appears on Garage Beat '66 Volume 3: Feeling Zero....

This is the result of many years of efforts in Vuƒçedol because its character is classified in the first row of archaeological parks and entered in the archaeological map of this part of Europe. In 2017, Vuƒçedol Culture Museum was the most visited museum in Slavonia and the 7th most visited museum in Croatia.  Archaeological site Vuƒçedol  The Vuƒçedol archaeological site is located on the right bank of the Danube River, four kilometres downriver from Vukovar at the spot where an intermittent watercourse in a loess plateau 25 metres high cut a narrow steep valley on the way towards the river. Both sides along the pass towards the Danube make up the archaeological site, on the left is the Karasoviƒá Vineyard, and on the right is a large complex which include the Streim Vineyard, the Streim Cornfield and artificially separated from them is a little plateau known as Gradac, which with later excavations was confirmed as being the metallurgical and cult centre of the site. Vuƒçedol is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Europe. The first investigations of the site date back to 1897. This attractive location was first inhabited in about 6,000 B.C. at the time of the first farmers, and more or less it was inhabited intensively through the whole of prehistory. The period between 3,350 ‚Äì 2,300 B.C. was the most intensive period of its existence and in that period it was undoubtedly the most significant European centre. Since this was also the time of the early settlements of Troy (Troy I and II) many analogies can also be found with the archaeological material from Vuƒçedol. More precisely, we can also characterise Vuƒçedol as the European Troy by its contemporaneousness, but even more so by the continental significance of the site and its finds. Archaeological excavations to date are able to very precisely reconstruct the daily life and customs of four cultural phenomena which in that time swept through Vuƒçedol (Baden, Kostolac, Vuƒçedol and Vinkovci). It was a turbulent time of the immigration of the first Indo-Europeans and their relationship with the natives, the blending of material cultures and religions. Each of the above-mentioned cultures had its own interesting separate destiny in Vuƒçedol, however the most detailed one able to be reconstructed is the Vuƒçedol which also gave its name to this site. Vuƒçedol reached a real peak in the intensity of settlement right in the period of the Vuƒçedol Culture (3,000 ‚Äì 2,500 B.C.). Excavations show that the culture was literally born in this area and that for a long time it was its most significant centre. This cultural phenomenon at its peak completely or partially covered 14 of today‚Äôs European countries ‚Äì the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Italy, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Albania and one settlement has even been registered in Eastern Greece.

It is, for the most part, a performance technique that can be helpful in loading resources preemptively. HTTP/2 Server Push is not a notification mechanism from server to client. Instead, pushed resources are used by the client when it may have otherwise produced a request to get the resource anyway; this can result in wasted bandwidth if said pushed resources go unused by the client, however.  Basic concept  Consider a website with three resources: index.html, styles.css and script.js. When a user, through their browser, connects to the home page of this website they automatically retrieve index.html. As the browser parses the HTML text in index.html, it finds instructions that will require styles.css and script.js. At that point, the browser will issue requests to get these other two files. To assemble the complete webpage, the browser will stack such requests as it gradually discovers the site's composition. With HTTP/2 Push, the server can take the initiative by having rules that trigger content to be sent even before it is requested. In this example scenario, the server knows that anyone requesting index.html will need styles.css and script.js, so it can push them to the client immediately without waiting for the client to request them. If done correctly, by the time the browser finishes parsing index.html, the transfer of styles.css and script.js would have already started, or even completed, removing the latency of having to request these and wait for them to arrive.  How HTTP/2 PUSH works at a protocol level  Push works over HTTP/2, which at its core is a frames protocol, meaning that information is exchanged in groups of bytes called frames. Additionally, frames are part of streams, and streams are identified by a number. The stream number is present in each frame as a binary field. Streams allow matching requests to responses, e.g. the response to request GET /index.html at stream 3 must also be at stream 3. There are different types of frames, and each has a different function. HTTP/2 has only a few of these types, and we don't need all of them to explain the basics. Here are the ones interesting for this description: * HEADERS frame. As its name implies, this type of frame carries HTTP headers . When sent by the browser to the server, it signals that a request is being made. When sent by the server to the browser, it signals that a response to a previous request or push promise is being sent. * PUSH_PROMISE frame. This frame is sent by the server to the browser to start pushing a resource. It also contains HTTP headers. However, the kind of headers present in a PUSH_PROMISE frame are headers that would normally be present in a request. This is different from the response headers that a server would normally send. The request URL, for example, is present in the PUSH_PROMISE frame as the HTTP/2-specific :path pseudo-header, as is the :authority pseudo-header to indicate a host. Other headers that may be present in a PUSH_PROMISE and that some browsers use are cache headers, for example, if-none-match. * DATA frames. These frames are sent in either direction to carry the actual content of a resource or the contents that the browser POSTs or PUTs to the server. * RST_STREAM frames. These frames serve many purposes. One of them is having the browser signal to the server that a pushed stream is not needed. When the server wants to push a resource, it prepares a PUSH_PROMISE frame, architecting it in the best way possible to seduce the browser into using the pushed contents. Then the server annexes the PUSH_PROMISE frame to the response part of a normal, browser- initiated stream. However, the actual data for the pushed resource is sent in a fresh stream started by the server and thus with an even number. The browser holds the pushed data in a temporary \\"quarantine\\" zone until it decides to use it. Later, every time the browser is going to make an actual request, it examines the contents of any received push promises to see if it is similar enough to the request it wants to make. However, the server need not wait until that moment to start sending data for the promised resource. After the PUSH_PROMISE frame has been sent on the browser-initiated stream, the server can send what would be response headers using a HEADERS frame in the new server-initiated stream, and later it can send the data of the resource using DATA frames. And at any point in time, the browser can interrupt any transfer by using RST_STREAM. Here is how this would work in the previous example. If the server is HTTP/2 PUSH ready, when it receives a request to index.html it can forecast that requests to styles.css and script.js are following close in tail. So it issues push promises to get a bit ahead of events. Here is how things could look, in order of occurrence and making up the stream numbers: * Server receives HEADERS frame asking for index.html in stream 3, and it can forecast the need for styles.css and script.js. * Server sends a PUSH_PROMISE for styles.css and a PUSH_PROMISE for script.js, again in stream 3. These frames are roughly equivalent to a browser's request. * Server sends a HEADERS frame in stream 3 for responding to the request for index.html. * Server sends DATA frame(s) with the contents of index.html, still in stream 3. * Server sends HEADERS frame for the response to styles.css in stream 4 notice the even stream number and then for the response to script.js in stream 6. * Server sends DATA frames for the contents of styles.css and script.js, using their respective stream numbers. Push promises are sent as early as possible so that the browser will have them well ahead of any discoveries. Notice that HTTP headers (specifically Link with the 'preload' keyword) can reveal URLs that the browser needs to fetch, and an eager browser would start asking for the resources upon seeing those headers. Therefore, push promises are best sent before even the response headers of the stream where they are attached.  Implementations  HTTP/2 Server push is being progressively implemented, for example Nginx web server implemented it in version 1.13.9 in February 2018.https://nginx.org/en/CHANGES-1.14  References  Category:Hypertext Transfer Protocol Category:Push technology ","title":"HTTP/2 Server Push"},{"id":"50405952","text":"Major Louis Frederick Knollys, (1847-1922) was the fourth British colonial Inspector-General of Police in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).

It is a first-person adventure horror, designed to be a serious take on ghost hunting and paranormal research, featuring real-world haunted locations. Overview Intrigued by the player's supernatural talent of clairvoyance, a struggling university department asks them to join their secret research team, making them a front-field operative in paranormal investigations. Using a wide range of ghost-hunting gadgets and abilities they will conduct missions to investigate real haunted sites, collect samples and gather evidence. Each mission is an open-ended haunted ground - a playable sandbox with its own story. The university is the player's home base, where their work will be evaluated, results assessed and where they will be briefed for their next mission.  Gameplay  Even though this is a horror game, ghosts won't appear without provocation. It is the player's task to find out how, to meet their objectives. During missions, ambidexterity will be a plus. The player's left hand will operate most of their gadgets and their right will interact with objects around them: turning a doorknob, pushing a door gently ajar, unearthing remains...  Gadgets  *Voice Log Recorder - serves to record and replay comments about objects and situations within a mission. *UV Lamp - reveals what the player's eyes cannot: most importantly, valuable samples of ectoplasm. *Full Spectrum Camera - a tool for obtaining hard evidence of paranormal activity. *EMF (ElectroMagnetic Field) Meter - by zeroing in on energy spikes, the player can detect and track paranormal activity and lead themselves towards items and locations that are important to the ghost they are hunting. *EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) Recorder - captures the voices of ghosts. Recordings are valuable evidence for the player's investigation and will often reveal valuable clues. *Pendulum - used for divination. First it needs to be charged by an object (e.g. a single recovered earring). It can then be used to find an associated object (the missing earring).  Process  Sudden drops in temperature indicate the close proximity of a supernatural presence. The player should keep an eye out for the telltale sign: breath condensation. When the terror gets too intense, the player can press a button to close their eyes for as long as needed. Sometimes, when the player closes their eyes as they touch an object, visions appear. Their clairvoyance allows the player to experience flashbacks associated with an object's history, which may feed the player important information about a ghost‚Äôs past or reveal further clues connected to the investigation. Development and release The game was announced at the Game Developers Session 2015 and was scheduled to be released in Q4 2017. On February 12, 2016, the game was greenlit on Steam and, on April 13, 2016, it went live on Kickstarter. However, according to the game's official website and the Steam Greenlight page, the game has been delayed to Q4 2018. However, no news has been provided by the developers to support that claim. No news about the overall progress of the game has been announced since 2017. As of early 2019 the game has apparently been cancelled after failing to get funding from Crytek.

For example, G_1(E) = \\\\mathbb{P}(E) is the projective bundle of E. In the other direction, a Grassmann bundle is a special case of a (partial) flag bundle. Concretely, the Grassmann bundle can be constructed as a Quot scheme. Like the usual Grassmannian, the Grassmann bundle comes with natural vector bundles on it; namely, there are universal or tautological subbundle S and universal quotient bundle Q that fit into :0 \\\\to S \\\\to p^*E \\\\to Q \\\\to 0. Specifically, if V is in the fiber p‚àí1(x), then the fiber of S over V is V itself; thus, S has rank r = rk(E) and \\\\wedge^r S is the determinant line bundle. Now, by the universal property of a projective bundle, the injection \\\\wedge^r S \\\\to p^* (\\\\wedge^r E) corresponds to the morphism over X: :G_d(E) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\wedge^r E), which is nothing but a family of Pl√ºcker embeddings. The relative tangent bundle TGd(E)/X of Gd(E) is given by :T_{G_d(E)/X} = \\\\operatorname{Hom}(S, Q) = S^{\\\\vee} \\\\otimes Q, which morally is given by the second fundamental form. In the case d = 1, it is given as follows: if V is a finite-dimensional vector space, then for each line l in V passing through the origin (a point of \\\\mathbb{P}(V)), there is the natural identification (see Chern class#Complex projective space for example): :\\\\operatorname{Hom}(l, V/l) = T_l \\\\mathbb{P}(V) and the above is the family- version of this identification.

In addition to her portraits, she is remembered for her many photographs of the city and its surroundings. Early life Born on 9 October 1861 in Ribe, Hauschildt was the daughter of a local grocer, Jess M√∏ler Hauschildt, who died when only 29. Thereafter she spent her infancy with her mother Karen (n√©e Rasmussen) and her two sisters at Dronning Louises B√∏rneasyl, a home for widowed mothers on Puggaardsgade. On completing her schooling at Miss Guldberg's school in Ribe, she worked as an au pair, first in the vicarage of F√•rup near Randers, then with a family in Kolding. Career Always interested in drawing and painting, Hauschildt served an apprenticeship with the Ribe photographer Mathilde Bruun who introduced her to the business. She was also taught by Sophus Juncker-Jensen (1859‚Äì1940) who opened a studio in Copenhagen in 1888, after studying photography in Paris. In 1890, Hauschildt acquired Bruun's studio on All√©en ved Kirkegaarden but moved into larger premises on Dagmarsgade around 1896. In 1904, while Christian IX was in Ribe for the inauguration of the renovated cathedral, Bodel Hauschildt was appointed court photographer. Hauschildt's photographs of the royal family and the restored cathedral were published in Illustreret Tidende. Around 1908, she moved to Aarhus where she opened a studio on Sct Clemenstorv. During that period, she travelled to Rome where she came into contact with two local photographers. On returning to Denmark, she spent more time in Aarhus but in 1920 re-established her business in Ribe. Strongly influenced by her stay in Rome, she decorated her studio in the Italian style, adding pillars, battlements and fired tiling to the exterior. In addition to her professional portraits, Hauschildt photographed or painted scenes in and around Ribe, often collaborating with Stephan Ussing (1868‚Äì1958), a local painter. Her photographs can be recognized by her unmistakable style, often employing unconventional angles and experimental lighting. She photographed everything of interest in Ribe, leaving behind some 2,000 plates. Around 1922, she engaged her friend Anna B√∏ysen who took over management of the studio in 1939. Hauschildt nevertheless kept an eye on the business until her death on Christmas Eve, 1951.

It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another. Studies on global news flow typically attempt to understand why certain countries are more newsworthy than others..Kim, K., & Barnett, G. A. (1996). The determinants of international news flow a network analysis. Communication Research, 23(3), 323-352. Along the years it has been found that the economic power of countries plays a particularly crucial role in their news prominence as well as the presence of international news agencies.Wu, H. D. (2000). Systemic determinants of international news coverage: A comparison of 38 countries. Journal of Communication, 50(2), 110-130. Thus, the US has been found to be very prominent in news mentions around the world (18%), followed by China, Western European and Middle Eastern countries (about 3-5% each). The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of developing countries have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications. This problem was later addressed in the MacBride report, and his set of recommendations for a New World Information and Communication Order. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the World System Theory, and the unequal economic structure of the world.Chang, T. K. (1998). All Countries Not Created Equal to Be News World System and International Communication. Communication research, 25(5), 528-563. Recent empirical studies show that among online news websites and news aggregators the unequal representation of the world has been perpetuated and even further intensified. Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world. Newsworthy measurement in Global News Flow In current news-flow theory, three methods are used to measure newsworthy between countries. First variable is national traits. National traits involves measure of the size of a country and its economic, political, and military power. Countries with better economic stands and higher political reputation tends to gain more newsworthy and trusteeship in global news flow. Second variable is relatedness, namely proximity to that foreign country. Countries that are related in terms of geography or demography with cultural similarity tends to gain more newsworthy in global news flow. Last variable is events. Countries that are currently involved with national events or conflicts tends to have more newsworthy in global news flow, especially countries that are experiencing political, economic, and social changes. Imperialism and Dependency in Global News Flow Throughout the history of global news flow, media imperialism played popular role with the attitude of focused on global information flows where news and entertainment content was considered to move one direct way. The global news flow has been an efficient tool for developed nations to gain their profits from developing nations. The imperialism in global news flow continued with neo-imperialism in global news flow with the structural communications theory and media dependency in global news flow. Dependency in global news flow is explained with evidence from developing countries/Third World regions around the globe points. In the flow in global news, these countries maintaining a heavy reliance by LDCs on the West for international news. The conclusion in dependency in global news flow is that Western news values have come to dominate media in the global south. With higher values and newsworthy, Western agencies interpret to set the agenda for developing countries' media as they influencing what topics get covered. System and Changes in Global News Flow In global news flow, there are \\"gatekeepers\\" who operate on an international scale. It can be seen as helper as people lack systematic knowledge about what news goes where in the world at what length and in what form. This model of processes in global news flow involved in the movement of news among nations. In this model of processes, there is the international communication chain with the receiver-the reader, listener or viewer, \\"internationalization\\". In this system of an international chain, major press and times in Big-Four contributes the international news information. At the end of global news flow and its system, news consumers may receive a very different product from initial resource due to system of global news flow. Changes in Global News Flow started with the potential of technological innovation. With a result from a comparative analysis, the internet plays the major key in the global news flow. Moreover, current study concludes the contribution in global news flow with a perspective on the technological influence on national level of both politics and economy markets as their primary sources of influence. Main resources covered in global news with developed technology are international politics, military and defense, and internal order. The technologies and its innovations did change the method and partial system in global new flow with easier access to news and information. Even with these changes in global news flow, the internet could not change the traditional imbalance in media coverage of international news between developed countries and developing countries.

The discovery of these breaches in 2016 by the NRL resulted in it stripping the Eels of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the 2016 NRL season. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title revoked. The investigation Prior to the start of the 2016 NRL season, the Parramatta Eels faced the prospect with starting the season on -4 points due to salary cap indiscretions in 2015, however the NRL was satisfied with governance changes at the Eels and no points were deducted. However, it was revealed in March that third-party payments had been made by several companies to several players, which is strictly prohibited in the NRL. On 3 May 2016, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg announced that the club would be docked the twelve competition points they have accrued so far this season, as well as fined $1 million and stripped of the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title it won in February. In addition, the NRL also announced that the Eels would not be able to accrue any further competition points until they fall under the salary cap, which they were reported to be $500,000 over as of 3 May 2016. Five officials, including chairman Steve Sharp, deputy chairman Tom Issa, director Peter Serrao, chief executive John Boulous and football manager Daniel Anderson, were also sacked. On 9 July, after over 2 months of club officials contesting the preliminary penalties, Parramatta were handed their punishment with the addition of their for/against points tally accumulated from rounds 1-9 being deducted. The main point of interest in this episode was the manner of the punishment when compared to the Melbourne Storm salary cap breach in 2010, while the Melbourne Storm were not allowed to play for points for the whole season the Parramatta Eels were permitted to play for points as soon as they fell back in line with the cap. It was acknowledged that this change was made due to the demoralising nature of the Storm punishment and having to witness a team running out week after week with nothing to play for. Outcome The aftermath ended with Parramatta hooker Nathan Peats being squeezed out of the club, so the club would be just under the salary cap and start playing for competition points for the remainder of the season. Though this did very little for the troubled club finishing the NRL season 13th on the ladder winning only six of their last 14 matches.

While she did not self- identify as belonging to a particular art genre, critics have classified her paintings as being surrealist, primitive, na√Øve, and modern.Futamura, C. Wakaba. \\"Cendrillon or Scheherazade?: Unraveling the Franco-Algerian Legend of Baya Mahieddine\\", Women in French Studies, Volume 24, 2016 (Article) Published by Women in French Association DOI: https://doi.org/10.1353/wfs.2016.0018 Her works are mainly paintings, though she did pottery as well, all completely self-taught.Khanna, Ranjana. ‚ÄúLatent Ghosts and the Manifesto Baya, Breton and reading for the future.‚Äù Algeria Cuts: Women and Representation, 1830 to the Present. Ed. Mieke Bal and Hent de Vries. Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 2008. Print. At the age of sixteen Baya had her first exhibition, in Paris, where she gained notice from renowned artists such as Picasso and Andr√© Breton. Her work was presented in various exhibitions in France and Algeria, and has appeared on Algerian postage stamps. Born in 1931 in Fort de l‚Äôeau (today's Bordj El Kiffan), by the age of five, both her parents had died, and it was her grandmother who raised her. At the age of eleven, Marguerite Caminat, a French woman residing in Algiers, stepped in as Baya's protector. While certain sources present Marguerite as Baya's ‚Äúprotector‚Äù, others state that Baya was responsible for completing household duties, much like a servant.Futamura, C. Wakaba. ‚ÄúBaya Revisited: Identity Expression and the Insights of Art Therapy.‚Äù The International Journal of the Humanities, vol. 8, no. 6, 2010. Marguerite furnished her with a residence, art supplies, and words of support for her art. In 1947 Marguerite, who was well connected in the literary and art worlds, was visited by the French art dealer Aim√© Maeght who, later that year, presented Baya's work in a solo exhibition in his gallery. Andr√© Breton wrote the preface to the catalogue of Baya's exhibition. After the time in Paris, Baya spent time in Vallauris working on pottery, where she met Picasso who was highly impressed by her work. Baya returned to Algeria and in 1953 she married El Hadj Mahfoud Mahieddine, a famous musician, in an arranged marriage. She had ceased to paint from 1953 to 1963, which coincides with the Algerian War. During these years she gave birth and was mothering six children. In 1963 she resumed painting, exhibiting both new and old work in Algiers and in Paris, until her death on November 9, 1998.  Work  In her gouaches dominated by vibrant colors, she often paints silhouettes of women and their clothes, belts and veils, figures of the enigmatic mother and different domestic objects. The objects surrounding these ladies are devoid of any shadow. Baya's artwork largely appear to reenact a vibrant and joyful community of women. The vibrant colors and sinuous contours of the figures in her gouaches offer unique representations of flora and fauna, and portray unusual animals such as flying rabbits and camel-sized birds that might emerge from Scheherazade's stories, from \\"The Thousand and One Nights\\" Arab stories.  Reviews  The bold colors and strange figures of her works revealed surrealist and dream-like qualities inspired artists such as Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, Andr√© Breton who defined her work as Surrealism, and this view was widely held for a long time. Breton's enthusiastic reception and encomium of Baya and her work is expressed in his 1947 essay ‚ÄúBaya‚Äù: ‚ÄúI speak not as others have, to deplore an ending, but rather to promote a beginning, and at this beginning, Baya is queen. The beginning of an age of emancipation and of agreement, in radical rupture with the preceding era, one of whose principal levers for man might be the systematic, always increasing impregnation of nature. The beginnings of this age lie with Charles Fourier, the new impetus has just been furnished by Malcolm of Chazal. But for the rocket that launches the new age, I propose the name Baya. Baya, whose mission is to reinvigorate the meaning of those beautiful nostalgic words: happy Arabia. Baya holds and rekindles the golden bough.‚ÄùAndre Breton, from ‚ÄòBaya‚Äô exhibition catalogue, Derrie\`re le miroir, Paris: Editions Aime Maeght, 1947.  Tribute  In 2018, a Google Doodle was created to celebrate her 87th Birthday.

It was produced by legendary Finnish film-maker Spede Pasanen, but unlike the comedy films he had produced previously he did not feature him on-screen. The movie was released in 1971, the same year as Spede's Hirtt√§m√§tt√∂m√§t and Kahdeksas Veljes. The film was intended to give its four stars a start in the Finnish film industry as both directors and leading actors. Although now widely available in DVD distribution in various Spede collections, the film's only other showing outside its theatrical run was a single TV rerun on MTV3 in 2008.  Plot Synopsis  Four Finns Paavo, Hese, Viiksi and Timppa are enjoying themselves too much in Hell (Hell being depicted as a Finnish sauna), so Perkele and Satan send them back to Finland for a vacation. They're given a suitcase full of money and (unbeknownst to them) are made incapable of becoming drunk. On their way out of hell, they steal a car and pick up enough hitchhikers to alert the police. When the quartet escape the scene, however, they leave their money behind. Next, they attempt to earn money by various illegal means, including a bank-robbery which lands Hese in jail. The boys manage to break Hese out of jail but are left with nothing to their name. Eventually they plot to steal heat-resistant suits which they plan to sell to people of other nationalities back in Hell, who can't stand the heat. They are successful although the military deployment leads to chaos and citywide destruction. When they return to Hell, Satan forces them to wear the heat- resistant clothing as a punishment and for his own amusement.  Cast  * Paavo Piironen as Paavo * Heikki Nousiainen as Hese * Heikki Huopainen as Viiksi * Timo Nissi as Timppa * Yrj√∂ J√§rvinen as Perkele (the lesser devil) * Heikki Savolainen as Satan * Leo Jokela as the Narrator * Ville-Veikko Salminen as the clothes-shop salesman  Background  The film was unconventional from Spede at the time, not featuring him in either a starring role or in the writing crew. The film's title is a pun. Literally translated the title means \\"Satan's Radicals\\". Saatana is a swear word in Finnish similar in meaning to \\"God damn it\\", so the title holds a double meaning as the four characters (referred to twice in the film as radicals) are from and of Satan, as well as literally from Hell. Leo Jokela, seen in many prior Spede comedies serves as the film's initial narrator and types out the film's credits, jokingly referring to the fact that he doesn't play a role in the film since it would have cost the producer too much. In 1971, all of Spede's movies were box-office disappointments which led to him taking a two-year hiatus from film-making. Despite this, Spede won a producer's Jussi Award for the film, jointly with Hirtt√§m√§tt√∂m√§t and Kahdeksas Veljes.

The first mention of Roggenbeuren dates from a donation from St Gall's Abbey in 860/1 in which the brothers Otholf and Teothard donated their territory in Gehrenberg to the abbey, and received the Roggenbeuren in exchange. Roggenbeuren later came into the hands of the ministerialis family of Schmalegg. In 1280 Conrad of Schmalegg sold the territory to the cathedral chapter of Constance. The upper jurisdiction was held by the Counts of Werdenberg- Heiligenberghttp://www.deggenhausertal.de/index.php/deggenhausertal/geschichte/roggenbeuren and after their extinction in 1534 by the Counts of F√ºrstenberg. In the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, in which the principalities of the ecclesiastic rulers were dispersed to the counts and princes of the empire, Roggenbeuren with the other territories of the Prince-Bishopric of Constance was ceded to the Electorate of Baden.

The archaeological studies of the ruins indicate that the temple was built with granite stones during the period of Hinduism influence in the region. It was built by Chutiya kings in the 13th-14th century.Sarma, P.C.A study of the temple architecture of Assam from the Gupta period to the end of the Ahom rule: Chutiya architecture, p. 205Choudhury, R.D, Heritage of Architecture of Assam, p.5Thakur, A.K, Pre-historic Archeological Remains of Arunachal Pradesh and People's perception: An Overview, p.6 This was the period when the Chutiya kings had started setting Brahmins in different areas of their kingdom offering them land grants. Kechai-Khaiti, a Chutia tribal goddess was believed to be the chief deity who was worshipped in the ruined temple. The location of a narrow stream named Akashiganga similar to the site of Tamreswari and Bura- Buri Temples of Sadiya indicates that sacrifices were once performed in the temple. Location The Malinithan archaeological site is located at the base of the Siang mountains in the Likabali town and a sub-division of the Lower Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh. It is situated on a hill that rises to a height of , which affords a commanding view of the plains around it and of the Brahmaputra River. Legend The site was discovered during British Raj times and since then mythology has been fabricated for the site. As per this mythology, it is said that when Krishna wanted to marry Rukmini, the daughter of King Bhishmaka of Vidarbha, he abducted her prior to her wedding with Shishupala. Krishna and Rukmini then travelled from Bhishmakanagar to Dwarka, stopping at Malinithan on the way over, where they were guests of Shiva and Durga, who were doing penance. Parvati, Shiva's consort, warmly welcoming her guests, presented them with garlands made of flowers plucked from her orchard. Krishna was so enamoured by the beauty and the scent of the flowers that he addressed Parvati as Malini, meaning \\"the mistress of the garden\\", and since then the place is named as Malinithan. In another legend it is said that an image of a female without the head, which was unearthed during the excavations, represented Malini who was the lover of Shiva. The image of the goddess Durga found here is also known as \\"Pupane\\", an ancient name for the Divine Mother. History The archaeological finds at the site of sculptures of Durga, a Shiva linga and a bull, the mount of Shiva, relate to worship by people of the Shiva cult. Based on these, archaeologists have inferred that the Shakti cult was practised in the region. It was one of the three leading centers of Shaktism; the other two centers are stated to be Bhaghawati, the mother goddess at Gorehoga village in North Lakhimpur, and Harhithan in Dhakuakhana in the west end Tamresari in the east. From all archaeological evidences at the site, archaeologists have opined that the temple belonged to the 13th century. Features The archaeological excavations revealed a very well designed and carved plinth of a temple, of height, sculptures of deities and animals, designs of flowers, damaged columns and panels. Four sculptures of lions on two elephants were found at the four corners of the ruins of the temple. Among the sculptures found at Malinthan, five notable ones carved out of granite stone are of Indra riding his mount Airavata, Kartikeya riding a peacock, Surya (Sun) riding a chariot, and Ganesha mounted over a mouse, and a large Nandi bull. On the basis of the erotic Maithuna sculptures found here in different postures it is believed that tantricism prevailed here as a fertility rite of the primitive tribal people who held the \\"mother principal as the procreative power of nature\\". The temple is carved entirely out of stone, a type of temple known as Asmamayai. Iron dowels discovered in the ruins of the stone temple which resemble the ones found in the Tamreswari temple of Sadiya shows that it was built by the same people.Religious History of Arunachal Pradesh by Byomakesh Tripathy, p.354 Gallery File:Malini than Mother godess scuplture.jpgMalinithan Mother goddess sculpture File:Gaja-singha of Malini Than.jpgGaja-singha of Malinithan File:Malini than Shiva sculpture.jpgMalinithan Shiva sculpture File:Malini than Kartika scuplture.jpgMalinithan Kartika sculpture File:Malini than Apsara scuplture.jpgMalinithan Apsara sculpture References Bibliography * Category:Hindu temples in Arunachal Pradesh Category:Shiva temples in Arunachal Pradesh ","title":"Malinithan"},{"id":"50406585","text":"Pontianak Malay (Bahase Melayu Pontianak, Indonesian: Bahasa Pontianak, Jawi script: ÿ®Ÿáÿßÿ≥ ŸÖŸÑÿßŸäŸà ⁄§ŸàŸÜÿ™ŸäŸÜÿßŸÉ) is a Malayan language spoken in Pontianak, Indonesia and the surrounding area.

Life =Early years= Andr√© Antoine was born in Leuven/Louvain. He comes from a farming family. He achieved his Licentiate in Law at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve in 1983. His degree in Higher European Studies followed a year later. His political career began in 1980 when he joined the Christian Socialist Party (PSC, as the cdH was then called), becoming a special advisor to the party presidency. In 1983 he started to work as a cabinet assistant for the Belgian Minister for Scientific Policy and Panning, Philippe Maystadt, moving on to work as an \\"attach√©\\" to the party president in 1984/85. =Local government= Antoine was a member of the municipal council in Ramillies between 1988 and 1994. Since 1994 he has been a councillor in nearby Perwez where he has also served as the mayor since 2000.

In 1995 he became a member of the newly renamed and reconfigured Parliament of Wallonia in Namur, and the Parliament of the French Community, which for most purposes is the name used for the same parliament when convening in Brussels as part of the national legislative structure. Re-elected to the Wallon parliament in 1999, he became the leader of the PSC group in it. In 2003 Jo√´lle Milquet appointed Antoine a vice- president of the recently renamed cdH (party), hitherto the PSC. The next year, 2004, he attained ministerial office, becoming the regional Minister for Housing, Transport and Regeneration. His wide palette of responsibilities included general and school transport, energy policy, housing and land use, zoning, airports and railway investment. In 2009 he became regional Minister for the Budget, Finance, Employment, Training and Sport. Despite the chan ge of post, he retained responsibility for airports policy in Wallonia, which under an EU directive from 2002 gives him the power to place a ban on night takes-offs and landings. However, it is not a power he exercised: there are very few night time take-offs and landings in Wallonia. Re-elected to the assembly again in 2014, he became president of the Wallon parliament on 22 July 2014.

He lives and works in New York City and Stone Ridge, NY and is on the faculty of the School of Visual Arts MFA program. He is represented by Susan Inglett Gallery in New York City and Devening Projects + Editions in Chicago. Education Stephan studied industrial design at Parsons School of Design and at Pratt Institute. In 1965, he moved to San Francisco and received his Master of Fine Arts degree from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1967. After returning to New York, he was a studio assistant to Jasper Johns until he started showing with the David Whitney Gallery in 1970. This and the Whitney Biennial Exhibitions of 1971 and 1973 were followed by sufficient shows and reviews to prompt Roberta Smith in the New York Times to refer to his work as ‚Äúamong the most closely watched developments of the early ‚Äô70s.‚Äù Work Gary Stephan, Untitled, 2019, tape on paper, 7 x 7 inchesExhibiting since the late 1960s, Stephan creates Postmodern art in the form of idiosyncraticly abstract paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, photography and video art. Stephan builds paintings, abstract in form but pictorial in nature, with a few simple visual tools and colors, which he then uses to undermine a coherent view. Stephan surrounds his marks with shaped areas of negative space that destabilize figure/ground relationships. A color that is used as ground might come to the surface as a positive form. He also uses discontinuous areas of similar color that visually unite to create the impression of a singular shape. Part of the power of Stephan‚Äôs paintings and drawings comes from their engagement with the architecture of their exhibition spaces in ways that mirror their formal structure. Because of their color and facture, some of Stephan‚Äôs paintings may seem austere, but merely apprehending their complex formal structure does not settle their meanings. Stephan creates ambiguities of form that summon feelings that are not easily resolved. As an abstract painter, Stephan evades the obvious seductive charms that painting offers. He is a rigorous formalist painter. Part of the strength of Stephan‚Äôs work is the way is engages our imagination through metaphor-eliciting ambiguities. All the feelings connected with these various interpretations coexist in the emotional resonance of his paintings. Exhibitions His work has been exhibited at institutions including the Drawing Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Whitney Museum. Stephan has had solo shows in New York at Susan Inglett Gallery, Bykert Gallery, Mary Boone Gallery, Hirschl and Adler, and Marlborough Gallery; in Los Angeles at Margo Leavin Gallery and Daniel Weinberg Gallery. He had a retrospective exhibition at the Kienzle Art Foundation in Berlin from 13 September 2017 to 13 January 2018.

Snapshot images taken from a video showing the nucleation and growth of a TEM in an endothelial cell intoxicated with C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum for 24 hours, Bar = 10 Œºm. For the dynamics see Video. Cellular dewetting refers to the process of nucleation and enlargement of transendothelial cell macroaperture (TEM) tunnels in endothelial cells (Figure 1). This phenomenon is analogous to the nucleation and growth of dry patches in viscous liquids spreading on a non-wettable substrate (Figure 2). Cellular dewetting is triggered by several protein toxins from pathogenic bacteria, notably the EDIN-like factors from Staphylococcus aureus and from Clostridium botulinum, as well as edema toxin from Bacillus anthracis. TEMs form in response to the rupture of cytoskeleton physical connections through the cytoplasm due to inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway or to induction of the flux of cyclic-AMP (cAMP) broad signaling molecule.  Physics behind cellular dewetting  liquid dewetting and cellular dewetting. The phenomenon of cellular dewetting can be interpreted by physical modeling (Figure 2). The driving force responsible for the spontaneous formation of TEM tunnels and their opening is the membrane tension that results from the spreading of cells due to actomyosin relaxation. Opposite to liquid dewetting, TEMs reach a maximum diameter, at which the driving force is balanced by a resisting force that develops along TEM edges (Figure 2). This resisting force is referred to as line tension and is uncharacterized at the molecular level.  Physical parameters  Driving forces pulling on a tunnel of radius R, as depicted in Figure 2. Here, pulling is due to the tensioning of the cell membrane (œÉ) that is partly counteracted by a line tension around the tunnel (T). In these conditions, the net driving force (FD) consists of two contributions: F_D = \\\\sigma - \\\\frac{T}{R} Dewetting proceeds if FD>0. Membrane tension (œÉ) depends on the tunnel radius R. A tunnel increase in size relaxes the membrane, inducing a decrease in membrane tension, as described by Helfrich‚Äôs law. Line tension (T) corresponds to the resisting force along the edge of the tunnel that opposes membrane tension and limits dewetting. This line tension can have physical and molecular components.

Her husband was the poet and politician Aim√© C√©saire. Early life C√©saire (n√©e Roussi) was born on 11 August 1915 in Poterie, Martinique, to Flore Roussi (n√©e William), a school teacher, and Beno√Øt Roussi, a sugar factory worker.Gilles Bounoure, \\"Suzanne C√©saire et la question de la civilisation\\", ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, p. 127. She began her education at her local primary school in Rivi√®re- Sal√©e in Martinique (which still had the status of a French colonial territory at that time), before attending a girls' boarding-school in the capital, Fort- de-France. Having completed her secondary education, she went to study literature in Toulouse and then in Paris at the prestigious √âcole normale sup√©rieure from 1936-1938. University and marriage to Aim√© C√©saire During her first year as a student in Paris, Suzanne Roussi meet L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, who introduced her to Aim√© C√©saire, a fellow student at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure.http://azmartinique.com/fr/tout-savoir/personnages- celebres/suzanne-roussi-cesaire The following year, on 10 July 1937, the couple married at the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris.Natalie Levisalles, \\"Suanne l'aim√©e de C√©saire\\", During their studies, the C√©saires were both part of the editorial team of the militant journal L'√âtudiant noir. In 1938 the couple had their first child. The following year they returned to Martinique where they both took up teaching jobs at the Lyc√©e Schoelcher. They went on to have six children together, divorcing in April 1963 after 25 years of marriage. Literary career C√©saire wrote in French and published seven essays during her career as a writer. All seven of these essays were published between 1941 and 1945 in the Martinique cultural journal Tropiques, of which she was a co-founder and editor along with her husband, Aim√© C√©saire, and Ren√© M√©nil, both of whom were notable French poets from Martinique. Her writing explored themes such as Caribbean identity, civilisation, and surrealism. While her writing remains largely unknown to Anglophone readers, excerpts from her essays \\"Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilisations\\", \\"A Civilisation‚Äôs Discontent\\", \\"1943: Surrealism and Us\\", and \\"The Great Camouflage\\" can be found translated into English in the anthology The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), edited by Michael Richardson. C√©saire had a particular affinity with surrealism, which she described as \\"the tightrope of our hope\\".Michael Richardson, The Refusal of the Shadow: Surrealism and the Caribbean (Verso, 1996), p. 7. In her essay \\"1943: Surrealism and Us\\", she called for a Martinican surrealism: ‚ÄúOur surrealism will then deliver it the bread of its depths. Finally those sordid contemporary antinomies of black/white, European/African, civilised/savage will be transcended. The magical power of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn forth from living sources. Colonial stupidity will be purified in the blue welding flame. Our value as metal, our cutting edge of steel, our amazing communions will be recovered.\\" C√©saire also developed a close relationship with Andr√© Breton following his visit to Martinique in 1941. She dedicated an essay to him (\\"Andr√© Breton, poet\\", 1941) and received a poem dedicated to her in return (\\"For madame Suzanne C√©saire\\", 1941).Jean-Claude Blach√®re, \\"Breton et C√©saire: Flux et reflux d‚Äôune amiti√©\\", Europe, Paris, vol. 76, iss. 832, 1998, pp. 146‚Äì159 (p. 153). This encounter with Andr√© Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism.P. Rosemont, Surrealist Women (2000), p. 122. Her writing is often overshadowed by that of her husband, who is the better known of the two. However, in addition to her important literary essays, her role as editor of Tropiques can be regarded as an equally significant (if often overlooked) contribution to Caribbean literature. Tropiques was the most influential francophone Caribbean journal of its time and is widely acknowledged for the foundational role it played in the development of Martiniquan literature. C√©saire played both an intellectual and administrative role in the journal's success.Bounoure, , \\"Suzanne C√©saire et la question de la civilisation\\", ContreTemps, no. 6, May 2010, p. 128. She managed the journal's relations with the censor ‚Äî a particularly difficult role given the oppositional stance of Tropiques towards the war-time Vichy government ‚Äî as well as taking responsibility for the printing. The intellectual impact she had on the journal is underlined by her essay \\"The Great Camouflage\\", which was the closing article of the final issue. Despite her substantial written and editorial contribution to the journal, the collected works of Tropiques, published by Jean-Michel Place in 1978, credits Aim√© C√©saire and Ren√© M√©nil as the journal's catalysts.Tropiques N¬∞ 1 √† 13/14, 1941-1945. Nouvelles √©ditions Place. Tropiques published its last issue in September 1945, at the end of World War Two.\\"Tropiques [REVUE] : Revue culturelle / dir. Aim√© C√©saire, Ren√© M√©nil\\". With the closing of the journal, Suzanne C√©saire stopped writing. The reasons for this are unknown. However, journalist Natalie Levisalles suggests that Suzanne C√©saire would have perhaps made different choices if she had not had the responsibilities of mothering six children, teaching, and being the wife of an important politician and poet, Aim√© C√©saire.http://next.liberation.fr/livres/2009/04/23/suzanne-l- aimee-de-cesaire_554226 Indeed, her first daughter, Ina C√©saire, remembers her saying regularly: \\"Yours will be the first generation of women who choose.\\" Having stopped writing she pursued her career as a teacher, working in Martinique and Haiti. She was also an active feminist and participated in the Union des Femmes Fran√ßaises. Reception and influence C√©saire was a pioneer in the search for a distinct Martiniquan literary voice. Though she was attacked by some Caribbean writers, following an early edition of Tropiques, for aping traditional French styles of poetry as well as supposedly promoting \\"The Happy Antilles\\" view of the island advanced by French colonialism, her essay of 1941, \\"Mis√®re d'une po√©sie\\", condemned what she termed \\"Litt√©rature de hamac. Litt√©rature de sucre et de vanille. Tourisme litt√©eraire\\" [Literaure of the hammock, of sugar and vanilla. Literary tourism].[1] Her encounter with Andr√© Breton opened the way for her development of Afro-Surrealism[2], which followed in the footsteps of her use of surrealist concepts to illuminate the colonial dilemma.[3] Her dictum - \\"La po√©sie martinique sera cannibale ou ne sera pas\\" [Cannibal poetry or nothing][4] - was an anti-colonial appropriation of a surrealist trope. Suzanne C√©saire's repudiation of simple idealised answers - whether assimilationist, Africanist, or creole - to the situation of colonialism in the Caribbean has proved increasingly influential in later postcolonial studies.[6] ; Essays published in Tropiques: * \\"Leo Frobenius et le probl√®me des civilisations\\" (April 1941) * \\"Alain et l'esth√©tique\\" (July 1941) * \\"Andr√© Breton, po√®te\\" (October 1941) * \\"Mis√®re d'une po√©sie\\" (January 1942) * \\"Malaise d'une civilization\\" (April 1942) * \\"1943 : Le surr√©alisme et nous\\" (October 1943) * \\"Le Grand camouflage\\" (1945) ; Books: * Suzanne C√©saire, This book is a collection her seven literary essays. ; English translations: * \\"The Malaise of a Civilization\\" and \\"The Great Camouflage\\" in *\\" Surrealism and Us\\" and \\"The Domain of the Marvelous\\" (extract from the essay ¬´ Alain et l‚Äôesth√©tique ¬ª) in * \\"The Domain of the Marvelous\\" (extract from the essay ¬´ Alain et l‚Äôesth√©tique ¬ª) in * \\"Andr√© Breton, Poet\\", Guy Ducornet and Franklin Rosemont, translators; \\"Discontent of a Civilization\\", Penelope Rosemont, translator; \\"1943: Surrealism and Us\\" and \\"The Domain of the Marvelous\\" (extract from the essay \\"Alain et l‚Äôesth√©tique\\"), Erin Gibson, translator; in * \\"Leo Frobenius and the Problem of Civilizations\\", \\"A Civilization‚Äôs Discontent\\", \\"1943 : Surrealism and Us\\" and \\"The Great Camouflage\\", Krzysztof Fijalkowski and Michael Richardson, translators; in See also * Antillanit√© * Cr√©olit√© * Leo Frobenius * Maryse Cond√© * V.

Synopsis Begbie, going by the name of Jim Francis, is now a Scottish expatriate artist in California and returns to Scotland for his murdered son's funeral. His wife Melanie slowly comes to terms with Jim's dark past. Critical reception The novel was reviewed in many newspapers. It received mostly good reviews. In a review for The Daily Telegraph, Orlando Bird called it \\"lean, clever and propulsive\\". Meanwhile, Hannah McGill of The Scotsman commended Welsh's perceptive description of the \\"divisions that rend families, and the minor lies and delusions that sustain relationships\\" Writing for The London Magazine, Erik Martiny called it a \\"resourceful, engagingly lively novel\\", but stressed that its \\"main interest derives less from its detective novel scenario than from Welsh‚Äôs ability to explore his protagonist‚Äôs inner struggle to contain the beast within.\\" In the Oxonian Review, Callum Seddon suggested the novel was \\"a take on the established trope of ‚Äòthe double‚Äô in Scottish literature\\". Meanwhile, Sunil Badami of The Australian assessed that the novel was \\"lean and purposeful\\", and a quick read. Reviewing it for The Guardian, Sarah Diturn suggested the characters were \\"unconvincing\\".

Parts of the building are 13th century and there is evidence there was a church here before this in Saxon times. It is situated in the old village of Hatfield just east of the modern town of Hatfield and close to the walls of Hatfield House once a royal palace. It once also served Hatfield House as a place of worship as well as the village and so is exceptionally grand for a parish church. The dedication to St Etheldreda derives from the Bishops of Ely for whom she is a patron saint and who once occupied the House when it was a bishops' palace.  Description  The church stands at the top of a hill with Old Hatfield village centre to the west. The building material is largely flint. It is cruciform with a tower at the western end. Most construction was between the 13th and 15th centuries. Two chapels have been added on either side of the chancel; on the north side is the Salisbury chapel and on the south side the Brocket chapel. The Salisbury chapel is the traditional burial place of the Cecil family and contains the ornate tomb of Robert Cecil, the first Earl of Salisbury. Two British Prime Ministers, Lord Melbourne and Lord Salisbury, are also interred here. Some rebuilding, particularly of the window tracery, was done during the Victorian era. Historically the church had a steeple on top of the west tower and this is shown in many early illustrations. It was last re-erected in 1847 to commemorate the visit to the town of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. However it was removed in 1930. There are eight bells in the tower which now form a Carillon, installed in 1786. It is set to play different tunes on each day of the week. There are many memorials, the oldest being a knight in armour of about 1160.

History The first part of the line was opened on 1 December 1914 from Kellinghusenstra√üe to Ohlsdorf. In 1920, the new branch from Wandsbek-Gartenstadt (Waldd√∂rfer railway) to Volksdorf opened; the two branches to Gro√ühansdorf and Ohlstedt followed in 1921 and 1925. Also in 1921, the Langenhorn railway to Ochsenzoll was established. On this line, there had been a preliminary service with steam trains since 1918. On 2 June 1929 the first part and on 25 March 1931 the second part of the KellJung line to Jungfernstieg was added. From 1960 to 1963 the line was built through the city center to Wandsbek-Gartenstadt, which completed the U1 line, connecting the branch to Volksdorf.

It was formed in May 1941, and destroyed by Soviet forces in June 1944. The unit was mainly used as a rear-security division in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, and was responsible for large-scale war crimes including the deaths of thousands of Jewish civilians. History The 707th Infantry Division was raised at Munich on 2 May 1941, and subsequently undertook training in the region. Historian Ben H. Shepherd has described the unit as \\"an extremely substandard division of the fifteenth wave\\" to be raised by the German Army during the war, with its personnel being \\"overaged, undertrained and underequipped\\". The 707th Infantry Division was also much smaller than the standard size of German infantry divisions, comprising just 5,000 soldiers. All of the division's initial officers, other than its commanding officer until February 1943, Major General , were reservists. Most soldiers in the division were aged over 30, and the officers were typically even older. Major General von Bechtolsheim and his operations officer were deeply committed Nazis. In August 1941, the 707th Infantry Division was deployed to the Eastern Front to undertake security duties in the occupied regions of the Soviet Union behind Army Group Centre's front lines. In October 1941, personnel of the division conducted public hangings of resistance members in Minsk, including that of 17 year old Masha Bruskina.Yad Vashem, contemporaneous photograph The 707th Infantry Division and attached Order Police units murdered over 10,000 individuals, most of whom were Jews, in Belorussia between October and November 1941. Almost all of the division's officers and enlisted personnel willingly took part in these killings; the small number who refused were only lightly punished. This operation was initiated by von Bechtolsheim, who issued orders explicitly calling for the \\"annihilation\\" and \\"extermination\\" of Jews. Other German Army units undertook similar killings. The 707th Infantry Division continued to undertake security duties in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union for the remainder of 1941 and throughout 1942 and 1943. During the spring and early summer of 1942 the division conducted a so-called \\"anti-partisan operation\\" designated Operation Bamberg in which more than 4,000 Soviet citizens ‚Äì the majority of whom were civilian farmers ‚Äì were killed. Shepherd has written that while other German security divisions also killed large numbers of civilians during such operations, the 707th Infantry Division had the worst record. Historian Jeff Rutherford has made a similar comparison, labelling the 707th \\"infamous\\". From January 1944 the 707th Infantry Division was used as a front-line unit in defensive roles. On 23 June, at the start of the major Soviet Operation Bagration offensive, it formed part of Army Group Centre's reserve. Later in June the division was encircled and destroyed by Soviet forces near Bobruisk. It was formally disbanded on 3 August 1944.

Studies have shown that PHMG in solution has fungicidal as well as bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The substance also has detergent, anti-corrosive, and flocculant properties and prevents biofouling. PHMG-P is a white powdered solid, and as all polyguanidine salts, readily soluble in water. Toxicity Unlike the related polymer polyhexanide (PHMB), PHMG has been described as a relatively new compound with properties, potency, and effects being not yet fully recognized. Preliminary findings indicate that PHMG and its derivatives primarily rely on damaging the cell membrane by inhibiting the activity of cellular dehydrogenases. When PHMG is aerosolized and inhaled, it harms the lungs, causing death of the cells lining the bronchioles and widespread damage to alveoli, along with bronchiolitis obliterans, an often fatal form of non- reversible obstructive lung disease in which the bronchiole are compressed and narrowed by fibrosis (scar tissue) and/or inflammation.Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary > bronchiolitis obliterans Retrieved on August, 2010 Uses PHMG was used in Russia to disinfect hospitals and from 2001 on, it was widely used in South Korea as a disinfectant to prevent microbial contamination in household humidifiers.Lee Hyun-jeong for the Korea Herald. April 24, 2016 Oxy suspected of watering down report PHMG was \\"originally marketed for cleaning a humidifier's water tank but instead used by the public as a water additive to suppress microbial growth.\\" South Korean lung disease outbreak and deaths The pulmonary toxicity of PHMG was discovered due to an outbreak of severe lung disease in South Korea, detected in children in the spring of the years 2006 to 2011, and in adults in the spring of 2011; the mortality rate in children was 58%, while among adults, 53% died or required lung transplantation. Autopsies and epidemiological work, followed up by animal studies, led the South Korean CDC to identify PHMG used in humidifiers as the cause. It was banned in 2011, and new cases ceased occurring. Reckitt Benckiser was one of the companies that sold this product in South Korea and it resisted taking responsibility until May 2016, when the Korean division chief apologized to victims and families in a press conference and offered compensation to the families of those who died to those who were injured; it was the first time the company had acknowledged that its products containing PHMG were harmful.

This stance arose partly from a strict policy of neutrality in international affairs that started in 1830 with the secession of Belgium from the north. Dutch neutrality was not guaranteed by the major powers in Europe, nor was it a part of the Dutch constitution. The country's neutrality was based on the belief that its strategic position between the German Empire, German-occupied Belgium, and the British guaranteed its safety. The Royal Netherlands Army was mobilized throughout the conflict, as belligerents regularly attempted to intimidate the Netherlands and place demands on it. In addition to providing a credible deterrence, the army had to house refugees, guard internment camps for captured soldiers, and prevent smuggling. The government also restricted the free movement of people, monitored spies, and took other wartime measures.  Pre-war status  Before the First World War, the Netherlands hosted two major international peace conferences. The first, the First Hague Conference, was held in May 1899 on the initiative of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Representatives of 26 nations conferred on the limitation of certain types of weapons, including poison gas, hollow point bullets, and aerial bombardment from hot air balloons. The conference was a surprising success, and agreements were reached on the laws of war and on war crimes. In 1907, the Second Hague Conference was hosted at the insistence of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The conference was initially planned for 1904, but it had to be postponed because of the Russo-Japanese War. The second conference only secured a few additional treaties and is generally considered a failure.  Politics  The Dutch monarch, Queen Wilhelmina, was known for her fierce patriotism and strong-willed nature. Wilhelmina leaned towards sympathy for France and Belgium, but only in private. She evinced a neutral stance in public. Her German husband, the prince-consort Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, was openly pro-German. His nephew, Frederick Francis IV, served in the German army.Fasseur, Cees. Wilhelmina. De Jonge Koningin. Amsterdam: Balans, 1998, pp. 508‚Äì510. On 29 August 1913, a centrist liberal minority cabinet was appointed under the leadership of independent liberal Prime Minister Pieter Cort van der Linden. His cabinet governed until 9 September 1918, an unusually long period for a Dutch cabinet. During this period, the important post of Minister of Foreign Affairs was taken by John Loudon. Although the government as a whole was strictly neutral, each member maintained individual preferences. Some ministers were in favor of France, while Prime Minister Cort van der Linden was privately seen as German-friendly and nicknamed \\"Kurt Unter der Linden,\\" after Berlin's Unter den Linden boulevard.Ruis, Edwin. Spynest. British and German Espionage from Neutral Holland 1914‚Äì1918. Briscombe: The History Press, 2016, p. 149. = Food shortages = War conditions disrupted the Netherlands' food imports and caused shortages. From 3 July 1917, authorities in Amsterdam held back the potato supply until there was enough to feed the whole city. This led to a large riot and looting of stores and markets. Rioters broke into warehouses and took potatoes intended to be exported to England. Two thousand soldiers were called in to break up the riot but were repelled by the rioters. Another clash took place in the city of Kattenberg where three groups of workmen, one from the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland, protested the lack of food for manual laborers. They also demanded that they receive actual food and not promissory papers.Daily Telegraph Thursday 5 July 1917, reprinted in Daily Telegraph 5 July 2017 page 24  Neutrality  In the aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on the Kingdom of Serbia at 11 a.m. on 28 July 1914. The Netherlands declared themselves neutral on 30 July. According to international law, neutrality had to be declared in each instance of a war declaration between two sovereign nations. During August, the Dutch declaration of neutrality had to be repeated regularly. The declaration consisted of 18 articles. The most important article stated that hostilities were not allowed within the territory and waters of the Dutch Empire; that no nation was allowed to use this territory and waters as a base for military operations; and that foreign soldiers who, for whatever reason, crossed into Dutch territory would be interned in POW camps for the duration of the war.Moeyes, Paul. Buiten Schot . Amsterdam: De Arbeiderspers, 2014, p. 54. = Violations = Monument commemorating the dead fishermen of Scheveningen At the beginning of the war the German army marched near the Dutch‚ÄìBelgian border in the province of Limburg. For a stretch of between border markers 42 and 43, the road was half Belgian and half Dutch territory. Dutch border guards made clear which part of the road was Dutch territory, and as a consequence, the German army avoided it on their westward march. Despite this, the Dutch were falsely accused by Belgian and French newspapers at the time of supporting the German invasion of Belgium.Moeyes, Paul. Buiten Schot, pp. 97‚Äì88. Dutch sailors suffered from war-related incidents and neutrality violations. Several ships were torpedoed by German U-boats or sunk by British sea mines. The fishing town of Scheveningen lost 300 fishermen. In total, 862 fishermen died and 175 fishing boats were sunk. Some sea mines washed ashore and killed civilians or military specialists tasked with disarming the sea mines.Lith, Hans van. Plotseling een vreselijke knal. Zaltbommel: Europese Bibliotheek, 2001, pp. 176‚Äì177. In order to protect merchant ships, the Netherlands negotiated a free channel from the coast via the Dogger Bank to the North Sea with Germany. Both Allied and German military aircraft violated Dutch airspace. On several occasions, lost British and German pilots dropped bombs on Dutch towns. The worst incident occurred on 30 April 1917, when a lost British pilot of the Royal Naval Air Service mistakenly dropped eight bombs on the town of Zierikzee, damaging several houses and killing a family of three. After initially denying the incident, the British government apologized and agreed to compensate the Dutch for damage and loss of life.Lith, Hans van. Plotseling een vreselijke knal, pp. 91‚Äì95. A total of 107 airplanes and 24 seaplanes landed in the Netherlands, and 220 crewmen were taken prisoner. Of the crashed planes, 67 were repaired and added to the army's air department.Starink, Dirk. De Jonge Jaren van Luchtmacht. Amsterdam: Boom, 2013, p. 95. German Zeppelins on bombing raids against England frequently violated Dutch airspace due to weather conditions such as wind or fog. It is unclear whether Dutch fire was responsible for the downing of the Zeppelin LZ 54. It came down in the sea and led to the King Stephen incident when British sailors let the German crew drown. = Espionage = Due to its geographical significance and its international connections, the Netherlands became a hotbed of espionage. The country's neutrality allowed citizens of belligerent countries to travel freely to or from the Netherlands. Most spy agencies had operatives in the country. MI6 had a station in Rotterdam under the command of Richard B. Tinsley. It handled several important spy networks in Belgium, such as La Dame Blanche. These networks provided the Allies with intelligence concerning German troops behind the Western Front. The German secret services also used Rotterdam as a base for espionage in Britain. From Rotterdam, spies were sent by ferry to spy on the Royal Navy. Dutch citizens were in demand as spies, as they could travel freely throughout Europe. Some of these spies were executed for espionage. Haicke Janssen and Willem Roos, two unemployed Dutch sailors, were executed in 1915. Exotic dancer and courtesan Mata Hari, convicted of spying for Germany in France, was executed in 1917. In total seven Dutch citizens were executed by the British, French, and Germans. Many more were imprisoned.Ruis, Edwin. Spynest. British and German Espionage from Neutral Holland 1914‚Äì1918. Briscombe: The History Press, 2016.  Armed forces  On 31 July, the Dutch government ordered the full mobilization of its conscript armed forces of 200,000 men, including reserves and regional militias. The chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Cornelis Snijders, was promoted to full general and commander-in-chief, a position which only existed in wartime. Snijders was the first non-aristocratic Dutch general to become commander-in-chief; a position which, until then, had been reserved for senior princes of the House of Orange. The Dutch military strategy was purely defensive and rested on three pillars. First, there was the Dutch Water Line, a defensive ring of rivers and lowland surrounding the core Dutch region of Holland, that could be inundated. An older version had existed since the sixteenth century. The second line of defense was formed by a circle of 19th-century fortresses and further inundations around the capital of Amsterdam. The third pillar was the Veldleger or mobile field army, that would operate outside the Waterline in the rural eastern and southern provinces. In August 1914 the field army had an operational strength of 88,770 soldiers.Abbenhuis, Maartje M. The Art of Staying Neutral. The Netherlands in the First World War, 1914‚Äì1918. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 47. During the war, militarily sensitive border areas and places considered essential to national defense were declared to be in a state of siege, a status immediately below a state of war. There, military authorities ruled under martial law, and non-residents could only travel there with a special permit. These prohibited border areas were expanded during the war in order to fight espionage and restrict the access of suspect individuals. The main weapons used by the Dutch army were the M√§nnlicher rifle and the Schwarzlose machine gun, both manufactured in Austria. Artillery was German and French, but was mostly outdated. The fortifications were also outdated.Abbenhuis, pp. 50‚Äì51. At the start of the war, there was no air force, only a small aviation department within the army. During the war, foreign planes which crashed in Dutch territory were repaired to serve in the aviation department. = Volunteers in foreign armies = Some Dutchmen volunteered for service in the French, British, German or Austro-Hungarian armies, but exact numbers are unknown. The German army did not accept foreign volunteers unless they possessed German nationality; they were often directed to allied armies such as the Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian or Ottoman. Some immigrants from the Netherlands to Canada, and a few who lived in the United States, served with various Canadian regiments of the British Expeditionary Force. About 80 of those who served have been identified through the personnel records of the First World War held at Library and Archives Canada.  Refugees  After the German invasion of Belgium on 4 August 1914, one million Belgians‚Äîout of a total population of six million‚Äîfled their country to the Netherlands. The first wave consisted of Belgians of German descent, German-speaking East Europeans, and Jews, who fell victim to the Belgian public‚Äôs outrage directly after the invasion. Many chose to leave because their businesses and homes were raided by angry mobs. The second wave was caused by the German army‚Äôs invasion and its war crimes against civilians. Most of these refugees returned when the focus of military action became concentrated on the Western Front. Others moved on to England or France. An estimated 100,000 Belgians stayed in refugee camps during the war; the largest of the camps was in Nunspeet. As well as Belgian civilians, there were political refugees from Germany such as the German-American socialist Carl Minster, Germans escaping conscription into the army, and prisoners of war who had escaped from German camps ‚Äì mostly Russians, Ukrainians, and Poles. = Prisoners of war = Commemorative monument to interned Belgian POWs According to international law, soldiers of the warring nations who entered a neutral country were to be interned for the duration of the war. Of the soldiers who entered the Netherlands, on purpose or by mistake, 33,105 were Belgian, 1,751 British, 1,461 German, eight French, and four American. Among these prisoners were pilots who had flown into Dutch airspace and crashed.Roodt, Evelyn de. Oorlogsgasten. Vluchtelingen en krijgsgevangenen in Nederland tijdens de Eerste Wereldoorlog. Zaltbommel, 2000, pp. 16, 139‚Äì140, 173 The majority of Belgian and British internees had fled to the Netherlands after the fall of Antwerp in 1914. Belgian prisoners were held captive in a camp in Amersfoort. The camp initially had a very strict regime, but after a revolt that resulted in the death of seven Belgians, the rules softened. As the prisoners would not be released until the end of the war, their wives and children often sought accommodation in the vicinity. Most British prisoners of war were members of the 1st Royal Naval Brigade. They were interned in Groningen, where they were held captive under a mild regime, which allowed for trips into the city. Some British soldiers formed a cabaret group named The Timbertown Follies, which toured throughout the country. The proceeds were donated to charities. Many German soldiers entered the Netherlands by mistake. This occurred most frequently at the beginning of the war, as the border between the Netherlands and Belgium was confusing. The German prisoner of war camp was at Bergen in the province of North Holland. Deserters were not considered foreign soldiers when they entered neutral territory if they were unarmed, removed badges from their uniforms, and proclaimed themselves deserters to the proper authorities. Numbers are unknown, but the majority of deserters by far were German. As deserters had no right to free accommodation or food, some of them were voluntarily interned in POW camps.

The hotel is located adjacent to the Royal George Hotel on Stirling Terrace, once the commercial and social centre of town, overlooking Princess Royal Harbour. The building was named for the White Star Line, an important shipping and passenger line that once operated out of Albany. The current building was completed in 1910, built on the site of the former White Hart Hotel that was built in 1906 and demolished in 1910 to make way for the new hotel. Charles William Reddin owned and managed the hotel at this time. After being rebuilt the two storey building contained twenty-two bedrooms and various other common rooms and a large dining room. The downstairs area contained a larger dining room and the bar area, with large arched windows facing onto Stirling Terrace. The Stirling Terrace side of the building had a balcony with intricate timber balustrades. Reddin was still the hotel proprietor in 1916 but by 1919 George Marques was the proprietor. Clarence L. Braddock took over management of the hotel in 1939 and remained there until 1943. In 1993 the hotel was renovated again with the paint removed from the ground floor walls leaving exposed brickwork. The balcony has also been removed and replaced with a cantilevered canopy parapet. A brewery, called Tangleheads, was opened in the hotel in 2006. The brewery's unusual name is taken from the first brewery that was opened in by John Ward in Albany in the 1860s. Although Ward's brewery was called Ward‚Äôs Windmill Brewery it was colloquially known as Tangleheads after the beer's effect on its drinkers. In 2014 the hotel owners received a grant of 52,788 for conservation and repairs as part of a revitalization project along Stirling Terrance in readiness for Anzac Centenary commemorations.

A single-story ell extends to one side. Monhegan Island was purchased in 1777 by Henry Trefethern, a native of Kittery, Maine. After his death in 1806, the island was divided among his heirs, and property ownership diversified thereafter. His son, also named Henry, continued to exert significant influence in the affairs of the small community, and it was thus that the imposing house he built in 1826 acquired its name. The house was divided into a duplex not long after construction, to provide residential space for Henry's brother George.

Probably built between 1815 and 1820, it is a fine local example of a Federal period brick house, rivalling in quality those found in more urban environments of the period. It was probably built by John Davis, a local housewright of some renown. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The John Davis House stands on the west side of River Road (Maine State Route 9) in the rural community of Chelsea, opposite its junction with Pushard Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gable roof and four irregularly placed chimneys. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a semi-elliptical transom window. The remaining bays are filled with sash windows, set in rectangular openings, with granite sills and lintels. A single-story shed-roof porch extends to one side. The interior features high quality Federal period woodwork and massive granite fireplace sills. The house's construction date is uncertain. It was not standing when the earliest map was made of the area in 1815, and is referred to as the \\"John Davis Farm\\" in a deed from the 1860s. Davis was a well-known housewright in the region, and may have built the house not long after the land was surveyed. The house is nearly identical in form to houses found in surrounding towns.
