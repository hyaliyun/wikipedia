The line had been authorised in 1844 and a station was proposed for the village of Hest Bank, Lancashire, the following year. It opened in 1846 along with the line. The station continued to serve the village of Hest Bank until its closure in 1969. The site remains notable as being the point at which the present-day West Coast Main Line (WCML) comes nearest to the west coast. Views of Morecambe Bay can be glimpsed from trains on this section of the line. Meanwhile, the \\"little\\" North Western Railway had been formed to link Skipton to Lancaster and with the Morecambe Harbour and Railway planned to make a junction with the L&CR; at Hest Bank. Regrettably this never materialised. Hoping to develop an export trade in coke and other minerals, the L&CR; applied on its own account to build the branch to Morecambe, receiving permission in 1859. At this point the line was leased by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and it was the latter that built the branch as a double track opening in 1864. In time however the branch was singled, but with an increase in holiday trade a south facing curve was added to the junction during 1888. Later a part of the branch from Bare Lane was redoubled and is still open as the Morecambe Branch Line. Hest Bank station itself was of rugged stone construction, a two-storey station house with a booking hall below on the up (southbound) platform. It was next to a level crossing over a minor road linking the A589 with houses, a water treatment works and a caravan park further along the foreshore. A small cottage for the crossing keeper was provided on the down (coastal-facing) side along with a footbridge to connect the platforms. The down side also had two sidings, one providing a bay platform.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations.

During the 'thirties the station became remarkable as the only one between Preston and Carlisle with electric lighting, thanks to the ingenuity of a member of staff. Four camping coaches were positioned here by the London Midland Region from 1960 to 1963, then it increased to five until 1969. The goods yard closed on 2 December 1963 but the tracks were used for the camping coaches until the end of the 1969 season despite the station finally closing to passengers in February 1969.

The nearby signal box still stands although now disused. Its latter role, purely as a manually controlled gate box to supervise the adjacent level crossing and that at nearby Bolton-le- Sands, was brought to an end in the Spring of 2013. NR had published proposals to close the box here initially at the end of 2012, which was briefly postponed until February 2013 before the work was finally carried out in May.

Biography  Sita Devi was the daughter of the Maharaja of Pithapuram ‚Äì Sri Raja Rao Venkata Kumara Mahipati Surya Rau Bahadur Garu and his wife Sri Rani Chinnamamba Devi of Kapileswarapuram, Nuzvid Zamindari. Sita Devi first married M. R. Apparao Bahadur, Zamindar of Vuyyuru. By him she had one child, a son Rajah M. Viduth Kumar Apparao. She was very social and was also a very close friend of Princess Niloufer the daughter-in-law of the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad. She met her second husband, Pratap Singh Gaekwar of Baroda, at the Madras horse races in 1943. The Gaekwad was, at that time, considered the eighth richest man in the world. It was also reported he was the second richest Indian prince. The Gaekwad was mesmerised by Sita Devi. The lovers consulted with his legal team. The lawyers recommended that the Hindu Sita Devi convert to Mohammedanism. That would dissolve her marriage to the Zamindar under Indian law. She embraced Islam. The Gaekwad took her as his second wife in 1943, which caused consternation with the British authorities, as this violated the antibigamy laws that the previous Gaekwad of Baroda enacted. The British Viceroy in New Delhi summoned the Gaekwad to contest this marriage. The latter argued that the law applied to the subjects of Baroda, and that he being their monarch was exempt from this law. This was confirmed by the Viceroy's legal advisers. The British government accepted the marriage, but didn't refer to the Maharani as \\"Her Highness\\" as was the protocol for the consorts of rulers of princely states. In 1946, the Gaekwad took his second wife on a tour of Europe. The reason for their visit was to find a suitable residence away from India. They found that the independent principality of Monaco was a suitable place to set up their second home. They bought a mansion in Monte Carlo and the Maharani took up permanent residence there. The Gaekwad visited often, bringing some of the great treasures of Baroda to Monaco. The Maharani became the custodian of these treasures.Tribune India 18 August 2002 The couple also made two trips to the United States after the war. They went on a spending spree, buying all types of luxurious items. It was widely reported they spent $10 million on one of those trips. Indian officials audited the principality's finances. They concluded the Gaekwad had taken several large interest-free loans from the Baroda treasury. They demanded that these be returned. The prince complied by making several payments from his $8 million-a-year income. The princely couple transferred a copious amount from the Baroda treasury, including some of its most famous jewellery, including four celebrated pearl carpets, a famed seven-strand necklace of priceless pearls (called the Baroda pearls), a three-strand diamond necklace with the famous Pink Brazilian Star of the South diamond and the English Dresden diamond. The princely couple also had custody of the Empress Eugenie diamond. When Baroda was integrated into the newly independent India, Indian officials were eventually able to recover some of the items, but some of the jewels had been transferred to the Maharani's ownership. In 1965, she purchased a painting in Paris from Daniel Wildenstein, believing it to be La Po√©sie by Fran√ßois Boucher. When it was discovered to be a fake, she sued Wildenstein in an English court despite both her and him residing in France. The case, Maharanee of Baroda v Wildenstein, established an important rule regarding the presence of a defendant in conflict of laws. Years after the Maharani's death some of the precious items were discovered. In 1994 the pearl carpet was found in a Geneva vault. It was sold to an Arab prince for $31 million. Currently this carpet is displayed at the Museum of Islamic Art, Doha, in Qatar, even though it was commissioned by an Indian Hindu Maharaja and not by an Islamic ruler. The Star of the South and other gems were located with jewellers in Amsterdam. After Maharani's death a part of her inheritance was transferred to her niece (daughter of Rani Manjula Devi of the Sidli family) Anangarekha Devi who currently lives in Assam with her family. Eventually, India, due to the discrepancies and possible fraud, deposed the Gaekwad in 1951 and his eldest son by his first wife succeeded him. Technically, the couple were not heads of state any longer, but they insisted on still being referred to by their former titles.The Maharajahs; by John Lord 1971 Random House She gave the Gaekwad one son, born in 1945, his name was Sayaji Rao Gaekwad (8 March 1945 ‚Äì 8 May 1985). Nicknamed \\"Princie\\",The Princie Diamond was so named in his honor he was the apple of her eye. She attended some of the most exclusive events on the globeTime Magazine Sept 13, 1968 and partied with other international luminaries, e.g. Aristotle Onassis.Time Magazine 21 March 1969 In 1953 the Maharani sold a pair of bejewelled anklets to Harry Winston. They had several large emeralds and diamonds. The jeweller set these stones into a spectacular necklace that was bought by the Duchess of Windsor Wallace Simpson. The Duchess wore this to a 1957 New York ball also attended by Sita Devi. When other guests were admiring the necklace. The Maharani was heard to exclaim that those jewels looked just as nice on her feet. The embarrassed Duchess returned the necklace to Winston.Internetstones.com The Maharani was a car enthusiast and was reportedly very fond of her Mercedes W126, which was custom made for her by Mercedes-Benz. At the 1969 Ascot Gold Cup she invited guests to touch the sapphire on her right hand for good luck. Esquire Magazine included Sita Devi and Princie on its list of \\"fun couples\\" for 1969. Sita Devi divorced the Gaekwad in 1956. He promptly moved to London.Time Magazine 26 March 1956 Even after the dissolution of her second marriage, she clung to her exalted title. Her Rolls-Royce still sported the armorial insignia of Baroda. She would reminisce about the days when she was referred to as royalty and received 101-gun salutes. Prince Rainier awarded citizenship of Monaco to both Sita Devi and Princie. Time Magazine 20 January 1975 She maintained a Paris apartment as well. She continued to live in grand style, drinking Baron de Rothschild's Bordeaux, rearranging her Louis XVI furniture and attending exclusive parties. When travelling she brought along a large wardrobe, reported to be a thousand saris, hundreds of pairs of shoes and of course her jewellery. But her finances were eventually reduced enough for her to secretly auction some of her beloved jewels in 1974. The Maharani suffered a tragedy in 1985, when Princie committed suicide one night when after his 40th birthday. His death was attributed to alcoholism and drug addiction. Sita Devi died four years later of natural causes. Some speculated it was due to a broken heart.

Founded in 2002, the festival screens in competition and out-of-competetion American and international independent films. According to the Daily Record, the festival is \\"an anticipated event among the international independent film community and an economic development driver for North Florida.\\" History The Inaugural Jacksonville Film Festival debuted May 15-18, 2003 with the opening film The Flying Ace, made by Norman Studios in Jacksonville, Florida in 1926. In addition to screening films, the festival hosts panels, workshops and parties. Jacksonville Film Festival was conceived by Joan Monsky and Karen Sadler in the spring of 2002. They assembled a small advisory group of community leaders and arts advocates to create a mission and a template for the event which was ambitiously scheduled for May 2003. In that year Jacksonville Film Festival became a non-profit organization. The Robin Shepherd Group designed the turtle logo and creative graphics, the city and the Times-Union declared their support, Preston Haskell contributed wisdom and encouragement (and more), and Erik Hart offered space and services at the Florida Theatre. Sponsors also took a leap of faith, and volunteers were generous with hours and hours of time and effort. Joan Monsky was elected president and brought in programmers to help guide the artistic vision. After long, arduous planning sessions, the First Annual Jacksonville Film Festival made its successful debut. In 2003, The mission of the Festival was threefold: to connect Jacksonville to its early \\"Hollywood of the South\\" moviemaking roots, to focus attention on independent film and filmmakers, and to contribute to the revitalization of downtown Jacksonville. Six downtown venues hosted films, parties and special events including the popular Entertainment Law Panel and Viva Cinema. Downtown was also alive with movie buffs, movie stars and movie guests. A year later in 2004, Bill Murray received the honor of the Tortuga Verde Award for Lifetime Achievement. The screening of Napoleon Dynamite got world-wide press for the seasons biggest hit film and Director Christopher Coppola screened his latest film \\"The Creature of Sunnyside Trailer Park\\" at the historic Florida Theater. In 2005, The festival added new initiatives: Books Alive!, a monthly program in partnership with the Jacksonville Public Library, celebrating family films derived from literature and REEL People, the film festival \\"fan club\\" offering year-round screenings of diverse and unique films never before seen in Jacksonville. In 2006, John Travolta's film Lonely Hearts was the headline film in the 2006 Jacksonville Film Festival. In 2007, the Jacksonville Film Festival celebrated its fifth year. The festival has been embraced by the city and is gaining increasing recognition in the Southeast as an important destination for the independent film community. A key to the success has been the festival commitment to offering \\"Something for Everyone!\\" 2008 will be known as the year of significant change. Jesse Rodriguez took the helm as Executive and program director, and along with the board of directors, extended the festival to a full week incorporating programs such as A TASTE OF ASIA, EUROPA EUROPA, HIP HOP FOR THE MASSES, as well as A MOMENT OF SILENCE PLEASE, a film program for the Deaf. The concept for a FILM FESTIVAL VILLAGE was also realized making all the venues and hotel within walking distance of each other. Now as an international film festival, over 20 countries were represented through cinema in 2008. In 2018, Jacksonville Film Festival returned in September 2018 after a six-year hiatus.

Located one mile west of Woodward Avenue, the University District is named for its neighbor to the south, the University of Detroit Mercy (UDM).University of Detroit Mercy retrieved 27 April 2015 The neighborhood is bounded on the north by residential Seven Mile Road, on the south by McNichols Road and the UDM campus, and on the east by the Detroit Golf Club and Golf Club Estates. The western boundary is Livernois Avenue: once known to Detroiters as \\"the Avenue of Fashion\\", this commercial boulevard of small shops is becoming ‚ÄúGallery Row,‚Äù home to a growing collection of art galleries and art-related businesses. University District is also seeing a surge in the number of LGBTQ families moving into the neighborhood, which engulfs and relives the history of the district. The University District was the first organized neighborhood in the City of Detroit to recognize, embrace, and support Gay and Lesbian persons, dating back to the 1950s. A number of Gay and Lesbian themed bars and nightclubs were only minutes from the District. During the white flight, LGBTQ residents relocated to nearby Ferndale, MI.  Architecture  The University District's 1,200 single family homes were built mainly during the \\"golden age of housing\\" from 1925-1930 and 1937-1941, when construction technology was highly developed, building costs were low, and old world craftsmen were in plentiful supply. The homes reflect a wide variety of styles: English Tudor, Romanesque, Italianate, Spanish Mission, French Provincial, Queen Anne, Georgian, Federalist, Art Moderne, and contemporary. The predominant Tudor style, consistent setbacks, rear-of-lot garages, and mature shade trees provide a coherent design aesthetic that gives the University District its distinctive visual identity. Interior features include intricate plasterwork, leaded or stained glass windows, oak paneled libraries, hand-pegged hardwood floors, one or more fireplaces, Pewabic Pottery tile, and crystal chandeliers. Most homes offer four to six bedrooms, a minimum of three bathrooms, two-car garages, and a fully finished basement that includes a furnace room, laundry room, fitness room and a large family room with wet bar and fireplace. Many of these family rooms have now been converted to home theaters. The District also includes two small apartment buildings and 80 duplex homes, many of which are occupied by University faculty and graduate students. Detroit's only Frank Lloyd Wright home, the Dorothy H. Turkel House, sits just outside the District on Seven Mile Road.  Amenities and cultural resources  Amenities in the University District include the Belden Tot Lot and Gesu Community Green and Garden. Nearby are the running track at UDM, Northwest Activities Center, the venerable Detroit Golf Club, and Palmer Park's playing fields, tennis courts, and public golf course. Cultural resources include the UDM Theatre Company in performance at Marygrove College, the Detroit Repertory Theater, and world-renowned Baker's Keyboard Lounge, as well as Sherwood Forest, Lincoln and Parkman Branch Libraries.  Community organization  The University District Community Association consists of 15 elected Board members.University District Community Association retrieved 18 Feb 2016 UDCA functions include publishing a quarterly newsletter, maintaining a website, sponsoring a volunteer radio patrol and walking tours of the neighborhood, planning social events, snowplowing non-emergency streets, and organizing support for neighborhood schools, community-wide yard sales, and biennial Home and Garden Tours. Surrounding communities include the Golf Club Estates, Palmer Woods, Green Acres, Sherwood Forest, Bagley Community, and Martin Park. All are part of the 12th Precinct Coalition and University Commons, umbrella organizations that address issues of area-wide interest. The University District is a Detroit Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ), entitling home buyers to reduced property taxes for up to 15 years.  History  The area now called the University District was originally farmland in the survey township of Greenfield, Michigan, organized by its residents in 1833 and named for its prosperous farms. A typical title abstract in the neighborhood shows a first sale by the \\"United States of America, Martin Van Buren, President\\", on April 1, 1837. The University District was annexed to the City of Detroit in the election of November 7, 1916. In November 1920, John P. McNichols, S.J., the newly appointed president of the University of Detroit, traveled with armed companions from the campus on Jefferson Avenue in downtown Detroit to Six Mile Road (then known as Palmer Boulevard, now called McNichols Road). He carried a satchel supposedly containing $120,000 in cash (it contained sliced newspaper‚Äîthe cash was in his overcoat) to purchase the farm that is now the Main Campus of the University of Detroit Mercy. Four months later, 33 building lots along Livernois north of Palmer were sold in a three-day period. Gesu Catholic Church was soon established despite proximity to the Seven Mile and Livernois area. For several decades, the southwest quadrant of the University District was home to large Catholic families, including that of Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanagh. In the 1920s and 1930s, the first homeowners were primarily realtors, senior partners in law firms and insurance agencies, or the owners and managers of prosperous Detroit businesses. Notable residents have included business owners such as Stanley Winkleman of the Detroit department store chain bearing his name, and musicians from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Concertmaster Mischa Mischakoff entertained visiting conductors and soloists at his University District home. The visiting musicians autographed the wallpaper in the foyer, which remained until 2015. The paper began to deteriorate and was professionally removed and preserved. Half of the paper was donated to the DSO archives and the other half was donated to the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library. Fairfield Street was often called Orchestra Row. A number of symphony musicians lived in the homes between Clarita and Margarita and their repair and maintenance staff lived nearby as well. African-American families began moving into the University District in the 1960s, depicted on stage in Palmer Park, a play by Joanna Glass, who lived in the neighborhood during that time.

His cartoons were syndicated across Canada and the United States, and he is considered one of Canada's most productive cartoonists. Biography Born in York County, Ontario in 1920, Roy was first published at the age of 14 in the school newspaper at Runnymede Collegiate in Toronto. His father was an athlete and Chief of Police in Swansea, where Roy explored the community between High Park and the Humber River, observing the differences between life as lived and as perceived and recorded. He said his first drawing instruction came from an architectural student who, courting Roy's older sister, needed to keep the youngster occupied with something else. Receiving no formal art training, Carless was inspired and mentored by the late Duncan Macpherson, editorial cartoonist for the Toronto Star, who nominated Carless to membership in the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists in 1971. Roy was the first labour cartoonist to be accepted by the organization. Most of Carless' originals are now in Canada's national archives (Library and Archives Canada). Copies are also in several Presidential libraries and in university collections. His work has hung in shows in the Art Gallery of Ontario, the International Salon of Cartoons in Montreal, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Hamilton Public Library, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Civilization and the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, the National Headquarters of the Canadian Labour Council, and shows in the cities of Quebec, Paris, Boston, Washington, and the Vatican. In 2006, Seraphim Editions published a retrospective of Roy Carless' life and work titled \\"the Carless Cartoon Collection, not bad for an old bastard.\\" Carless died Friday morning, January 2, 2009, in Hamilton, Ontario. He was 88. Cartoons Signed as \\"Roi\\", Carless cartoons have been published in independent and labour publications in both official languages and in every province of Canada right to the Arctic Circle. His work has appeared in each of the United States and its territories from Guam to Puerto Rico. At his peak, Carless created for more than twenty publications with a combined circulation exceeding three million copies, drawing to meet the specific needs of each publication. Remarkably, he did this while working full-time on an assembly line in Hamilton, Canada, and while chief steward of the union that represented employees in the plant. \\"I worked with a witty bunch of guys; my editorial board was the guys at the shop,\\" Roy said about the inspiration for much of his humour.

The village has an approximate population of 350. History The village was first documented in 1295 in the Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis\\" as \\"Chotors\\". The first wooden church for the village existed before 1293. At the initiative of Anna Barbara von Gaschin, construction began in 1782 for a new church for the village. Permission was given by the Bishop of Breslau on January 31, construction began in February, and by October the building was already covered with a roof. On a ball on the decorative spire of the church is written \\"Franz Herzog von Gaschin, highly born, married to Anna Barbara von Garnier, decided for the greater honor of God to give money to build a new church.\\" The document ends \\"This document has been placed on this ball by me, Pastor Carl Padiery, for the good of future generations. The parish celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1882 though a small exhibition of documents detailing its history collected by its then- priest, Father Kahl, who was an avid scholar. In 1840 the village had 385 inhabitants, and a large new school was built. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 164 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 164 voted to join the newly created state of Poland.Results of the Upper Silesia plebiscite (in German) However, because citizens of Gemeinde Turawa overall voted for Germany, the village remained part of the Weimar Republic. In 1933 the village had 547 inhabitants. On 19 May 1936 the village was renamed Gro√ü Kochen by Nazi officials because of its Slavic-sounding name. By 1939 the village had shrunk to only 474 inhabitants. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Oppeln The village is situated near the Turawa Reservoir, which was begun in 1933 with construction of the dam and then completed in 1938. During its contraction, 3 million cubic tons of earth were moved, 225 thousand tons of stone, 10 thousand tons of cement and the same amount of reinforced steel. The construction of the dam destroyed several villages, and villagers from three (Zamoscie, Krzysline, and Vorwerk Kuchara) were resettled in Gro√ü Kottorz. However, it also brought development to the area. After 1945, Silesia as a whole was annexed by Poland, and most of the German population was expelled. The village was renamed Kot√≥rz Wielki. Though it originally placed in Silesian Voivodeship, in 1950 it was moved to Opole Voivodeship instead. On 8 March 2012, the old German name Gro√ü Kottorz was again made official. The town has a volunteer fire brigade, founded in 1934. It organizes may dances for the residents through the \\"Firemen's Club\\". It also organizes a traditional Silesian carnival known as \\"leading the bear\\" (\\"Wodzenie nied≈∫wiedzia\\" in Polish, \\"B√§hrenf√ºhren\\" in German), through which it gets donations for maintenance.

Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II). The village has an approximate population of 900. History Though the origins of the village are not known, local legend states that the rich forests around the village were used as a hunting ground by the Dukes of Oppeln, who built a hunting lodge in the area. The first documents that mention Turawa are from the beginning of the sixteenth century, and mention two estates, both named Kuchar, belonging to the village of Gro√ü Kottorz. One of them was Turawa, while the second was located on a site now flooded by the Turawa Reservoir. The name was probably given around 1562 by Georg von K√∂nigsfeld, the owner of the manor the settlement was located on. The settlement, along with its hamlets of Marscholken and ≈Åyczyna continued to belong to the village of Gro√ü Kottorz until the eighteenth century. In 1712, the settlement and the surrounding property was sold by Franz Karl von Blankovsky to Martin Scholtz von L√∂wencron of Kamienitz and Wieschowa, who began construction of the present palace. His son, Joseph, died childless in 1759 and his widow, Anna Barbara von Garnier, remarried Franz Adam Count von Gaschin. After her death in 1804, Turawa was owned for years by a brother, Franz Xavier von Garnier. From then until the end of World War II the village was ones by the von Garnier family, who in 1841 received the title of count (with the name Count von Garnier-Turawa.) In those times Turawa had 581 inhabitants. The last owner of turawa was Hubertus Count von Garnier-Turawa, a member of the Prussian Landtag (1925-1932), who died in 1952 in Unterw√∂ssen in Bavaria. At the end of the nineteenth century, a chapel and cemetery were built on Bald Hill near the village, which came to be considered one of the most beautiful religious buildings in Turawa. However, after 1945 the building was systematically devastated as part of the Communist government's anti- German campaign. In 1965 the chapel was blown up, and in 1976 the ruins were removed. In the 1930s, a project came up for consideration in Oppeln for the construction of an artificial reservoir to protect the city against flooding. Hubertus von Garnier offered his own lands west of Turawa for the project. In 1933 the project was submitted to the German government, receiving the personal approval of Adolf Hitler. Construction on the 22 km¬≤ reservoir finished in 1938. As a result of the project, several small villages were flooded, and many of their citizens were relocated to Turawa. Since 1945, after the occupation of Silesia by the Red Army and Soviet authorities, Turawa became the seat of the municipality, with its first mayor, Roch Stotko. Palace Construction on the current palace in Turawa began in 1730 at the behest of Martin Scholtz von L√∂wenckron to plans by the Oppeln-based architect Adam Tentschert. In 1751 his son, Joseph, expanded the palace, adding a chapel with bell tower. It was again expanded in 1761 with the construction of the north wing and entrance gate. In 1847 Karl Count von Garnier completely refurbished the somewhat neglected palace. In 1937, the family von Garnier gave the palace to be used as an orphanage. After the Second World War, in 1949, the palace was given to the Children's Home of Turawa. After a fire in the offices of the district council building, it also housed temporarily the municipal offices. Between 1964-1965 the palace was remodeled to better suit the needs of the orphans. To this day, it preserves a mixture of Baroque, neo- Renaissance, and neo-Rococo architecture, including marble fireplaces, Baroque bookshelves, gilded wall deceptions and stucco, and a grand ballroom. The park surrounding the palace is filled with interesting old trees, including white oak, ash, and linden.

This prefetches the file so that when it is subsequently accessed, its contents are read from the main memory (RAM) rather than from a hard disk drive (HDD), resulting in much lower file access latencies. Many Linux distributions use readahead on a list of commonly used files to speed up booting. In such a setup, if the kernel is booted with the boot parameter, it will record all file accesses during bootup and write a new list of files to be read during later boot sequences. This will make additional installed services start faster, because they are not included in the default readahead list. In Linux distributions that use systemd, readahead binary (as part of the boot sequence) was replaced by systemd-readahead. However, support for readahead was removed from systemd in its version 217, being described as unmaintained and unable to provide expected performance benefits. Certain experimental page-level prefetching systems have been developed to further improve performance.  In filesystem  Bcache support readahead of files and metadata.

History The name of this village derived from its location; until 1945 it was called 'Bergvorwerk, meaning \\"estate on the mountain\\". The owners of the estate, amounting to 1000 hectares of arable land, were the von Gaffron- Prittwitz family, descendants of Hussars rewarded by Frederick the Great of Prussia for their loyalty with a large fief. After the death of the last member of the family, Alexander Friedrich von Gaffron-Prittwitz (1845-1923), his widow sold the estate, along with one in nearby Kasimir. The land was then parceled out into a dozen large farms, including one belonging to Alois Dambon of nearby Roschowitzwald. In the 1930s a waterworks for Oberglogau was built in the town. There is also a Neolithic archeological site in the town. After 1945, when Silesia was given to Poland, the town was renamed Strok√≥w, and then renamed again to G√≥reczno.

In analogy with the genome, where the genome is the total set of genes, the receptorome can be considered the total set of genes giving rise to receptors or receptor molecules. It could also be seen as the total number of receptor proteins in a certain organism. The human receptorome constitutes at least 5% of the human genome. It encodes receptors that mediate the physiological, pathological and therapeutic responses to both exogenous and endogenous ligands. Several in silico (on a chip) and physical screening methods have been devised to mine the receptorome efficiently and \\"mass- screening\\" substances towards a huge set of receptors to study effect and interaction.http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/short/280/7/5129 In practice, the receptorome now is considered to encompass not only traditional receptors but also ion channels and transporters in the human genome that are potential drug targets. Some of the most renowned types are the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) - targets for many medications.http://jop.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/20/4_suppl/41 One of the most active areas of search for ligands to receptors, are in the field of brain receptors. In the hunt for psychopharmacologically active substances, psychoactive plant products are screened towards a receptorome array. Apart from finding new substances, discovering the molecular mechanisms responsible for these substances' actions will likely give insights into the molecular underpinnings of human consciousness.

It had a population of 965 in December 2013.  Name  The village has had numerous names in its history. It was named Lubra by its founder, and over the next few centuries was known as Lubrac, Lubrzi and Leuber (in that order.) Leuber being the German name for the village, it kept that name until it became part of Poland in 1946, Switching to its current name of Lubrza.  History  The village was first mentioned in the will of the founder of the village, dated 1233. For the next few centuries, there were a few scattered references to the village, often under different names. Over all this time, Lubrza had been ruled by the Piast dynasty, first as part of Poland then part of the Duchies of Silesia, but the Duchies were no more than a vassal to the neighbouring Kingdom of Bohemia. It was taken by the Habsburg Monarchy in 1526, Only to be taken by Prussia in 1742 in the Silesian Wars.http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/austrian-succession-war- the-first-silesian- war.htmlhttp://www.emersonkent.com/map_archive/silesia_1756.htm After the Franco-Prussian wars and the creation of a unified Germany, Lubrza became part of the German Empire.

It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and exterior finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and shingling. The main facade is asymmetrical, with a full-height polygonal window bay on the right, and a stack of three porches on the left, supported by square posts and topped by a gable. It has bands of decorative shingling between the levels and brackets in the extended eaves. Some windows have lights with stained glass. The house was built about 1914, during a major eastward expansion of residential three- decker construction. The house's early tenants were ethnically diverse, drawn from other immigrant neighborhoods of the city. Anthony Zemaitis, the first owner, was a machinist; his tenants were a patternmaker and traffic manager.

She pushed for a commission to investigate 9/11 and to establish a memorial. Eckert died at age 57 on February 12, 2009, in the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in Clarence Center, New York. She had met with President Barack Obama just a few days before her death in her role as an advocate for those affected by 9/11. Before the September 11 attack Eckert was born in 1951 in Buffalo, New York, and met her future husband, Sean P. Rooney, at a dance at Canisius High School, a Jesuit-run academy in that city, when both were 16 years old. Eckert attended the Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls high school in Eggertsville, New York. She received a degree in fine arts in 1975 from Buffalo State College, where in 2005 she gave the Baccalaureate Commencement Address. Rooney lived in Buffalo until 1978, working as a manager of restaurants, until he began working in the financial services industry and moving to Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut. When he died he was a vice president for risk management services at the Aon Corporation. He worked on the 98th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower, one of 32 employees in Aon's offices there. The couple, who had no children and lived in the Glenbrook section of Stamford, Connecticut, had been married 21 years when Rooney died. Before Rooney's death, they had celebrated their 50th birthdays with vacations to Vermont, to mark his, and Morocco, to mark hers. September 11, 2001 When the planes hit the World Trade Center, Rooney called his wife and exchanged voice mail messages with her. To get to safety, he made his way to the 105th floor of his building, trying to reach the roof, when he became trapped until the tower collapsed, killing him. After Eckert learned about the attacks, she went home and stayed on the phone with her husband until she heard the tower collapse.

Founded in 1948 as the African Girls High School, it is within walking distance from its brother school Alliance High School.  History  Founded in 1948 by the Alliance of Protestant Missions, Alliance Girls' High School was the first institution of higher secondary education for African girls in Kenya, and served in parallel with Kenya High School which at that time only admitted European girls. Before Kenyan independence it was called African Girls High School. Alliance Girls High School sits on 71 acres of land in Kiambu West district, Central Province, originally donated by the Presbyterian Church of East Africa.Akyeampong, Emmanuel Kwaku, and Henry Louis Gates (eds) (2012). Dictionary of African Biography, Vol. 4, pp. 295; 473. The school's first principal, Jean Wilkinson (n√©e Ewan), was a Scottish missionary. Joan Waithaka, one of the first students to graduate from the school, became its first African principal in 1969. She also served on the 1976 Gachathi Report committee which recommended that the Kenyan government adopt policies which would increase women's participation not only in higher education but also in science and other male-dominated spheres in the country.Kiluva-Ndunda, Mutindi Mumbua (2001). Women's Agency and Educational Policy, p. 78. State University of New York Press. The first 10 girls admitted to the school arrived on 28 February 1948 and came from the all the different provinces in Kenya as is still the case today. In 1961, Alliance Girls High School was one of the first five schools in Africa to offer the Higher School Certificate (at the time, the equivalent of A Levels and a requirement for university entrance).Eshiwani, George S. (1993). Education in Kenya Since Independence, pp. 37; 52. East African Publishers. Prior to the establishment of Alliance Girls High School, a few girls had been admitted to the predominantly male Alliance High School. One of the last girls to graduate from there was the writer Rebeka Njau who later taught at the Alliance Girls High School.Busby, Margaret (1992). Daughters of Africa, p. 415. Pantheon Books.

It has been defined as \\"research without a clear goal\\" and \\"curiosity-driven science\\". It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"basic research\\". Proponents of this mode of science argue that unanticipated scientific breakthroughs are sometimes more valuable than the outcomes of agenda-driven research, heralding advances in genetics and stem cell biology as examples of unforeseen benefits of research that was originally seen as purely theoretical in scope. Because of the inherently uncertain return on investment, blue-sky projects are politically and commercially unpopular and tend to lose funding to more reliably profitable or practical research. Terminology The term blue sky research probably comes from the notion that such research does not relate to what is on the ground realities about rather to 'untouchable' sky. History Support for blue skies research has varied over time, ultimately becoming subject to the political process, in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Vannevar Bush's 1945 report, Science: The Endless Frontier, made the argument for the value of basic research in the postwar era, and was the basis for many appeals to the federal funding of basic research. The 1957 launch of Sputnik prompted the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research to sponsor blue skies research into the 1960s. By the 1970s, financial strains brought pressure on public expenditure on the sciences, first in the UK and the Netherlands, and by the 1990s in Germany and the United States. In 1980, British Petroleum (known as BP after 2000) established a blue skies research initiative called the Venture Research Unit, headed by particle physicist Donald Braben. Braben controversially challenged peer review as the mechanism for establishing funding, emphasizing the selection of researchers whose proposals \\"could radically change the way we think about something important.\\" In 2005, Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust and former Professor of Medicine at Imperial College, London warned that excessive emphasis on agenda-driven research could jeopardise serendipitous advances in science: > The Government is right to recognise the importance of science and > technology, but I think it is a mistake to try to ring-fence funds. There is > a serious danger that we will spend money on projects that are less good. It > is absolutely key that funding is used to support the best scientists with > the best ideas. When UK research councils introduced a requirement that grant application include a 2-page statement on the economic impact of the proposed work, 20 scientists, including 1996 Nobel laureate Harold Kroto, wrote a public letter to Times Higher Education condemning the requirement and calling for peer reviewers to ignore the additional documentation. Grants and conferences The Royal Society grants up to 1 million pounds sterling annually in Theo Murphy Blue Skies awards to fund \\"research which is considered to be original and exciting but lacks a sufficient evidence base in the literature to be supported by traditional grant schemes.\\" The UK-based Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) operates a program called the IDEAS Factory, intended to promote \\"blue sky, curiosity-led research.\\" The international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) holds a \\"Blue Sky Forum\\" every decade.  Subjects  Owing to its radical nature, blue sky science may challenge accepted scientific paradigms and introduce entirely new fields of study. It has been the inspiration for numerous works of science fiction. It has sometimes been concerned with topics such as unexplained phenomena and the impact of future technologies upon society, asking questions such as \\"How would a spacecraft traverse a black hole and where would it arrive upon leaving it?\\" and \\"Will the universe end, or will it just expand ever outwards for eternity?\\" Bibliography * * * See also * Applied science * Instrumentalism * Pure mathematics * Applied mathematics References ;General * ;Specific Category:Philosophy of science Category:Research ","title":"Blue skies research"},{"id":"21524324","text":"Borycz () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Izbicko, within Strzelce County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

He was born in Antwerp in 1924, where his British father was working as a diamond dealer for De Beers. He was a great-grandson of the scholar Eliezer Liepman Philip Prins (1835-1915). His grandfather, Julius, was the founding president of the Adath Yisroel Synagogue in London. He moved to London as a child where he was educated. He worked during World War II in a Spitfire engine factory making diamond tools. He began to work under his father but disliked working for De Beers, so he established his own firm, Industrial Diamond Company, exploiting the niche market for industrial diamonds. He took over his father's dealer business in 1949 and later expanded into mining. By the 1980s, his company had annual sales of $100 million.Hoffman, Allison. \\"Treasure Trove\\". Tablet magazine, 9 September 2009, accessed 8 April 2010 In 1948, Lunzer married Ruth Zippel, the Italian-born daughter of a Polish merchant.

Lunzer has five adult daughters: Margaret, Myra, Fiona, Alison and Caroline. Ruth Lunzer died in 1978. The daughters are the beneficiaries of the Valmadonna Trust. Lunzer died peacefully at home on 18 December 2016.  The Valmadonna Trust Library  Lunzer's interest was originally invested in racehorses. By the 1950s that interest turned to collecting rare Hebrew books. Over the next six decades, he advised the Trustees of the Valmadonna Trust Library in respect of their acquisition of 13,000 books and manuscripts .

In February 2009, the Valmadonna Trust Library was exhibited by Sotheby's in New York. After visiting the exhibition at Sotheby's, a scholar from the Drisha Institute wrote of Lunzer's achievement: > \\"The morning of our visit, I studied the commentary of Rabbi David Kimhi, > who is known as the Radak, on Joseph's conflict with his brothers. Honestly, > it felt like just another of the many rabbinic commentaries... Then I went > to the Valmadonna. Peering closely at one of the oldest manuscripts, I saw > that it was a volume of Psalms with the Radak's commentary. In that instant, > time and space collapsed as I found myself bound to every other Jew who has > studied Kimhi's work since it was penned in the late 12th and early 13th > centuries. That moment made clear to me that I am not simply a modern Jew > studying in a contemporary yeshiva near Lincoln Center. I am tied to every > other Jew through 800 years of history. I envision Kimhi hunched over his > work, and wonder if his soul knows that even still we are learning from him, > that his elucidation remains as relevant to the study of biblical text as it > was to his contemporaries. The books of the Valmadonna ‚Äì the books of our > people ‚Äì bring history alive [and] keep our history alive even when the > communities that produce them are long dead\\".Cohen, Debra Nussbaum. > \\"Receiving the Original Text Messages\\". The Jewish Daily Forward. May 13, > 2009 (issue of May 22, 2009) In December 2015, Sotheby's New York presided over the sale of the Daniel Bomberg Babylonian Talmud (1519-1523) from the Valmadonna Trust for $9.3 million, the copy that Lunzer obtained in trade from Westminster Abbey in 1980., accessed 5 January 2016. In 1956, Jack Lunzer, the custodian of the Valmadonna Trust attended an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum celebrating 300 years of Jewish resettlement in England. There, he first became aware of Westminster Abbey's magnificent complete copy of the Talmud. For nearly a quarter century, Mr. Lunzer courted the Abbey in an attempt to acquire it. Eventually, he persuaded his Trustees to purchase a 900-year old copy (actually an early-mediaeval forgery) of Westminster Abbey's original charter and presented it to the Abbey, along with supporting endowments. In grateful recognition of this singular act of largesse, the Abbey awarded the custodian its magnificent copy of the Bomberg Talmud. In January 2017, the Valmadonna Trust Library was sold to the National Library of Israel through a private sale arranged by Sotheby's. David Blumberg, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Library of Israel, said: > ‚ÄúThe Valmadonna Trust Library represents an historic addition to our leading > collection of Jewish manuscripts, prints and books, which reflect and embody > the cultures of the Jewish people around the world and across the ages‚Äù. The Valmadonna Trust Library will be housed in the National Library of Israel's landmark new building in Jerusalem, due to open to the public in 2022.

Previously a stop on the Midland Great Western Railway's main line to Galway and later on the main route between Dublin and stations in County Mayo, the station was closed in 1987. As of 2015, the line and station at Moate form part of the Athlone to Mullingar Cycleway. History The station was first opened in 1851, and located on the Midland Great Western Railway's line to Galway. The station formed part of the main route between Dublin, County Galway and County Mayo until 1973, when C√≥ras Iompair √âireann transferred the majority of these services to the Great Southern and Western Railway route from Portarlington. At this point, services were cut back until finally the station was closed in 1987, severing the rail link between Athlone and Mullingar. Developments in the Irish economy in the 1990s and 2000s led to a re-evaluation of the need for an extended railway network, and the Irish government's Transport 21 plan had seen several rail expansion projects implemented, to restore several sections of the rail network. However, the line from Mullingar to Athlone via Moate was not included in these proposals, in spite of the Strategic Rail Review which led to the Transport 21 proposals recommending that it be reopened.What's Missing - Transport 21 This led to criticism in 2006 from the local community, and calls for Iarnr√≥d √âireann to rethink this.Local groups demand railway revolution - Sunday Business Post, 17/09/06 Ultimately however, the line and station remained closed. Cycleway The proposal to reopen the line was dropped in favour of creating a cycling route known as the Dublin- Galway Greenway. Part of this cycleway uses the Athlone-Mullingar rail route. Work began in early 2015 including works at Moate station. The Mullingar (West) to Garrycastle (Athlone East) section of the Galway to Dublin Cycleway was opened on 3 October 2015 by the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Moate.\\\\- Galway to Dublin Cycleway website, October 2015 References Category:Disused railway stations in County Westmeath Category:Proposed railway stations in the Republic of Ireland Category:Dublin-Galway Greenway ","title":"Moate railway station"},{"id":"21524519","text":"The Burke Special was a TV series broadcast on BBC1 in the United Kingdom from 15 June 1972 to 13 May 1976.

It is the site of the annual Surin Elephant Round-up. , Surin has an estimated population of 39,179. Etymology The first part of the name Sur- originates from the Sanskrit word Sura (Devanagari: ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞) meaning \\"God\\" (cf. Asura), and the second part -in(thara) from Sanskrit is \\"Indra\\" (Devanagari: ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞). Hence the name of the province literally means Lord Indra. Geography In the north of the province is the valley of the Mun river, a tributary of the Mekong. To the south of the province is the Dongrek mountain chain, which also forms the boundary to Cambodia. The central and northern parts of the province are undulating flood plains. Climate Surin has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Aw). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from late April through early October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. History Prehistory The earliest settlers in this region were hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic, with the introduction of agriculture, dates from 2,500 to 1,500 years BCE. The Bronze Age dates from 1,500-500 BCE, and the Iron Age from 500 BCE to 500 CE. It is in the Iron Age that the first evidence of human settlement emerges in the province, with approximately sixty known Iron Age sites. Historical period The earliest known historical period is the Dvaravati. This was an Indian-based culture, which diffused through the north-east region of what is now Thailand. Evidence of this culture is found in Surin region dating to between the 7th to 11th centuries CE. It was in this period that Buddhism became the dominant religion of the region. Following the Dvaravati period, the powerful Khmer Empire expanded its influence throughout what is now the southern Isan region of Thailand. This period covers the 7th to 13th centuries CE. Surin was an important part of the ancient Khmer empire. Temple ruins and a substantial ethnic Khmer minority remain part of Surin. Khmer stone inscriptions date from c. 600 CE. Over the next several centuries a growing number of Khmer sites were constructed in the province, most notably Prasat Sikhoraphum. These sites would have formed part of the network of Khmer infrastructure centred on Prasat Phanom Rung. With the collapse of the Khmer empire in the 13th century Surin province faded from history. It is in the 18th century that it re- emerges. At this time a Kuay local leader named Chiangpum became the royally appointed ruler of the region. According to legend he presented a rare white elephant to the Chao Phaya Chakri, future King Rama I. In gratitude, Chiangpum was awarded the royal title Luang Surin Phakdi and appointed the village headman. When Rama I became the Thai monarch, he appointed Luang Surin Phakdi as the province's governor. In 1763 the village was moved to the location of the modern city of Surin, and was upgraded to a city with the name Muang Prathai Saman. There is a local legend that this move was due to better water supplies at the new site. Also, that the original location of the town was at Muang Thi, approximately fifteen kilometres to the east of the modern city. In 1786, the city's name was changed to Surin in honor of its governor. The province slowly grew in population, there was a continual influx of people from surrounding areas, principally Cambodia (part of what is now western Cambodia was ruled by Bangkok at this time), however Surin was largely self- sufficient, and somewhat isolated. This changed with the advent of the railroad in 1922. Surin and its economy was exposed to the wider world. Chinese and Indian merchants settled, manufacturing increased, and Surin joined the modern world.

It is one of the values by which Filipinos accommodate the demands of the world around them as opposed to its counterpart grouping, referred to as the \\"confrontative surface values\\", which include values such as lakas ng loob and pakikibaka. The essence of utang na loob is an obligation to appropriately repay a person who has done one a favor. The favors which elicit the Filipino's sense of utang na loob are typically those whose value is impossible to quantify, or, if there is a quantifiable value involved, involves a deeply personal internal dimension. This internal dimension, loob, differentiates utang na loob from an ordinary utang (debt); being an internal phenomenon, utang na loob thus goes much deeper than ordinary debt or even the western concept of owing a favor.

At the time of its closing in October 2017, it had been the longest operating hardware store in the United States, having begun business in 1782. The building that the store resided in was built about 1831, and is one of its oldest commercial buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Elwood Adams Store building is located on the west side of Main Street in the northern part of Worcester's downtown area. It is a four-story masonry structure, its facade crowned by an Italianate wooden cornice. The ground floor consists of two storefronts separate by a brick pier, although these have for many years functioned as a single establishment. Windows are set in rectangular openings with stone sills and lintels. The hardware store that became the Elwood Adams Store was established in 1782 by Daniel Waldo Sr. on this site, erecting the city's first brick building. Waldo's son Daniel Jr. took over the business in 1791, and later partnered with Henry Miller, who purchased it in partnership with George Rice in 1821. Miller took full ownership of the business in 1831, and purchased the building from Waldo's heirs in 1865. Around that time, it was raised from its original 2-1/2 stories to four stories, and its front facade was refaced with new brick. Miller sold the business to Elwood Adams and a partner in 1886. First known as Smith & Adams, it became known as the Elwood Adams Store in 1891, the name it retained until its closing in 2017.

The early years (1946‚Äì1963)  The 49ers changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often in their first eighteen years of existence. From the team's inception in 1946 through the early 1960s, the San Francisco 49ers usually wore red, white or silver helmets, white or light-gray pants, and cardinal red (home) and white (road) jerseys. The 49ers' original logo was a mustached 49er gold miner from the 1849 California Gold Rush, dressed in plaid pants and a red shirt, jumping in midair with his hat falling off, and fired pistols in each hand: one nearly shooting his foot, and the other pistol forming the word \\"Forty-Niners\\" from its smoke. By the mid-1950s this logo showed the prospector jumping against a backdrop of Kezar Stadium, the team's home from 1946 to 1970. Original uniforms consisted of plain red jerseys with white front and back numerals and no trim. Pants were white, and leather helmets were in several colors. In 1950, concurrent with the team's admission to the NFL, the red jersey gained three parallel white stripes on the sleeves; this feature, with modifications and updates, has been implemented on the team's jersey ever since. Also around this time, the helmets were gradually changed over to a silver-colored plastic. An entirely new look appeared in 1953; helmets were red with a silver center stripe. White pants were given a thin red-black-red tri-stripe. For the 1954 season silver-grey pants were introduced, and in the 1955 season the jersey numerals gained black trim that created a \\"dropshadow\\" effect. These 1955 jerseys, along with white pants, served as the model for the team's \\"throwback\\" uniform in its championship 1994 season. Red socks included three white stripes. In 1956 the helmet was changed to solid white and the black outlining and shadowing effect was eliminated from the jersey numerals. The pants striping became solid red. In 1957 the 49er uniform was altered again; helmets were made gold, accompanied by beige-gold, unstriped pants. Jerseys and socks remained the same, but in accordance with the NFL's 1957 rule ordering primary-colored \\"home\\" and light \\"road\\" shirts for each team, the 49ers debuted white road jerseys with three parallel sleeve stripes; the middle stripe was red, the top and bottom gold. This striping was replaced in 1958 by a wide red crescent shoulder stripe. So- called \\"TV Numbers\\" appeared on both jerseys in the same year. Throughout the middle and late 1950s, and the early 1960s, the 49ers were one of just a few NFL teams (the Chicago Bears were most prominent) to use helmets made by Chicago-based Wilson Sporting Goods; these helmets were of slightly different shape than those made by the Riddell company, which for more than a half- century have been a prominent supplier of NFL team headgear. Yet another radical alteration was made to the 49er uniform in 1960. Appearing were silver helmets with three widely spaced red stripes; the center stripe was thicker. Home jerseys were unchanged, but road jerseys featured a new dual crescent shoulder stripe in what is usually called the \\"UCLA\\" style. An alternate logo was designed in the 1960s featuring a shield-shaped crest formed from the number \\"49\\", with a football in the upper right quadrant and \\"SF\\" in the lower left quadrant. In 1962 the helmet was redesigned to feature a red-white-red triple center stripe (the white middle stripe was wider). The earliest version of San Francisco's current primary logo, an intertwined white \\"SF\\" within the center of a red oval, also debuted in the 1962 helmet design. By 1972-73 the oval was slightly smaller in size and gained a thicker black border.  A more standard look (1964‚Äì1988)  The team's colors then changed in 1964. All silver elements were changed to what was called \\"49ers Gold;\\" helmets were gold, with the same striping and logo. New beige-gold pants with a red-white- red Tristripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. The scarlet red jerseys kept the traditional three red sleeve stripes, but road jerseys abandoned the previous dual crescent shoulder stripes in favor of three red sleeve stripes (the converse of the home jersey). The red home jerseys had white block numbers, three white parallel stripes on the sleeves, and smaller white block \\"TV\\" numbers above these stripes on the upper sleeve, with the color scheme reversed for the white road jersey. The red elliptical helmet logo was made slightly smaller in 1971-72 and received a thicker black border around the oval. From 1964 to 1971, the team's gold pants were unique in that they consisted of two varying colored panels: a more lustrous gold fabric was used on the rear portion of the pants and a lighter-hued, less lustrous beige fabric on the front. This pants design was abandoned from 1972 onwards for a more uniform, subdued beige. On very few occasions from 1971-1973, when traveling to play against teams in warm-weather venues that wore white jerseys at home such as the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints, the 49ers would don thinner mesh-fabric red jerseys that were missing the usual sleeve stripes and TV numbers. There was also a white version of this warm-weather jersey that was worn on even rarer occasions. The 1964 uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next thirty seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970‚Äì74 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping would be worn until 1995 (as well as for throwback games from 2002‚Äì08). Starting in 1984, there was a change in the numeral font (the number \\"2\\" was made a squarer block numeral), along with the gradual incorporation of serifed letters for players' names on the back of the jerseys (completed by the 1986 season). Also for the 1986 season, the 49ers incorporated a special 40th anniversary patch sewn on the pants along the side of the hips. At the conclusion of the 1988 season, in what would be Coach Bill Walsh's final game, five 49ers (including quarterback Joe Montana) would wear red jerseys from circa the 1984 season (distinguishable by thicker sleeve stripes and sans-serif lettering for players' names) during the team's Super Bowl XXIII victory.http://www.gridiron- uniforms.com/GUD/controller/controller.php?action=teams- season&team;_id=SF&year;=1988  1989‚Äì1993  In 1989, the 49ers' jerseys were further slightly altered with the stripes on the sleeves being made less bold and arranged closer together (sleeves on NFL jerseys began to get shorter and closer to the shoulder around this time). As for the team's helmet logo, black outlining on the intertwined \\"SF\\" was also added in 1989. For the 1991 season, concurrent with the rest of the teams in the NFL, the 49ers incorporated a small NFL Shield logo sewn on the bottom of the jersey's collar and front of the pants for the first time (this would be replaced with a redesigned \\"NFL Equipment\\" Shield logo for the 2002 season). Prior to the 1991 season, the 49ers announced a prototype for a new logo and helmet design. Instead of the traditional \\"SF\\" oval, this new logo featured a stylized \\"49ers\\" in white with black and red shadows, along with a red facemask. However, fan reaction was so overwhelmingly negative that the idea was scrapped the next day. The only carryover from the 1991 planned uniform change (and the last significant change to the 1964‚Äì1995 uniform design) was the switch from red socks with three white stripes to solid red socks.  1994‚Äì95  During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \\"throwback uniforms\\" on occasional games (beginning with week 3 of the season) to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that had black outlines and blockshadows (the smaller TV numerals above the shoulder stripes however, were removed as they were non-existent on the original 1950s jerseys). White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks (the team later reverted to their regular solid red socks after receiving permission from the NFL to wear the uniforms for the rest of the season). The regular 1989-95 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 red helmet. The team first donned the 1955 throwback uniforms during their week 3 match against the Los Angeles Rams and the following week at home versus the Saints, with both being wins (coincidentally, these were also the first two games Deion Sanders played after signing as a free-agent with the 49ers). The team then suffered an embarrassing 40-8 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at home wearing their regular uniforms with gold pants, with Steve Young angrily being benched to prevent him getting injured. For the subsequent three games until their BYE week, the team again was scheduled to play games wearing the throwback uniforms with white pants and blockshadow numerals, and all three games resulted in wins. As the 49ers embarked during the following weeks on what would eventually be a 10-game winning streak that ultimately culminated in a Super Bowl XXIX victory, the team (prompted both by the superstition of then coach George Seifert, as well as the preference of players) petitioned the NFL to wear the throwback uniforms for the rest of the season, which was granted. The switch to solid red socks after the team's BYE week in the middle of the season marked this occurrence. In all the 49ers went 15-1 (including the playoffs) wearing the 1955/1994 throwback uniforms, (the only loss being the regular season finale on the road at Minnesota, with the team wearing white jerseys and resting most of their starters for the playoffs). Meanwhile, the 49ers went undefeated wearing the red jerseys of the throwback uniform. After winning Super Bowl XXIX however, the team was compelled to revert to wearing its regular 1964-style uniforms (1991 revised design) for the following 1995 season.  1996: 50th Anniversary Uniform change  In 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 50th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red. The smaller TV numerals were moved from the side of the upper sleeve above the sleeve striping to the top of the shoulderpads. Other new modifications to the uniform showed marked influence from the 1994 throwback uniforms: a black blockshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). Black trim was added on the sleeve stripes as well, which also now featured an updated oval \\"SF\\" logo. The team's helmet underwent a major redesign as well in 1996. The updated oval logo (now in cardinal red) had a more stylized, \\"stretched\\" black border along with gold trimming, while the intertwined \\"SF\\" had thicker black bordering and shadows. For the helmet's color a shinier, more metallic gold was used, while the helmet striping was changed from red-white-red to black-cardinal-black. The old gray-colored facemask was also switched to a cardinal-red colored one. As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). The socks remained solid-colored, though switched to the darker cardinal red.  1998‚Äì2008  For the 1998 regular season opener, the team made a surprise switch back to gold pants, only this time to match the helmet it was a shinier, more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \\"SF\\" logos placed on both sides of the hip. The 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants would be worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. From the 1980s until 2005, the 49ers nearly always wore their white uniforms at home for their two preseason home games (and thus usually wore white jerseys the whole preseason,) while the team wore red for all eight regular season home games. Since 2006, the 49ers have worn red jerseys for all home games including preseason. The team also is occasionally compelled to wear red on the road when visiting warm-weather opponents early in the season (if that opponent elects to wear their white jerseys), or if an opponent's established home jersey is white, such as the Dallas Cowboys (and on most occasions the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins). Starting in 2002, the 49ers regularly used their 1980s-style (1989 version) scarlet and beige-gold uniform as alternate uniforms for one or two home games (usually for \\"Alumni Day\\" and around Christmas). In all, the team would wear the retro uniforms on eight occasions: *2002 ‚Äì vs. Philadelphia *2005 ‚Äì vs. Tampa Bay *2006 ‚Äì vs. Minnesota and Arizona *2007 ‚Äì vs. Arizona (Season Opener in honor of Bill Walsh) and St. Louis *2008 ‚Äì vs. Seattle and Washington During the 2006 season, the 60th anniversary of the team's inception, a commemorative patch was on the jerseys for all games. For the 2007 season, the 49ers began wearing black cleats, following a growing trend among many teams in the NFL. 2009 uniform change  On February 17, 2009, 49ers.com officially announced new uniforms to be presented to the public during 49ers Draft Day events on April 25, 2009. The showcased design would be adopted for the 2009 NFL season. The uniform change rumors were confirmed by the team's chief operating officer Andy Dolich at the 49ers' State of the Franchise. When asked when they were going to change their uniforms \\"back to normal\\", Dolich replied stating, \\"Stay tuned. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you see championship colors back.\\" During the design process of the new 49ers uniforms, considerable input was received from 49ers players, coaches, team alumni and fan focus groups which occurred over a period of two years (2006‚Äì08), and was then conveyed to NFL Equipment manufacturer Reebok. The uniforms were revealed on April 25, 2009, during the first day of the draft. 49ers players Patrick Willis, Josh Morgan, Dashon Goldson, Joe Staley, and Moran Norris (each accompanied by 49ers alumni) displayed the new uniforms at the 49ers draft party. The new uniforms are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves). Because of less room along the side of the sleeves, the secondary \\"TV\\" numerals have been moved to the top of the shoulder pads (as in the 1996‚Äì2008 jerseys). Meanwhile, a \\"49ers\\" wordmark ligature has been included below the collar on the front of the jersey, just below the NFL Equipment shield. The new helmets retained the shinier metallic gold shell color and 1996‚Äì2008 stretched oval \\"SF\\" logo design (though the oval was in the new brighter shade of red). However, the helmet stripes were reverted to the classic red-white-red order, and the face mask returned to the more traditional color of neutral gray. When the new uniform was debuted the pants remained made of the same lustrous gold material of the 1998‚Äì2008 uniform, but by training camp and the preseason the pants were toned down to a duller sheen of flat gold, similar to the 1980s pants but more closely matching the shade of gold used in the new helmets rather than the old khaki/tan. The pants striping is also in the classic red-white-red order, though this time in a more standard, medium width and not the thick striping width of the 1976‚Äì1995 pants. Players had complained that the old thick pant stripes on the throwbacks were too restrictive to movement. The new pants also feature zippers along the front, an innovation over the traditional laces used. The team's socks retain a solid red look (and not the throwback uniform style that had three white stripes), again in the new brighter red team color. Since the 2009 season, the team has chosen not to have any \\"throwback\\" games as in recent years (2002‚Äì08), as the new uniform is consistent with the \\"classic\\" 49ers look of the 1980s. However starting in 2018, the team reintroduced the all white 1994 throwback uniform as an alternate set. 2012 Nike uniform update For the 2012 NFL season, (and concurrent with the rest of the teams in the league), the official San Francisco 49ers onfield jersey, pants and socks were manufactured by Nike, along with other uniform paraphernalia (undershirts, gloves and cleats; though the latter two are not mandated for all players). The updated uniform design was revealed alongside those of the rest of the league at an official event organized by the NFL and Nike in Brooklyn, New York on April 3, 2012 (with former 49ers quarterback Alex Smith joining fellow players from each team as models). For the 49ers' uniforms, not much in the overall appearance was drastically changed and much was carried over from the previous Reebok design (such as the truncated sleeve stripes). Looking to improve the NFL uniform's physical design rather than a wholesale updating of teams' graphic designs, Nike focused changes mainly on the cut, fit and finish of the uniform, basing them on Nike's \\"Elite 51\\" uniform template that had already been worn recently by Football Bowl Subdivision college football teams. The new design utilizes more breathable fabrics on the jerseys and pants striping (and more moisture-resistant fabrics overall), and a new stretchable \\"Flywire\\" elastic stitching on the jersey collar. In addition, compartments for increased padding around the hip area that truncates the top portion of the pants stripes have been implemented, as well as lighter, aluminum d-rings for securing the belt straps. The former \\"NFL Equipment\\" shield of the Reebok era has also been abandoned league-wide in favor of a return to a simpler NFL shield logo on the collar and pants (made from a more rigid synthetic material instead of a fabric patch). 2015 to present On April 30, 2015 at their NFL Draft rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design). The uniform consists of black jerseys and pants with red numerals and striping. Nike logos are in gold, while the standard solid red socks will be worn. These uniforms will be worn a maximum of two games a year, per league rules. For the 2016 season (the 49ers' 70th), the team will once again wear a commemorative patch on the front upper left side of their jerseys, the design being based on the team's early-60's \\"49 shield crest\\" alternate logo. As part of the NFL Color Rush initiative, the 49ers wore their black alternate uniform, but instead of red socks, they replaced the combination with black socks. They wore this combination against the Arizona Cardinals on October 6, 2016. The black alternate uniforms were retired following the 2017 season. At the 2017 NFL Draft a new jersey template designed by Nike debuted for many teams, incorporating subtle changes. Called Vapor Untouchable, the most significant update for the 49ers jersey is a new sleeve stripe design in a thicker width and consisting of only two stripes versus the three stripes of past 49ers jerseys. The tailoring on the collar was also revised. On May 23, 2018 during the team's State of the Franchise event, the 49ers debuted a new, alternate uniform based on the 1994 white throwback uniforms.

He was Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Home Office from 1895-1903. Digby was born in Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, England, the son of Hon. and Revd. Kenelm Henry Digby (1811‚Äì1891) and his wife Caroline. The Digby county family, established in Dorset, had a history of public service. The Revd. Kenelm Henry Digby was the younger brother of Edward Digby, 9th Baron Digby and Jane Digby. Digby went to school at Blakeney in Norfolk and then Harrow School in north-west London. He graduated in 1859 from Corpus Christi College Oxford, and was called to the bar as a member of Lincoln's Inn in London in 1865. From 1868-1875 he taught at Oxford University, and published An Introduction to the History of the Law of Real Property in 1875, which soon became a standard textbook. He was a strong supporter of Gladstonian Liberalism and believed in \\"the greater importance of giving substantial power to the working classes\\". Later in his life he was involved in working out fair and effective means of compensating workmen for industrial injuries. In 1892 Digby was appointed County Court Judge in Derbyshire, and in 1891 he became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn and in 1904 took silk. In 1894 he was unexpectedly approached on behalf of the Liberal Home Secretary, H. H. Asquith, about an appointment as Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Home Office. However, a strong devotion to public duty weighed in the balance against his fears about his inexperience in administration and public office. In January 1895 Digby was appointed Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Home Office, succeeding Sir Godfrey Lushington. Digby was created KCB in 1898, retired in September 1903 and was created GCB in 1906. Over the subsequent ten years he sat as a member of numerous departmental committees of inquiry, chairing the Home Office departmental committee on workmen's compensation (1904), and acted as an arbitrator in labour disputes. In 1914 he was appointed a member of the commission to investigate alleged German war atrocities in Belgium. Digby married Caroline (1848‚Äì1926) on 30 August 1870, the second daughter of liberal politician Edward Strutt, 1st Baron Belper. They had four children - two sons and two daughters. One of his daughters was the scientist Lettice Digby and a son Edward Aylmer Digby who was a barrister and naval officer(2007, December 01).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 1980.  Description and history  The Arad Alexander House stands in a densely built residential area southeast of downtown Worcester, on the north side of Waverly Street between Providence and Coral Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a front gable roof. Its main block follows a side hall plan, and the front facade is a full temple front, with Corinthian columns supporting a full entablature and triangular pediment adorned with modillion blocks. The front windows are topped by moulding with consoles and hoods. The main entrance has an elaborate Corinthian surround with sidelight and transom windows beneath a corniced entablature. The house was built c. 1845, and is one of Worcester's most elaborate Greek Revival houses. Its original location and builder are unknown (although the later may be the locally prominent Elias Carter, based on stylistic evidence) but believed to be closer to the downtown area. The house was moved to its present location in the 1860s by Arad Alexander. Later owners subdivided the house into multiple units. One of its prominent 20th- century residents was Samuel Fine, who adjudicated disputes within the city's Jewish community.

It is member of the Haemodoraceae family. It is commonly known as the tall, yellow, or evergreen, kangaroo paw. The specific epithet, flavidus, refers to the yellow flowers of this plant. A member of the genus Anigozanthos (kangaroo- and cats-paws) that has an evergreen clump of strap-like leaves, up to 1 metre long and 0.2 m wide, growing from an underground rhizome around 0.5 m in diameter. The rhizome allows the species to regenerate after drought or fire. Each plant may produce over 350 flowers, on up to 10 long stems, these appear during the summer of the region. Pollen is distributed by birds as they plunge into the flowers to reach the nectaries. Flowers are frequently yellow and green, but may present in shades of red, pink, orange, or brown. It is found along roadsides, along creeks, and in forests and swamps, and other unshaded winterwet habitat. The species occurs in a range from Two Peoples Bay in the southeast, throughout the Warren and southern Jarrah Forest, to Waroona on the Swan Coastal Plain. It was previously endemic to the region, but is now naturalised in New South Wales. This kangaroo paw is now widely cultivated in the Eastern states of Australia and the United States of America. Anigozanthos flavidus hybridises with other members of the genus, and is used in the development of cultivars. It is a hardy plant, tolerant of a wide range of soil types and condition, that may live for around 30 years in a garden. It is propagated from seed or sections of the rhizome.

It is the main building of a five-acre (2 ha) former farm, built around 1870, to serve as both a farmhouse and summer boardinghouse, in response to Cornwall's growing popularity as a summer resort town. Today it is known as Shadow Mountain Farm, owned and operated by the Cromwell Manor bed and breakfast to the east along Angola. Both properties were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996. Property The house sits on a gentle rise with a view to the west highlighting Schunemunk Mountain. The lot is the remainder of a much larger farm that has been subdivided since the house was built. There are six other buildings besides the house, all considered contributing resources to the NRHP listing. It is a five-bay two-and-a-half-story clapboard-sided structure with Gothic detailing and a molded cornice and plain frieze at the roofline. The wooden-shingled roof, pierced by brick chimneys at either end, is cross-gabled by a two-story rear wing projecting from the south side, itself with a one-story pent-roofed bay on its own west. A one-story porch fronts the entire east elevation, with a flat roof, bracketed cornice, piers with decorated capitals and a plain frieze similar to the roofline. Elaborate cutouts form the guardrail between piers. Inside, the house follows a center hall plan. Many of the original finishings, hardware and trim remain. The attic, used as lodging for summer boarders, is completely finished as well. The six other buildings, all contemporary with the house's original construction, are located slightly downhill and to the rear. There are a small complex of two two-story wooden barns, a kitchen building since converted into a home, a carriage house with its original doors and hardware, and a shed. History The house was built some time around 1870 by Hand, descended from one of Cornwall's oldest families. A successful apple farmer, he saw the growing interest of New York City residents in spending their summers amid the fresh air of Cornwall, and had the house's attic finished to take some in during that season. It was effectively built to be both a farmhouse and a summer boardinghouse. It has passed through a variety of owners since then. Recently it has returned to its original use as lodging, with the owners of Cromwell Manor operating it as Shadow Mountain Farm Cottage, a bed and breakfast.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It now houses professional offices. Description and history The Allen House is set on the north side of Elm Street, at its corner with West Street, several blocks west of Worcester's Main Street and downtown. The three story mansard-roofed building is basically square in plan, with an ell projecting from its rear, and a central pavilion slightly projecting from its front facade. The pavilion rises two stories, and is topped by a pedimented gable. The main roof cornice is studded with modillions, as is that of the porch that shelters the front entry. The house was apparently the idea of Charles Allen, and occupies a lot which previously belonged to Governor Levi Lincoln, Jr., who had built a house there which Allen had moved a short distance to make way for this house. Allen was a high- profile Worcester native, working in law practice with John Davis, another Massachusetts governor. He served in the state legislature and as a local judge before being appointed the first chief justice of the newly organized Massachusetts Superior Court. He turned down an offer of a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Allen died in 1869, and the house may have been completed by his heirs, who owned the property into the early 20th century.

When Zhao Gao, a personal attendant to Qin Shi Huang's youngest son Huhai, committed a serious offence, the emperor ordered Meng Yi to prosecute Zhao according to the laws. Meng Yi went by the book and noted that Zhao Gao was to receive the death penalty and be stripped of his official titles. However, Qin Shi Huang eventually pardoned Zhao Gao on account of his diligence in performing his duties.(È´òÊúâÂ§ßÁΩ™ÔºåÁß¶Áéã‰ª§ËíôÊØÖÊ≥ïÊ≤ª‰πã„ÄÇÊØÖ‰∏çÊï¢ÈòøÊ≥ïÔºåÁï∂È´òÁΩ™Ê≠ªÔºåÈô§ÂÖ∂ÂÆ¶Á±ç„ÄÇÂ∏ù‰ª•È´ò‰πãÊï¶Êñº‰∫ã‰πüÔºåËµ¶‰πãÔºåÂæ©ÂÖ∂ÂÆòÁàµ„ÄÇ) Shiji vol. 88. In the winter of 210 BC, Qin Shi Huang became seriously ill while he was on an inspection tour in eastern China so he sent Meng Yi to help him pray to the gods on his behalf. Before Meng Yi returned, the emperor died at Shaqiu (Ê≤ô‰∏ò; south of present-day Dapingtai Village, Guangzong County, Henan), with only Zhao Gao, Huhai and Li Si by his deathbed. Zhao Gao and Li Si secretly changed the emperor's final edict ‚Äì which named his eldest son, Fusu, his successor ‚Äì and made Huhai the new emperor instead. The falsified edict also ordered Fusu and Meng Tian, who were away at the border, to commit suicide. Fusu faithfully followed the order but Meng Tian felt suspicious and repeatedly requested for confirmation, but was placed under arrest. When Huhai heard that Fusu was dead, he wanted to spare Meng Tian, but Zhao Gao advised him against it because he feared that the Mengs would take revenge against him.(ÂßãÁöá‰∏âÂçÅ‰∏ÉÂπ¥ÂÜ¨ÔºåË°åÂá∫Ê∏∏ÊúÉÁ®ΩÔºå‰∏¶Êµ∑‰∏äÔºåÂåóËµ∞ÁêÖÈÇ™„ÄÇÈÅìÁóÖÔºå‰ΩøËíôÊØÖÈÇÑÁ¶±Â±±Â∑ùÔºåÊú™Âèç„ÄÇÂßãÁöáËá≥Ê≤ô‰∏òÂ¥©ÔºåÁ•ï‰πãÔºåÁæ£Ëá£Ëé´Áü•„ÄÇÊòØÊôÇ‰∏ûÁõ∏ÊùéÊñØ„ÄÅÂ∞ëÂ≠êËÉ°‰∫•„ÄÅ‰∏≠ËªäÂ∫ú‰ª§Ë∂ôÈ´òÂ∏∏Âæû„ÄÇÈ´òÈõÖÂæóÂπ∏ÊñºËÉ°‰∫•ÔºåÊ¨≤Á´ã‰πãÔºåÂèàÊÄ®ËíôÊØÖÊ≥ïÊ≤ª‰πãËÄå‰∏çÁÇ∫Â∑±‰πü„ÄÇÂõ†ÊúâË≥äÂøÉÔºå‰πÉËàá‰∏ûÁõ∏ÊùéÊñØ„ÄÅÂÖ¨Â≠êËÉ°‰∫•Èô∞Ë¨ÄÔºåÁ´ãËÉ°‰∫•ÁÇ∫Â§™Â≠ê„ÄÇÂ§™Â≠êÂ∑≤Á´ãÔºåÈÅ£‰ΩøËÄÖ‰ª•ÁΩ™Ë≥úÂÖ¨Â≠êÊâ∂Ëòá„ÄÅËíôÊÅ¨Ê≠ª„ÄÇÊâ∂ËòáÂ∑≤Ê≠ªÔºåËíôÊÅ¨ÁñëËÄåÂæ©Ë´ã‰πã„ÄÇ‰ΩøËÄÖ‰ª•ËíôÊÅ¨Â±¨ÂêèÔºåÊõ¥ÁΩÆ„ÄÇËÉ°‰∫•‰ª•ÊùéÊñØËàç‰∫∫ÁÇ∫Ë≠∑Ëªç„ÄÇ‰ΩøËÄÖÈÇÑÂ†±ÔºåËÉ°‰∫•Â∑≤ËÅûÊâ∂ËòáÊ≠ªÔºåÂç≥Ê¨≤ÈáãËíôÊÅ¨„ÄÇË∂ôÈ´òÊÅêËíôÊ∞èÂæ©Ë≤¥ËÄåÁî®‰∫ãÔºåÊÄ®‰πã„ÄÇ) Shiji vol. 88. When Meng Yi returned from his mission, Zhao Gao suggested to Huhai to exterminate the Meng clan, but Huhai had Meng Yi arrested and imprisoned in Dai (‰ª£; around present-day Yu County, Zhangjiakou, Hebei). Meng Tian, who had already been arrested earlier for defying the edict, was imprisoned in Yangzhou (ÈôΩÂë®; around present-day Yulin, Shaanxi). After Huhai returned to the Qin capital, Xianyang, he held a grand funeral for his father, after which he ascended the throne as Qin Er Shi (Second Emperor of Qin). Zhao Gao remained as a close aide to Qin Er Shi and he often spoke ill of the Mengs in front of the emperor and urged the emperor to get rid of them.(ÊØÖÈÇÑËá≥ÔºåË∂ôÈ´òÂõ†ÁÇ∫ËÉ°‰∫•Âø†Ë®àÔºåÊ¨≤‰ª•ÊªÖËíôÊ∞èÔºå‰πÉË®ÄÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËá£ËÅûÂÖàÂ∏ùÊ¨≤ËàâË≥¢Á´ãÂ§™Â≠ê‰πÖÁü£ÔºåËÄåÊØÖË´´Êõ∞„Äé‰∏çÂèØ„Äè„ÄÇËã•Áü•Ë≥¢ËÄåÊÑà‰∏çÁ´ãÔºåÂâáÊòØ‰∏çÂø†ËÄåÊÉë‰∏ª‰πü„ÄÇ‰ª•Ëá£ÊÑöÊÑèÔºå‰∏çËã•Ë™Ö‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçËÉ°‰∫•ËÅΩËÄåÁπ´ËíôÊØÖÊñº‰ª£„ÄÇÂâçÂ∑≤ÂõöËíôÊÅ¨ÊñºÈôΩÂë®„ÄÇÂñ™Ëá≥Âí∏ÈôΩÔºåÂ∑≤Ëë¨ÔºåÂ§™Â≠êÁ´ãÁÇ∫‰∫å‰∏ñÁöáÂ∏ùÔºåËÄåË∂ôÈ´òË¶™ËøëÔºåÊó•Â§úÊØÄÊÉ°ËíôÊ∞èÔºåÊ±ÇÂÖ∂ÁΩ™ÈÅéÔºåËàâÂäæ‰πã„ÄÇ) Shiji vol. 88. Fusu's son, Ziying, strongly advised Qin Er Shi against executing the Mengs, but the emperor refused to listen. Qin Er Shi sent an envoy to meet Meng Yi and order Meng to commit suicide. Meng Yi gave a long reply, in which he hinted that the emperor had no reason to execute him. However, the envoy, who knew that the emperor wanted to see Meng Yi dead, ignored Meng's response and killed him.(Â≠êÂ¨∞ÈÄ≤Ë´´Êõ∞Ôºö ...

In popular culture Jackie Chan portrayed the protagonist, Meng Yi, in the 2005 Hong Kong film The Myth. This character is loosely based on the historical Meng Yi. In the film, Meng Yi is reincarnated as a present-day archaeologist who embarks on a quest to find a mysterious element that can make objects hover in air. His quest leads him to discover his past life and to Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. In 2010, The Myth was adapted into the television series of the same title, with Jackie Chan as the producer for the series. Hu Ge starred as the protagonist, Yi Xiaochuan, a 21st-century freelance photographer who is accidentally transported back in time to the Qin dynasty, where he takes on his new identity as Meng Yi. In the manga series Kingdom, Meng Yi is known as Mou Ki, the younger son of the general Mou Bu (Meng Wu). Like his older brother Meng Tian, he studies under Lord Changping, and learns tactics and strategy alongside He Liao Diao (Ka Ryo Ten in the series). References * Sima Qian.

Muriithi is also a regional reporter and correspondent for NTV, a Kenyan media outlet, QTV, and the Nation Newspaper, all owned by Nation Media Group (NMG). He previously worked for The Standard of Kenya as a US correspondent. Biography BMJ Muriithi was born in Kanyuambora village, Embu district in the Eastern province of Kenya. A son of Kenyan small scale farmers, the late Sospeter Mungwana Kironji Mutua and Jane Igoki Mungwana Kironji, he rose from a relatively modest family background to head one of the most popular drama clubs in Kenya, the Mt. Kenya Theatrix, before moving to the United States. Early life, school, and career Muriithi and his now late brother, Stephen Njagi Kironji, started acting in their village church at a very young age. Muriithi later joined Kangaru School, Embu, Kenya, graduating in 1986. He then joined a private school in Thika, Kenya while living with his father, who worked as at Joytown Special School for disabled children as a caretaker. Muriithi became the YMCA Drama Club Chaperon in 1988 and later that year he was elected to head the Youth Department at the Thika YMCA branch. In 1990, he trained as a registration assistant at Kenya Institute of Surveying and Mapping (KISM) in Ruaraka. Upon graduating, Muriithi was hired by the Kenyan government and posted in Eastern Province as a Registration Assistant. While working with the Lands Department at the Eastern Provincial Headquarters in Embu, he joined renowned actor Joseph Murungu in the newly formed Mt Kenya Theatrix Drama Group under the auspices of the Kenya Red Cross, Embu Branch. While on an exchange program tour co- sponsored by the Kenya Red Cross Society and the Norwegian Red Cross Society, he enrolled in a certificate course in acting and photojournalism at Haraldvangen Institute in Norway, graduating in 1992. Artistic activity Earlier in his career, he traversed the country with members of Mt. Kenya Theatrix, sensitising people to the dangers of HIV/AIDS through community theater under the sponsorship of Plan International, a non-governmental humanitarian organisation. In high school, he was named the entertainer of the year of the class of 1986. Muriithi produced and presented the arts segment of John Obong'o Jr.'s Kenya Beat, a popular Kenyan radio program aired on Monday mornings. He covered artistic activities in Nairobi and upcountry, including the national schools and colleges drama festivals. He frequented the Professional Centre adjacent to the Kenya National Assembly where some of the most prolific Kenyan and foreign thespians staged their plays under the directorship of James Falkland, the Scots-born director of the Phoenix Players. In the mid-90s, he was featured on Kenyan radio, television and stage, and was appointed the executive chairman of Mt. Kenya Theatrix Club in 1995. Some of the productions he featured in included Athol Fugard's Sizwe Bansi Is Dead, Joseph Murungu's So Sweet a Bite, Francis Imbuga's Betrayal in the City, and John Ruganda's The Burdens, as well as a number of William Shakespeare's published works. During his days in Nairobi, he featured in some high-profile TV commercials, including one by then Celtel (later Zain and now Airtell), one of Africa's leading telecommunication companies. He was also a co-presenter of The World This week, a news roundup program produced by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation KBC. Besides his duties at KBC, Muriithi produced and presented Biashara Ndogondogo, a popular radio program aired on Saturdays by Nairobi-based Nation Radio, now QFM which is owned by Nation Media Group. While working with the media houses, he simultaneously served as a registration assistant with Kenya's department of lands in both Embu and Nairobi. Before leaving Kenya, he sat on the provincial adjudication board for Kenya Schools and Colleges Drama Festival. He was also a high school drama coach, producing and directing plays for Emma Girls School in Embu and Uthiru High School in Nairobi, both of which made it to the provincial level in the 90s. Time in the US In 2002, BMJ Muriithi moved to Georgia, US, where he enrolled to study Mass Communication and International Relations at Atlanta Metropolitan College. He worked as a correspondent and an editor with a US- based Kenyan Newspaper, Kenya Empowerment Newspaper, owned by Wilson Kimani Wanguhu. He was also a syndicated correspondent with Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, the Standard newspaper, Kenya, and a reporter for Minneapolis- based Mshale Newspaper. On 23 November 2008, his article, \\"An Africa to-do list for Obama\\", was published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the main Newspaper in the state of Georgia, US. The same was later published by The Washington Post, the oldest DC newspaper with the largest circulation in the City.  Activism  In the early 1990s, Muriithi teamed up with fellow thespians, including Packson Ngugi and a group of activists led by Kenyan politician and later Cabinet Minister James Orengo, to protest the government's intention to sell the Kenya National Theatre building to the adjacent Norfolk Hotel against the wishes of the artists. The idea was consequently shelved. In October 2009, Muriithi received an award from Kenya's ambassador to the US for what the Kenyan Embassy in Washington DC termed \\"his professional support and cooperation with the Embassy\\". It was presented at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia by HE. Peter Ogego, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.  Controversy  In the early 1990s, Muriithi declined a job offer as a newscaster on the government-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation on principle. In a newspaper interview carried by The Standard, a leading Kenyan daily, on 5 September 1995, the journalist said he could not take up the job as a news anchor owing to his opposition to the way the media house was carrying out its business. \\"It is a mouth piece for President Daniel Arap Moi and his cronies and much as I would love to serve my country in that respect, my conscience does not allow me\\", he told The Standard Newspaper. In opinion pieces carried by the local dailies in the mid-1990s, he attacked President Moi's administration, terming the second president of Kenya as \\"one of the worst strongmen the world has seen in recent times\\". Observers have often wondered whether the journalist has any particular political leaning since he is equally critical of the current Kenyan president, Mwai Kibaki. In a radio interview with ksnmedia.com, he quipped; \\"Kibaki's legacy is indelibly tainted by his association with the Moi administration. How does he explain his total silence as Moi's administration acted with impunity while he (Kibaki) comfortably sat in the same government, holding powerful positions, including that of the Vice-President of the republic of Kenya?\\" In another interview with ksnmedia.com on 26 September 2010, Muriithi criticised Kibaki for what he termed \\"open nepotism\\", saying almost all the key positions in his wing of the coalition were held by his tribesmen, save for a few held by his close cousins, the Ameru. He was equally critical of Prime Minister Raila Amolo Odinga. \\"Why is his sister the Consul General in Los Angeles yet she is a PHD in Chemistry? Don't you think he should try to at least conceal the open nepotism?\\" he was quoted by Kenya Satellite News Network as wondering. Asked what he thought of the founding president of Kenya as the country marked its 48th birthday, Muriithi said that Kenyatta had his successes as a statesman but his administration generally laid the foundation for the official corruption which is so rampant in Kenya today. He said There seems to be consensus that Kenyatta perfected tribalism and amassed great wealth (including vast tracts of land) while ignoring the real heroes, the freedom fighters some of whom - like Dedan Kimathi - lost their lives, property and dignity as they fought for independence. Personal Muriithi is married to Edith Muriithi, a medical assistant and a student at Georgia State University. His daughter, Carole Wawira Muriithi attended School in Kenya, Cameroon, Ghana and Vietnam and was later a student at the University of Sussex, in the south of England. She now works in London with 'The Girl Network.' Carole's mother, Fiona Clare, works for CARE International.

Life and career Piet Christiaan Leonardus de Jong was born in Leeds, England on 8 August 1887. His father, Jacques Leonardus de Jong, was a Dutch immigrant, and his mother, Rosa Teale de Jong, a Yorkshire native. Piet had two siblings: an older half-sister, Gwendolyn (b. 1880), and a younger brother, Arton Carl (b. 1893). For his education, he first attended the Leeds Modern School. Piet later attended the Leeds Institute of Science, Art, and Literature, where he studied architecture. After completing his studies, de Jong won several architectural prizes, including two from the West Yorkshire Society of Architects (prize in 1908, silver medal 1909). In 1912, Piet de Jong received the Soane Medallion which included a travel award of ¬£50 from the Royal Institute of British Architects. With this prize money, he was able to travel to Italy in 1912 to study Classical architecture. In 1913, he returned to London as a member of the Leeds architectural firm Schofield and Berry. Also in 1913, de Jong designed his first and only building in England: the First Church of Christ Scientist, Leeds. In 1914, World War I broke out, and in 1916 he joined the army as a lance-corporal in the Army Cyclist Corps. Although the precise details of his participation in World War I are unknown, he most likely served as part of the East Riding Yeomanry. Piet de Jong first travelled to Greece in 1919 as part of the post-war reconstruction programme for eastern Macedonia. At this time he first met the excavator of Mycenae, Alan Wace. In 1920, de Jong began work as an architect and archaeological illustrator for the Mycenae excavations. He worked on the Mycenae excavations until 1923, during which time he produced the famous reconstruction of Grave Circle A, Mycenae. From the 1920s to the 1950s, de Jong applied his skills as architect and artist to the illustration, recording, and reconstruction of some of the most famous excavations in Mediterranean archaeology. In 1921, he worked for the excavations at Halae, under Hetty Goldman. Also in 1921, on 14 February, Piet de Jong married his wife Effie. At the time of her marriage, Effie was living in Athens and working as an English teacher. She accompanied Piet de Jong on many of his archaeological projects. His work at Mycenae earned him a positive reputation and in 1922, he was hired by Sir Arthur Evans to work on the recording and reconstruction of the palace at Knossos on Crete. Piet de Jong's reconstruction of the dolphin fresco, Knossos In 1923, de Jong was the first person appointed as the official architect for the British School at Athens. Many of the publications of archaeological finds produced by the British School during this period include plans, plates, and drawings by de Jong. From 1923 to 1926, de Jong worked at Sparta, and in 1924 at Eutresis. During the 1920s, he also worked at Zygouries, excavated by Carl Blegen, and at Corinth, under both Bert Hodge Hill and Leslie Shear. His reconstruction of the Throne Room, Knossos Piet de Jong returned to Crete every year from 1922 to 1930. During this time, he designed and directed much of the reconstruction work at Knossos. This work included both architectural reconstruction (especially the Queen's Megaron and Throne Room), and frescos (the dolphin fresco). In the 1930s, de Jong produced drawings for the archaeological excavations at Perachora and Prosymna, and in 1932 began work as illustrator for the excavations at the Athenian Agora. The events of World War II forced de Jong to return to Leeds from 1939 to 1947. Piet de Jong's reconstruction of the palace at Knossos Delphinus delphis 02 In 1947, de Jong returned to Crete as the curator of Knossos. The Knossos excavations were now directed by Sinclair Hood, who continued to employ de Jong in the recording and reconstruction of the Knossos material. In 1952, de Jong relinquished his post as Knossos caretaker, but continued to produce watercolours and reconstructions both at Knossos (1957‚Äì61), and for a number of other archaeological projects. In 1957, he produced watercolour reconstructions of the fresco paintings from the so-called 'Painted House' at Gordion. Around the same time, de Jong also produced the plates for the material excavated by John Caskey at Kea. Until 1965, de Jong worked again for Carl Blegen at Pylos, where he produced his famous reconstructions of both the Palace of Nestor and its ornate floor. His final archaeological assignment, the watercolour reproduction of several Minoan frescos, began on Crete in 1966. While still in Crete and at work on these frescos, Piet de Jong died on 20 April 1967 at the age of 79. Archaeological illustration and reconstruction As an archaeological illustrator and architect, de Jong was responsible for both the accurate recording and the reconstruction of a wide variety of archaeological materials including: pottery, frescos, figurines or other small objects, and architecture. Watercolours, both translucent and opaque (gouache), on paper, were de Jong's preferred medium for the execution of archaeological illustrations. De Jong also produced many pencil and ink drawings. Piet de Jong was a talented artist. However, he was not trained as an archaeologist. Many of his reconstructions take extreme artistic licence in the interpretation of the archaeological remains. For example, his reconstruction of the dolphin fresco at Knossos, is formulated around a very small number of fresco fragments. In addition, de Jong did not produce a style of documentation which would be considered sufficient for modern, quantitative, standards of archaeological recording. Another group of examples is de Jong's illustration of ceramic finds. Modern drawings of archaeological ceramics tend to include both a 'section', or profile drawing, of the vessel and an 'elevation', a depiction of its outside face. In contrast, de Jong's illustrations do not include a section and elevation, but rather tend to depict the entire outside profile of the vessel, often from a distorted perspective, to make as many of the object's defining attributes visible to the viewer as possible. Caricatures Piet de Jong was also a talented caricaturist. Forty-four de Jong caricatures, also in watercolour, have been published. The majority of the subjects for these paintings were archaeologists from the excavations for which de Jong worked as architect. Some of the more famous of his scholarly subjects include Sir Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos, and Alan Wace, excavator of Mycenae.

Biography Song Yi joined Xiang Liang's insurgent Chu kingdom around 209 BC, when rebellions broke out throughout China to overthrow the Qin Dynasty. In 208 BC, Xiang Liang found Xiong Xin, a descendant of the royal family of Chu, and installed him on the throne of Chu as King Huai II. After engaging Qin forces in various battles, Xiang Liang began to grow contemptuous of the enemy due to the small amount of resistance that he encountered. Song Yi warned Xiang Liang that his overconfidence and his troops' inattentiveness would lead to defeat against the Qin army. At that time, the Lord of Gaoling (È´òÈôµÂêõ), an envoy from the insurgent Qi kingdom, was travelling to Chu and he encountered Song Yi along the way. Song Yi told him to slow down his pace because he was sure that Xiang Liang would meet his downfall. Song Yi's prediction was right as Xiang Liang was killed in action against the Qin army, led by Zhang Han, at the Battle of Dingtao. The Lord of Gaoling met King Huai II later and recommended Song Yi to the king, saying that Song \\"may indeed be said to understand the art of warfare.\\" The king summoned Song Yi and discussed strategic issues with him, after which he appointed Song Yi as commander-in-chief of his army, with Xiang Yu (Xiang Liang's nephew) and Fan Zeng serving as his deputies. Song Yi was commissioned to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao kingdom, which was under attack by Qin. In 207 BC, the army reached Anyang (ÂÆâÈôΩ; southeast of present-day Cao County, Heze, Shandong) and Song Yi ordered them to halt and wait for 46 days without making further movement. As the Zhao capital Handan was under siege by Qin forces, Xiang Yu advised an immediate crossing of the Yellow River to attack the Qin army, but Song Yi ignored him, preferring to move when Zhao and Qin were exhausted from fighting each other. Song Yi then gave an order that any man who was \\"fierce as a tiger, recalcitrant as a ram, greedy as a wolf, so headstrong they will not submit to orders\\" should be decapitated, hinting that the assassination of Xiang Yu would be agreeable to him. He sent his son, Song Xiang (ÂÆãË•Ñ), to the Qi kingdom, and accompanied his son to a drinking party at Wuyan (ÁÑ°ÈπΩ; east of present-day Dongping County, Tai'an, Shandong). Xiang Yu was angry with Song Yi and he gave a speech to the other generals, decrying Song's extravagance and unconcerned attitude towards military affairs. The next morning, when entering the commander's tent to make his morning report, Xiang Yu took Song Yi by surprise and killed him, seizing Song's command of the army. Xiang Yu then denounced Song Yi for committing treason, saying that Song was plotting with Qi against Chu, and his execution was authorised by the king. References * Sima Qian.

Built c. 1896, it was a good example of a vernacular Italianate triple decker, whose exterior decoration has since been removed or covered over. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Ludwig Anderson Three-Decker is located on Vernon Hill south of downtown Worcester, at the western corner of Fairbanks and Stockton Streets. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a shallow hip roof. Its main facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the rightmost bay, sheltered by a gabled portico with round columns. The interior follows a typical side hall plan, with a stairwell on the right providing access to the building's three units. Its historic exterior features have been compromised by the application of synthetic siding. These features included a modillioned cornice, window surrounds with rope moulding on the caps, and an early 20th-century portico with paired square columns. The house was built about 1896, and was typical of early triple-deckers built to house workers in the factories of South Worcester and Quinsigamond Village. Its first owners, and a number of its early tenants, were Swedish immigrants. Ludwig Anderson, whose family owned it into the 1930s, was a grocer who also lived here, while early tenants were machinists, factory workers, and others engaged in lower-paid jobs.

It takes the name from Redknife River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River, and was first described in the banks of the Trout River, north of Trout Lake, Northwest Territories, at Table Rock Rapids by Belyea and McLaren in 1962. Lithology The Redknife Formation is divided into the Jean Marie Member (base) and an upper unnamed shale unit. The Jean Marie Member is composed of argillaceous, silty and dolomitic fossiliferous limestone. The carbonates are massive east of Fort Nelson and west of the Alberta border. The upper Redknife consists of calcareous shales with silty limestone and siltstone interbeds. To the south and east, the shales grade into limestone and siltstone, and it becomes dolomitic in the Peace River arch. The Redknife formation contains common coral and brachiopod fossils. Oil/gas production Gas is produced from the Jean Marie Member in the Greater Sierra filed east of Fort Nelson, British Columbia. Distribution The Redknife Formation occurs in outcrops in the southern Northwest Territories and in the sub-surface in north-eastern British Columbia, also reaching into north-western Alberta. The maximum thickness of the upper shales is , and the lower carbonates are up to . The Jean Marie Member is found in outcrops south of the Mackenzie River between Kakisa and Blackstone River. It grades westwards into the shale facies of the Fort Simpson Formation. East of the Peace River Arch it turns into the carbonates of the Kakisa Formation. Relationship to other units The Redknife Formation is conformly overlain by the Kakisa Formation and overlies the Tathlina Formation in northern Alberta and the Fort Simpson Formation in British Columbia and Northwest Territories.

She was stationed at the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Morale Operations (MO) headquarters in Rome, Italy. Background Barbara Lauwers was born Bo≈æena Hauserov√° in 1914 in Brno, then Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. She became a lawyer and just before the break out of war she also became a journalist. Lauwers got married and she and her husband moved to Belgian Congo in 1939 when events started to escalate in Europe. In 1941 they moved to United States. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, her husband joined the army and she went to work at the Czech embassy in Washington, D.C. before joining the WAC herself. She was sent to Algeria and then Rome, Italy where she pursued her work at the MO. World War II Work While in Rome, Corporal Lauwers assembled a team of German prisoners to work in counterintelligence and psychological warfare. The prisoners worked as ‚Äúcobblers‚Äù‚Äî spies who create false passports, visas, diplomas and other documents. She conducted Operation Sauerkraut, which infiltrated enemy lines with teams of German prisoners that spread ‚Äúblack‚Äù propaganda regarding Hitler throughout occupied Italian towns. Corporal Lauwers also created the \\"League of Lonely War Women\\" or VEK in German. This mythical organization was to demoralize German troops by making them believe that the females in their lives back home were having casual relations with other soldiers. Eight faked field post letters in the German language were produced by the OSS in Italy with the total number of forged field post letters that were printed in Rome being indicated in an OSS production report. 287,000 copies were produced in the period between 15 July 1944 and the end of the war. The operation was so successful that The Washington Post was fooled and ran a story on 10 October 1944 entitled, ‚ÄúGerman soldiers on leave from the Italian front have only to pin an entwined heart on their lapel during furloughs home to find a girlfriend.‚Äù The newspaper got the story from a circular which had been captured on the Eighth Army front and was actually written by Lauwers and carried behind German lines by the Sauerkraut agents. In another mission, Corporal Lauwers led a team in writing and delivering ‚Äúblack‚Äù propaganda targeting soldiers attached to the German army in northern Italy. On 29 April 1945, this mission was so successful that 600 troops defected behind Italian lines and withdrew their support from the Germans.

The knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement. They are: * Knowledge ‚Äì the subjects, topics, and items of information that an employee should know at the time he or she is hired or moved into the job. * Skills ‚Äì technical or manual proficiencies which are usually learned or acquired through training. * Abilities ‚Äì the present demonstrable capacity to apply several knowledge and skills simultaneously in order to complete a task or perform an observable behaviour. A similar model, the KASE (Knowledge, Attributes, Skills and Experience) framework is used by the careers advisory service at King's College London.  Evaluation of essays  KSA statements are also known as Evaluation Factors. Other agencies sometimes call them \\"Rating Factors\\", \\"Quality Ranking Factors\\", \\"Knowledge, Abilities, skills, and Other Characteristics\\", or \\"Job Elements\\". The name can be just a name but it often influences content and length of the essay. The required length of the KSA statements varies from employer from employer, but the usual length of the KSA factors is between 1/2 to 1¬Ω pages long. The scoring of KSA essays is often based on a ranking given to each individual essay, and there is often a cutoff score. High scores are derived through answering the KSA question as specifically as possible, providing examples from previous employment or training that clearly demonstrate the applicant meet the qualifications.

The charity sponsors treks and climbs to the world's highest mountains, often performing musical concerts at the peak. Origins In spring 2001, at age 31, James Chippendale, an American businessman, was diagnosed with leukemia, needing a bone marrow transplant to recover. After his recovery in 2003 he founded a cancer charity, the Love Hope Strength Foundation (LHSF) with fellow survivor Mike Peters, a Welsh musician and lead singer with The Alarm. Activities The charity raises funds for cancer treatment, promotes awareness and early detection, and advocates for bone marrow registration by holding rock concerts at remote, elevated venues, including Everest base camp, the top of the Empire State Building, the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, with a concert at Mount Kilimanjaro in 2009. The UK organisation holds an annual summer trek to the top of Wales' highest mountain, Snowdon, called Snowdon Rocks, and to this has been added a number of other events, including Rhondda Rocks, Avebury Rocks and Ben Nevis Rocks. LHSF concerts feature both amateur and professional musicians, and have featured high-profile rock musicians including Chuck Berry, The Fixx's Cy Curnin, Squeeze's Glenn Tilbrook, Everclear, The Beat, Nick Harper, Chris Summerill and members of The Cult. The first four shows had raised almost $1 million by September 2008. LHSF is a beneficiary of a documentary film called More To Live For, which details James Chippendale's cancer and survivorship experience.

Despite being located somewhat precisely in relation to neighboring islands by notable Spanish cartographers of the 16th century, the island was not found in a 1997 survey, nor in an extensive 2009 study conducted by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) on behalf of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. Interest in the island arose in late 2008, fueled by the fact that if such an island existed, it would be important for determining the boundaries for exploitation rights of oil in Hoyos de Dona (Doughnut Holes) in the Gulf of Mexico. The island was first mentioned by Alonso de Santa Cruz in El Yucat√°n e Islas Adyacentes, a list of islands of the region published in Madrid in 1539. Its precise location is given in Espejo de navegantes (Seville, ca. 1540) by Alonso de Chaves, who wrote that from a distance, the small island looks \\"blondish or reddish\\" (in Spanish: bermeja). According to Michel Antochiw Kolpa, a French- Mexican cartographer, since 1844 British maps have reported the sinking of the island some sixty fathoms below. Explanations for its apparent disappearance include an erroneous observation by the early cartographers, shifts in the geography of the ocean floor, rising sea levels and conspiracy theories claiming that the Central Intelligence Agency destroyed the island to expand the economic zone allotted to the United States.

The campaign was a brainchild of Nisha Susan, an employee of Tehelka political magazine. The campaign was conceived particularly in protest against a threat by Pramod Muthalik of the Sri Ram Sena (also spelled as Sri Ram Sene and Sriram Sena), an orthodox group based in Mangalore. Muthalik threatened to marry off and take other action on any young couples found together on Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day is traditionally not observed in India, as it is celebrated in Western cultures. Background On 6 February 2009 a group men attacked a group of women in Mangalore, India. The attack was an isolated incident and allegedly carried out by members of the Shri Rama Sene. Later that month, Muthalik announced an action plan to target couples found dating on 14 February, Valentine's Day. He said \\"Our activists will go around with a priest, a turmeric stub and a mangalsutra on 14 February. If we come across couples being together in public and expressing their love, we will take them to the nearest temple and conduct their marriage. On 9 February 2009, Home Minister P. Chidambaram said that \\"Sri Ram Sene is a threat to the country. The Centre is watching its activities with great concern\\". Pink Chaddi campaign In the midst of the tension, a protest was started by a group of young women, called the \\"Pink Chaddi\\" campaign, where they urged a peaceful protest (described as Gandhian in the press) to all of India, by sending pink underwear (\\"Chaddi\\" in Hindi) to Muthalik's office on Valentine's Day. The novel form of protest was initiated by Nisha Susan, Mihira Sood, Jasmeen Patheja and Isha Manchanda As the protest grew, underwear started pouring in from locations all over India in solidarity for the \\"Love Sena\\". Over 500 pink chaddis were couriered on Friday. Other cities collected hundreds of such chaddis and decided to courier them directly. Reaction to the campaign The Pink Chaddi Campaign received widespread media coverage, and the Facebook group saw numbers of members growing exponentially in the following days. A few reports were also critical of the campaign accusing it of trivialising an important issue like attack on women. There was also political reaction to the campaign as supporters of RSS objected to use of pictures of RSS members on the campaign blog. RSS had criticised the Mangalore attack and favoured ban on the Sri Ram Sena. The blog owner removed the pictures of RSS members following this objection. A counter-campaign calling itself \\"The Pink Condom Campaign\\" was started by some unknown activists a few days before Valentine's Day. Preventive custody As an additional precaution, Muthalik and 140 others of the Sri Ram Sena were held in preventive custody on Valentine's Eve.

He has lived in Seattle, Washington since 1987. Career Jamaica Clinton Fearon was born near Kingston, and quickly moved to St. Catherine, a rural Jamaican province. Fearon was heavily influenced by the music found at his local Seventh-day Adventist church. He returned to Kingston at age 16, where he founded his first band, The Brothers. Errol Grandison, who first encountered Fearon through his work with The Brothers, quickly offered him a chance to replace David Webber as the third member of The Gladiators.Moskowitz, David V. (2006) Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, He joined the group in 1969, first as a singer and then as a bass player and background vocalist after the departure of both Grandison and David Webber. He remained with the group until 1987, often appearing as the leader on songs including \\"Chatty Chatty Mouth,\\" \\"Rich Man Poor Man,\\" \\"Get Ready\\" and \\"Let Jah Be Praised\\". During these years, he also worked as a session-man for a range of artists, including Coxsone, Lee Perry, Joe Higgs, Yabby You, Joseph Hookim and Prince Tony Robinson. United States By the late 1980s, Fearon began to feel artistically crowded after nearly two decades of playing with the same band. As such, Fearon left the band and settled in Seattle, Washington following the Gladiators' 1987 American tour in order to launch his solo career. His first project in the United States, The Defenders, enjoyed a moderate success with the EP \\"Rock Your Bones\\" released in 1989. The group was short-lived, and disbanded in 1992. In 1994, Fearon reorganized his musical vision by forming The Boogie Brown Band. The group's debut album, \\"Disturb the Devil,\\" marks the beginning of Fearon's successful solo career and features Barbara Kennedy on keyboards, Lamar Lofton on bass, Girt Bolo on drums and John Saba on guitar. He followed this release with a series of other albums produced by his newborn record label, Boogie Brown Productions. Notable releases under Boogie Brown Productions also include Mi An' Mi Guitar, a 2005 acoustic album that refashions classic Gladiators recordings such as \\"Richman Poorman\\" and \\"Streets Of Freedom.\\" Clinton Fearon followed Mi An' Mi Guitar with his 2006 album Vision, which is composed of long, melodic songs that masterfully complement his earlier solo releases. In 2008, Clinton Fearon released Faculty Of Dub, featuring all original music as well as his own bass playing for the first time in nearly two decades. Clinton Fearon splits his time between Seattle and France, and continues to tour with The Boogie Brown Band.

The naval militia was reauthorized by Governor Rod Blagojevich through an executive order in 2006. As a naval militia it was not part of the Illinois National Guard or National Guard of the United States.  Formation  In September 1892 a meeting was called by Lieutenant-Commander B. M. Shaffner, attended by more than 20 graduates of the Naval Academy at Annapolis who were resident in Chicago, which proposed the formation of a State Naval Militia. The following year a bill was finally passed, and approved by Governor Altgeld, which provided for the creation and establishment of the Illinois Naval Militia, to consist of two battalions, each having a maximum strength of 400 men, and a minimum of 140. The 1st Battalion was based in Chicago, and the 2nd Battalion in Moline on the Mississippi. The 1st Battalion initially had 225 men, divided into four divisions, while the 2nd Battalion, had 176 men at its foundation, soon rising to 206. USS Michigan, seen here after her name was changed to USS Wolverine in 1905 The 1st Battalion met one evening each week and practiced boat-drill, both sail and oar, and were trained in the use of torpedoes, for which a steam-launch was specially fitted; and in the use of artillery, the cutlass, and small arms. The Navy Department presented the First Battalion with a complete stand of Hotchkiss rifles, cutlasses and revolvers, a Hotchkiss Rotary Gun and a battery of four 3-inch breech-loading field guns. Each summer there was a three-week cruise, for which the Militia was loaned a ship, usually obsolete, by the Navy. Up until 1901 this was usually the . The officers of the militia were all former naval men, and several were veterans of the Civil War. There was also an associate membership, composed of many of the leading merchants, bankers and professional men of Chicago, including Marshall Field, Lyman J. Gage, and Charles Deering. Further, honorary memberships were awarded to Shelby M. Cullom, J. Frank Aldrich, and Colonel Leroy P. Stewart, Inspector General of the First Brigade of the Illinois National Guard. Following the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, there were plans to move the replica battleship Illinois to a pier near Van Buren Street, where the ship would have become the headquarters of the militia. By 1896, the Illinois Naval Militia had five divisions: three in Chicago, one in Moline, and one in Alton, of approximately 250, 100, and 50 men respectively. At that time, it received $25,000 in federal funds annually, and operated several boats and a steam launch.  World War I  In late 1916 the Illinois Naval Militia was federalized into the National Naval Volunteers, created by an act of Congress and approved on August 29, 1916, under which the President was permitted to call them up for active duty with the United States Navy. Detailed plans for mobilization were prepared, and within forty-eight hours of the declaration of war on April 6, 1917, the entire Illinois Naval Militia had left Chicago by train for the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Some were actually at sea within a week of the declaration of war, and many more on the first group of ships that left the United States bound for Europe. At that time the Illinois Naval Militia consisted of 579 men organised into: * Headquarters and staff, Chicago, 38 men under the command of Captain Edward A. Evers, including medical staff, paymaster and commissary * 1st Division, Chicago, 40 men, Lieutenant John A. Mulholland * 2nd Division, Chicago, 45 men, Lieutenant James D. Davidson * 3rd Division, Chicago, 59 men, Lieutenant Glen G. Meade * 4th Division, Chicago, 58 men, Lieutenant George H. Melvin * 5th Division, Chicago, 54 men, Lieutenant Fred B. Orr * 6th Division, Chicago, 38 men, Lieutenant Walter E. Davis * 7th Division, Moline, 21 men, Lieutenant Otis W. Howard * 8th Division, Peoria, 44 men, Lieutenant Benjamin R. Belsley * 9th Division, Alton, 28 men, Lieutenant Josiah B. Maxfield * 10th Division, Quincy, 55 men, Lieutenant William A. Johnson * Marine Company, Chicago, 41 men, Captain Franklin T. Steele  Later history  World War I marked the high-point of the Illinois Naval Militia. The United States Naval Reserve was formed in 1915, and those states that maintained Naval Militias received very little federal aid, and then only if the members of their state Naval Militia were also members of the Naval Reserve, which offered more benefits. There was also competition for personnel from the Marine Corps Reserve and Coast Guard Auxiliary. Inevitably, the Naval Militia's popularity began to decline. By the 1970s, the Illinois Naval Militia had become little more than a social club located on the Chicago waterfront. When the city annexed the property, the militia effectively ceased to exist, but was not formally dissolved until 1988. However, on January 19, 2006, it was reauthorized, though never re- established, by an executive order of Governor Rod Blagojevich. Senate Republicans disputed the governor's authority to resurrect the militia.

Biography Reuben Rogers was imbued with both groove and spirit from birth. Raised in the Virgin Islands by parents who were both ministers, Rogers grew up playing gospel in church while absorbing the calypso and reggae rhythms of the islands. The discovery of jazz in his teens added the elements of freedom and improvisation to those innate qualities, creating the unique chemistry that would make Rogers one of the most distinctive and indemand bassists in modern jazz. Rogers‚Äô versatile mastery of both the acoustic and electric bass has led to opportunities on stages around the world alongside some of the music's most renowned artists, including Charles Lloyd, Wynton Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Tomasz Stanko, Roy Hargrove, Marcus Roberts, Nicholas Payton, Mulgrew Miller, Jackie McLean and Dianne Reeves, among many others. The range of styles and approaches represented by that partial list reflects the diversity and adaptability of Rogers‚Äô virtuosic and communicative gifts. Whether laying down a window-rattling groove, painting lush harmonic colors or whispering with delicate lyricism, Rogers's passion and singular voice shine through in any setting. While he is constantly adapting his always-recognizable voice to new settings, styles and challenges, Rogers‚Äô career is remarkable for the longevity of many of his artistic relationships. He maintains musical partnerships reaching back to his earliest mentors, and enjoys rewarding long-term collaborations with several other artists, including notable tenures with Joshua Redman, Charles Lloyd and the Aaron Goldberg Trio that have lasted for a decade or more. That blend of long- lasting relationships with novel encounters has led to an entrancing richness in Rogers‚Äô playing, an evolution that is the extraordinary result of deep exploration combined with fresh surprises. Over the last two decades, he has been featured on more than 100 recordings and countless international tours. In addition, in 2015 he released his first upright bass loop and sample collection, Reuben Rogers Volume 1. Rogers‚Äô sole release as a leader is the 2006 all-star session The Things I Am, which features Redman, Payton, Goldberg, drummers Gregory Hutchinson and Adam Cruz, percussionist Kahlil Kwame Bell, saxophonist Ron Blake, and guitarists Mark Whitfield and David Gilmore. Embracing new challenges while continuing to evolve the profound bonds he has formed with his most long-lasting associations has provided such a rich avenue of self-expression that he thrives in his role as, to use his own joking term, ‚ÄúSuper-Sideman.‚Äù Born in 1974, Rogers was always drawn to music and dabbled with the clarinet, piano, drums and guitar before discovering his true passion in the bass ‚Äì a love of low end that he attributes to the earth-shaking sounds of bass-driven calypso and reggae that emanated from nearly every car driving around his native Virgin Islands. His natural abilities were nurtured by his high school music teacher, Georgia Francis, who would continue to provide support and encouragement even after Rogers left the Islands to study at Berklee College of Music. He was introduced to jazz by saxophonist Ron Blake and drummer Dion Parson, with both of whom Rogers continues to work in the Afro-Caribbean tinged 21st Century Band, bringing his life and music full circle whenever he returns to the Islands. Both there and around the world, Rogers continues to give back with educational opportunities, leading workshops, clinics, private lessons and master classes to encourage the next generation of jazz musicians.

The flag has three horizontal stripes. From top to bottom, the stripes are green, white, and blue. The flag has been used officially as the flag of the Republic of Bashkortostan since 25 February 1992. The white stripe of the flag is charged with a Kurai flower in the center. The first national entity that represents the Bashkir people was the state of Bashkurdistan. The state uses a flag similar to the current flag of Bashkortostan. The flag was a tricolor consisted of blue, green and white. After the assimilation of Bashkurdistan to the Soviet Union in 1919, Bashkurdistan was absorbed to the USSR as an autonomous republic, the Bashkir ASSR. The Bashkir ASSR uses a flag similar to all of the autonomous republics: a red flag with the inscription of the nation's name. The flag of Bashkir ASSR is also identical with the flag of the Russian SFSR at the corresponding time.  Symbolism  The Kurai flower represents friendship, and its seven petals represent the seven tribes who bring unity, and consolidation to Bashkortostan. The blue represents the integrity, and the excellence of the thoughts of the Bashkir people, and the white stands for their peacefulness, and their willingness to cooperate, and the green for freedom, and eternal life.  History   As Bashkurdistan  The first national flag of Bashkortostan was designed by a Bashkir statesman, Akhmetzaki Akhmetshahovich Validov (1890-1970). The flag consisted of three horizontal stripes of equal size, which is blue, green and white. The flag was approved by the Order of the Government of Bashkurdistan No. 4547 on 20 August 1918. The order was published on June 19, 1918 in the Bashkort newspaper and on August 20, 1918 in the newspaper \\"Bashkortostan hokumetenen tele\\". This flag was also originally used as a common flag of the Bashkir army. The blue color on the flag symbolized the union of the Bashkirs with the Turks, the green colour symbolizes Islam, and the white colour symbolizes the desire for peace, happiness and prosperity.  As the Bashkir ASSR  After the formation of the Bashkir ASSR, the first flag of the Bashkir ASSR was adopted in 1920. The flag was a red flag, with the abbreviation of the name of the republic inscribed in the flag. The flag was used until 11 October 1924, when the decree \\"On the change of the State flag of the Bashkir ASSR\\", changed the design of the flag of the Bashkir ASSR. The inscription in the flag was replaced with the hammer and sickle. After the promulgation of the new constitution of the Bashkir ASSR, a new state flag of the Bashkir ASSR was approved on 23 July 1937 at the 10th All-Bashkir Congress of Soviets. The flag was the same with the flag of the Russian SFSR. The only difference was some additional inscriptions. The inscriptions underwent a minor change on 9 February 1938, after the transition of the writing system of the Bashkir language by the decree of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Bashkir ASSR. A new state flag of the Yakut ASSR was adopted on March 31, 1954, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Bashkir ASSR \\"On the State Flag of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\". The details of the flag design was specified with the adoption of the \\"Provision on the State Flag of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\" on 16 January 1956 by the Supreme Soviet of the Bashkir ASSR. The new state flag was identical with the state flag of the Russian SFSR, but with additional inscriptions of the abbreviation of the Bashkir ASSR in Bashkir and Russian languages.  As the Republic of Bashkortostan  = Background = After the adoption of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Bashkir SSR on October 11, 1990, the communist symbols of the republic ceased to reflect the current situations of Bashkortostan and the need to adopt new state symbols arose, including the new flag. Prior to the creation of the new flag, the leaders of the Bashkir nationalist movement decided to adopt the flag of Bashkurdistan as its official flag. = Competition = To address this need, by the Decree Number 211 of 26 November 1990, the Council of Ministers of the Bashkir SSR declared a countrywide competition for the best draft of state symbols of the republic which was to be submitted prior to 15 February 1991. Later, the Order of the Council of Ministers of the Bashkir SSR of December 30, 1990, approved the Regulations on the procedure for holding a competition, which extended the deadline for presenting sketches of the flag and coat of arms by March 1, 1991. The sketches were to be made in color on a thick paper with a minimum size of 30 √ó 20 cm. The sketches were to be attached with a note indicating the dimensions and a detailed explanation of the meaning of the symbols. The winners of the competition for the best design of state symbols were scheduled to be awarded four awards with 3,000 rubles each. Several prominent Bashkir artists submitted their projects. About 40 draft flags were submitted to the competition commission under the chairmanship of M. A. Ayupov. The competition was won by the project submitted by the art editor of the Kitap publishing house, Ural Masalimov, and Olga Asabina, a student from the Ufa School of Arts. The kurai flower was designed by Nil Khabibullin in the 1960s as a television screensaver for the Day of Bashkir Culture in Leningrad. The order of the stripes of the flag changed in 1991 after the Komi Republic adopted a similar flag to the flag of Bashkortostan. The green and white stripes was swapped.  Adoption as the state flag  On February 25, 1992, the Bashkir SSR was renamed as the Republic of Bashkortostan by the Supreme Council of the Bashkir SSR. The flag of the Republic of Bashkortostan was adopted on the same day.

The stand is famous for its limited approach to the Chicago- style hot dog, its toppings departing from tradition by including only mustard, onions, relish, sport peppers and fresh cut French fries placed on top, known as a Depression Dog. The menu is limited to hot dogs, double dogs, tamales and fries, and, atypical of Chicago hot dog stands, lacks any trace of ketchup even for dipping the fries. History Regular hot dog with everything In 1946 city worker Gene Mormino was at a Cubs game at Wrigley Field when Mormino decided if he added French fries to his hot dog it would give it a gratifying dose of saltiness and crunchiness. Based on that idea, he started a hot dog stand at Polk & Western Streets in Chicago. The restaurant quickly gained popularity, but three years later Mormino lost the entire stand in a card game in 1949. In 1950 Mormino gathered enough money and moved operations to the current location in River Grove, Illinois also taking in friend and co-worker Jude DeSantis. Since 2004 it has been owned and run by J. Mormino, Gene's son. In 2006, Gene's & Jude's was inducted into the Vienna Beef Hot Dog Hall of Fame. In 2011, in a competition of 64 hot dog stands across the country, it was chosen by the magazine \\"Every Day with Rachael Ray\\" and the food blog Serious Eats as the best hot dog in America. During the 50s, Gene and Jude's was a frame building and was not actually called Gene & Jude's - the sign of the stand simply said \\"Vienna Red Hots.\\" Customers referred to it as \\"River Road Hot Dogs\\" or \\"Vienna's.\\" During the 1950s, Gene & Jude's had a takeout window, and its drinks were sold in bottles.

The singer, better known under the nickname of \\"Sultana of Tarab\\" or \\"The Sultana\\", was considered to be the leading Egyptian singer in the 1920s.  Career  She studied in a French nuns‚Äô school, after which she began her career in singing in local clubs in the Ezbekiyya entertainment area. She joined the theatre of Aziz Eid, known for encouraging and developing the talents of his actors, actors who have among them many future stars such as Fatma Rushdi. This is where Mounira El Mahdeya acquired her acting technique and her lyrical talent as an actress and singer. She also was part of the ensemble of Salama Higazi and when he became ill, she sang his role in Salah al-Din al-Ayubi, while dressed onstage as a man. Her first recording was in 1906, under the name Sitt Munira (Lady Munira). She sang Arabic musical repertoire and also Arab adaptations of popular Italian operas, her performances became very popular and increasingly demanded by the public. She interpreted some male roles as Romeo and Mark Antony. She was a trailblazer and not afraid to express nationalist sentiments where she performed. She was later followed in the field by such actresses as Bahige Hafez, Fatma Rushdi and Aziza Amir. Her performances marked the increasingly popularity of new and lighter song formats, for instance, the taqtuqa, which she sang for women and theater audiences. However, Mounira al-Mahdiya was also proficient in the singing of adwar and qasa'id which she sang for male audiences. The great popularity of Mounira al-Mahdiya, intensified by the success of the film La Coquette in 1935, enabled her to build a network of fans from different backgrounds, both social and geographical, and a theatre now bears her name. She sang for kings and leaders in national celebrations such as \\"National Day of Turkey\\" in front of Kemal Atat√ºrk. Hassan al-Imam directed a film, Sultana al-Tarab about her life, produced by and starring the artist Sherifa Fadel.

Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were planned to be released Autumn 2009, but they have been \\"delayed indefinitely\\". Instead, a sequel, Grand Slam Tennis 2, was released exclusively for those consoles on February 2012. Some features for the Wii version include online play, Wii MotionPlus functionality, pick up and play, a Grand Slam career mode, and all four Grand Slam locations, including Wimbledon. The Wii version was also the first title in Europe to be bundled with the Wii MotionPlus. The in-game music was created by Paul van Dyk, who wrote and produced all the tracks in the game.  Gameplay  Grand Slam Tennis features 23 total players, including 10 retired legends and 13 of today's top players at the time of the game's release. It also includes a \\"Create-A-Player\\" mode. In the \\"Create-A-Player\\" mode, players can create their own unique player for use in all modes of the game. The player can customize their created player with branded clothing, racquet styles, accessories and physical appearance. Up to nine players can be created at any one time. Pat Cash serves as the commentator even when he is playing in a match. Grand Slam Tennis offers 12 different authentic stadiums from all four Grand Slam venues to play in, and is the first video game since Top Spin 2 to feature a licensed Wimbledon. Play Now is a mode allows players to enter either a singles or doubles match. This mode is available for both single and multiplayer forms of play. The player is able to select their venue, and to choose settings such as set length, number of sets, difficulty and the option of a tie-break. Grand Slam mode allows players to embark on a career with their created player. The career involves travelling to each of the four Grand Slam tournaments and attempt to achieve the Grand Slam by winning every tournament. Each tournament begins with a warm-up match against a fellow fictional rookie of average ability. The player can then challenge a legend or current player to a match in an attempt to learn the players special ability, e.g. Rafael Nadal's forehand topspin, or Bj√∂rn Borg's fitness. If the player is successful with their challenge, they may equip that special ability for use in future matches. The player can equip only one ability to start with, however as the player increases in skill, they will be able to equip multiple abilities at one time. Then the player will take part in a party style mini- game form of tennis along with fictional players, before starting the tournament. Every tournament starts at the round of 32 stage (round 3). Party Mode is a collection of mini-games that are each a slightly altered form of tennis, with slight rule changes: *Tag Team: 2 on 2 with players rotating and taking turns hitting the ball. *Aussie Doubles: 2 on 1 and the players rotate after each set. *Drop and Lob: use the drop shot and lob winners for double points. *Champs: time based game, take turns swinging, win the rally to become a champ. *King of the Court: beat the king to become king, only the king earns points. *Net-masters: Net shots are worth double points. *Triplets: Similar to Aussie doubles where (2 on 1) but the players do not rotate around. Online multiplayer consists of ranked or unranked matches where you can play anyone around the world. Ranked earns the player points when they beat someone and these points decide what overall ranking you are in the world. Unranked matches are friendly and do not earn any points for the player's online profile. It is good for people who are preparing to hit the leaderboards. When players win ranked matches they do not only win points for themselves but also for their country. There is a national leaderboard which shows which country has the best players.  Reception  Grand Slam Tennis received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported for release on July 2, 2009, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, two sixes, and one seven for a total of 27 out of 40. 411Mania gave it a score of eight out of ten and said, \\"If you are a big fan of the sport, and even engage in the sport in your free time, you will no- doubt enjoy this game. Grand Slam is a fun way to prepare you for the game's real online draw. If you've just been settling for Wii Tennis over the past few years, then now is the time to act, because Grand Slam Tennis is likely as good as it is ever going to get for the sport on the Wii.\\" The Daily Telegraph similarly gave it eight out of ten, saying, \\"Though ultimately lacking the precision a truly great tennis game needs, EA should be commended for a superb Wii effort which amply demonstrates the publisher's commitment to the format. If not quite the revolution it promised to be, Grand Slam Tennis shows enough promise that next year's iteration should be a classic.\\" Teletext GameCentral also gave it eight out of ten, saying, \\"EA's tennis and Wii MotionPlus debut is a success after all and an encouraging sign for the future.\\"  References   External links  *Grand Slam Tennis * Category:2009 video games Category:Cancelled PlayStation 3 games Category:Cancelled Xbox 360 games Category:EA Sports games Category:Electronic Arts franchises Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Tennis video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Wii games Category:Wii-only games Category:Wii MotionPlus games ","title":"Grand Slam Tennis"},{"id":"21526343","text":"A Man of Straw () is a 1958 Italian drama film directed by Pietro Germi.

The project was motivated by ambiguous germplasm identification, difficulty in tracing pedigree information, and lack of integration between genetic resources, breeding, evaluation, utilization and management data, all of which had constrained development of more knowledge-intensive crop research efforts. In conjunction with the IRRI, ICIS was developed by agricultural scientists and information technicians in several centres of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), in Advanced Research Institutions (ARIs), and in National Agricultural Research Systems (NARSs) to address these constraints. The project was discontinued in 2011. Implementations The rice implementation of the ICIS was referred to as the \\"International Rice Information System\\", or \\"IRIS\\".

Collocated with the White Sands Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, the NCCDS is the operations control facility for the network. It schedules most Space Network elements and supporting elements and provides interfaces for planning, acquisition, control, and status of the Space Network. The NCCDS is the point-of-contact between customers (who have satellites in orbit) and the Space Network for most scheduling and real-time performance. A customer may obtain Space Network support by submitting specific schedule requests to or establishing generic requirements with the NCCDS. The NCCDS translates customers‚Äô requirements into specific TDRS communications and tracking events. Additionally, the NCCDS notifies affected customers of scheduled system outages so that Mission Operation Centers (MOCs) can properly plan mission activities. Upon MOC request, the NCCDS provides operational performance information (such as data presence monitoring indicators and data quality monitoring data) on scheduled services during actual support to determine if conditions exist that will affect data quality. The NCCDS issues Network Advisory Messages (NAMs) to provide up-to-date information on network conditions and constraints. These messages are accessible via the NCCDS active NAM web site. The Goddard Space Flight Center uses the NAMs as a means of letting customers know of any performance constraints associated with the TDRS spacecraft.

The Eyo Festival, otherwise known as the Adamu Orisha Play, is a Yoruba festival unique to Lagos, Nigeria. In modern times, it is presented by the people of Lagos as a tourist event and due to its history, is traditionally performed on Lagos Island. The Eyo The word \\"Eyo\\" also refers to the costumed dancers, known as the masquerades that come out during the festival. The origins of this observance are found in the inner workings of the secret societies of Lagos. Back in the days, The Eyo festival is held to escort the soul of a departed Lagos King or Chief and to usher in a new king. It is widely believed that the play is one of the manifestations of the customary African revelry that serves as the forerunner of the modern carnival in Brazil.http://www.travelintelligence.com/travel-writing/2919/Africa-and- Middle-East/Nigeria/Lagos/Lagos/The-Eyo-Festival.html On Eyo Day, the main highway in the heart of the city (from the end of Carter Bridge to Tinubu Square) is closed to traffic, allowing for procession from Idumota to the Iga Idunganran palace. The white-clad Eyo masquerades represent the spirits of the dead, and are referred to in Yoruba as \\"agogoro Eyo\\" (literally: \\"tall Eyo\\"). An Eyo Iga Olowe Salaye masquerade jumping. The first procession in Lagos was on the 20th of February, 1854, to commemorate the life of the Oba Akintoye. Here, the participants all pay homage to the reigning Oba of Lagos. The festival takes place whenever occasion and tradition demand, though it is usually held as part of the final burial rites of a highly regarded chief in the king's court. Among the Yorubas, the indigenous religions have largely lost the greater majority of their traditional followers to Christianity and Islam. Be that as it may, the old festivals are still almost universally observed as tourist attractions which generate a lot of revenue for government and small businesses around the Lagos Island venue of the Eyo festival. It is during these occasions that their traditional monarchs and nobles exercise the most of their residual power. Order of events In his book Nigerian Festivals, travel writer and culture reporter Pelu Awofeso notes: A full week before the festival (always a Sunday), the ‚Äòsenior‚Äô eyo group, the Adimu (identified by a black, broad-rimmed hat), goes public with a staff. When this happens, it means the event will take place on the following Saturday. Each of the four other ‚Äòimportant‚Äô groups ‚Äî Laba (Red), Oniko (yellow), Ologede (Green) and Agere (Purple) ‚Äî take their turns in that order from Monday to Thursday.  History  Historically, Iperu is the source, cradle and originator of Eyo in Nigeria and the world. There are 5 different branches/types of Iga Eyo in Iperu Akesan Names of the families and Iga of Eyo each represents are: # Iga Pakerike which is symbolized by red cap of √©yo # Iga Agbonmagbe, also symbolized by blue cap of √©yo. # Iga √©yo Odoru # Iga √©yo Mogusen/Amororo # Iga √©yo Fibigbuwa The major source of √©yo in Iperu is the Iga √©yo Pakerik√© and other 4 are the Iperu Royal houses. > History made us to understand that Ey√≥ was brought to Lagos to entertain an > in-law which has now become something more celebrated in Lagos today.

In the fields of psychological testing and educational testing, \\"validity refers to the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores entailed by proposed uses of tests\\".American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education. (1999) Standards for educational and psychological testing. Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association. Although classical models divided the concept into various \\"validities\\" (such as content validity, criterion validity, and construct validity),Guion, R. M. (1980). On trinitarian doctrines of validity. Professional Psychology, 11, 385-398. the currently dominant view is that validity is a single unitary construct.Messick, S. (1995). Validity of psychological assessment: Validation of inferences from persons‚Äô responses and performances as scientific inquiry into score meaning. American Psychologist, 50, 741-749. Validity is generally considered the most important issue in psychological and educational testingPopham, W. J. (2008). All About Assessment / A Misunderstood Grail. Educational Leadership, 66(1), 82-83. because it concerns the meaning placed on test results. Though many textbooks present validity as a static construct,See the otherwise excellent text: Nitko, J.J., Brookhart, S. M. (2004). Educational assessment of students. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill- Prentice Hall. various models of validity have evolved since the first published recommendations for constructing psychological and education tests.American Psychological Association, American Educational Research Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education. (1954). Technical recommendations for psychological tests and diagnostic techniques. Washington, DC: The Association. These models can be categorized into two primary groups: classical models, which include several types of validity, and modern models, which present validity as a single construct. The modern models reorganize classical \\"validities\\" into either \\"aspects\\" of validity or \\"types\\" of validity-supporting evidence Test validity can itself be tested/validated using tests of inter-rater reliability, intra-rater reliability, repeatability (test-retest reliability), and other traits, usually via multiple runs of the test whose results are compared. Statistical analysis helps determine whether the differences between the various results either are large enough to be a problem or are acceptably small.  Historical background  Although psychologists and educators were aware of several facets of validity before World War II, their methods for establishing validity were commonly restricted to correlations of test scores with some known criterion.Angoff, W. H. (1988). Validity: An evolving concept. In H. Wainer & H. Braun (Eds.), Test Validity (pp. 19-32). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. Under the direction of Lee Cronbach, the 1954 Technical Recommendations for Psychological Tests and Diagnostic Techniques attempted to clarify and broaden the scope of validity by dividing it into four parts: (a) concurrent validity, (b) predictive validity, (c) content validity, and (d) construct validity. Cronbach and Meehl's subsequent publicationCronbach, L. J., & Meehl, P. E. (1955). Construct validity in psychological tests. Psychological Bulletin, 52, 281-302. grouped predictive and concurrent validity into a \\"criterion- orientation\\", which eventually became criterion validity. Over the next four decades, many theorists, including Cronbach himself,Cronbach, L. J. (1969). Validation of educational measures. Proceedings of the 1969 Invitational Conference on Testing Problems. Princeton, NJ: Educational Testing Service, 35-52. voiced their dissatisfaction with this three-in-one model of validity.Loevinger, J. (1957). Objective tests as instruments of psychological theory. Psychological Reports, 3, 634-694.Tenopyr, M. L. (1977). Content- construct confusion. Personnel Psychology, 30, 47-54.Guion, R. M. (1977). Content validity‚ÄìThe source of my discontent. Applied Psychological Measurement, 1, 1-10. Their arguments culminated in Samuel Messick's 1995 article that described validity as a single construct, composed of six \\"aspects\\". In his view, various inferences made from test scores may require different types of evidence, but not different validities. The 1999 Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing largely codified Messick's model. They describe five types of validity-supporting evidence that incorporate each of Messick's aspects, and make no mention of the classical models‚Äô content, criterion, and construct validities.  Validation process  According to the 1999 Standards, validation is the process of gathering evidence to provide ‚Äúa sound scientific basis‚Äù for interpreting the scores as proposed by the test developer and/or the test user. Validation therefore begins with a framework that defines the scope and aspects (in the case of multi-dimensional scales) of the proposed interpretation. The framework also includes a rational justification linking the interpretation to the test in question. Validity researchers then list a series of propositions that must be met if the interpretation is to be valid. Or, conversely, they may compile a list of issues that may threaten the validity of the interpretations. In either case, the researchers proceed by gathering evidence ‚Äì be it original empirical research, meta-analysis or review of existing literature, or logical analysis of the issues ‚Äì to support or to question the interpretation's propositions (or the threats to the interpretation's validity). Emphasis is placed on quality, rather than quantity, of the evidence. A single interpretation of any test result may require several propositions to be true (or may be questioned by any one of a set of threats to its validity). Strong evidence in support of a single proposition does not lessen the requirement to support the other propositions. Evidence to support (or question) the validity of an interpretation can be categorized into one of five categories: # Evidence based on test content # Evidence based on response processes # Evidence based on internal structure # Evidence based on relations to other variables # Evidence based on consequences of testing Techniques to gather each type of evidence should only be employed when they yield information that would support or question the propositions required for the interpretation in question. Each piece of evidence is finally integrated into a validity argument. The argument may call for a revision to the test, its administration protocol, or the theoretical constructs underlying the interpretations. If the test, and/or the interpretations of the test's results are revised in any way, a new validation process must gather evidence to support the new version.

Born in Hudson, Ohio, he and his four brothers moved to Kansas Territory in 1854. After his father's actions in \\"Bloody Kansas\\", John Jr. was arrested, mistreated while in prison, and later released. Shortly after this, John Jr. left Kansas with his father. John Jr. might have been aware of the plans for the raid at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. He was not a part of the raid itself, yet he knew all the details and even was part of the process preparing for it. Intelligence agent and liaison Because of tensions between John Brown and other members of the plans and cause, John Brown appointed John Jr. as the intelligence agent and liaison. This meant that John Jr. would be the go-between for John Brown and other members. This provided safety for John Brown and secrecy. Knowledge of the Virginia raid It was suspected that John Jr. was aware of his father's plans to raid the arsenal in Virginia. This plan was addressed to several men, although the definite position and location of attack might not have been as widely known except to those closest to Brown. It is said that John Jr. was well aware of the plans for the Virginia arsenal. John Jr. received word from his father to move the \\"tools\\" for the raid. The letter told John Jr. to do this \\"with perfect quiet\\" and to move only the tools, \\"not the other stuff\\", to a safe place where only Jr. and \\"the keeper\\" would know where they were. This cryptic message was received and Jr. travelled to Conneaut, Ohio, where the weapons had been secretly shipped, and moved them several miles south to a farm in Cherry Valley township. In early 1860, the U.S. Senate created a Select Committee to report on the invasion of Harper's Ferry. James M. Mason, head of the committee, submitted a resolution to compel John Jr. and two others to testify. A deputy of the Senate's Sergeant-at-Arms was sent to arrest the individuals and bring them to Washington. The deputy reported that Brown could not be arrested without the employment of armed force. Scouting and recruiting Recruiting John Brown sent John Jr. on a journey throughout the state of Pennsylvania, wanting him to acquaint himself with men \\"of the right stripe\\" John Jr. was to travel through the state of Pennsylvania and covertly find men willing to join John Brown's cause. The areas that John Jr. was ordered to visit, specifically, were Gettysburg, Bedford, Chambersburg and Uniontown. John Jr. spent time visiting Massachusetts, New York and Canada to enlist black supporters. These missions did not produce the desired results, as the army attacking the arsenal was merely twenty-one men. Scouting around Harper's Ferry John Jr. acted as his father's liaison for the raid in Virginia. In 1858, John Brown sent John Jr. to Virginia. This mission was to survey the area surrounding Harper's Ferry. Civil War and Jennison's Jayhawkers In July 1861, Brown decided to recruit a company of soldiers that would travel to Kansas and enlist with Kansas volunteer forces then operating in Missouri under the auspices of Kansas Senator James H. Lane. His intention was to enlist \\"abolitionists of the intense sort\\" and muster them under Colonel James Montgomery, one of Lane's three Lieutenants. John Brown's \\"Sharpshooters\\" garnered significant press attention as they traveled from Ohio to Kansas. However, on its arrival, the company had only signed 66 men. On November 9, 1861, while Brown was still recruiting in Michigan, the company elected to join Colonel Charles R. Jennison's First Kansas Cavalry, later designated the Kansas Seventh Volunteer Cavalry, and known in Missouri as Jennison's Jayhawkers. Upon his own arrival in December, Brown was mustered in as the captain of Company K of the Kansas Seventh. Brown served as captain of the company until May 1862, when he resigned because of his rheumatoid arthritis. He was succeeded as captain of the company by his second lieutenant, George H. Hoyt, who had been one of his father's lawyers following the Harpers Ferry attack. Post-war Following his resignation, Brown purchased 10 acres on the south shore of South Bass Island at Put-in-Bay, Ohio, becoming a socialist later in life. A visitor about 1871 described him as a \\"quiet, genial, warm-hearted farmer, amateur geologist, and land surveyor\\". In 1882 John Jr. travelled to Martinsville, Indiana, to identify the body of his brother Watson. (See The Burning of Winchester Medical College.) He was the guest of the Governor of Indiana for dinner. He remained at Put-In-Bay until his death on May 3, 1895.

The 94th episode of the show overall, \\"LaFleur\\" aired on March 4, 2009, on ABC in the United States, being simulcast on A in Canada.CTVglobemedia, (December 10, 2008) \\"A Gets Lost as Midseason Schedule Announced\\", A. Retrieved on December 20, 2008. The episode was written by co-executive producers Elizabeth Sarnoff and Kyle Pennington and directed by editor Mark Goldman. Having lost Charlotte Lewis in the time flashes, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford, Juliet Burke, Miles Straume, Jin-Soo Kwon and Daniel Faraday realize the time flashes have stopped, and they find themselves in 1974. Sawyer then perpetuates a lie to the DHARMA Initiative to protect themselves from mistakes of the past. Plot Following the events of \\"This Place is Death\\", a time jump briefly takes the remaining group of survivors ‚Äî James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) ‚Äî to a time when there is an ancient statue standing on the island (the remnants of which are seen in \\"Live Together, Die Alone\\"). They are only able to see the back of it before John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) turns the wheel, bringing the survivors forward to 1974, at the peak of the Dharma Initiative's presence on the island. Now that John has pushed the wheel, the time jumps have stopped and they are stuck in the past. The group comes across a pair of Dharma Initiative members who have been captured by two of the island's native inhabitants, known as the Others. Juliet and Sawyer kill the Others and free Amy (Reiko Aylesworth), but her husband Paul (Casey Byrnes) has been killed. The group returns to the barracks, where Amy resides. However, she tricks them into walking through the sonic fence which surrounds the barracks, knocking them unconscious. Sawyer wakes up and is confronted by Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison), the leader of the Dharma Initiative on the island. Sawyer tells him that his name is James LaFleur and that he and the other survivors were part of a shipwreck on the island, and that they are still looking for other members of their crew. Horace tells him that they will have to leave the next day on the submarine because they are not \\"Dharma material\\". Meanwhile, Daniel sees Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) as a young girl, but decides not to say anything to her. That night, the spokesman of the Others, Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), enters the barracks to determine why his treaty with Dharma was broken. Sawyer convinces Alpert not to attack Dharma, because he is the one who killed the Others. Alpert is further convinced when Sawyer shares knowledge of the events that transpired in 1954 in the episode \\"Jughead\\". Because Sawyer has successfully defused the situation, Horace allows the group to stay for two weeks and look for the other crew members of their ship, when in reality they are waiting for Locke to return with the survivors who left the island. Three years later, the survivors have joined Dharma and are living in the barracks. Sawyer is the well respected head of security, while Jin (who is now fluent in English) continues to search for those who left the island. Amy is pregnant with Horace's baby and due to give birth in two weeks. Following an argument between them, Horace gets drunk and hurls sticks of dynamite at trees and Amy goes into early labor; Juliet successfully delivers the baby, the first that survived in all her time on the island. Horace believes that Amy is not yet over her deceased husband, however Sawyer reassures him by stating that three years is enough time to get over someone, referring to his relationship with Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). Sawyer returns to his home, where he lives with Juliet, with whom he is now in a relationship. The next morning, he receives a call from Jin, who has found Kate, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) in the jungle (as seen in \\"316\\"). Sawyer secretly meets them far from the barracks, where they are reunited. Production In the episode \\"Confirmed Dead\\", Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in \\"LaFleur\\", when Charlotte is depicted as being a young girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for \\"Confirmed Dead\\" listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right. Reception The episode gained 12.396 million American viewers and 339,000 Australian viewers. \\"LaFleur\\" garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a positive review, stating \\"The narrative successfully establishes a new direction for the story from here on out and gives us an exciting, yet familiar, setting for the next few episodes.\\" He also liked the episode's focus on Sawyer, saying \\"This is a great James Ford episode. It's been a while since we've had an opportunity to see Sawyer's con artist skills put to the test and he definitely delivers this week.\\" References External links *\\"LaFleur\\" at ABC * * Category:Lost (season 5) episodes Category:2009 American television episodes ","title":"LaFleur (Lost)"},{"id":"21526912","text":"Lone Peak High School (LPHS) is a public high school in Highland, Utah, United States.

D'Adamo. These diets are based on the notion that blood type, according to the ABO blood group system, is the most important factor in determining a healthy diet, and each author recommends a distinct diet for each blood type. The consensus among dietitians, physicians, and scientists is that these diets are unsupported by scientific evidence. In what was apparently the first study testing whether there was any benefit to eating the \\"right\\" diet according to one's blood type, a study published in 2014 compared \\"biomarkers\\" such as body mass index, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol and insulin among young people, and assessed their diets over a period of a month. Based on one's diet each person was classified as tending to follow the blood-type diet recommended for O, A, or B. While there were significant differences in some biomarkers between these groups, there was no significant interaction between diet and biomarkers. In other words, those who were eating the \\"right\\" diet for their blood type did not show different biomarker values on average compared to those eating the \\"wrong\\" diet. The blood type diet was named by the British Dietetic Association as one of the \\"Top 5 Celeb Diets to Avoid in 2019\\".\\"BDA Releases Top 5 Celeb Diets to Avoid in 2019\\". British Dietetic Association. Retrieved 31 October 2019. Diet The underlying hypothesis of blood type diets is that people with different blood types digest lectins differently, and that if people eat food that is not compatible with their blood type, they will experience many health problems. On the other hand, if a person eats food that is compatible, they will be healthier. That hypothesis is, in turn, based on an assumption that each blood type represents a different evolutionary heritage. \\"Based on the ‚ÄòBlood-Type‚Äô diet theory, group O is considered the ancestral blood group in humans so their optimal diet should resemble the high animal protein diets typical of the hunter-gatherer era. In contrast, those with group A should thrive on a vegetarian diet as this blood group was believed to have evolved when humans settled down into agrarian societies. Following the same rationale, individuals with blood group B are considered to benefit from consumption of dairy products because this blood group was believed to originate in nomadic tribes. Finally, individuals with an AB blood group are believed to benefit from a diet that is intermediate to those proposed for group A and group B.\\"  Lack of evidence  As of 2017 there is no scientific evidence to support the blood type diet hypothesis and no clinical evidence that it improves health. Peter J. D'Adamo, a naturopath, is the most prominent proponent of blood type diets. Luiz C. de Mattos and Haroldo W. Moreira point out that assertions made by proponents of blood type diets that the O blood type was the first human blood type requires that the O gene have evolved before the A and B genes in the ABO locus; phylogenetic networks of human and non-human ABO alleles show that the A gene was the first to evolve. They argue that it would be extraordinary, from the perspective of evolution, for normal genes (those for types A and B) to have evolved from abnormal genes (for type O). Yamamoto et al. further note: \\"Although the O blood type is common in all populations around the world, there is no evidence that the O gene represents the ancestral gene at the ABO locus. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that a defective gene would arise spontaneously and then evolve into normal genes.

It was started in 1991 as part of The Best American Series published by Houghton Mifflin. Articles are chosen using the same procedure with other titles in the Best American Series; the series editor chooses about 70-100 article candidates, from which the guest editor picks 25 or so for publication; many, but not all of the remaining runner-up articles listed in the appendix. The series has been edited since its inception by Glenn Stout. Traditionally loaded with long-form feature stories and an occasional column, the annual book is considered a must-read by many sports writers, though the reach of its influence is debatable. Authors who have appeared in the series five or more times in its history are: Gary Smith (13 times), Wright Thompson (12), Steve Friedman (10), S.L. Price (nine), Charles P. Pierce (nine), William Nack (seven), Rick Reilly (seven), Roger Angell (seven), Pat Jordan (seven), Rick Telander (seven), Linda Robertson (six), Paul Solotaroff (six), Chris Jones (six), Chris Ballard (six), Mark Kram Jr. (five), Bill Plaschke (five), Peter Richmond (five) and Steve Rushin (five). It also includes award-winning writers whose genre is not exclusively sports writing, such as Jeanne Marie Laskas whose 2008 piece \\"G-L- O-R-Y!\\" offered a rare look at professional cheerleaders. The series culminated in 2000's Best American Sports Writing of the Century, which featured few works from the 1990s. The guest editor for that book was David Halberstam, who also was the guest editor for the first edition of the series, in 1991. Guest editors Selected from the cream of the sports journalism crop, nearly every guest editor has had at least one story published in a previous or later edition of the book. The only exceptions are John Feinstein, and Dick Schaap (whose work appeared twice in the Best American Sports Writing of the Century anthology).http://indiepro.com/glenn/best-american-sports- writing-index-1991-2010/ http://indiepro.com/glenn/best-american-sports- writing-2012/ * 1991: David Halberstam * 1992: Thomas McGuane * 1993: Frank Deford * 1994: Thomas Boswell * 1995: Dan Jenkins * 1996: John Feinstein * 1997: George Plimpton * 1998: Bill Littlefield * 1999: Richard Ford * 2000: Dick Schaap * 2001: Bud Collins * 2002: Rick Reilly * 2003: Buzz Bissinger * 2004: Richard Ben Cramer * 2005: Mike Lupica * 2006: Michael Lewis * 2007: David Maraniss * 2008: William Nack * 2009: Leigh Montville * 2010: Peter Gammons * 2011: Jane Leavy * 2012: Michael Wilbon * 2013: J.R.

The group advocates that the U.S. Government, U.S. corporations and individuals who benefited from the labors of former slaves should pay reparations of an undisclosed amount and say that further study needs to be done to find the exact amount, but estimate that the amount may be approximately $8,000,000,000,000 (eight trillion.) Members of N‚ÄôCOBRA seek reparations because of the many injuries caused from slavery and the continuing effect it has had upon their descendants. These reparations can take many forms including land, economic development, and other monetary resources. Based on the estimated U.S. population for 2008, this amounts to approximately $205,000 per Black citizen in the United States. Founding  N‚ÄôCOBRA was founded September 26, 1987, for the purpose of spreading information and supporting of the long-term goal of gaining reparations for African Americans. Founders of N‚ÄôCOBRA include National Conference of Black Lawyers, The New Afrikan Peoples Organization, and the Republic of New Afrika. After its founding the organization grew and now has chapters in various parts of the world including Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, and the United States. The work is based on nine national commissions: Economic Development, Human Resources, Legal Strategies, Legislation, Information and Media, Membership and Organizational Development, International Affairs, Youth and Education.  Leadership  The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America membership is broken down into three categories: individual members, national and local organizational members and organizational affiliates. There are chapters, members, and affiliates in many different places around the globe. N‚ÄôCOBRA membership is seen in many different parts of the United States and in parts of Africa, Europe, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Primary leadership for the organization is handled by a national board of directors.  Board of Directors:  = Officers = * Masharki Jywanza (National Female Co-Chair) * Kamm Howard ( National Male Co-Chair) * Brenda Lett (National Secretary) * Sababu Shabaka (National Treasurer) = At-large Board Members = * Faye Rose Toure, Esq * Deborah Rice-Lamar * Dr. Mae Christian * Dr. Marshall Lee = Regional Representatives = * Jeanette Herera (Midwest) * Woullard Lett (Northeast) * Jumoke Ifetayo (Southeast) * Diana Kimble (Southwest)  Actions  Legal action = H.R. 40 = H.R. 40 is the Congressional Reparations Study Bill that is introduced by Representatives John Conyers and Shelia Jackson Lee every Congress since 1989 and championed by N'COBRA's Legislative Commission. In 2001, N'COBRA supported H.R.40, entitled Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African- Americans Act. This bill was sponsored by Rep John Conyers Jr. On January 9, 2017, Congressman John Conyers (D-MI), introduced a newly revised HR40 Reparations Bill. It is titled The Commission to Study and Develop Reparations Proposals for African Americans Act. In a press release on the N'COBRA website, Congressman Conyers explained this new bill was drafted to reflect \\"the advances in the legal and societal discussion of the transatlantic slave trade and reparations. In the past, the focus on the social effects of slavery, segregation and its continuing economic implications remained largely ignored by mainstream analysis. ‚Ä¶the call for reparations represents a commitment to entering a constructive dialogue on the role of slavery and racism in shaping present-day conditions both in our community and American society as a whole.\\" Supporters The following list of persons who spoke at a 2002 rally in Washington DC: *Rev. Louis Farrakhan, Nation of Islam leader *Dr. Imari Obadele, founder of NCOBRA *Ms. Dorothy Benton-Lewis and Mr. Jahahara Alkebulan, male and female co-chairs *Ms. Adjoa Aiyetoro, Co-Chair of the NCOBRA Legal Commission *Mr. Charles Ogletree, Professor of Law at Harvard *Dr. Ron Daniels, founder and CEO of the Institute of the Black World *Ms Harriet Frost of the Rosewood Idella Carrier Foundation *Mr. Gary Grant of the Black Farmers Association *Mr. Hilary Shelton, director of the Washington, DC Branch of the NAACP *Mr. Damu Smith, director of the National Black Environmental Justice Network *Mr. Malik Zulu Shabazz, of the New Black Panther Party *Mr. Senghor Baye of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) *Mr. Omali Yeshitela of the African People's Socialist Party  Relationship with Black Lives Matter  In August, 2016, the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition which is tied to the Black Lives Matter movement, released a policy platform based around reparations. The platform listed six demands, comprising 40 policy recommendations, and \\"seeks reparations for lasting harms caused to African-Americans of slavery and investment in education and jobs.\\" N'COBRA lauded the announcement of this platform as \\"the first time these black-led organizations linked to the decentralized Black Lives Matter movement have banded together to write a comprehensive foundational policy platform.\\"  Recent News  According to a 2016 article in the Washington Post, a U.N. panel said they believe the U.S. owes Black people reparations. A report done by a U.N connected panel claimed because of slavery, Americans with African descent should receive reparations in some form. In the same article, it is also stated that \\" Despite substantial changes since the end of the enforcement of Jim Crow and the fight for civil rights, ideology ensuring the domination of one group over another, continues to negatively impact the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today. The dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion amongst the US population.\\" They concluded that because of slavery, violence against the Black community, and terrorist acts like lynching, Black people should receive some sort of apology or other form of reparation.

Louis, le Grand dauphin fell in love with her after the death of his consort in 1690 and began a liaison with her. Simultaneously, she was in a relationship with Count Francois Alphonse de Clermont-Chaste, a member of the entourage of the mar√©chal de Luxembourg. Luxembourg advised Clermont-Chaste to marry Choin in order to acquire power over the dauphin through her.Mitford, Nancy (Swedish): Solkonungen. Ludvig XIV och Versailles.( The Sun King. Louis XIV and Versailles) G√∂teborg, Bonniers. 1966 It was rumoured that Marie √âmilie and Clerment-Chaste planned to dominate the throne by producing a child with her, which they would present as the child of Louis. When these plans were discovered, after the correspondence between Marie √âmilie and Clerment was presented to the king, they were both exiled from court,Mitford, Nancy (Swedish): Solkonungen. Ludvig XIV och Versailles.( The Sun King. Louis XIV and Versailles) G√∂teborg, Bonniers. 1966 which did not, however, permanently end her relationship with Louis. Marriage Marie √âmilie married Louis secretly in 1694. No details are known of the ceremony, but on 19 July 1694, the Dauphin referred to her as his legal spouse in a letter to his father's morganatic wife, Madame de Maintenon.Mitford, Nancy (Swedish): Solkonungen. Ludvig XIV och Versailles.( The Sun King. Louis XIV and Versailles) G√∂teborg, Bonniers. 1966 Nonetheless, the marriage was not officially recognised, Marie √âmilie did not acquire the title of Dauphine, continuing to be officially referred to as Mademoiselle de Choin. She did not participate in court life. Marie √âmilie resided in the palace of Meudon, within which she imitated the role played at court by Madame de Maintenon, with whom she got along well, acting as her husband's hostess, receiving dukes and foreign diplomats. She was allowed to sit in a chair in the presence of members of the royal house and to call them by their names rather than by title. Yet she dressed simply, took no further advantage of the marriage and did not participate in politics.Mitford, Nancy (Swedish): Solkonungen. Ludvig XIV och Versailles.( The Sun King. Louis XIV and Versailles) G√∂teborg, Bonniers. 1966 Pregnant at the time of her secret marriage, she gave birth to a son who was sent to the countryside and died aged two in 1697 without receiving a legal name.Genealogy Database by Daniel de Rauglaudre No further children are known to have been born to the marriage.  Later life and death  After Louis's death in 1711, she withdrew into retirement. Louis left her a fortune in his will, but she tore up the will with the words that when he was alive she needed only him and after his death only a pittance.Mitford, Nancy (Swedish): Solkonungen. Ludvig XIV och Versailles.( The Sun King. Louis XIV and Versailles) G√∂teborg, Bonniers. 1966 Marie Emilie was given a pension by the king and devoted herself to charity, not participating in society life. She died in Paris, \\"universally respected for her private virtues\\".

With the outbreak of the Black Death in the 15th century, the abbey also took care of the new contagium. St. Anthony was chosen due to its widespread depiction in company of a small pig, an animal whose fat was used for the treatment of the plague. The complex was modified and rebuilt several times. It initially included a hospital, of which only the fa√ßade remain, the preceptory itself and the church. The latter appears today in Lombard-Gothic style, after its renovation in the 14th-15th centuries. Annexed to it is the bell tower, also in Gothic style (14th century). The interior was decorated with numerous frescoes starting from the 13th century, some of which painted by Giacomo Jaquerio in the early 15th century.

This Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 85 of 1933) appears to be still on the statute books. In 1956, however, it was decided that there were too few traditional speakers in County Clare to justify its inclusion in the Official Gaeltacht.

It says that there is a demand for Gaeltacht status. It has also claimed that native speakers who received grants under the Sc√©im Labhairt na Gaeilge, a scheme first established by the State in 1933 with the aim of supporting the language among traditional speakers, still live in the county and speak Irish.

The flat terrain of the Plain is in contrast to the varied and hilly terrain of the remainder of the campus. The Plain rises approximately above the Hudson River and has been the site of the longest continually occupied U.S. Army garrison in America since 1778. In its early years, the entire academy was located on the Plain and it was used for varying activities ranging from drill and mounted cavalry maneuvers to an encampment site for summer training to a sports venue. Currently, the Plain refers to just the parade field where cadets perform ceremonial parades. Geography The Plain in the early days of the academy comprised approximately of relatively flat ground rising approximately above the Hudson River. It was not always the level and manicured parade ground that is seen today. History Wood's Monument is moved to the cemetery.Miller, p.5. Before the development of the modern academy, the term \\"The Plain\\" referred to the relatively flat geographic area that the current academy occupies. It included the area where Fort Clinton was constructed. The term now specifically applies to the parade field. The Connecticut militia that first occupied West Point on 27 January 1778 encamped there during that particularly harsh winter. That summer, construction began on Fort Arnold, later to be renamed Fort Clinton, which stood at the far eastern edge of the Plain and overlooked the sharp westerly turn in the Hudson River. The land was owned by a private citizen, a Mr. Stephen Moore of North Carolina. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton authorized the army's purchase of the land for $11,085 in 1790.Ambrose, p. 10. Football on the Plain, c1900. Execution Hollow is clearly visible just above the diagonal walkway in the mid-right of this picture. Battle Monument is on the back right side of it. In the early days of the academy, the Plain was used for many purposes beyond its current use for ceremonial parades. From its earliest days until just after World War I, the Corps of Cadets spent their summers encamped on the Plain as part of their tactical field training. Semi- permanent tents were erected, hard-floor planking, and furniture and books were moved out to the campsite as the Cadets moved out of the barracks for the summer. Cadets practiced military drill and cavalry maneuvers on the Plain's open areas.Hancock, p. 193. However, after the superintendency of Douglas MacArthur from 1919 to 1922, summer camp was no longer held on the Plain. Before the construction of Michie Stadium, the Army football team played their home games upon the Plain. For the first 100 years of the academy, there was a large depression on the northern edge of the plain near trophy point. This area was known locally as Execution Hollow as reportedly military executions occurred there during the Revolutionary War period. The hollow remained until 1912, when it was filled in with soil excavated from the construction of Bartlett Hall.Lange, P. 8 The area now is a small grassy field between the Superintendent's review stands, Clinton Field, and Battle Monument on Trophy point. The field contains a small putting green used by the Department of Physical Education for golf instruction and a spruce tree planted in 2009 as a post Christmas tree.

Because of the cold weather common at the academy, cadet reviews are usually held between April and November. Cadets also use the Plain for recreational activities or as a place to retreat from the barracks during the late spring or early fall. The general public is asked not to walk on the grass Plain. Visitors can access and view the Plain up- close from Diagonal Walk, a walkway which bisects the Plain running north‚Äìsouth from Eisenhower statue to MacArthur statue. The Plain is also the location of the Corps of Cadets' Tap Vigils when a member of the corps passes away. Shortly before 2330 hours, the entire corps assembles in silence on the large paved southern edge of the plain, known as the Apron. The traditional military hymn \\"Taps\\" is played, followed by a singing of the \\"Alma Mater\\" by the corps, followed by the playing of \\"Amazing Grace\\" by the Pipes and Drums. The cadets then disperse in silence back to their rooms. Monuments The periphery of the Plain is home to several monuments to past American military leaders. A horse-mounted George Washington is depicted atop Washington Monument on the western edge looking out over the Plain. World War II Generals of the Army are remembered with Eisenhower Monument and MacArthur Monument, which sit at opposite ends of Diagonal Walk. In the far north west corner, Thayer Monument commemorates the \\"Father of the Military Academy\\", and stands watch over the Plain.

History  Pope Gregory I (590‚Äì604) is credited with establishing the first papal schola cantorum at the Basilica of St. Peter, after the model of the guild- like papal schola at St. John Lateran. This choir remained in Rome during the Avignon Papacy (1309‚Äì1378) and was merged with the Avignon papal choir upon the Pope's return to Rome. Sixtus IV (1471‚Äì1484) transferred all papal functions and the papal choir to his newly built chapel, now known as the Sistine Chapel, while providing for a small choir of eight singers for the chapter functions at St. Peter's. On 19 February 1512, Julius II (1503‚Äì1513) issued a Bull completely reorganizing the Vatican capella (hence the name \\"Julia\\" in Latin, \\"Giulia\\" in Italian).\\"Sistine Choir,\\" Catholic Encyclopedia (1913). He enlarged its revenue and its size to twelve men and twelve boys, so that it could serve as a sort of preparatory school for the papal choir, on the plan of the ancient schola.Sistine Chapel Choir and H. Bewerunge, \\"Palestrina and Orlando di Lasso,\\" The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, p. 1092. Among the Cappella Giulia's choir masters were esteemed names such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1551‚Äì1554 and 1571‚Äì1594), Giovanni Animuccia, Francesco Soriano, Stefano Fabri, Orazio Benevoli, Domenico Scarlatti, Niccol√≤ Jommelli, Pietro Raimondi, Salvatore Meluzzi, and Niccol√≤ Antonio Zingarelli. The capella was disbanded in 1980 and replaced temporarily by a choir directed by the Spanish Monsignor Pablo Colino Paulis (Magister ad nutum) to continue to perform the key functions of the previous choir. In this new choir, called the Musical Chapel of the Sacrosanct Patriarchal Vatican Basilica, unlike the previous capella, the boy choristers were replaced by female voices, when they sang on major holidays (Easter, Christmas, and Saints Peter and Paul). In 2006 the choir was again reorganized, retaining the addition of women's voices, under the current choir master, the Canadian Father Pierre Paul, O.M.V.Sandro Magister, \\"A New Musical Season Opens at the Vatican ‚Äì And Here's the Program,\\" L'Espresso, 18 October 2007; cf.

Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., is a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of five victims of extraordinary renditions against Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., which had provided services that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used to perform renditions. Background According to an article that appeared in October 2006 in The New Yorker, the CIA is a Jeppesen customer. The article claims that the company has provided navigational and logistics support to the agency's extraordinary rendition program. The article says Jeppesen provided \\"flight plans, clearance to fly over other countries, hotel reservations, and ground- crew arrangements\\" to the CIA. According to the article, an unnamed former employee quoted Bob Overby, Jeppesen's managing director, as saying at a meeting, \\"We do all of the extraordinary renditions flights‚Äîyou know, the torture flights. ... Let's face it, some of those flights end up that way... It certainly pays well.\\" On November 16, 2006, Amnesty International staged a demonstration in front of the company's International Trip and Flight Planning Office in San Jose, California to protest their involvement in the rendition program.Demonstration at Jeppesen Corporation in San Jose, California.

ACLU lawsuit On May 30, 2007, the ACLU sued Jeppesen on behalf of five plaintiffs who had been tortured in Morocco, Egypt and a United States base in Afghanistan. The suit alleged that, since 2001, Jeppesen provided support for at least seventy flights for the CIA's secret extraordinary rendition program, transporting prisoners overseas to be tortured. The suit was dismissed in February 2008 on a motion from the United States government, on the theory that proceeding with the case would reveal state secrets and endanger relations with other nations that had cooperated. On September 8, 2010, in a 6‚Äì5 en banc ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the suit, and the ACLU filed an appeal with the Supreme Court in December 2010.

The first fatality occurred on 2 August 2002.Legionnaires' alert claims first victim The source of the bacteria was later found to be from steam coming out of a badly maintained air conditioning unit.

Ultimately seven people died and 172 cases were reported (a case fatality rate of around 4%), ranking as the second worst in British history and seventh worst globally by death count. The coroner for Furness and South Cumbria criticised the council for its failings with regard to health and safety at the conclusion of an inquest into the seven deaths. In 2006, council employee Gillian Beckingham and employer Barrow Borough Council were cleared of seven charges of manslaughter. Beckingham, the council senior architect, was fined ¬£15,000 and the authority ¬£125,000. The authority maintained that Beckingham was not responsible for the building or the defective plant and dismissed the building Technical Manager Kevin Borthwick. He was later re-instated to his position following a challenge by his union. The borough council was the first public body in the country to have faced corporate manslaughter charges. Beckingham maintained that a contract to maintain the plant was in place but failings of others meant that the work was never undertaken, nor was the lack of adequate maintenance pursued by those responsible for the building. Following the trials, the contractor responsible for maintaining the defective plant, Interserve, settled a ¬£1.5 million claim by the Council for damages.

Brust (November 4, 1869 ‚Äì June 22, 1946) was an American architect, and fellow of the American Institute of Architects, who practiced his craft from approximately 1893 to 1946, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Brust designed hundreds of residential, ecclesiastical (churches, convents, chapels, monasteries, rectories, and seminaries), business, school, medical, public, memorial, recreation, and theater commissions. In 1906, Peter Brust partnered with Richard Philipp and formed the architecture firm of Brust & Philipp. By the 1920s, the firm was the largest architectural firm in Wisconsin. In 1938, Peter Brust established the firm of Brust & Brust with his sons John and Paul. The firm remained in that name until 1973 when it became Brust-Zimmerman. The residential designs of Peter Brust were overwhelmingly influenced by Old English architecture. Brust didn't intend to bring medieval architecture to Milwaukee, but rather bring the best of English tradition and infuse into his designs. The English influence on house design was felt across America from the 1880s into the 1940s. The Tudor Revival craze (influenced by wealthy Americans) hit Milwaukee in the 1920s and 1930s, which Brust & Phillip capitalized on.

The channel, which operated out of facilities based in downtown Houston, Texas, originally began in April 2005 as a sub-feed of sister network Fox Sports Southwest and became a separate 24-hour channel on January 12, 2009. Fox Sports Houston held the broadcast rights to most of the professional sports franchises based in Houston, carrying games from the Houston Astros (Major League Baseball), Houston Rockets (NBA) and the Houston Dynamo (Major League Soccer); it also carried coverage of collegiate events involving Conference USA members, the Houston Cougars and Rice Owls as well as high school sports events throughout the Houston area. After losing the broadcast rights to the Astros and Rockets to Root Sports Southwest, the network was re-absorbed into Fox Sports Southwest on October 5, 2012. History A separate FSN feed for Houston and the surrounding area launched in April 2005, just as the Astros and Rockets were working together to establish their own local sports network with the city's then-dominant cable television provider, Time Warner Cable. For the better part of two seasons (from 2003 to 2005), all Houston Rockets games that were not televised nationally on ABC or ESPN were only available on broadcast television, splitting games between independent station KNWS-TV (channel 51, now Azteca affiliate KYAZ) and WB affiliate KHWB (channel 39, now CW affiliate KIAH). Working out with the new deal with the Astros and Rockets, Fox Sports Networks decided to establish a completely separate feed for Houston and its surrounding outer television markets, however just operating evenings and on weekends, while Fox Sports Southwest continued to transmit in the region in other dayparts. Fox Sports Houston logo, used from 2009 to 2012. In addition to Astros and Rockets telecasts, FSN Houston also broadcast games featuring the University of Houston and Rice University football and basketball teams, and local high school sports events. The channel also aired a Houston-branded edition of the Southwest Sports Report, the network's nightly sports news and highlights program. Fox Sports Houston produced Rockets and Astros games for co-owned MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station KTXH (channel 20). On January 12, 2009, Fox Sports Houston split from Fox Sports Southwest and relaunched as a 24-hour standalone channel. The new feed allowed the channel to provide more local content and maintain its own identity, as well as air replays of Houston Rockets and Astros games, which it had not been able to do before, according to Ramon Alvarez, spokesman for Fox Sports Houston. It also allowed for more extensive coverage of the city's NFL franchise, the Houston Texans. Fox Sports Southwest's primary Dallas-based feed was previously carried in the Houston market for most non-event programming. The channel was carried only for live game broadcasts on DirecTV and Dish Network, whose viewers continued to receive Fox Sports Southwest as their full-time RSN. Loss of broadcast rights and re-absorption into Fox Sports Southwest Fox Sports Houston's partnership with the Rockets ended after the 2011‚Äì12 NBA season, and their partnership with the Astros ended after the 2012 Major League Baseball season. The two teams subsequently struck broadcast deals with Comcast (which acquired the cable television franchise rights to the Houston market in a trade with Time Warner Cable in exchange for the latter's Dallas-Fort Worth system in 2007), forming the nucleus of the new regional sports network Comcast SportsNet Houston, which became the home to both teams when it launched on October 1, 2012. On October 2, 2012, Fox Sports Networks announced that it would shut down Fox Sports Houston three days later on October 5, re-absorbing it into Fox Sports Southwest; the move resulted in the layoffs of some of the network's staff. Longtime network personality Patti Smith remains with Fox Sports as a host for team programming pertaining to the Houston Texans, while Kevin Eschenfelder left the network in late September to join Comcast SportsNet Houston as a reporter. Reporter Greg Lucas also did not continue with Fox Sports; while it was initially unclear if he would join Comcast SportsNet Houston, he ultimately did not move to that network.

It operates 4 metro lines (see Milan Metro), 18 tram lines (see Trams in Milan), 131 bus lines and 4 trolleybus lines (see Trolleybuses in Milan), carrying about 776 million passengers in 2018. ATM manages other minor transport services in Lombardy as well. These include Radiobus, a demand-responsive minibus service; the Cascina Gobba‚ÄìSan Raffaele people mover; the Como‚ÄìBrunate funicular; the BikeMi bike sharing service. Furthermore, since 2008, it has been operating the Copenhagen Metro in Denmark. History An old 4800 series articulated streetcar (Jumbotram), on the new metrotranvia 7, in Precotto. A ticket celebrating the 75th anniversary of ATM. Class 1500 streetcar on line 29 (now replaced by lines 9 and 10) in Corso Colombo, restored to the original 1920s white-and- yellow livery. Public transport in Milan started on August 17, 1840, with the opening of the Milan-Monza railway. Horse-drawn buses were introduced in 1841. Services were run by the Societ√† Anonima degli Omnibus (SAO), \\"Omnibus Anonymous Company\\". The company was responsible for 11 bus lines between 1861 and 1865. Few years later the first horse-drawn trams were introduced: 3 lines were opened in 1881 followed in 1893 by the first electric tramway, built by Edison company. Two years later the same company opened 18 more lines, all ruled by municipality offices. Edison's concession on new lines expired in 1917, leaving all the operations to the municipality. Few years later the public offices responsible for public transport operations were made independent, becoming the Azienda Tranviaria Municipale (ATM) in 1931. In the meantime, the first petrol powered bus lines were introduced in 1905, operated by SITA (Societ√† Italiana Trasporto con Automobili) and then moved under control of ATM along with the first trolleybus line (1933). After World War II resources were focused on bus lines and, since the mid-1950s, on the new metro. Milan Metro construction began in 1957 and in 1964 the first line was opened. Five years later the Line 2 was inaugurated. On 1 January 1965, ATM changed its name to \\"Azienda Trasporti Municipali\\" (Municipal Transport Company). In these years a new generation of longer tram (jumbotram) were introduced. In the 1960s Italy and Milan saw a strong increase in car owners, and the increasing importance of private over public transport. Several new stations of the two metro lines are opened in the following years. The new Line 3 was inaugurated in 1990. Tram line 15 to Rozzano was the first to go beyond the city border in 1992. ATM changed its name again in 1999 to adopt the current one, \\"Azienda Trasporti Milanesi\\", and it became a S.p.a. in 2001. In these years, the first on-demand service, the Radiobus, was introduced to operate during the night. The first light rail line, Line 7, was introduced on 7 December 2002. This was followed by other two lines on 8 December 2003: Line 4 and Line 15. These three lines are howsoever referred to as trams. New magnetic tickets and electronic pass cards were introduced in 2004. The complete upgrade process took 3 years. A 7000 series low-floor articulated streetcar (Eurotram), on line 15. An IVECO trolleybus on line 92 at the Bovisa, near the railway station. A Mercedes-Benz Citaro on line 70, in via Carlo Farini. A train of underground line M3 bound for piazzale Maciachini (now extended to Comasina) entering the Duomo station. Network Rapid transit The Milan rapid transit network consists of 4 lines: * M1 Sesto I Maggio - Rho Fiera / Bisceglie * M2 Assago Milanofiori Forum / Abbiategrasso - Cologno Nord / Gessate * M3 San Donato - Comasina * M5 San Siro Stadio - Bignami The network is more than long and serves 113 stations, mainly underground. The system has a daily ridership of over 1 million and is the biggest in Italy. The company will also manage the fourth line, the fifth in order of construction, when operational. Outside of Italy, ATM also operates the Copenhagen Metro. Trams The urban tram network comprises 15 lines fully within the city limits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 24, 27, 33), plus two lines linking the city centre with the hinterland (15 Milan- Rozzano, 31 Milan-Cinisello Balsamo), and one interurban line (179 Milan- Limbiate). Lines 1, 5, 10, 19 and 33 are operated with Peter Witt streetcars from the 1920s. Trolleybuses The trolleybus network consists of 4 lines: lines 90 and 91 (known as la circolare, \\"Circle line\\") run around the city, while lines 92 and 93 serve some of the northern and eastern neighbourhoods. Buses ATM operates 67 urban bus lines and 52 interurban bus lines.

On August 26, 2003 a Beech 1900D crashed into water 100 yards offshore from Yarmouth, Massachusetts, United States shortly after taking off from Barnstable Municipal Airport in Yarmouth. Both pilots were killed. Aircraft and crew A Colgan Air Beechcraft 1900D, similar to the aircraft involved in the accident Flight 9446 was an unscheduled deadhead flight of a Beechcraft 1900D (registration '). The aircraft had just finished receiving maintenance in Yarmouth, Massachusetts, and was being repositioned to Albany, New York to return to revenue service. The two occupants of the plane were its pilots, Captain Scott Knabe (39) and First Officer Steven Dean (38). Accident Flight 9446 departed Barnstable Municipal Airport on August 26, 2003 at 15:40 eastern daylight time. Shortly after takeoff, Flight 9446 declared an emergency and reported a trim problem. The aircraft entered into a left turn and reached an altitude of 1,100 feet. The pilots requested a return to Barnstable, and air traffic control cleared the flight to land on any runway. The airplane continued its left turn in a nose-up attitude, and then pitched down and crashed into water near the airport. Investigation and aftermath The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident. The NTSB determined that Flight 9446 was the first flight after maintenance personnel replaced the forward elevator trim cable. The maintenance personnel had skipped a step in the maintenance process. In addition, the aircraft maintenance manual depicted the elevator trim drum backwards. As a result, the trim system was configured in a manner that caused the trim tabs in the cockpit to move in the correct direction, but the actual trim wheel (which controlled the flight control surfaces) moved in the opposite direction. The NTSB also determined that the pilots did not notice the maintenance error because the captain failed to perform a preflight checklist, which included an elevator trim check. The pilots manually set nose-up trim prior to departure, but because of the improper maintenance, this actually set the elevator trim to the full nose-down position. The NTSB determined that it would have taken 250 pounds of force on the control yoke for the pilots to keep the plane airborne, making a safe landing nearly impossible. Investigators programmed a flight simulator with the improper trim settings and made six simulated flights. Five attempts resulted in crashes shortly after takeoff; in one attempt, the simulator pilot was able to circle for a landing, but impacted terrain while attempting to land. The NTSB published its findings and determination of probable cause on August 31, 2004. The NTSB determined that the probable causes of the accident were the maintenance crew's improper replacement of the forward elevator trim cable, and subsequent inadequate functional check of the maintenance performed. The NTSB identified the flightcrew's failure to follow the checklist procedures, and the aircraft manufacturer's erroneous depiction of the elevator trim drum in the maintenance manual, as contributing to the accident. After the NTSB's final report was published, Aero News Network observed that Beechcraft 1900D maintenance manuals were considered as accident factors in two previous fatal accidents. However, Raytheon (owner of Beechcraft) denied blame for the crash of Flight 9446, and a company spokesman said the accident would not have happened without the Colgan Air maintenance crew's mistakes.

HADITU was led by Henri Curiel.Beinin, Joel. Was the Red Flag Flying There?: Marxist Politics and the Arab-Israeli Conflict in Egypt and Israel, 1948-1965. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990, p. 106. The movement followed the line of the National Democratic Revolution.Beinin, Joel,and Zachary Lockman. Workers on the Nile: nationalism, communism, Islam, and the Egyptian working class, 1882 - 1954. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press, 1998, p. 452. History HADITU was founded in July 1947 through the merger of two communist factions, the Egyptian Movement for National Liberation and Iskra.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990. p. 58.Meijer, Roel. The Quest for Modernity: Secular Liberal and Left-Wing Political Thought in Egypt, 1945-1958. London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2002, p. 120. Soon after the foundation of HADITU, the organization had a membership of around 1,400, being the largest communist organization in Egypt at the time.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, pp. 57, 59. HADITU published a legal weekly newspaper, al- Jamahir (ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿßŸáŸäÿ±, 'The Masses'). Al-Jamahir had a regular circulation of 7-8,000, but the circulation occasionally peaked to around 15,000.Beinin. Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990. p. 59 Al-Jamahir played an important role in the growth of HADITU. Free copies of the newspaper were handed out to workers at factories, and the newspaper became an important rallying point to spread the influence of the movement among industrial workers. The newspaper had a relatively high journalistic standard, with photographic essays and expos√©s about industrial conditions.Beinin and Lockman, Workers on the Nile, 1998, pp. 352‚Äì353. The paper was closed in 1948 under martial law provisions that the Egyptian government enforced at the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. In early 1948 Curiel presented the paper \\"The Line of National and Democratic Forces\\" to the HADITU Central Committee, a document that became an important point of reference in the organization. The document contained criticisms against the earlier leadership and political line of the Egyptian communist movement. HADITU had a student front, the Communist Student League.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, p. 111. HADITU also led the Preparatory Committee for an Egyptian Students Federation.Beinin and Lockman, Workers on the Nile, 1998, p. 427. HADITU went through a series of splits. One of the first groups to break away was the Revolutionary Bloc, led by Shudi Atiya ash- Shafi (He had left after not being included in the HADITU Central Committee as the movement was reorganized. Ash-Shafi argued that HADITU had a bourgeois outlook). In April 1948 two HADITU splinter groups, Toward a Bolshevik Organization and Voice of the Opposition, merged to form the Egyptian Communist Organisation. Another HADITU splinter group was Toward an Egyptian Communist Party (NAHSHAM).Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, pp. 105, 110. In the wake of the January 1950 election in Egypt, the political climate was normalized somewhat. The more open political environment enabled HADITU to work more effectively and expand its influence. HADITU was the most effective political force in the workers movement at the time, playing a leading role in various trade unions.Beinin and Lockman, Workers on the Nile, 1998, pp. 397, 406. In the summer of 1950, Curiel was expelled from Egypt. Curiel was classified as a \\"foreigner\\", although he had held Egyptian citizenship for 15 years. In exile, Curiel settled down in Paris where he formed a HADITU branch of Egyptian-Jewish √©migr√©s. The group became known as the 'Rome Group'. The Rome Group was able to secure some financial supplies to HADITU and translated HADITU documents into French and circulated them in Europe. While Curiel formally remained a HADITU Central Committee member, he no longer played any role in the decision-making of the organization. He was not consulted on any major matters.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, pp. 106‚Äì107. HADITU supported the 1952 coup d'√©tat, being the only communist faction to do so. Several prominent figures in the Revolutionary Command Council and the Free Officers had links to HADITU. RCC member Yusuf Siddiq was a member of HADITU. Another RCC member, Khalid Muhyi ad-Din, had briefly been affiliated to HADITU in 1947. Whilst not a RCC member, HADITU member Ahmed Hamrush was a prominent figure in the Free Officers Movement. HADITU member Ahmed Fu'ad, a military judge, acted as a liaison between HADITU and Gamal Abdel Nasser. However, in retrospect it appears that HADITU overestimated its influence over the RCC. The RCC also contained followers of the Muslim Brotherhood, and neither HADITU nor the Brotherhood were in control over the revolution.Beinin and Lockman, Workers on the Nile, 1998, p. 419. Toward the end of 1952, HADITU had around 2,000-3,000 members.Beinin and Lockman, Workers on the Nile, 1998, p. 405. Other communist groups expressed fierce criticism of the government for its violent suppression of a strike in Kafr Dawar and the execution of two workers accused of being the leaders of the strike. After the executions of the two labour leaders, HADITU and non- communist trade unionists agitated in the working-class neighbourhoods of Alexandria and Kafr Dawar (in vehicles, with loudspeakers, borrowed from the army), but called on workers to remain calm. The support to the government after the Kafr Dawar crack-down decreased HADITU influence in the labour movement, and internal rifts developed between the party and its trade union cadres. In January 1953 the government closed down the legal press of HADITU. The Communist Student League took part in militant protests against Nasser, but this was rebuked by HADITU. HADITU reversed its policy of not criticizing the government in August 1953, as the government launched a crack-down on communist groups on the advice of the American embassy in Cairo.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, pp. 107, 111. 1953‚Äì55 was a period of disarray in HADITU. The organization was weakened over disputes on how to relate to the regime. The movement had difficulties in handling the rising Pan-Arabist nationalism. One sector favoured supporting the government, due to its pan-Arab orientation in foreign policy.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, p. 113. In September 1954 there was a major crackdown on the organization, and 25 of its cadres were arrested.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990. p. 109. In the same year Joyce Blau, who had functioned as the courier between Curiel's Rome Group and the party in Egypt, was arrested. With her arrest, communication between the party in Egypt and the exiles was cut off. Curiel's role has been considered contentious. In September 1952, the French communist daily L'Humanit√© published an article accusing Curiel of having had contacts with a Trotskyist informer during the Second World War. When HADITU attempted to conduct unity discussions with other communist factions, the issue of Curiel's membership (being tainted by the accusations in L'Humanit√©) became a stumbling block.Beinin, Was the Red Flag Flying There?, 1990, pp. 113‚Äì114. In February 1955 HADITU merged with six other factions, forming the Unified Egyptian Communist Party.

It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown. A sequel, Crackdown 3, was released for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in February 2019. Gameplay Crackdown 2 is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \\"Agency\\", known simply as the \\"Agent\\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if they pre-ordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent's powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. The player is able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game allows for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but now supports up to four players. The game also features competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 does not feature the same option. Microsoft Producer Peter Connelly stated: \\"It would've taken a half-day of work, for something that only a tiny percentage of gamers will ever use.\\" In Crackdown 2, the player fights both the Cell, a terrorist organization, and \\"Freaks,\\" strange infected mutants. Both organizations' members can be killed with melee attacks, explosions, and bullets but there are special UV weapons made for the Freaks, who cannot survive in sunlight. There are five skills to be leveled up: Agility, which the player increases by collecting Agility Orbs and Renegade Agility Orbs, by doing Rooftop Races, or by killing enemies from a highly elevated location; Firearms, which is increased by shooting both handheld and mounted guns; Driving, which is increased by running enemies over, power slides, handbrake turns, completing Road Races, jumping through Stunt Rings and collecting Renegade Driving Orbs; Explosives, which is increased by using explosives, both Launchers and thrown Grenades; and Strength, which is increased by using hand-to-hand attacks, throwing objects, beating people with those objects, or using the moves you unlock as your Strength increases, such as the Charge or Ground Slam. Multiplayer Multiplayer playlists include game modes such as Rocket Tag, Vehicle Tag, Capture the Orb, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. A Co-op game type allows you to party up with up to 4 friends. In co-op, you can obtain special orbs known as \\"Online Orbs\\" or \\"Xbox Live Orbs\\" which give an overall bonus to all your skills. Co-op mode is similar to single player except the campaign missions will only advance for the player that hosts the game. Plot Crackdown 2 takes place 10 years after the events of Crackdown. After \\"saving\\" Pacific City, there was a short time of peace. Then, according to the Agency, a new medical student named Catalina Thorne was accepted into the Agency as a scientist. However she was found to have been performing her own unauthorized experiments and was kicked out. Afterwards, her life was ruined, with her blaming the Agency. Later, she broke into the Agency cloning facility which housed the original agents, and introduced a virus into them which mutated the already genetically modified Agents, who became mindless and enraged, going on a killing spree before dying hours later. She then went on to destroy the research labs, sending the project back to square one and single-handedly destroying the Agent program. Soon after, Catalina unleashed the \\"Freak\\" virus into the populace of Pacific City, turning the infected into mindless mutated monstrosities that kill anything they find. With no agents to combat them, the Agency and the city were left helpless as criminals also began to resurface in the absence of the agents and the weakness of the Agency. While the people were weaker and more desperate than ever, Catalina rallied their support, claiming the Agency has a cure for the virus but is keeping it secret. Desperate for hope, they formed the \\"Cell\\", a terrorist group devoted to destroying the Agency and making them give up the cure. That's when the Agency unveiled Project Sunburst, in which a large bomb of direct sunlight is planted and detonated inside \\"Freak\\" lairs. The light is perfectly harmless to normal people, but the sunlight burns and destroys the Freaks. These bombs are dependent on generators to gather sunlight. Upon hearing of these generators and Project Sunburst, the Cell took over and stole the generators. The Agent must reactivate all of the absorption units, three per beacon for a total of twenty-seven. The Agent must visit each freak lair, summon air support with the beacon, and defend it against the freaks until it detonates. During the final few beacons, Catalina Thorne hacks into the Agent's comm system and pleads with him to cease the beacon re-activations, but eventually is silenced by the Voice of the Agency. After the last beacon is detonated, the Agent must return to the Tower and activate the final beacon: the Tower itself. During the process, ex-agents turned into freaks, which were kept for research, break free and attack the three cores which must be defended by the Agent. After the beacon charges, Catalina herself attacks in a stolen and repainted Agency helicopter, firing at the core. Ordered to stop her, the Agent, though damaged and bruised, leaps from the tower, firing at the helicopter as he falls. Catalina turns the helicopter when it is fired upon, causing the agent to hit the rotor blades rather than the cockpit. He is torn apart, sacrificing himself, succeeds in stopping Thorne. His hand lands in the helicopter as Thorne spins out of control away from the tower. The beacon fires and kills all remaining freaks in Pacific City, with the Voice of the Agency admitting he feels sorry for anyone who tries to stand in the Agency's way now. After the credits, a short video shows Thorne performing research, with the hand of the Agent in a test tube on the table in front of her. Alternate plot The plot, as given above, is not necessarily the true story in the game. Audio Log collectibles found in the game give a different story, which paints the Agency as evil and manipulating, having engaged in a multi-step program to once again give the public a reason to accept unconditional control by their forces and cover up their own involvement in the events of the first game. This alternate story matches the twist at the end of the first Crackdown game. Prior to the events of the game, the Agency, after taking control of Pacific City after the events of Crackdown, invites a group of Pacific City journalists and Agency whistleblowers to a press conference and destroys it, blaming it on terrorists. Thorne, a doctor who actually wants to help the Pacific City populace, attempts to open a clinic to give free medical care to the homeless, but \\"freaks\\" left over from a Pacific City supergang (funded by the Agency, as revealed in Crackdown) invade the clinic and kill almost everyone; the Agency blames this on wild animals. Following this incident, Thorne attempts to lead protests against the Agency and call for an antidote to the freak virus, leading the Agency to blame Thorne for creating the freaks in the first place by infecting the homeless she claimed to treat at her clinic. The Agency then walls off the infected area of Pacific City and secretly creates an antidote, but only uses it on their own agents; as a side effect, the agents lose their superhuman abilities, which the Agency again blames on Thorne. They then send undercover police to instigate violence at Thorne's peaceful protests, turning the public against her entirely. The Sunburst weapon is built to supposedly deal with the freaks, but is actually built as an antipersonnel weapon, meant to kill anyone who might oppose the Agency. Thorne, in an attempt to stop the Agency's plan, leads attacks by the Cell on the Sunburst bombs, giving the Agency a reason to send their Agents back into the field. Development Phil Wilson and Billy Thomson, respectively Producer and Lead Design of Crackdown had previously confirmed that the game was designed from the outset to be a long-running series, stating that sequels for the game are very likely to be produced, especially if Crackdown performed well commercially. However, during the Industry All Stars event in September 2007, Wilson confirmed that Realtime Worlds was not working on a sequel to the game, saying \\"Microsoft [was] a little late in stepping up to the plate to ask for Crackdown 2, and by then we had already started working on bigger, better things.\\" However, then-Microsoft Game Studios corporate vice president, Shane Kim, stated that Microsoft still holds the intellectual property rights for Crackdown and that a Crackdown sequel was still a possibility. Realtime's Studio Manager Colin MacDonald clarified that if they have the resources after completion of APB, they could approach Microsoft to discuss a sequel. Prior to its announcement, industry rumors stated that the new start-up company, Ruffian Games, a Scottish studio formed from members from the Realtime Worlds team, may be involved in the development of a Crackdown sequel. This was confirmed when the game was announced during the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo Conference. The rumors of Ruffian's involvement with the sequel were initially dismissed by McDonald, saying he doubted \\"Microsoft would harm an otherwise fruitful existing development relationship by gambling on funding Crackdown 2 with a startup on RTW's doorstep, for obvious reasons.\\" Following the announcement, David Jones, founder of Realtime Worlds, stated he was \\"a bit miffed\\" with Microsoft's decision, believing that Microsoft may have been looking at an internal development studio instead of the new start-up located in the same geographical area as his company and formed of many of his team's former members. Ruffian's executive producer, Peter Connelly, agreed that the situation that caused Realtime Worlds to move onto APB was unfortunate, but hold no animosity towards the company. Ruffian's Thomson noted that about half of their team formerly worked on Crackdown across all areas of game development, and felt their studio was the best choice to make the game's sequel. The team chose to keep the sequel located in Pacific City as they considered that setting had a character of its own in the first game and wanted to preserve that for the sequel to keep up its familiarity with players, while still making it \\"bigger and better\\". The team also sought to preserve the same free-form gaming experience from Crackdown and opted to avoid any significant dialog-driven cutscenes, while improving on parts of the gameplay from the first game that were seen as weaker aspects. There are no significant mechanical changes to the game, though Ruffian continues to improve on the rendering engine to allow the display of the large vista of Pacific City. Reception Crackdown 2 received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot praised the game's exploration, orb collecting and four-player co-op, while criticizing its similarities to its predecessor. IGN also faulted it for similarities to its predecessor and its absence of a true story, but complimented its orb collecting and cooperative campaign. Giant Bomb said that while the game was enjoyable, too much was lifted from the first game and little new was added. Destructoid gave the game a negative review, criticizing its similarities to the previous game, while also noting new issues not present in the original. The writer said that the game \\"has no real reason to exist.\\" GameTrailers praised the game's addictive Orb collecting, but criticized its lack of story or structure. Official Xbox Magazine UK praised its four-player co-op, combat system, but criticized the layout of Pacific City for being too similar to its predecessor, as well as lack of transforming vehicle, but the author, Ben Talbot, still described the game \\"an addictive experience, and one that offers the best sandbox co-op this side of Saints Row 2\\". Ben Reeves from Game Informer criticised the game for being too similar to the original Crackdown, as well as unfinished texture work, unimpressive score, mindless enemy AI, as well as low replay value. He stated that the game is almost indistinguishable from the first Crackdown. In Japan, where the game was released under the name on 8 July 2010 (the same release date as Australia's), Famitsu gave it a score of 30 out of 40. The Escapist gave the game four stars out of five and said that it \\"offers hours of satisfying, brainless fun for those who enjoy that sort of thing. Newcomers to the series and die-hard fans alike will find plenty to obsess over.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B and said, \\"Dissing Crackdown 2 for its lack of narrative is too easy. A videogame shouldn't articulate everything. Games should be mysterious; something should always be left to the imagination.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave it seven out of ten and said it was \\"immense fun, but this is thanks to the fact that its core gameplay remains largely unchanged from its predecessor. In a way, the game feels more like a slightly more evolved version of the original Crackdown than a true sequel.\\" Metro UK gave it six out of ten and said it was \\"Rushed, repetitive and a huge waste of potential. More expansion pack than sequel - and not even a good one.\\" However, 411Mania gave it a score of five out of ten and said it was \\"quite a fun game, and for gamers who love collecting things this is the way to go. But if you're not into that, or [you] already beat the original, there's nothing new worth seeing here.\\" Wired similarly gave it five stars out of ten and said, \\"An interesting experiment? Sure. But the changes to the game design have all but removed the most-fun parts while emphasizing the game's weaknesses. Whoops.\\" References External links * Category:2010 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Crackdown Category:Dystopian video games Category:Microsoft games Category:Open world video games Category:Parkour video games Category:Third- person shooters Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games using Havok Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Zombie video games Category:Biopunk ","title":"Crackdown 2"},{"id":"21527732","text":"Thomas Walker (died 5 December 1665) was an Oxford academic and administrator.

Until 1984, it was the site of a free ferry. Village Kylesku is located where Loch Glencoul and Loch Gleann Dubh join to form a sea passage Loch a' Ch√†irn Bh√†in which links to Eddrachillis Bay. It is in the Scottish council area of Highland. The village stretches back along the road from the slipway that used to be the southern end of the ferry crossing. Now by-passed by the main road carried over the bridge, the Kylesku Hotel overlooks the slipway. Nearby is Eas a' Chual Aluinn, Britain's highest waterfall. This can be visited on a boat trip aboard Rachael Clare. Kylesku sits at the centre of a area which has become Scotland's first 'Global Geopark'. There is abundant wildlife and a wide range of outdoor pursuits in or on the lochs, mountains and white sandy beaches, including bird watching, seal and otter spotting, fishing, climbing and hill walking. Ferry Queen of Kylesku in 1971 There was a passenger ferry (a rowing boat) in the early 19th century. Commercial traffic mainly comprised cattle on their way to central Scotland, and they had to swim across. Over the years, various ferries came and went, and small car- carrying ferries first appeared between the wars. The Kylesku Ferry was unusual in being free for much of its life. The Maid of Kylesku, a two car ferry, was built for the Kylesku crossing in the early 1950s, where it was operated until replaced by the Queen of Kylesku in 1967. When no longer needed, the Maid of Kylesku was beached on the opposite side of the bay. In 1976, the , built in Ardrossan, became the first vessel capable of carrying fully loaded commercial vehicles. After the opening of the Kylesku Bridge, it was used as the Corran Ferry. The new bridge carries the A894 road across the Kyles from Kylesku to Kylestrome Waiting for the Kylesku Ferry Bridge The ferry service became known as a dreaded bottleneck on the route and was replaced by the Kylesku Bridge in 1984. Opened by the Queen, the bridge is long and crosses a stretch of water. The curving, five-span, continuous, pre- stressed concrete, hollow bridge has been described as one of the most beautiful bridges in the world. The bridge was built by Morrison Construction Group and designed by the architects Arup (intended to complement the natural beauty of the site), and it has won several design and construction awards. A cairn on the north side, erected in 1993, commemorates the 50th anniversary of the formation of the XIIth Submarine Flotilla, a unit of \\"X-craft\\" and \\"Chariot\\" miniature submarines, which trained in Lochs Glendhu and Glencoul from 1943.

Eyewitnesses feared passengers were trapped in two of the derailed carriages. Medical and rescue teams from the Bhubaneswar headquarters of East Coast Railway converged on the scene of the accident and erected emergency lighting to speed up the rescue effort, which had been hampered by the dark. Local people assisted the emergency services in their rescue effort, with one local describing the accident as \\"horrible and serious\\". Union Minister of State for Railways R. Velu reached the spot on Saturday morning to take stock of the situation. A high-level inquiry had been ordered to ascertain the cause of the accident, he said. Twelve of the 24 coaches of the superfast train derailed approximately from the state's capital, Bhubaneswar. Some coaches of the train were lying over each other and many people were trapped under the mangled train cars. The injured were sent to local hospitals.  Reaction  The Minister said the Railways would pay Rs.500,000 each to the next of kin of those killed in the accident and a job each to the family of those killed.

Involved in Umkhonto we Sizwe, Tshwete was imprisoned by the apartheid authorities on Robben Island from February 1964 to 1978. Tshwete resumed activities with the ANC and become a regional coordinator for the new United Democratic Front. He later lived in exile in Zambia with the ANC. After the first free elections in South Africa in 1994, he became the new government's first Sports Minister and later was Minister of Safety and Security.  Early life  Tshwete was born in Springs, East Rand, on 12 November 1938 to Xhosa parents. He was the eldest of four siblings. While still a baby his parents moved to Peelton (Nkonkqweni), a black township near King William‚Äôs Town, Eastern Cape. He was taught to read by his mother before starting primary school. His political interests were awakened reading the Xhosa newspaper Imvo Zabantsundu in his youth. He attended Forbes Grant Secondary School in King William's Town and was introduced to the ANC through its publications given out by the principal, Mr. H. Mjamba, and at Welsh High in East London he joined the ANC's African Students' Association. When he left school he continued his work with the ANC.  Political background  As a member of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) Border regional command, he was arrested in June 1963 and sentenced in February 1964 to fifteen years in jail for belonging to a banned organization. He spent his prison time on Robben Island and completed a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in English and Philosophy from University of South Africa (UNISA). On Robben Island, with his interest in rugby, he organised the prisoners into rugby teams and created a league. He was released in March 1978 and returned to his homeland and became a teacher. By 1983, he became politically active again and joined the United Democratic Front (UDF) becoming the president of the Eastern Cape region. He was arrested that year by the Ciskein police and held for four months and then constantly harassed until he left South Africa for the ANC in exile. He was first in Maseru, Lesotho, and by 1985 he was in Lusaka, Zambia, resuming his military training with MK. He became a political commissar in MK in August 1987 and authorized the ANC military units in South Africa to attack white civilians by means of a bombing campaign of restaurants and nightclubs in Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Durban. The ANC National Executive Committee distanced themselves from the attacks in August 1988 after the attacks had been condemned by anti-apartheid leaders and church groups usually sympathetic to the ANC cause. Tshwete was transferred from his position as a political commissar in MK and he obtained an appointment in the National Executive. During the 1987, Tshwete was involved in the talks, in Dakar, Senegal and Paris, France when white businessmen, Afrikaner intellectuals and leading South African opposition members met the ANC for discussions. He returned to South Africa after the ANC was unbanned in 1990 as a member of their National Executive and negotiating team. After the ANC won the first free election in 1994, Nelson Mandela appointed him as his Minister of Sports, a position he held from 1994 until 1999. He was tasked with overseeing South Africa's re- entry into international sport, establish development programs for underprivileged blacks sportsmen and women in all sports including rugby and cricket, and de-racializing the national sport teams. As the head of the ANC's Sports Desk he had the task of uniting sports that had been riven by apartheid. He had the knack of \\"bringing sworn enemies to the negotiating table and sending them away as allies ... he went from one sporting code to the next and fixed the potholes on their roads to unity\\". Having united South Africa's cricket bodies he travelled with Ali Bacher to London in May 1991 and successfully applied for South Africa's admission to the International Cricket Council. He started the first Governor's Cup Yacht Race from Cape Town to Saint Helena in 1996.Governor's Cup at Saint Helena Island Info On the retirement of Nelson Mandela, he served in Thabo Mbeki's first government as the Minister of Safety and Security from 1999 until his death in April 2002. He was tasked with restoring the morale of an undermanned, underpaid police force beset with a political history of maintaining apartheid, riddled with corruption and a huge escalation of violent crime in the country. On 24 April 2001, Tshwete, in his capacity of Minister of Safety and Security, announced, on national television, an investigation into an alleged plot to oust the country's president, Thabo Mbeki, by three high-ranking members of the ANC. They were identified as Cyril Ramaphosa, Tokyo Sexwale and Mathews Phosa. The opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, described the investigation as an abuse of government powers and a method to neutralize opponents as Mbeki sought a second term as president. The three men were cleared in December 2001 when Tshwete announced the results of the investigation and apologised to the men and their families.  Honours  Steve Tshwete Local Municipality in Mpumalanga Province is named after him.Steve Vukhile Tshwete biography at ANC.org.za  Death  It is said he had developed back pain back in March 2002 and was confined to a wheelchair.

The organization was founded in 2001 by a small group of recent graduates of Queen's University who recruited other recent graduates. They organized an engagement forum that took place in May 2001 in Muskoka to discuss human capital flight (or 'brain drain'). The results of the forum and other research and consultation formed the basis of Canada25's first report A New Magnetic North: How Canada can Attract and Retain Talent (2001). The report concluded that to retain talented young Canadians, and attract global talent, the Canadian business, research and non-profit sectors, as well Canadian governments, must deliver on \\"a culture of innovation that begets challenging opportunities, celebrates success, and empowers individuals to fully utilize their skills and ideas\\" while at the same time creating \\"strong social orientation and a healthy cultural and physical environment\\" and ended with a series of recommendations. The principal author of Canada25's second report was Naheed Nenshi, who would later become the mayor of Calgary. The report, titled Building Up: Making Canada's Cities Magnets for Talent and Engines of Development (2002), was the result of the group's national forum held near Victoria, BC, and their 11 regional roundtable meetings, all held in 2002. The topic built upon their first report's theme of attracting and retaining talent and applied it more narrowly to how that affects cities and . The report concludes that a young talented professionals tend to be attracted to cities that offer (1) high density, mixed-use cores, (2) social-cultural diversity and (3) discovery in terms of urban space and innovation. The group's third report was titled From Middle to Model Power: Recharging Canada's Role in the World (2004). Based on another set of consultations, research and round table discussions, the report's principal author David Eaves concludes that the traditional role of embassies is outdated and should be more like a cultural establishment or community centres for expatriates. The report also identifies Canadian military deployment strategy as erratic and calls for the federal government to establish transparent and predictable intervention criteria, as well as directing the military to establish a specialized expertise in postwar reconstruction. Canada25's fourth, and what would be their final, published national policy report was Canadians and the Common Good: Building a Civic Nation Through Civic Engagement (2007). With Robin Rix as the principal author, the report was based on research and consultation done for the groups' 2006 national forum, held in Calgary, and 13 roundtable meetings of members, held in various location across North America. The report concluded with 20 policy recommendations around getting young people involved in civic life. Among the recommendations are events that celebrate the coming-of-age of youths (at the legal age of 18), increasing use of the Internet for elections, tax reform regarding contributions to non- profit organization, and revitalize public spaces and civic facilities. Canada25 also completed dozens of regional projects on issues from healthcare to Kyoto to urban development including: Investing in the Next Alberta (2005); Cooling the Hot Air: Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol (2002); Batir pour l'avenir: A Montreal Renaissance (2002); Ripe With Potential: Vancouver as a Destination For Talent (2002) and Views From Young Talent in Winnipeg (2002). In 2007, after six years of operations, Canada25 closed its doors due to a lack of a stable funding source.

Eisenhower. Biography  Early life  General Snyder was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was the son Albert Snyder and Priscilla McCrum. His father died when he was ten years old. He attended the University of Colorado from 1899-1901. Snyder then attended Jefferson Medical College and received his M.D. in 1905. He completed his medical internship at Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia. He became a contract surgeon at Fort Douglas, Utah. His experience with military service was so favorable that he decided upon a military-medical career. He graduated from the U.S. Army Medical School in Washington, D.C. in June 1908 with high honors and was simultaneously commissioned a first lieutenant in the United States Army Medical Corps. In 1909, Snyder‚Äôs first military assignment took him to the Philippines where he served with the Research Board of Tropical Medicine. While in the Philippines he met he met Alice Elizabeth Concklin. They married July 12, 1910. Career In 1911 he returned to the United States and, in the next twenty-five years, his varied command and instructional assignments took him to numerous posts in the United States and one in Puerto Rico. From 1936 to 1940 Snyder was medical adviser to the National Guard Bureau in Washington, D.C.\\"Biography of Howard Snyder\\" From December 1940 until June 1945 Snyder was assistant to the inspector general of the War Department, a job which required him to travel to all theaters of operations during World War II. Toward the end of the war Snyder became closely acquainted with Dwight D. Eisenhower and, although technically retired because of his age in March 1945, remained on active duty in Europe as General Eisenhower‚Äôs personal physician until after the surrender of Germany. Snyder continued his association with the Eisenhower family after the war, treating Mamie Eisenhower for pneumonia in November 1945 and, after retiring from military service, remaining close to Dwight D. Eisenhower while he was president of Columbia University. Snyder became senior adviser to the Conservation of Human Resources Project and Manpower Council, a project instituted by Eisenhower in 1950 to find ways of correcting the manpower wastage identified during World War II. In January 1951 Snyder was again called to active duty and was assigned to Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) where he soon became a special adviser to General Eisenhower. After being retired from military service once again, Snyder rode Eisenhower's campaign train in September 1952 during Eisenhower's successful bid for the presidency.  Physician to the President  After Eisenhower‚Äôs inauguration as President in January 1953, Snyder was appointed to the White House staff as the Physician to the President, and remained Eisenhower's personal physician throughout the administration. Snyder‚Äôs duties in the White House involved providing close personal attention to the medical needs of Eisenhower and his family, as well as the White House staff. This personal attention included accompanying the president on overseas trips and those within the United States, vacations, and golf outings. He administered medications, took temperatures, gave the president daily medical advice and recorded observations on the president‚Äôs activities, disposition, and physical condition.

English translation (Google) (1831 ‚Äì 5 December 1900) was a French official from Alsace, best known for being arrested by Germans in the April 1887 Schnaebele incident (or Affair) which nearly led to war between France and Germany.Unless otherwise noted, the content of this article is verbatim from: Edits for modernization, clarity and content corrections have been made. Who caused the incident and why remains speculative, but it has been suggested German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was its instigator, for a number of possible motivations ‚Äì baiting France into starting a war; or, gauging the extent of French support for Boulangism; or creating a strained situation with France to force the renewal of a Russian-German alliance of neutrality that was under debate at the Russian court. Others see it as simply a series of unintended consequences, notable for the role played by France's General Georges Ernest Boulanger. This and a number of other incidents involving General Boulanger are elements of what is known as the Boulanger Affair, a series of embarrassments for the newly formed government of the French Third Republic that some consider to have nearly led to a coup d'√©tat. Biography Guillaume Schnaebel√© or Wilhelm Schn√§bele was an Alsatian born in 1831 in Eckbolsheim, near Strasbourg. After the Franco-Prussian War and Germany's subsequent annexation of Alsace in 1871, he emigrated to France, probably altering the spelling of his name accordingly. He had served in the war and was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honor. After the incident of 1887 he was moved to a post at Laon. He died on 5 December 1900 in Nancy, France. Schnaebele Affair Illustration: Schnaebel√© being grabbed at the border by two German secret policemen in disguise.

Illustration: After the incident, French customs officials looking across the border (to the left), marked by the square-topped pole on the left. On 21 April 1887 the French Havas news agency published a dispatch to the effect that Schnaebel√©, a mid-level and obscure French police inspector, had been arrested by two agents of the German secret police on the Franco-German frontier near Pagny-sur-Moselle as he was on his way to Ars an der Mosel (now Ars-sur-Moselle) for a meeting with the German police inspector there, at the latter's request. A dispute followed as to whether the arrest had taken place on French or German territory (see \\"Account of incident\\" below); but regardless, the French claimed that under the circumstances Schnaebel√© was entitled to immunity even if on German territory since he had been invited to a conference by German officials. The reason given by the German authorities for the arrest was that in a previous inquiry into charges of treasonable practices against a number of Alsatians, evidence had been produced that Schnaebel√© had been involved in transmitting to Paris information as to German fortresses, furnished by Alsatians in the pay of the French Government, and that an order had been issued to arrest him if ever he should be found on German soil. In other words, the Germans believed Schnaebel√© to be a spy. Within a week of his arrest, on 28 April, Schnaebel√© was released by order of the German Emperor, William I. In a dispatch of the same date to the French ambassador at Berlin, Bismarck explained that, although the German Government considered, in view of the proofs of guilt, the arrest to be fully justified, it was deemed expedient to release Schnaebel√© on the ground that business meetings between frontier officials \\"must always be regarded as protected by a mutually-assured safe conduct.\\"The full letter from Bismarck is translated and published in: Thus ended the Schnaebel√© incident. The week-long incident, between 21 and 28 April, generated such threatening and provocative language from both sides as to cause serious concern of war. A large section of the German press demanded that Germany make no concession. In France, the Cabinet voted 6 to 5 against an ultimatum demanding the release of Schnaebel√© with an apology, which would almost certainly have meant war, as had happened with the Ems Dispatch in 1870. The proposed ultimatum had been put forward by French war hawk and Minister of War Georges Ernest Boulanger, who also brought in a bill to mobilise an army corps. After Schnaebel√©'s release and Bismarck's letter, many in the French public thought Bismarck backed down, because he was afraid of Boulanger which increased Boulanger's rising star as a national hero and bolstered his image as a \\"Revenger\\" for France against Germany. However, it was, in truth, an embarrassment to the Republican government, who knew the French army was no better off than in 1870, when Germany quickly defeated it in the Franco Prussian War. Boulanger's antagonism against Germany during the week long crisis was indeed a danger to the Republic. For this and other reasons, on 7 July 1887 Boulanger was released as Minister of War and dispatched by the government to a provincial post to be hopefully forgotten, but not before admiring throngs tried to stop his train from leaving Paris: loyal to his military orders, he was smuggled out in a switched engine. Cause The reasons for the arrest and release of Schnaebel√© have never been entirely explained, but there are theories, both contemporary and modern. Contemporary theorists include Elie de Cyon, who asserted that Bismarck brought about the incident intentionally (for reasons explained below); that Czar Alexander III, made apprehensive for the peace of Europe, wrote an autographic letter to William I in regard to the matter, and that the Kaiser, going over the head of his chancellor Bismarck, ordered the release of Schnaebel√©. Several French politicians at the time suspected the incident of being a calculated experiment by Bismarck to gauge the depth of the anti-German feeling in France, a means of testing, by an incident, which could be closed at any time by a mere apology, without any shock to German national dignity, whether Boulanger had a sufficient following in public opinion to make Boulangism a real danger to peace. In Germany, the incident occurred during a time when Bismarck was trying to force a new and very expensive military law through the Reichstag,The Septennate army law, or seven years credit for military expenses. and it has occasionally been speculated that it was necessary to inflame the menace of war to justify these new taxes. However, the Army Bill was passed on 11 March, three weeks before Schnaebel√© crossed the border. Bismarck might have been trying to agitate conflict with France before Germany's treaty of neutrality with Russia expired that year (signed in 1881 and renewed in 1884) ‚Äì Germany knew from experience that it could not afford a war with France without a neutral or allied Russia. Russia would only remain neutral if the responsibility for war was cast on the French, as happened in 1870. When the French government stood its ground and presented an irrefutable case, failing to throw the responsibility on the French, Bismarck knew, from previous experience, that he could not count on Russia's neutrality if conflict came, and he had to back down: Schnaebel√© was therefore set free. Related to the Russians, Bismarck may have wanted to create a strained situation with France, to counteract the Panslavist party in Russia, who, at the time, were lobbying the cabinet of the Russian Emperor not to renew the Russian-German alliance. Modern (1989) research suggests a simpler explanation. Schnaebel√© was, in fact, engaged in espionage, working under the express request of Boulanger. However, Schnaebel√© had been invited onto German territory by his German counterpart, which was a guarantee of safe-conduct, and thus his arrest, whilst on German territory, was legally irregular, which is why Bismarck agreed to his release. Bismarck had backed down, exclusively, because of the circumstances surrounding the arrest. Account According to one account, the incident occurred as follows: It was a cool day and Schnaebel√© was wearing a coat and top hat. He walked briskly on the road leading from Nancy (France) to Metz (then in Lothringen, German Empire). The road is deserted. To his left are two French brothers working in a vineyard. To his right are a number of German railroad workers out of sight, but within earshot. Gautsch, his German colleague of Ars an der Mosel who he is supposed to meet, is not in sight. Schnaebel√© wonders if Gautsch has reneged on the meeting. Schnaebel√© is waiting impatiently, a few steps from the German side. Suddenly, a man in a gray blouse appears from the German side, hails Schnaebel√©, then rushes at him, trying to lead him into Germany. Schnaebel√© successfully resists but then a second man in a gray blouse appears. Returning a few steps into French territory, Schnaebel√© exclaims (in German): \\"What do you want from me? I'm Guillaume Schnaebele Commissioner Special Pagny. I am here at home! This is the border.\\" His two attackers do not listen and continue to grapple him across the border. The two French farmers do not intervene, but the six German rail workers on hearing the cries for help come into view. But what they see deters action: the two assailants remove their blouses and are shown to be wearing uniforms of the German police. Everything is then perfectly clear. They handcuff Schnaebel√© by the wrist and lead him on foot to the village of Nov√©ant and then by train to Metz. There he is thrown into prison and held incommunicado. Legacy In 2005, as part of the arrival of the TGV to Pagny-sur-Moselle, a bridge was named for Schnaebel√©.
