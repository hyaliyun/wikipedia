The nearest town is Lalamusa about seven kilometers to the Northeast. The village has a population of almost ten thousand and holds two seats in the local area government union council. Residents are mostly farmers but some are fortunate enough to find manual labor jobs in Middle East allowing them to send back money to their families. A few residents of the area have moved to cities for better education of their children and for the good of their family. History Most popular traditions hold that the first native of the village was a person named as Sarang Khan who settled in the area in the sixteenth century during the famous Band-O-Bast by Mughal Emperor Akbar. And from that time now village's population has been increasing at a very slow pace. Even creation of Pakistan made no difference and there was no demographic change at all because all of inhabitants were followers of Islam. But after Afghan war there were Afghan immigrants who chose to stay here and few of them are still living with their families in neighborhoods. Basic amenities Electricity and telephone service are now provided to this remote village after long effort by village residents. Broadband facility is also available to residents. People with no land-line access in remote places can avail high speed internet through PTCL's wireless 3G service \\"EVO\\". Nearest health center is Rural Health Centre about 3 miles away. Currently there are rumors about the establishment of a Local Hospital. Education Kotla has middle schools for boys and girls. The nearest high school is in Lalamusa. Criticism against education World is abundant with critics so is Kotla Sarang Khan but one thing that makes this village's critics different is that they criticize modern education and like to speak against it whenever and wherever given a chance, any body can avail this opportunity repeatedly to get an estimate of his tolerance and control over emotions and to know how much guts he has got to take part in a debate than can last for hours and even days. What makes it interesting is that these critics like to use privileges of modern society like electricity, telephony and all industrial products but will not step back unless the person who supports education either accepts defeat or cuts his own throat. They have one motto, to live in stone age with all modern facilities in a backpack. Politics Like anywhere else in rural areas of Pakistan people here in this village also follow caste system while using their right to choose their representatives. Lack of political development in Pakistan and repeated invasion by dictators has left impact on residents of this village too and this can be viewed by knowing political views of residents and conspiracy theories that they follow. Lack of any political development has strengthen old traditional caste system over the decades. This can be understood by following example, Every time when elections are held people cast their vote against short term benefits or to person recommended by their elders but later they either curse politicians or pray for military invasion and praise previous government for the rest of the term until next elections are held. But recent developments in communication and telecoms sector is gradually raising political activism and awareness among local residents.

Raed (i.e. overgrown with secondary forest). Location The Brooketon Colliery is located in Serasa. It is located to the north of the roundabout where Jalan Muara meets the Muara Tutong Highway about one and a half miles away from Muara Town centre. History Coal was first reported in Brunei Darussalam near Muara as early as 1837. from The Geology and Hydrocarbon Resources of Negara Brunei Darussalam retrieved 07-06-12 in Serai Pimping. The Muara coalmine was first mined commercially in 1883, when William Cowie was given the concession rights to mine the coal in exchange for $1,200 per year.Before the Oil, it was Coal Brunei Times 14-04-2007 However, Cowie later sold his rights to Rajah Charles Brooke and the Rajah renamed the mine Brooketon (Brooke Town). Between 1889 and 1924, it was operated by the Sarawak government of Rajah Charles Brooke. Annual exports of coal varied between 10,000 and 25,000 tons annually and in those 33 years of operation, more than 650,000 tons were exported. At first it was opencast until it became harder and underground mining was introduced. Brooketon Colliery was strategic as it was very near to Muara where then and now there is a safe deep-water anchorage to which the mine was connected via rail. During the time the mine was in operation, there was a wooden rail line that connected Brooketon which is about one and a half mile away from Muara. The rail line is no longer in place. Politically too, even though he only had economic rights, Brooke became the de facto ruler of the area. The mine employed hundreds of miners and that required him to introduce a police force, post office and roads transforming Muara into an extraterritorial settlement an extension of Sarawak. It was not until 1921 that Muara was \\"returned\\" to Brunei. It closed down in 1924 because of heavy financial losses caused by continuously decreasing coal prices in the world economic recession. Current Issues All that remains of the mine today is an overgrown railway, locomotives, mine entrances and an abandoned Morris Minor.Revisiting Brunei‚Äôs Historical Brooketon Colliery at Muara. The Museums Department of Brunei wanted to turn the historical 62 hectares coal mine as an open site museum to promote the country's eco-tourism.

It rejects the Copernican principle and supports the long- superseded notion that Earth is at the center of the Universe. The film is narrated by Kate Mulgrew and features scientists such as Lawrence M. Krauss and Michio Kaku. Mulgrew and scientists who were interviewed in the film have repudiated the ideas advocated in the film and stated that their involvement was the result of being misled by the filmmaker. Release The film was released on October 24, 2014, when screened at the Marcus Addison Cinema in Addison, Illinois, according to the distributor Rocky Mountain Pictures. Box office receipts were $86,172. Complaints from featured actors and scientists Physicist Lawrence Krauss was one of those interviewed in the film. He would later say that he was misled into being part of the controversial documentary. The film was criticized by some of the interviewed physicists, who say they were misled into appearing in the film, claiming that the documentary makes an invalid philosophical assumption that defining physical relationships among objects in space, one way or another, necessarily must limit what one can say about the relationship between God and humanity in theology, and treats science as a belief system dealing with the same matters as religion. The movie rejects the scientific consensus that the Earth and other planets orbit their stars, and distorts other elements of the actual Copernican principle. Following the release of the film's trailer, narrator Kate Mulgrew said that she was misinformed about the purpose of the documentary. Max Tegmark explained that DeLano \\"cleverly tricked a whole bunch of us scientists into thinking that they were independent filmmakers doing an ordinary cosmology documentary, without mentioning anything about their hidden agenda.\\" George Ellis corroborated. \\"I was interviewed for it but they did not disclose this agenda, which of course is nonsense. I don't think it's worth responding to -- it just gives them publicity. To ignore is the best policy. But for the record, I totally disavow that silly agenda.\\" Michio Kaku said that the film was probably using \\"clever editing\\" of his statements and bordered on \\"intellectual dishonesty\\", and Lawrence Krauss said he had no recollection of being interviewed for the film and would have refused to be in it if he had known more about it. British physicist Julian Barbour said that he never gave permission to be in the film.

Balfour was the eldest son of Sir James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich, President of the Court of Session, and his wife Margaret (n√©e Balfour). James Balfour, 1st Baron Balfour of Glenawley, was his younger brother. His residence was Burleigh Castle near Kinross. He was knighted at the opening of Parliament in 1592.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 683. Rebel In the early 1590s Balfour supported and intrigued with the rebel Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, along with other landowners including John Wemyss of Logie and Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie. In October 1592 he crossed the border into England and played cards and football with Bothwell at Netherby Hall.Joseph Bain, Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (London, 1894), p. 415. He was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle in November 1592 and faced banishment.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 751, 818: Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 207. Arms and armour An Act of Parliament in 1600 made Michael Balfour wealthy, directing landowners and people of standing to buy armour from him, for defence musters. Several men complained that Balfour tried to make them buy more armour than their rank and income demanded, or like James Blackadder of Tulliallan, already owned sufficient armour.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 180-2. In 1598 James VI had allowed Balfour to import arms from abroad, and historians regard this as a move to prepare for war in the event of death Queen Elizabeth, to ensure the succession of James to the throne of England, and 1602 Balfour was sent to buy weapons in the Dutch Republic for 2,000 troops to fight pretenders to his throne.Susan Doran, 'James VI and the English Succession', Ralph Anthony Houlbrooke, James VI and I: Ideas, Authority, and Government (Ashgate, 2006), pp. 32-3: John Duncan Mackie, Negotiations between King James VI and Fredinand I Grand Duke of Tuscany (Oxford, 1927), pp. viii-xiv. Balfour became a member of the Scottish Privy Council. He served as Scottish Ambassador to the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Duke of Lorraine in 1606. In 1607 he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in the County of Kinross. He died in March 1619. Marriage and children Michael Balfour married Margaret Lundin, daughter of William Lundin of that Ilk, in 1591. She died in 1625. He was succeeded in the lordship by his daughter Margaret. Margaret Balfour married Robert Arnot, a son of Robert Arnot of Fernie, and he adopted the name, Robert Balfour, 2nd Lord Balfour of Burleigh.

JONAH described itself as \\"dedicated to educating the world-wide Jewish community about the social, cultural and emotional factors which lead to same-sex attractions\\". JONAH's leaders disagree with the consensus of mainstream science and the world's major mental health organizations who say that non-heterosexual sexual orientation is not a disorder. In 2015, a landmark trial found that JONAH's claims to be able to change sexual orientation constituted consumer fraud. The organization was ordered to pay restitution to the plaintiffs and shut down within thirty days. Eleven days after the verdict, the founders created a conversion therapy organization called JIFGA using JONAH's assets. In June 2019, a New Jersey judge ordered JIFGA to shut down within thirty days and pay $3.5 million to victims. History JONAH was created in 1999 in Jersey City, New Jersey by two married couples, Theodore and Elaine Berk and Arthur and Jane Goldberg. They created the organization after finding out their sons were gay. Arthur Goldberg is a former secretary-treasurer of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality. During the 2014 trial against JONAH, it was revealed that Goldberg's license as a board certified professional counselor was revoked in 2011 because the American Psychotherapy Association learned that Goldberg had lied on his application by failing to disclose his felony conviction as a Wall Street municipal bonds manager. In 2000, JONAH provided literature and outreach to gay and bisexual Jews, and their families of all denominations, in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, advertising their supposed methods of reducing and eliminating homosexuality. JONAH eventually became a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. Since then it expanded to include members in the United States, Israel, Canada, and various European nations. =Trial= On 25 June 2015, in the first-ever trial of conversion therapy in the United States, a New Jersey jury found JONAH guilty of consumer fraud for promising to be able to change its clients' sexual urges and determined its commercial practices to be unconscionable. In a seminal pretrial ruling on 5 February 2015, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Peter Bariso excluded expert testimony from several leading conversion therapy proponents, Joseph Nicolosi and Christopher Doyle, ruling that their opinions were based on the false premise that homosexuality is a disorder. Bariso wrote that \\"the theory that homosexuality is a disorder is not novel but ‚Äì like the notion that the earth is flat and the sun revolves around it ‚Äì instead is outdated and refuted\\". On 18 December 2015, Judge Bariso granted a permanent injunction after an agreement by both parties that required JONAH to shut down entirely and prohibited founder Arthur Goldberg and counselor Alan Downing from engaging in any form of conversion therapy in New Jersey. The jury in the case found unanimously on 25 June that by offering services claiming could turn gay people straight, JONAH committed consumer fraud and engaged in unconscionable commercial practices. Under the agreed to injunction and settlement, the defendants will pay the full in damages awarded by the jury to compensate the plaintiffs for the fees they paid to JONAH and for remedial mental health counseling for one plaintiff. The proposed judgment includes a $3.5 million award of legal fees. The plaintiffs agreed to accept an undisclosed portion of that award, but the defendants will be liable for the full amount if they violate the agreement. JONAH is required to shut down all of its operations within 30 days after the order is entered, and its websites and online listservs must be removed. JONAH also will have to liquidate its assets and permanently dissolve as a corporate entity within six months. As part of the settlement, JONAH will not appeal the jury verdict. =Aftermath= Eleven days after the verdict, JONAH was reincorporated as JIFGA, \\"Jewish Institute for Global Awareness\\", keeping JONAH's assets, leadership and operations, as well as the same address and phone number. The Southern Poverty Law Center says that this is an attempt to evade the shutdown order and has appealed to the courts to enforce the previous ruling against JIFGA. In June 2019, a New Jersey judge, Peter F. Bariso Jr., found that JIFGA was an illegitimate attempt to continue JONAH in violation of the court order. He ordered JIFGA to shut down within thirty days and pay 3.5 million fine to victims of the scam. Arthur Goldberg and Elaine Berk are forbidden to serve in executive leadership or on the board of any nonprofit. Methodology JONAH emphasized the Talmudic understanding of homosexuality as \\"being led astray\\" (Nedarim 51a), and therefore of being able \\"to return\\", consistent with the Jewish principle of repentance (teshuvah). According to JONAH, same-sex attractions may be mitigated and potentially eliminated. JONAH employed the techniques of Richard Cohen, an unlicensed counsellor who promotes conversion therapy. Techniques for overcoming homosexual urges included undressing in front of other men, pummeling an effigy of one's mother, and re-enacting traumatic childhood experiences. Controversy In July 2010, a video published by the organization Truth Wins Out features two former participants of JONAH, Ben Unger and Chaim Levin, alleging that Alan Downing, a JONAH counselor, demanded that his participants strip off all of their clothing in front of a mirror and touch their genitals in his presence. Downing released a statement in response denying the charges. After emails were sent to the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists linking to the video, the organization initially rescinded a previous invitation to JONAH's founder Arthur Goldberg to speak at their annual convention, but later allowed him to speak. Yael Respler of The Jewish Press printed a letter by Goldberg about the incident and noted in response that she herself had engaged in reparative therapy (also called conversion therapy). On 29 November 2012, the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America issued a statement clarifying that it did not endorse JONAH'S methods, stating they came to this decision \\"based on consultation with a wide range of mental health experts and therapists who informed us of the lack of scientifically rigorous studies that support the effectiveness of therapies to change sexual orientation, a review of literature written by experts and major medical and mental health organizations, and based upon reports of the negative and, at times, deleterious consequences to clients of some of the interventions endorsed by JONAH\\". =Lawsuit= In November 2012, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed the lawsuit Ferguson v JONAH against JONAH, Goldberg, and Downing on behalf of Michael Ferguson, Ben Unger, Chaim Levin, and two of the participants' mothers for fraudulent practices which are illegal under New Jersey's consumer protection laws. The Southern Poverty Law Center has noted that the lawsuit is \\"groundbreaking\\" insofar as it is \\"the first time a conversion therapy provider has been sued for fraudulent business practices\\". In 2014 Superior Court Judge Peter Bariso ruled that JONAH and its co-defendants could have to pay three times the cost paid by the participants for therapy they said they needed because of JONAH's conversion therapy. Testimony at the trial revealed the JONAH program's bizarre and abusive techniques, which included instructing men to undress and instructing one plaintiff to touch his genitals in a private counseling session. JONAH orchestrated violent role-play exercises, encouraging clients to beat effigies of their mothers, who were sometimes blamed for their sons' homosexuality. Male counselors advocated \\"healthy touch\\" sessions that included prolonged cuddling. JONAH's tactics alienated some clients from their families and caused them to blame themselves or family members for their sexual orientation. In February 2015, Hudson County, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Peter Bariso said that JONAH's claims of gay conversion therapy that describe homosexuality as a curable mental disorder were illegal based on the state's Consumer Fraud Act. Judge Bariso also said it's fraudulent to offer \\"success statistics\\" because \\"there is no factual basis for calculating such statistics\\". The judge also excluded expert testimony from leading conversion therapy proponents, Joseph Nicolosi and Christopher Doyle, ruling that their opinions were based on the false premise that homosexuality is a disorder. Bariso wrote that \\"the theory that homosexuality is a disorder is not novel but ‚Äì like the notion that the earth is flat and the sun revolves around it ‚Äì instead is outdated and refuted\\". In response to Judge Bariso's ruling, David Dinielli, deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said, \\"This is the principal lie the conversion therapy industry uses throughout the country to peddle its quackery to vulnerable clients. Gay people don't need to be cured, and we are thrilled that the court has recognized this\\". =Ruling= On 25 June 2015 a jury of seven voted unanimously to convict JONAH under the Consumer Fraud Act of New Jersey. The jury also found that JONAH's practices were unconscionable business practices. The verdict required JONAH and Downing to refund thousands of dollars paid by former clients. On 18 December 2015, Judge Bariso granted a permanent injunction after an agreement by both parties that required JONAH to shut down entirely and prohibited founder Arthur Goldberg and counselor Alan Downing from engaging in any form of conversion therapy in New Jersey. The jury in the case found unanimously on 25 June that by offering services claiming could turn gay people straight, JONAH committed consumer fraud and engaged in unconscionable commercial practices.

A front-rower, he represented Queensland in the State of Origin on nine occasions and played one Test for Australia as a reserve forward against France in mid-1994. Hohn played club football in Australia for the Fortitude Valley Diehards, Brisbane Broncos and South Queensland Crushers, and in England for Wigan and Hunslet. Biography While attending Pittsworth State High School, Hohn played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1981. He started his career with the Pittsworth Danes before moving to the Brisbane Rugby League premiership to play with the Fortitude Valley Diehards. Hohn also spent a season with Wigan (1986‚Äì87). He joined the Brisbane Broncos upon their foundation in 1988, playing in their first ever match and going on to feature in the club's first and second premiership wins in 1992 and 1993. In the weeks following the 1992 Grand Final, Hohn travelled with the Broncos to England, where he played at second- row forward in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first NSWRL club to win the match in Britain. After playing in the Broncos' grand final winning team again in 1993, Hohn also made his Queensland and Australian representative debuts in 1994, becoming the oldest Australian forward (at the age of 30) to make his Test d√©but in the process. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Hohn played at second-row forward for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge. During the mid-1990s' Super League war Hohn left the Broncos to join cross-town ARL rivals, the South Queensland Crushers where he played out the remainder of his career.

In addition, there are some unique features in the game. Each of the four characters brings along a pet, which can be sent to attack enemies or used as a shield. There are three buttons: Shoot, jump, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges the player's pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds. The shield button converts the pet into a shield that is permanent - until players press the button again or it takes enough damage to disappear. Melee attacks and pet attacks release hearts which boost their shield power. Characters include Jake and Sara, two regular humans from Earth. Dr. J, a scientist, and Maya an ape.

Background Crosby is of ancestry, originating from the Maxxtakxaata (Metlakatla, Alaska), and Gisbutwaada (Killer Whale clan), and House of Gitlan.http://www.grunt.ca/indianacts/crosby.swf Born and raised in her maternal grandmother's territory, Marcia grew up on what is now Prince Rupert. She has a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts and English (1990), a Master of Arts, \\"Indian Art/Aboriginal Title\\" in Cultural History (1993), and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Art History, all from the University of British Columbia. Her MA thesis focused on the tension between representations of Aboriginal cultures and peoples in the public sphere, the work of Indigenous art and artists, and representations of Aboriginal title in British Columbia. Crosby's PhD dissertation is on, ‚Äòself-identifying modern Indian artists.‚Äô Crosby started teaching English literature and First Nations Studies at Vancouver Island University in 1996 (previously Malaspina College). Crosby has worked as a researcher, reviewing Aboriginal programs in public institutions. Crosby's works in literature and curatorial practices have continually interrogated mainstream representations and the historical narratives of First Nations peoples and cultures.  Curatorial practice  Crosby was a guest curator and writer for the Contemporary Art Gallery's exhibition \\"Nations in Urban Landscape\\" (1994). This exhibit toured to Oboro, Montreal in 1996. Shelly Niro, Faye HeavyShield and Eric Robertson are some of the artists referenced in her, \\"Nations in Urban Landscape\\" exhibition catalogue. In \\"Nations in Urban Landscape\\" Crosby investigates the geo-political discourse between Canadian and First Nations governments over the land issues that have shaped cultural practices in museums and galleries. Starting in 2008, Crosby began participating in the web project, \\"Ruins in Progress: Vancouver Art in the Sixties\\" in association with the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery. Included on this site is an essay by Crosby titled, \\"Making Indian Art ‚ÄòModern‚Äô\\" where Crosby writes, \\"What complicates any exploration of this historical stage is the situation in which artists and others struggled to become modern. Before the mid1960s, there was no sustained economic or/and institutional or private support from patrons (including collectors of contemporary aboriginal art), nor an established intellectual discourse to create value for ‚Äòmodern Indian‚Äô art.\\" Crosby writes about George Clutesi, Henry Speck, David Neel and others and their vision to be modern integrated artists during the sixties. Crosby explains that because of their art practices there was an invocation of upward social mobility which succeeded in integrating the formalist discourse of Northwest coast ‚Äòfine art‚Äô into both museum and art galleries, which paradoxically eclipsed many these early artists and their histories. Crosby's work for this website was the first step in framing her PhD dissertation. Since 2001, Crosby has written on contemporary art history topics as diverse as the myth of Bill Reid, the sculptural works of Dina Gomez, an Argentinian artist living and working in Vancouver, and aboriginal performance art, which included two published essays on the multi-media works of Rebecca Belmore. In 2012, Crosby acted as a co- curated with Karen Duffek at the Vancouver Belkin and Satellite Gallery's show, \\"The Paintings of Henry Speck: Udz‚Äôstalis.\\" Henry Speck (1908-1971) is a kwakwaka‚Äôwaka artist who became a \\"newly discovered phenomenon\\" in 1964, when his paintings of masked dancers, coastal creatures, and sea monsters were shown at Vancouver's New Design Gallery. Marcia Crosby is introduced in the exhibition excerpt as a writer, scholar, and PhD candidate, UBC Department of Art History, Visual Art, and Theory). In the exhibition catalogue \\"Projections: The Paintings of Henry Speck, Udzi‚Äôstalis\\" Karen Duffek, and Marcia Crosby have a formal dialogue where they discuss Specks place in \\"Indian art\\" history. Crosby states, \\"I don‚Äôt think Speck and his work ‚Äòslipped away‚Äô so much as the genealogy of ‚Äòmodern art‚Äô by Aboriginal artists cannot account for such qualities as their traditional, metaphysical referents, or their seemingly positivist focus on form.\\" In July 2013, Crosby held a \\"Feedback\\" talk for the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver) in response to Itee Pootoogook's exhibit \\"Buildings and Lands\\". Pootogook's exhibition included a series of large-scale graphite and coloured pencil drawings depicting images of modern northern life distinctly different from the accustomed historical images seen in Inuit work. Instead of traditional subjects such as igloos and parka-clad hunters, Pootogook shows her audience everyday works, one made up of recognizable contemporary accouterments including snowmobiles, boats, soft drinks, and television sets. Crosby's formal discussion on the Pootogook's exhibit heavily reflected upon some of the aspects researched and developed in her PhD. Crosby writes in her thesis, \\"Setting up cultural institution in the heroic position of saviors of First Nations cultures bypasses the more important issue of addressing how that ‚Äòneed‚Äô was created in the first place. Certainly, it can be stated that many First Nations individuals and communities today recognize that accessing the information recorded by ethnographers, anthropologists, archeologists, political scientists, art historians and curators is very important to filling in the historical gaps in local knowledge- which exist because of the many colonialist projects for assimilation and cultural genocide...Who benefits from whom is a historically specific and complex question.\\" Crosby‚Äôs Feedback at the Contemporary Art Gallery included a focus on the formation of Aboriginal cultural production in urban spaces in Vancouver, B.C., for Native and non-Native publics. More specifically, Crosby focuses on the diverse forms of performativity, the display and sale of Aboriginally produced objects, and urban community supports by well-known First Nations artists through their association with new Aboriginal social organizations.  Construction of the Imaginary Indian  An important work by Marcia Crosby is her \\"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\\" an essay included in Janet Giltrow book, \\"Academic Reading, second edition: Reading and Writing Across the Disciplines.\\" In the text, Crosby makes clear her goal to analyze the current state and recent phenomenon in the arts and social sciences where an embracing of ‚Äòdifference‚Äô is taking place.Crosby 2002, p. 267. Crosby makes transparent her experiences at university and the importance of the trials and tribulations she faced. She writes, \\"At the time, I felt only the discomfort of being wedged between the limits of who my professor thought I was and what that person was capable of accomplishing. As I continued studying the Euro-Canadian interaction with First Nations people, both in the visual arts and in literature, I saw a composite, singular ‚ÄòImaginary Indian‚Äô who functioned as a peripheral but necessary component of Europeans‚Äô history in North America- the negative space of the ‚Äòpositive‚Äô force of colonialist hegemony.\\"Crosby 2002, p. 269. The ‚ÄòImaginary Indian‚Äô is a fictionalization of past and present cultures by the west and Crosby elaborates on this throughout her essay. Crosby shapes an argument focused on the precautions about western historizing indigenous people as illusory and an inscribing in past cultures a need to be saved through colonization and civilization. However, \\"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\\" does not take a primarily negative stance. In fact, Crosby writes about how the interest in aboriginal culture, in turn, created a space for native people to enter the art arena, which has in part provided a forum for many First Nations people to speak to current social and political issues.Crosby 2002, p. 270. During her four years at university, Crosby studied and researched individuals who supposedly presented positive images of native people including: Paul Kane, Emily Carr, and Bill Reid. As one of the less than one per cent of First Nations students who attend post-secondary institutions, Crosby found a collection of artists whose work prompted images of past cultures. Emily Carr and her retrospective at the National Gallery of Canada in the summer of 1990 is a major focus in \\"Construction of the Imaginary Indian.\\"Crosby 2002, p. 277. Crosby points out that Carr paints the remaining traces of Indian culture such as totem poles and canoes.Crosby 2002, p. 273. This artistic decision on Carr's behalf speaks to what Crosby interprets as an ambition to record others.Crosby 2002, p. 275. In her text, Crosby questions this further by interrogating the subjects in Emily Carr's paintings. Crosby writes, \\"Carr paid a tribute to the Indians she ‚Äòloved‚Äô\\" but who were they?\\"Crosby 2002, p. 276. \\"The Construction of the Imaginary Indian\\" argues Carr's paintings can be seen as a recording of relics or ethnographic depictions. In Crosby's eyes, Carr was searching for a Canadian identity and also recognition for acting honorably. Crosby writes, \\"At this time, when the struggles of First Nations people for aboriginal rights and self-identity are being widely publicized, it is inappropriate, I think, for an art historian to describe Carr‚Äôs remarks as a ‚Äòstatement of high moral purpose.‚Äô\\" Carr is not alone is being perceived by art historians this way, Paul Kane‚Äôs work and reception by the public is also unpacked in Crosby‚Äôs essay. In \\"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\\" Crosby writes that Paul Kane‚Äôs texts and images reflect nineteenth-century philosophical, religious and political views about indigenous peoples. Crosby adds, Kane‚Äôs ‚Äòhistorical documents‚Äô have transcended time with a message that is still embraced by some art historians and government officials. However, Kane's work today can be read as a detriment of First Nations people because his work became a rationale for denying aboriginal rights, because according to Kane being Indian meant being a savage. Clearly, Crosby finds Kane's claims of authenticity problematic. Paul Kane was committed to making journals in the hopes that they would become intrinsic or essential in value for historians.Crosby 2002, p. 274. Crosby states that when a culture is represented as going through fatal changes, the natural thing to do is salvage or save it. \\"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\\" sheds light on the fact that Kane's‚Äô success depended on the inevitable death of a primitive people and industrial's fascination with such individuals. Bill Reid's work moves slightly away from acting like a recording or documenting, when compared to Kane's journals.Crosby 2002, p. 279. Bill Reid is introduced in Crosby's text as a central figure in this revival of Indian art.Crosby 2002, p. 280. Crosby introduces Bill Reed as a Haida artist who took part in the so-called renaissance of Northwest Coast Indian art. Crosby writes, \\"In this vein, others besides Reid have been cited as saviors of native culture.\\" In \\"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\\" the media's response to marginalized cultures within the postwar context is made central. In reciprocation to the publicizing of the apparent hardships of a culture there is a general global cry for decolonization and independence for non- Western nations (280). Reid has stated he: \\"wants to be taken on his own, engaged in the making of art, not Indian art.\\"Crosby 2002, p. 283. In her text, Crosby responds to this by commenting on political meaning behind his supposed autonomous art practice. Crosby writes, \\"Reid has actively supported the myth of the imminent death of the Indian, by identifying himself as hero and cultural saviour.\\"Crosby 2002, p. 284. Reid's work follows a rubric that promotes the dominant culture's assumption that is not only their obligation but their right to assume the responsibility of caring for a dying culture, that within the museum setting, becomes a homogeneous collection of Indian artifacts.Crosby 2002, p. 285. Crosby writes, \\"The Indian was neatly contained within the institutional glass case, carefully locked away as a repository for the unthinkable or unspeakable parts of those who created it.\\" Reid's work like Carr and Kane reinforces the myth of the artist while also underlining a culture's apparent helplessness. It is important to note that in \\"Construction of the Imaginary Indian\\" Crosby includes a list of the individuals who have contributed to her conclusions on the ‚ÄòImaginary Indian.‚Äô Crosby writes, \\"However, the critical and protesting voices of Linda Nochlin, Heather Dawkins, Edward Said, Terry Goldie, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Marnie Fleming, James Clifford, Virgina Dominguez and many others confirmed the legitimacy of my discomfort at the disparity between what was imagined, written or said, and what was implied In \\"Manifest Matters\\", Gerald Vizenor writes, \\"The postindian warriors hover at last over the ruins of tribal representations and surmount the scriptures of manifest manners with new stories; these warriors counter the surveillance and literature of dominance with their own simulations of survivance.\\"Vizenor 1994, p. 1978 Crosby does more than ‚Äòcollect and display Indians as objects‚Äô as human specimens rather her writing speaks to a personal experience and personal connection with past and present cultures with a sensitivity that is supported by dedicating years to building upon an education.Crosby 2002, p. 267 Included in Wendy Stewart, Audrey Huntley and Fay Blaney's, \\"The Implication of Restorative Justice for Aboriginal Women\\"(2001) is a quotation by Marcia Crosby: \\"I can hardly speak your words because I think you might not forgive me for telling the story you wanted kept a secret. Yes, some of out leaders, some of our old people and others on our communities want us to be quiet about life on our social and geographical reserves. They want us to be silent and if we are not we are not family. But your silence deadened me gram. This is about love and anger. This is about sadness and joy. About strength and total collapse of the spirit.\\" This quotation included in \\"The Implication of Restorative Justice for Aboriginal Women\\" is reinforcement for how dedicated Crosby is in making works that offers a spirit, honor and resistance.

They are shell-less marine (except for 2 species), preview. pulmonate gastropod molluscs. Onchidiidae is the only family within the superfamily Onchidioidea. These animals are quite unusual in that they are emphatically not opisthobranchs with gills, as are almost all of the sea slugs. Instead these creatures are pulmonates. They are more closely related to air-breathing land and freshwater snails and slugs than they are to most other sea snails and sea slugs. This family has no subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005). 143 species names were created within the Onchidiidae, but until recently few species could be identified. In the late 1920s Hoffmann revised the family (based on the descriptions), and classified the described species into genera. Labb√© later continued the revision and named many new genera in his classification of onchidiid slugs. Labb√© also made mistakes in describing the anatomy of some species, and the Onchidiidae was not revised again for over 80 years. Finally, in 2016, the genus Onchidium was revised based on natural history, comparative anatomy, and DNA sequences. This was followed by a revision of the genus Onchidina, and the descriptions of onchidiid species in several new genera.  Anatomy  Adult onchidiids lack a shell, although a shell and operculum is present at the larval stage. The mantle cavity is reduced to the point of absence, correlating with a loss of gills, raphes, and other characters usually found in the mantle cavity. The organism is completely detorted. Slugs in this family make and use love darts made of chitin.Chung D. J. D.: Molluscan 'Love darts'? Hawaiian Shell News, 1986 May, Vol 34(5), pages 3-4. http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/HSN/1980/8605.pdf  Genetics  In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes lies between 16 and 20 (according to the values in this table).Barker G. M.: Gastropods on Land: Phylogeny, Diversity and Adaptive Morphology. in Barker G. M. (ed.): The biology of terrestrial molluscs. CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK, 2001, . 1-146, cited pages: 139 and 142. Habitat Most of the species in this family are marine and are found in the intertidal zone. Many species live on rocky coasts, while others live in mangrove forests which may be marine or brackish. Onchidium stuxbergi (as E. ajuthiae, synonym in literature) was previously described as being collected from fresh water, but recent research has shown that the species has only been collected from brackish water. Remarkably, some onchidiid species are completely terrestrial. Semperoncis montana (synonym in literature: Platevindex apoikistes and Semperella montana) and Platevindex ponsonbyi are the only known terrestrial species in the Onchidiidae. They live in high- elevation rainforests in Borneo and the Philippines. Life habits All these slugs breathe air. The marine ones breathe and move around and feed during low tide, when the water recedes and the slugs are exposed to the air.

The growth of science and a correspondingly scientific way of looking at evidence have for the last three centuries slowly been gaining ground over religious explanations of the cosmos and mankind's place in it. However, not only is secularism now under renewed attack from religious fundamentalism, but it has also been widely claimed that the scientific evidence itself points strongly to a universe deliberately fine-tuned for life to evolve in it. In addition, certain aspects of human life, like consciousness and the ability to recognise the existence of universal moral standards, seem completely resistant to evolutionary explanation. In this book Colin Howson analyses in detail the evidence which is claimed to support belief in God's existence and argues that the claim is not well-founded. Moreover, there is very compelling evidence that an all- powerful, all-knowing God not only does not exist but cannot exist, a conclusion both surprising and provocative. =Articles= His articles include: * 'Evidence and Confirmation', and 'Induction and the Uniformity of Nature', A Companion to the Philosophy of Science, ed.

Early life Frederick Banbury was born on 2 December 1850. He was the eldest son of Frederick Banbury and Cecilia Laura (n√©e Cox) of Shirley House Surrey., and was educated at Winchester College. Business career Banbury was admitted to the London Stock Exchange in 1872 and was head of Frederick Banbury and Sons, stockbrokers, of London, between 1879 and 1906, as well as chairman of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and a director of the London and Provincial Bank. Politics Banbury was elected to represent Camberwell, Peckham in the House of Commons at the 1892 general election, and held the seat in 1895 and 1900. At the 1906 general election he lost the seat as the Liberal Party won a large majority. Later in the year he returned to parliament when he was returned unopposed in a by election for the City of London. He held the seat until 1924. He was a diligent member of the Commons, and was known for his formal attire and punctuality. Although he remained on the back benches he was regarded as an institution in the House. Banbury was created a baronet, \\"of Southam in the County of Warwick\\", in 1903, and admitted to the Privy Council in 1916. When the bill which led to the initial extension of the franchise to women was passing through parliament, Banbury said during a debate: > \\"Women are likely to be affected by gusts and waves of sentiment. Their > emotional temperament makes them so liable to it. But those are not the > people best fitted in this practical world either to sit in this House ... > or to be entrusted with the immense power which this bill gives them.\\" After his retirement from the House of Commons at the 1924 general election, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Banbury of Southam, of Southam in the County of Warwick. Railways He was the last chairman of the GNR, which lost its identity when, under the Railways Act 1921, it was grouped with several other railways on 1 January 1923 to become a constituent of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Sir Frederick was a strong opponent of the railway grouping, and had voted against the Bill during its passage through Parliament; he wanted no part of the future LNER, and decided to retire from railway service at the end of 1922. In late September 1922, the GNR honoured Sir Frederick by naming its newest express passenger locomotive no. 1471 Sir Frederick Banbury. This locomotive belonged to GNR Class A1, was built in July 1922 and remained in service until November 1961. Personal life Banbury married Elizabeth Rosa, daughter of Thomas Barbot Beale, of Brettenham, Suffolk in 1873. She died in 1930. Banbury survived her by six years and died in August 1936 at his home, Warneford Place, Highworth, Wiltshire aged 85. He was buried in Sevenhampton. He was succeeded in the barony by his grandson Charles, his only son Captain Charles William Banbury having been killed in the First World War. Banbury was an animal lover, and for years was on the council of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and served as its chairman.

Her son, Walter Kolm- Velt√©e, was also a noted film director. Life =Austria, Wiener Kunstfilm and Vita-Film: to 1926= Luise was born in Vienna, the daughter of Louis Velt√©e, proprietor of the city panopticon, descended from a family originating in Lyon, who had settled in Austria in the early 19th century. Her brother was Claudius Velt√©e, also later known as a film director. Even in her childhood she helped her father in his business by working on the till. In January 1910, she and her first husband, Anton Kolm, along with the cameraman Jacob Fleck and her brother Claudius, set up the Erste √∂sterreichische Kinofilms- Industrie, the earliest significant film production company in Austria, with financial support from a number of sources, including Luise's father. It was renamed the √ñsterreichisch-Ungarische Kinoindustrie GmbH a year later, and at the end of 1911, after a major financial reconstruction, was renamed the Wiener Kunstfilm-Industrie. The company's first productions were short documentary pieces made in Vienna and other parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Competition was tough, as the new company was up against the very large international French film companies that dominated the Austria market at the time. The French companies were expelled from Austria at the beginning of World War I, but there was new competition in the form of the extremely wealthy Sascha-Film company, also Austrian. During the war the two companies struggled for dominance in the newsreel and propaganda markets, but the superior financial resources of Sascha-Film saw them firmly in the leading position by 1918, and carried them through the economic and political collapse of Austria immediately following the end of the war. Wiener Kunstfilm was obliged to dissolve, but Anton Kolm was able to re-structure its finances and relaunch the company as Vita-Film in 1919. Work began immediately on prestigious new film studios at Rosenh√ºgel in Mauer,possibly on the site of Wiener Kunstfilm's studios, the exact location of in Mauer has never been fully established; the Rosenh√ºgel Film Studios are still in operation today but in 1922, as a result of severe disagreements with their financial backers, Anton and Luise Kolm and Jacob Fleck severed their connection with Vita- Film.Vita-Film went bankrupt in 1925 Anton died later in the same year. Luise and Fleck married in 1924 and left for Berlin in 1926. =Germany 1926-33; Austria 1933-40= In Germany Luise Fleck and her husband worked for Berlin production companies, particularly for Liddy Hegewald and UFA. During this period they made between 30 and 40 films, sometimes as many as nine in a single year. When Hitler took power in 1933 they returned to Vienna, as Jacob Fleck was Jewish, but continued to produce for \\"Hegewald-Film\\" in Vienna and Prague, while Luise's son Walter Kolm-Velt√©e, who had taken a qualification in sound production at Tobis-Tonbild-Syndikat, was nominally responsible for direction. When in 1938 the National Socialists also took power in Austria in the Anschluss, and control over the Austrian film industry passed virtually overnight into the hands of the Reichskulturkammer, there was no more work for them. =Exile 1940-47= Jacob Fleck was interned in 1938 in Dachau Concentration Camp, but was released in 1940, when he and Luise went into exile in Shanghai. They co-operated with the Chinese director Fei Mu in the co-direction of the film S√∂hne und T√∂chter der Welt (\\"Sons and Daughters of the World\\"), which before the establishment of the People's Republic of China was the only collaboration between Chinese and foreign film makers. Its premiere took place on 4 October 1941 in the Yin Du Theatre in Shanghai. =Return to Austria 1947-50= In 1947, the same year in which Austria's first post-war film studio openedBelvedere-Film, set up by August Diglas, Emmerich Hanus and Elfi von Dassanowsky, the Flecks returned to Vienna to plan their comeback, which however never materialised, although a few films were made under the name of a revived Neuer Wiener-Kunstfilm. Luise Fleck died in 1950, Jacob Fleck three years later. Works In 1911 her first credited work as co-director was released: Die Gl√ºckspuppe (\\"Good Luck Doll\\"). Other dramas followed in the same year: Der Dorftrottel (\\"The Village Idiot\\"), Trag√∂die eines Fabriksm√§dels (\\"Tragedy of a Factory Girl\\") and Nur ein armer Knecht (\\"Just a Poor Fellow\\"). In 1913 were premiered her works as director and producer \\"Der Psychiater\\" (\\"The Psychiatrist\\") and Das Proletarierherz (\\"The Proletarian Heart\\").it is not clear whether these are two separate films shown together, or the title and subtitle of a single film During World War I she directed the pro-Habsburg propaganda dramas Mit Herz und Hand f√ºrs Vaterland (\\"With Hand and Heart for the Fatherland\\") (1915) and Mit Gott f√ºr Kaiser und Reich (\\"With God for Kaiser and Reich\\") (1916). In 1918 appeared Der Doppelselbstmord (\\"The Double Suicide\\"). She also made use of Austrian literature in Die Ahnfrau (\\"The Ancestress\\"), based on the play of the same name by Franz Grillparzer, and Lumpazivagabundus, both from 1919. From 1911 to 1922, the year in which her husband Anton died, Luise is known to have directed over 45 films, and the number may have been considerably higher.Nepf, 1991 Luise Kolm, as she was then called, was principally responsible for the studio's production of socially critical dramas that dealt with questions of class conflict and ideological questions, unlike the standard productions of other film studios of the time. The actor Eduard Sekler, who worked for Wiener Kunstfilm, described her in this way: \\"Luise Kolm was a brilliant all-round talent while her husband Kolm just looked after the money - she did everything, she cut and spliced the films, wrote the intertitles and helped her brother in the laboratory. Without her drive and initiative it's doubtful if the firm could have remained in existence.\\" \\"Filmgeschichte(n) aus √ñsterreich\\" (Folge 2, ORF, 1970) Further works by her were the film adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's middle-class tragedy Flirtation in 1927 and When the Soldiers in 1931. The Priest from Kirchfeld appeared in cinemas in 1937. It was Luise and Jacob Fleck's first sound film production of the well-known anti-clerical play of 1870 by Ludwig Anzengruber, after two silent films 1914 and 1926. It was intended as anti-Nazi and pro-Catholic \\"Austria propaganda\\", but was not perceived as such by the critics, who misinterpreted and discounted it. Altogether Luise Fleck wrote at least 18 screenplays, directed 53 films and produced 129 films. Some sources assume far higher figures, allowing for her work being often uncredited.

In 2017, he was appointed deputy chairman of the State Duma, and Putin awarded him with the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\", 2nd degree. On 27 November 2018, a full video of the interrogation of the alleged perpetrator was published, in which he said that the attack was organized by the co-owner of the \\"Mechanical Plant\\" company Alexander Gorbunov, and the customer was Turchak, who personally hurried the performers and personally demanded to break Kashin‚Äôs legs and arms so that he could not write. Views Considering the widely publicized case of Andrey Sychev, in which a young conscript lost his legs and genitalia after brutal beating by other servicemen, Kashin claimed that the case was fabricated by Committee of Soldiers Mothers: \\"The only proven episode... is that Sychev squatted for a while in front of now imprisoned junior sergeant Sivyakov....

Career After playing youth football in the Bristol area, Shore was scouted by Norwich City to join their elite youth setup at the age of 12. He signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday, becoming the youngest player ever to sign as a professional with Norwich City. Only five weeks after signing for Norwich, Shore suffered a knee injury while playing a South-East Counties youth game against Arsenal which would eventually cause an early end to his playing career. In 1998 Shore had an unsuccessful trial at Aston Villa. He later signed for Bristol Rovers, where he made his league debut, but his knee injury forced to retire from professional football at the age of 24, having made just 29 first team appearances in all competitions, scoring five goals. After retiring from full-time football, Shore later made his playing comeback for Brislington, and also went on to play for Mangotsfield United. He also worked for BBC Radio Bristol as a summariser on football commentaries, and started a soccer school called Jamie Shore Soccer International. He is now a coach with the South West Soccer Academy. In October 2017, having previously been employed as the club's U18 manager, Shore returned to Yeovil Town as the club's first team coach.

Street performances and public displays traditionally occur on the Sundays approaching Ash Wednesday, consisting of prescribed musical acts, dancing, and marching. Large numbers of Binche's inhabitants spend the Sunday directly prior to Ash Wednesday in costume. The centrepiece of the carnival's proceedings are clown-like performers known as Gilles. Appearing, for the most part, on ShroveSpencer, p.17 Tuesday, the Gilles are characterised by their vibrant dress, wax masks and wooden footwear. They number up to 1,000 at any given time, range in age from 3 to 60 years old, and are customarily male. The honour of being a Gille at the carnival is something that is aspired to by local men. From dawn on the morning of the carnival's final day, Gilles appear in the centre of Binche, to dance to the sound of drums and ward off evil spirits with sticks.

These oranges are thrown to, and sometimes at, members of the crowd gathered to view the procession.As Logan (2007) and Pateman (2006) note, the tradition of throwing oranges at members of the crowd is done in good spirit and not out of aggression, and to be hit was traditionally considered something to be proud of.

Life Born in Rome, he was the son of the senator Pietro Stefaneschi and his wife, Perna Orsini. He received his early education at Rome, and was sent to the University of Paris to pursue higher studies. After three years he received the degree of Master of Arts, and intended to devote himself to the study of philosophy and Holy Scripture, having already begun to teach at the university, when his parents recalled him to Italy in order that he should study canon and civil law. He was highly esteemed by Pope Celestine V, who made him canon of St. Peter's and auditor of the Rota. He was created cardinal-deacon of the titular Church of San Giorgio in Velabro on 17 December 1295 by Pope Boniface VIII, who also sent him as legate to Cesena, Forl√¨, Faenza and Bologna in 1296 to suppress civil disturbances. Pope John XXII appointed him protector of the Minorites, 23 July 1334. He was never ordained priest. He died at Avignon. Works Stefaneschi is best known as the author of Opus Metricum, a life of Celestine V composed in dactylic hexameter. Abstracting from a short autobiography left in his cell by Celestine when he became pope, the Opus Metricum is the earliest biography of the hermit-pontiff. It is composed of three parts, each complete in itself and written at a different time. In 1319 the author united these three separate poems into one work and sent it with a dedicatory epistle to the prior and the monks of San Spirito at Sulmona, the mother-house of the Celestines. The first part contains in three books an account of the election, reign, and abdication of Celestine. It was written before Stefaneschi became cardinal. The second part describes in two books the election and coronation of Boniface VIII, and was written five years later, when Stefaneschi was already cardinal. The third part is composed of three books and describes the life of Celestine after he had abdicated, his canonization, and miracles. The poem is preceded by an introduction in prose, which contains valuable data of the author's life and a synopsis of the whole work. Though of great historical value, the poem is devoid of all literary excellence, and at times is even extremely clumsy and barbarous. It was first edited by Papebroch, Acta Sanctorum, IV, May, 436-483. The other works of Stefaneschi are: Liber de Centesimo sive Jubileo, edited by Quattrocchi in \\"Bessarione\\" (1900), an interesting and historically important account of the first Roman Jubilee, held in 1300; Liber ceremoniarum Curi√¶ Roman√¶, a book of ceremonies to be observed at the Roman Court; Vita S. Georgii Martyris, a eulogy on St. George, the patron of Stefaneschi's titular church; and \\"Historia de miraculo Mari√¶ facto Avinione\\", a short narrative of how a young man, who had been condemned to death at Avignon, was miraculously delivered by the Virgin Mary.

His books portrayed the jazz world that many black musicians struggled in, portraying disk jockeys, club owners, liquor, drugs, and racism. \\"There are jazz people whose influence can be described as minor,\\" wrote Val Wilmer, \\"yet who are well- known to musicians and listeners alike ... You'd have to be hard-pressed to ignore the wealth of legend that surrounds Babs Gonzales.\\" Jazz writer Jack Cooke explained that Gonzales \\"assumed the role of spokesman for the whole hipster world... [becoming] something more than just a good and original jazz entertainer: the incarnation of a whole social group.\\" Early life Gonzales was born Lee Brown in Newark, New Jersey. He was raised solely by his mother Lottie Brown alongside two brothers. Of his nickname, Gonzales explained, \\"my brothers are basketball players... there was a basketball star in America named Big Babbiad, and so they were called Big Babs, Middle Babs, and I'm Little Babs.\\" As a young man, Gonzales worked as band boy for swing bandleader Jimmie Lunceford, after which he relocated to Los Angeles. To circumvent racial segregation, Gonzales wore a turban and used the pseudonym Ram Singh, passing as an Indian national. Using this identity, Gonzales worked at the Los Angeles Country Club until becoming a private chauffeur to movie star Errol Flynn. Whilst hospitalized for appendicitis in 1944, he assumed the Spanish surname Gonzales as he \\"didn't want to be treated as a Negro,\\" later explaining that \\"they was Jim Crowing me in ofay hotels and so I said if it's just simple enough to change my last name, why not?\\" After the outbreak of World War II, Gonzales was forced to return home to Newark to report for military duty, but was declared unfit for service after arriving to his inspection dressed as a woman. Music career = 1940s = After working with Charlie Barnet and Lionel Hampton's big bands, Gonzales moved to New York and became involved with the burgeoning sound of bebop, a style which initially confused him. \\"I didn't understand what Charlie Parker was playing,\\" said Gonzales, \\"I did not understand anything about bebop [until] Dizzy who - showing me chords, explaining to me what the melodic lines were that he was playing - opened up the music to me.\\" Despite being a trained pianist and drummer, Gonzales preferred to sing rather than play an instrument, stating that \\"it's easier to sing and, above all, it's less tiring. We don't sweat while playing and we always look handsome. Plus, a singer usually earns more money than an instrumentalist.\\" Gonzales formed his own group, Babs' Three Bips and A Bop, releasing a number of 78rpm singles for Blue Note, Capitol, and Apollo labels in the late 1940s. Tadd Dameron, Sonny Rollins, Roy Haynes, Wynton Kelly, and Bennie Green were among the musicians who performed at these recording sessions. \\"I formed the Bips because I felt bebop needed a bridge to the people,\\" said Gonzales, \\"The fire was there... but it wasn't reaching the people.\\" The most notable of Babs' Three Bips and A Bop singles was \\"Oop-Pop- A-Da\\". Its prominent scat singing was credited with originating \\"an easy route to vocal improvisation which is still employed by jazz aspirants the world over.\\" A cover version of \\"Oop-Pop-A-Da\\" later became a one of Dizzy Gillespie's first commercial successes. Gonzales himself rejected being labelled a \\"scat\\" singer, stating \\"I am a jazz singer. Scat is a technical way of interpreting a melody by paraphrasing it by means of onomatopoeia. The scat singers do not improvise. I do not stop improvising, like an instrumentalist; I improvise on the harmonic frame and use chords of passage.\\"  Friendship with Sonny Rollins  Saxophonist Sonny Rollins' debut recordings were made with Gonzales at a session for the Capitol label in 1949. \\"Babs was a very wonderful guy,\\" Rollins reminisced in 2019, \\"he gave me an opportunity to make my first recordings, and a chance to work with the older, more prominent musicians than myself at the time... Fats Navarro, Lucky Thompson, people of that stature.. I was just a kid coming into the business.\\" Reflecting on Gonzales' personality and achievements, Rollins remarked, \\"Just thinking about him makes me laugh... in a respectful way, not at him but with him. He needs to be recognized and praised for what he did. I never forgot him. We were great friends. I admired him tremendously and respected what he was doing.\\" = 1950s and 1960s = Gonzales released a string of albums and singles throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but became only a cult figure, ultimately self-publishing his own recordings. As composer and arranger, Gonzales provided music for Bennie Green (\\"Soul Stirrin'\\" and \\"Lullaby Of The Doomed\\"), Johnny Griffin (\\"Low Gravy\\"), James Clay and David \\"Fathead\\" Newman (\\"Wide Open Spaces\\" and \\"Figger-ration\\"), Paul Gonsalves (\\"Gettin' Together\\") and others. As a guest vocalist he appeared on releases by James Moody, Eddie Jefferson, Jimmy Smith, Bennie Green, Johnny Griffin, and Savoy Records supergroup The Bebop Boys, where he appeared alongside musicians such as Fats Navarro and Bud Powell. Throughout this time Gonzales remained a behind-the- scenes influence in the jazz world, linking musicians to one other and introducing them recording to companies. For example, organist Jimmy Smith's association with the Blue Note label began under Gonzales' recommendation, with Gonzales writing introductory liner notes for Smith's A New Sound - A New Star. Dizzy Gillespie remembered Gonzales as \\"a musical scout... that's how I got Charlie Persip in the band,\\" reminiscing that \\"[Gonzales] called me up at my house one time, he said 'I'm over here in Newark, and there's a drummer over here who's a bitch!', so I said to bring him to rehearsal... [Gonzales] brought him to rehearsal... next day, [Persip] got the job.\\"To Bop Or Not To Be: A Jazz Life, NRK Television 1990  Nightclub Ownership  From 1958, Gonzales operated a nightclub called Babs' Insane Asylum, located in Sugar Hill, New York at 155th Street and St. Nicholas Place. The house band included Hank Jones, Roy Haynes, and Milt Hinton. \\"These guys could have made some crazy money in the studios or with another orchestra, but they preferred to work at home for $100 a week,\\" said Gonzales, \\"simply because it was a great place where all the jazzmen came.\\" Gonzales refusal to work with a talent broker or manager caused social tension. \\"Joe Glaser hates me\\", claimed Gonzales, \\"he could not understand that [Louis] Armstrong or [Lionel] Hampton come to my house to play while I'm independent. And all the other impresarios hate me because I never wanted to fall under the thumb of any one of them. I am free and I owe nothing to anyone.\\" Columnist Dorothy Kilgallen helped to promote the club, however it eventually closed in 1959 due to a rent dispute. Gonzales explained, \\"I quit after two years when the guy who owned the building asked for a bigger cut. We threw his piano out the window!\\"Ralph J Gleason's liner notes for Babs Gonzales \\"Live At Smalls Paradise\\" album, Dauntless Records, 1963 Gonzales attempted to open a similar club in Paris, named Le Maison Du Idiots, but lost access to his $10,000 investment after a general strike. He explained, \\"in America when a group calls a strike you pay it no mind, but in France, nobody works. At the conclusion, the people told me that the [wage] security I'd put up was gone with the old regime, and that if I wanted to reopen I would have to put up fresh security. There I was, ten grand gone and broke.\\"  Written Works  Gonzales wrote and self-published two books, I Paid My Dues: Good Times... No Bread (1967) and Movin' on Down de Line (1975). The books were largely autobiographical but also featured short stories about the exploits of \\"shyster\\" agents, hustlers, pimps and prostitutes who were known to Gonzales. Jazz writer Scott Yanow described the books as \\"more colorful than accurate.\\" Gonzales also printed a small \\"bebop dictionary\\". He personally sold these books at jazz concerts. Due to Gonzales' esoteric, jive vocabulary, he was dubbed \\"the inventor of the bebop language\\".Liner notes for Jimmy Smith \\"A New Sound... A New Star...\\" album, Blue Note Records, 1956. Jazz writer Nat Hentoff elaborated, \\"[Gonzales] is always among the first to use and introduce the newest shifts in the argot, and he may indeed have coined a few himself.\\"Nat Hentoff's liner notes for Babs Gonzales \\"Tales Of Manhattan\\" album, Jaro Records, 1959. An excerpt of Gonzales' writing was later included in the historical collection The Cool School: Writing from America's Hip Underground, whose editor Glenn O'Brien defined Gonzales' voice as one of many \\"outsider voices ignored or suppressed by the mainstream [that] would merge and recombine in unpredictable ways, and change American culture forever.\\"  Personal life  From 1951 Gonzales began to travel regularly to Europe, and remained there for months at a time. Though he makes no mention in his autobiographies, it appears that Gonzales was married for some time. A 1953 issue of Jet published a photograph of Gonzales posing beneath the Eiffel Tower with his \\"Swedish wife, champion swimmer and model\\" Sonja Juhlin, however he later stated that he was not married, explaining that \\"I love freedom too much... there are too many girls on earth to choose just one.\\" Gonzales had earlier been characterized as a \\"hard playboy\\" by magazine columnist Jack Jackson, and claimed in his autobiographies that he had slept with hundreds of women. Jet editor Chester Higgins Sr. reported in 1970 that Gonzales had been living between Sweden and Denmark \\"for several years\\".  Death  Gonzales died of cancer at Newark's College Hospital in January 1980.

Background Additional credit is given to publisher Irving Mills whose words were added to the song by Mitchell Parish.

That original conception was inspired by three of Ellington's grade school teachers. \\"They taught all winter and toured Europe in the summer.

History  The lamps' original purpose was utilitarian with the typical pieces including the base, a cup for the candle, and the chimney or shade. Their creation began in the 1840s, when a new type of candle was developed. These candles were smaller, fatter, and encased with paper; they were usually set in a saucer of water to burn. They burned longer and carried less risk of fire, a common danger of the Victorian era. Samuel Clarke, one of several English designers of lighting devices, patented a glass cup covered with a dome on December 14, 1885. His company promoted the lamps as a way to sell their own candles. Clarke's original lamps feature a fairy embossed into the bottom, and they became so popular that all small candle-based lamps became known as \\"fairy lamps.\\" They became extremely popular, due to the sudden affordability of mass-produced glass and candles, and were frequently used to illuminate nurseries, sickrooms, and hallways. Samuel Clarke even designed a fairy lamp in the shape of a crown in honor of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The Queen reportedly purchased 1,500 of these lamps \\"for her own use\\". The popularity of fairy lamps spread to America, and glassworks on the eastern seaboard and Midwest began manufacturing fairy lamps as well. An exhibit at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago featuring an island lit by fairy lamps (3,000 of which were donated by Samuel Clarke), later toured various American cities. Fairy lamps themselves continued to be used through the 1920s. The Fenton Art Glass Company resumed production of the fairy lamp in the early 1950s, and the items continue to remain collectible.

After the site was unused for more than 15 years, the building was constructed between 1905 and 1907. Built at a cost of US $2 million, the structure included modern amenities, such as ice accessible from every apartment. The building was designed in the French Second Empire style by architects Clinton and Russell.Alpern, Andrew. Apartments for the Affluent: a Historical Survey of Buildings in New York. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1975. Print. It was listed as a contributing property to the federal government designated Central Park West Historic District on November 9, 1982. History In 1902 the property that The Langham stands on was owned by the same family, the Clarks, who owned the prestigious Dakota. The Clark family acquired the property during a period from 1880‚Äì1884 when they acquired numerous properties, including the site of The Dakota. The building is currently owned by the Manocherian family. Located at what is now 135 Central Park West, The Langham occupies the blockfront between West 73rd and West 74th Streets. The location remained vacant until the Clark family liquidated it in 1902. At first the property would not sell because they had placed an unusual restriction on it, no building built could exceed the height of The Dakota, which stands across 73rd street. Apparently, the Clarks could not sell the site with the restriction in place as the sale deed from later in 1902 indicated only a standard \\"restriction on stables and billboards.\\"Gray, Christopher. \\" Streetscapes/The Langham, Central Park West and 73d Street; Tall and Sophisticated, and Just North of the Dakota\\", The New York Times, 20 September 1998.

Architects Clinton and Russell, working for Boehm and Coon, filed plans for a US$2 million building in 1904. By September 1906 the finishing touches were being applied and The Langham was fully complete and open for rental in 1907. The reporting from The New York Times lavished praise upon the building when it opened, noting among its modern amenities \\"real ice.\\" > In each icebox is an extra coil of pipe, through which a freezing mixture > circulates, so that if a tenant wants a piece of real ice, without going to > the trust for it, all he has to do is fill a small metal pan with water, > place it within the coil, and in a few minutes its contents will be frozen > solid.

Irving Bloomingdale, son of the founder of the famous store, moved into The Langham from a limestone townhouse when it opened. Isadore Saks moved from the Art Deco Majestic to the Langham with his son Joseph. Martin Beck, head of the Orpheum Theater chain, was another prominent early resident. He would go on to establish the Palace Theater, where Charlie Chaplin made his American stage debut.

It is situated on the Garden Route between George and Wilderness. It is a popular beach for surfers, consisting of a right hand reef-like wave which rolls over small boulder-like rocks for about 200m. District and National surf competitions are often held at Vic Bay and despite its small size, Vic Bay is a well-known and much-visited spot. The western side of the bay culminates in large boulders believed to have rolled down from the top of the hill. This area is known as Land's End, the name given to the original bungalow at the end of the then- dirt road. The Land's End bungalow is now a large self-catering and B&B; property, as are most of the thirteen properties along the road. The eastern side of the bay consists of rocks, flanked briefly by a concrete wall built to prevent erosion of the slope. There is a small cave often used by fishermen as shelter. The end of the eastern side is known as Kabeljou Bank, named after the large Cob which are often line-caught from the rocks. A number of camp sites overlook the bay and clusters of holiday chalets are situated nearby, making it a popular holiday destination during the summer and Easter holiday periods. The grassy area above the beach has braai facilities and a small shop and restaurant are situated at the top of the beach road. Running above the Bay is the railway line joining George, Wilderness, Sedgefield and ultimately Knysna. The famous Outeniqua Choo Tjoe operated popular tourist rides along this route, although following operational difficulties and severe damage to the tracks above Vic Bay during the 2006 storms, its future remains uncertain. A concrete jetty, flanked by a sandy-bottomed rock pool, looks out across the bay and is a popular place for watching the surfers and for fishing. The original jetty, given to the bay by the original owner of what is now The Waves B&B;, was severely damaged during storms and was replaced by a larger one during the early 1990s.

It is not recorded in the Domesday Book but references to it occur from the 12th century onwards. For many years it was owned by the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral, who let it out to the Grey family. The manor house of Portpool subsequently became known as Gray's Inn, acquiring a reputation for the teaching of law. Location Documents from the 13th and 14th centuries indicate that Portpool included the present site of Gray's Inn, stretching eastwards beyond Leather Lane, northwards beyond present day Clerkenwell Road and southwards to the City boundary. Its area diminished over time as parts were sold off.E. Williams, Early Holborn and the Legal Quarter of London, Vol 1, 1927. The exact location of the manor buildings does not appear to be recorded, although it is assumed by most historians that they lay in the area of the current hall of Gray's Inn. The pool from which Portpool gets its name may have been located near the north-west corner of Brooke Street.E. Williams, op. cit., para 599. History Simon de Gardino de Purtepole left his house within Holeburne bar to his son-in-law Richard de Chygewelle or Chigwell.Cal. Wills, i 48 Chygewelle in 1294 enfeoffed the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's with the property, and they enfeoffed Reginald de Grey, who held it of them in 1307. Before 1397 Henry Grey de Wilton had made a feoffment of \\"Portpole maner called Grey's Inn\\" to certain persons in trust.E. Williams, Staple Inn, 22, 38-44, and Douthwaite, Gray's Inn, 3-18 On 12 August 1506 Edmund Grey, 9th Baron Grey de Wilton (d. 1511) sold to Hugh Denys (d.1511), Groom of the Stool to King Henry VII \\"the manor of Portpoole (one of the prebends belonging to St. Paul's Cathedral), otherwise called Gray's Inn, four messuages, four gardens, the site of a windmill, eight acres of land, ten shillings of free rent, and the advowson of the chantry of Portpoole.\\" The manor was bequeathed by Denys in his will to Sheen Priory, in Surrey, where he was buried, in trust for the augmentation of the Chapel of All Angels at Brentford End. After a delay of five years involving a legal dispute during which a royal licence was being sought by Denys's executors to alienate the manor to Sheen, the Priory leased \\"the mansion of Portpoole\\" to \\"certain students of the law\\", at the annual rent of ¬£6 13s. 4d. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the benchers of Gray's Inn were entered in the King's books as the fee farm tenants of the Crown, at the same rent as paid to the monks of Sheen.John Timbs, Curiosities of London, 1867 John Stow, writing at the end of the 16th century, stated that beyond Holborn Bars lay \\"Porte Poole, or Grayes Inne lane, so called of the Inne of Courte, named Grayes Inne, a goodly house there scituate, by whome builded or first begun I haue not yet learned, but seemeth to be since Edward the thirds time, and is a prebend to Paules Church in London.\\" The name Portpool is preserved today in Portpool Lane, which runs to the east off Gray's Inn Road. Origins of the name Some authors have speculated, without linguistic analysis, that the \\"Port\\" in Portpool refers to a gateE. Williams, Early Holborn and the Legal Quarter of London, Vol 1, 1927 or a market. However, the earliest references to the name of the manor indicate that the first syllable is \\"Purt\\" (\\"Purtepol\\" c.1200 and 1203; \\"Purtepole\\" 1220 and 1309; \\"Pourtepol\\" 1316). This shows that it cannot be \\"port\\" in any sense of that word but instead a personal name, \\"Purta\\". It is therefore \\"Purta's Pool\\".J.E.B. Gover, The Place Names of Middlesex, London, 1922, pp 70-1 and 105. Certainly, it has not been convincingly shown that \\"port\\" refers to any particular gate or market, and indeed the idea of locating a gate or market near a pool is a little unusual. =References= Category:Areas of London Category:History of the London Borough of Camden ","title":"Portpool"},{"id":"10493891","text":"The World Confederation of Billiards Sports (WCBS) is the international umbrella organization encompassing the major cue sports (billiards-type games), including carom billiards, pool games of several varieties, and snooker.WCBS official website, accessed May 12, 2007.

The World Confederation of Billiards Sports (WCBS) has 135 member national federations, as well as continental bodies for Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. WCBS, in turn, is affiliated with many international sports organizations, such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC), General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), International World Games Association (IWGA) and Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). Its statutes, practices and activities all conform to the Olympic Charter.Englishblackball.com Role The primary aim of WCBS is to establish billiard-type sports as medal events in as many multiple-sports competitions as possible, on both regional and world levels. The ultimate goal of WCBS is to have billiard sports included in the Olympic Games.Main role of WCBS, mentioned on the IBSF homepage The WCBS serves as platform for its associated groups: The Union Mondiale de Billard (UMB); the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA); the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) and its amateur counterpart, the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF).Structure diagram showing UMB, WPA and WSF as the members of WCBS on UMB's websiteConstitution of WPA stating it is a founding member of WCBSDetails of WCBS on IWGA website showing that WPBSA as a member federation of WCBS These groups work closely together, but the independence of each organization is maintained and respected. As a result, unlike other international sports organizations, the WCBS does not set the rules of the sports nor organize any international competition itself. Instead, these functions are carried out by the associated organizations. History Before the establishment of WCBS in 1992, there was no single organization representing all cue sports, which was necessary to meet the requirements of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Moreover, cue sports did not meet the official definition of a sport. These were the main obstacles to gaining approval for the inclusion of cue sports in the Olympic Games, despite many attempts to achieve Olympic recognition that have been made since the 1950s.Section named \\"WPA true global coverage\\" on WPA website In 1985, Andr√© Gagnaux, of Switzerland, became the new president of the UMB, the world governing body for carom billiards. In an attempt to achieve Olympic recognition, he contacted the WPBSA, the governing body of professional snooker, to discuss the possibility of forming a governing body for all cue sports. There was no world governing body for pool at that time. Nonetheless, his first attempt failed as he could not convince the WPBSA why it would be important for them to achieve IOC recognition, and what possible cooperation with the UMB could do to further their goals. =Founding and organization= Following the founding of the WPA as the international governing body for pool and their successful organization of the first WPA World Nine-ball Championship in 1990, Gagnaux contacted the WPBSA again. This time he was more successful. In order to fulfill the conditions set by the IOC, the representatives of the governing bodies of the three main cue sports convened on August 30, 1990, at a meeting in Bristol, UK, with the WPBSA as the host.Column written at AZBilliards.com by Yen Makabenta, the president of Raya Sports This was the first time representatives of the three divisions gathered around one table. As a result, it was decided to form the World Confederation of Billiard Sports (WCBS), an umbrella organization encompassing all billiards sports, and a three-man committee (consisting of Gagnaux for carom, Jorgen Sandman for pool and Mark Wildman for snooker) was appointed to write the first constitution for the new organization. Eighteen months were spent devising a way to enable the various disciplines to work closely together, while maintaining their independence. The inaugural General Assembly of the WCBS was held in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland on January 25, 1992. A board consisting of nine delegates was elected with three representatives from each founding member: the UMB, the WPA and the new World Snooker Federation (WSF), formed by cooperation between the WPBSA and the IBSF. The office of president rotated, so that all three divisions take a turn at heading the organization.Section of \\"IOC granted the WCBS its outright recognition\\" about the history of WPA =Dissension= In September 2002, the WPBSA informed the IBSF that it was no longer interested in cooperating with the latter, and the WPBSA withdrew from the WCBS. For unknown reason, the IBSF failed to share this information with the WCBS board, and it was only due to rumors that the WCBS finally was informed of the situation. Having failed to impress the IBSF about the importance of resolving this dispute, a board meeting was held in Bottrop, Germany, in March 2003. The IBSF representatives, although formally invited, did not show up for this meeting. This did not prevent the WCBS from deciding to declare the snooker component of the WCBS temporarily vacant. The IBSF, displeased with this decision, turned to the IOC Court of Arbitration for Sports in Lausanne, Switzerland on May 30, 2003. The CAS delivered its final decision on January 20, 2004, and the WCBS won the case on all counts. Since then the WPBSA has returned to the WCBS, now in its own right as a direct member. IBSF remains a member as well, and the WSF has dissolved. Since the election of the sixth president, Pascal Guillaume of France, in late 2004, all parties have agreed to try and work constructively together for the future benefit of the sport. Pascal has pledged a policy of unification.Sportbusiness.com Accomplishments =GAISF membership= In 1992, the first goal for the newly formed WCBS was to gain recognition by the IOC and obtain membership in the General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF). In October 1993, the WCBS was invited to be an observer at the GAISF Congress and General Assembly in Lahti, Finland. However, the WCBS application failed to make it into the agenda of the AGM (Annual General Meeting), so the two WCBS representatives at this meeting, (Andr√© Gagnaux and Jorgen Sandman), could only listen and learn. In October 1994, when the GAISF AGM took place in Monte Carlo, Monaco, the WCBS application was on the agenda. A discussion about whether billiards could be considered a sport led to a compromise wherein the GAISF would define what constituted a sport, meaning the issue would have to be tabled for a year. Meanwhile, the IOC had responded to their application for recognition by stating that the WCBS was too new, so any possible IOC recognition could not be granted immediately. The IOC also recommended that the WCBS should apply for membership with the GAISF, stating that \\"whilst this is not a prerequisite, the IOC would look favorably on a WCBS membership with the GAISF.\\"History of WCBS In October 1995 the GAISF Congress and General Assembly was held in Seoul, Korea. Andr√© Gagnaux became ill and was hospitalized, so the WCBS delegation was led by Jorgen Sandman, who was accompanied by Nigel Oldfield (Great Britain) and Massimino Del Prete (Italy). The WCBS had learned from the failures of 1993 and 1994, and was better prepared to present its case. The main feature of their presentation was a glossy brochure entitled Right on Cue, a professional overview of billiards sports, which was distributed among the delegates. The WCBS also hosted a cocktail reception for the approximately 500 attending officials. At AGM, the WCBS finally became a provisional member of the GAISF. Any new organization entering the GAISF must first be a provisional member for two years before they are accepted as a full member with voting rights.List of members of International Sports Federations of GAISF =IOC recognition and participation in the World Games= In July 1996, the IOC decided to grant the WCBS a provisional recognition for two years.Smartsnooer.com In September of the same year the WCBS became a member of the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF). An application for membership with the International World Games Association (IWGA) was also filed shortly thereafter, and at the 1997 IWGA AGM it was decided that the WCBS would be granted membership as of January 1, 1998.Member Federation of IWGA On February 5, 1998, the IOC granted the WCBS full recognition, clarifying the status of billiards sports as true sports. Later, the GAISF accepted the WCBS as a full member at the 1999 AGM and the IWGA decided to include billiards sports into the program of the 2001 Akita World Games. The WCBS also applied for the inclusion in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Among 15 other sports that had applied for inclusion, the Greek Olympic Committee decided to consider five, billiards sports among them. It selected two sports out of the five, with billiards sports ending up as their third choice. =Cue sports in other events= Apart from the 2001 World Games, cue sports have been included in many different important multi-sports events, such as the World Youth Games in Moscow and the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games. There were 10 medals of cue sports in the 1998 Asian Games. Participation at the 2002 Asian Games in Pusan, Korea was in jeopardy, mostly due to financial concerns that the host city had. But, in the end, billiards sports were in competition for 10 medals. Later, they were included in the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar. The WCBS has also tried to get billiards sports included in the Commonwealth Games. While the WCBS has been accepted as a member of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), the attempt at inclusion has not yet succeeded. Attempts from WCBS have also been made for inclusion into other events like the Pan-American Games, the All-Africa Games and the Mediterranean Games.

He graduated from the seminaries of Tbilisi (1876) and Kiev (Kyiv) (1880), and was appointed a deputy inspector of the Odessa Seminary in 1880. Returning to Georgia in 1883, he served both as a teacher at the theological schools in Gori, Kutaisi and Tbilisi, and a church official. At the same time, under the pseudonyms of Sadzagelov-Iverieli, Iverieli, and Nikozeli, he published several works, in Georgian and Russian, about the history of the Georgian Orthodox Church and Christianity in Georgia. He discovered and studied several unique medieval Georgian manuscripts, collected old Georgian coins, recorded pieces of folklore, sponsored talented Georgian students, and collaborated with foreign scholars interested in Georgia.  Church career  After the death of his wife and children, he became a monk, assumed the name of Kyrion, and was ordained to the position of archimandrite at Kvatakhevi Monastery in 1896. He served as a bishop at Alaverdi (1898‚Äì1901) and Gori (1901‚Äì2). In the early 20th century, during the heated debates concerning the status of the Georgian church, he was an active proponent of the Georgian autocephalist movement, –ö–∏—Ä–∏–æ–Ω (–ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π –ò–µ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –°–∞–¥–∑–∞–≥–µ–ª–æ–≤) [Kirion (Georgy Yeronimovich Sadzagelov).

Kyrion was deprived of the title of bishop, sent to Kuriazh, Ukraine, and later confined into the Sanaksar Monastery in Mordovia. In 1915, he was restored to his rank and appointed a bishop of Polotsk and Vitebsk. He was able to return to Georgia only after the 1917 February Revolution in St Petersburg led to a de facto secession of Georgia from Russia. Returning to Georgia in September 1917, he was welcomed by Georgians as their spiritual leader. By that time, Georgian clergymen had restored the autocephaly of the Georgian church (March 12, 1917), and Kyrion was elected as Catholicos Patriarch and consecrated at Svetitskhoveli Cathedral on October 1, 1917. The Most Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church refused to recognize the move, and the result was a break in communion between the two churches. It was not until 1943 that the Russian Orthodox Church recognized the autocephaly of the Georgian Patriarchate and the relations between the two co-religionist churches were restored. During his tenure, Kyrion faced an opposition from a group of Georgian clerics who defied his authority. Kyrion's death remains a mystery to this day. He was found murdered at his residence at Martqopi Monastery early on June 27, 1918. He was buried at the Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral.

Detail of a painting by Pinturicchio. Coat of Arms of Cardinal Domenico Capranica Domenico Capranica (1400 - 14 July 1458) was an Italian theologian, canonist, statesman, and Cardinal. Life Cardinal Capranica was born in Capranica Prenestina. His younger brother, Angelo, also became a cardinal. After studies in canon and civil law at Padua and Bologna, under teachers probably including Giuliano Cesarini, he received the title of Doctor of Both Laws at the age of twenty-one. Soon he became secretary to Pope Martin V, and Apostolic prothonotary, and in 1423 or 1426 was made cardinal by this pope, though his nomination was not published in a secret consistory until 1430. Thomas Joseph Shahan, in: Capranica had earned this rapid promotion by various political and military services, notable by his administration of Imola and Forl√¨ and by his successful reduction of rebellious Bologna. In the meantime he had become Bishop of Fermo, but for some reason did not go to Rome for the public ceremonies at which he was to be made cardinal. Despite his protest, and their previous agreement with Martin V, the cardinals of the conclave that followed the latter's death (1431) refused to recognize Capranica's nomination, and the new pope, Pope Eugene IV, sustained their decision on the ground that the delivery of the hat and assignment of the title were necessary for the validity of a cardinal's nomination. Capranica, having already suffered severe losses at Rome through the enmity of the Orsini, took refuge first with Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan and later appealed (1432) to the Council of Basle for recognition of his title. Among his entourage when he left for Basel was Enea Silvio Piccolomini, the future Pope Pius II. The Basel assembly recognized Capranica's promotion, but to punish him for adhering to the council Eugene IV deprived him of all honors and dignities, also of his possessions. Capranica sought a reconciliation with the pope at Florence (30 April 1434). Eugene restored to him his offices and goods, assigned to him the cardinal's church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and sent him to the Council at Ferrara with a special commission to treat with the Greek bishops and theologians concerning the reunion of the Churches. Cardinal Capranica executed twelve responsible embassies for the Apostolic See, and was named Grand Penitentiary (1449) and Archpriest of the Lateran. Capranica was one of the most earnest reformers in the Roman Church. He inaugurated the restoration of primitive fervor among the Cistercians of Tuscany, and drew up for Pope Nicholas V, in 1449, a model plan of a general religious reform.Pastor, Geschischte des P√§pste, I, 394-96; Antonio G. Luciani, ‚ÄúIl Cardinal Capranica ed un progetto di riforma ecclesiastica,‚Äù Res publica litterarum 5, no. 1 (1982), pp. 161-167. He was stern and severe in character, and in the duties of his office open and free of speech, also quite fearless. He insisted on a personal examination of the votes cast for Nicholas V, whose election greatly surprised him, and remonstrated vigorously with Pope Callixtus III for his nepotism, especially in the nomination of Don Pedro Luis Borgia as Vicar (governor) of Spoleto. Capranica was eminent as a peacemaker, notable at Genoa, where he healed grievous municipal dissensions, and again between the Apostolic See and King Alfonso V of Aragon and the princes of Germany. During the plague of 1456 he remained at Rome. He took a very prominent part in all the negotiations for a crusade against the Turks in the hope of restoring Constantinople to the Pal√¶ologi. He is now best known as the founder of the Almo Collegio Capranica, which he opened in his own palace (the oldest Roman monument of the early Renaissance) for thirty-one poor scholars, sixteen in theology and the liberal arts, and fifteen in canon law. Its constitutions, drawn up by himself,Rome, 1705, 1879. are praised as a model of their kind. The college itself is the oldest of the Roman colleges and therefore rejoices in the peculiar title of \\"Almo Collegio\\". His manuscript library passed to the college.A. V. Antonovics, ‚ÄúThe library of Cardinal Domenico Capranica,‚Äù in Cultural Aspects of the Italian Renaissance: Essays in honour of Paul Oskar Kristeller, ed. Cecil H. Clough, Manchester/New York: Manchester University Press, 1967, pp. 141-159. In 1460 his brother Cardinal Angelo Capranica erected nearby a special building for the college.Denifle, Die Universit√§ten, I, 317 sqq. Cardinal Capranica left all his property to ecclesiastical uses, saying: \\"The Church gave it to me; I give it back, for I am not its master, but its steward. I should indeed have reaped but little profit from the nights spent in studying ecclesiastical discipline if I were to leave to my relatives the goods of the Church which belong to the poor\\") The cardinal died a few weeks before Pope Callixtus. At his death the Milanese ambassador wrote home that \\"the wisest, the most perfect, the most learned, and the holiest prelate whom the Church has in our days possessed is gone from us\\". He added that the cardinal was universally considered as the next pope. Pastor himself says that of all the cardinals of the Renaissance Age none but Niccol√≤ Albergati, Cesarini, and Juan Carvajal can be compared with him. He lies buried in a chapel at Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, near St. Catherine of Siena. He supposedly wrote an opusculum known as \\"The Art of Dying Well\\" (1487).Capranica's authorship has been questioned, see Antonio G. Luciani,\\"Minoranze significative nella Biblioteca del Cardinale Domenico Capranica\\", in Scrittura. biblioteche e stampa a Roma nel Quattrocento (Vatican City,1980),p.169 n.8. He is said by Mansi to have written a history of that council, never printed.Gaetano Moroni, \\"Capranica Domenico\\". In: Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica, Venezia: Tipografia Emiliana, 1841, Vol. IX, p. 214-16 () The cardinal actually compiled a systematic collection of Basel's documents, which is found only in manuscript form.

Clarke, first published in 1954. It was also published as \\"The Invention\\". It later appeared in his collection Tales from the White Hart. \\"Patent Pending\\" is a frame story, purporting to recount a scientific tall tale told by a certain Harry Purvis at the (fictional) \\"White Hart\\" pub in London sometime in the 1950s, during a discussion of literary censorship (at the expense of the censors). Plot summary The story within a story tells of a French scientist who successfully finds a way to record and play back brain waves, allowing experiences to be replayed by other people (rather like the feelies in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World). After the device's inventor proves the fidelity of the recordings by capturing a well known gourmet's rapturous appreciation of a cordon bleu meal, and playing it back, reproducing every fine gustatory sensation, his assistant \\"Georges\\" recognizes that other sorts of rapture can also be recorded, finding a pornographic use for the device. Starting with amateur recordings of his own amorous play with his mistress, Georges progressed to a more sophisticated work involving a male-female pair of prostitutes whose technique and physical attributes were more up to the job (In telling the story to the audience at the White Hart, Harry Purvis emphasized that the pair were not from the Place Pigalle, because the assistant's budget did not extend to it - \\"He did not go anywhere near the Place Pigalle, because that was full of Americans and prices were accordingly exorbitant\\"). The resulting recordings were, indeed, every bit as faithful to the young, fit couple's raptures as the gourmet's, and Georges was delighted - entirely too delighted. Eventually, Georges' fascination with the recording of that professional performance takes over his life, Georges's neglected mistress takes his life for the first known act of electronic infidelity. After the police investigation ended, a venture to make the recording process commercial (with city officials among the investors) supposedly went underway, according to Purvis (as he ended the story).

(1973) Eucalypts of the Western Australian goldfields (and the adjacent wheatbelt), Canberra. AGPS p.143 is a small tree or mallee that is endemic to Western Australia. The Noongar name for the tree is Gungurra. Description The tree typically grows to a height of and a canopy that spreads to over . It has smooth, white, pink, greenish or light copper coloured bark that sheds in ribbons. Juvenile leaves are stalked, ovate to broad-lanceolate to elliptical, to 18 x 9 cm. Adult leaves have a disjunct arrangement and are stalked. The leaf blade has a broad- lanceolate shape, basally tapered and are about in length and wide. Leaves are dull, grey-green to glaucous and concolorous. Lemon yellow flowers appear in late winter to late spring. Each axillary, simple conflorescence has three to seven flowered umbellasters on terete peduncles. The buds have a rostrate or urceolate appearance with a calyx calyptrate that sheds early. The fruit is bell or urceolate shaped that are about long and wide. Fruits have depressed discs and enclosed valves and contain red coloured seeds that are linear and cuboid. Taxonomy Eucalyptus woodwardii was first formally described in 1910 by the botanist Joseph Maiden in the Journal and proceedings of the Natural History and Science Society of Western Australia. The type specimens were collected by the surveyor Henry Deane in 1909 from along the Trans- Australian Railway line about east of Kalgoorlie. Distribution Lemon- flowered gum is found on flats and rises with a field distribution that is limited to east of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia in the Karonie area, and with sand or deep sandy loam. Cultivation The tree is a very popular ornamental in southern Australia due to its attractive, large, lemon-yellow flowers.Brooker, I. & Kleinig, D.,(1996) Eucalyptus, An illustrated guide to identification, Melbourne. Reed Books. The cascades of yellow flowers, grey weeping foliage makes the drought tolerant tree suitable for many gardens. It is also frost tolerant and attracts bees and birds. Used as a privacy screening plant or a feature plant it has a medium growth rate and requires little pruning. It is commercially available in seed or as tubestock. In the 1970s hybrids between this and coral gum (E. torquata) called Torwood had been developed.Chippendale, G.M.

The original design consists of a 2.3 km dual three-lane tunnel running under new reclamation areas provided by the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation project,Central‚ÄìWan Chai Bypass and Island Eastern Corridor Link and also connections to Connaught Road West flyover and Island Eastern Corridor. It substitutes Connaught Road Central, Harcourt Road, Gloucester Road and Victoria Park Road to be part of Route 4.Route Diagram ‚Äì Route 4 The bypass opened to traffic on 20 January 2019. History The project, originally estimated to cost HK$28 billion, was approved by the Legislative Council finance committee in 2009, following a \\"decade of objections and legal challenges\\" from environmentalists and citizens concerned by further reclamation of Victoria Harbour. An Environmental Permit was issued under the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance and construction began the same year. Lawmakers were \\"shocked\\" in 2013 by cost overruns. The Transport and Housing Bureau requested HK$8 billion in extra funding, bringing the total bill to HK$36 billion. Gary Fan, a member of LegCo's transport panel, asked: \\"Did the government deliberately underestimate the cost in order to get Legco to pass it?\\" The government bureau blamed unforeseen geotechnical difficulties as well as fluctuating labour and materials costs for the 28 per cent budget increase. On 15 September 2015, the Director of Highways announced that the Central‚ÄìWan Chai Bypass will not open in 2017 as previously anticipated. He blamed a large metal object (probably a sunken ship) that was found on the seabed at the reclamation site in Wan Chai. As a result of the discovery, reclamation works were suspended for some time. The first phase of the project opened on 20 January 2019 with the entire project becoming operational on 24 February that year. Alignment The bypass starts from Rumsey Street Flyover at Sheung Wan. It enters a tunnel outside the International Finance Centre in Central, then heads east past the Tamar site in Admiralty with an interchange at Wan Chai. It continues to head east under the proposed reclamation areas of Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Tin Hau. The original design to have the bypass via Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter leave the tunnel and connect with Island Eastern Corridor at Fortress Hill was amended so that the bypass would now emerge from the tunnel between the IEC carriageways, merging with them near Oil Street, Fortress Hill.Public Engagement Digest - Harbourfront Enhancement Review Tunnel ventilation Ventilation is an indispensable part for the operation of the tunnel as it will supply fresh air to maintain good air-quality environment to the commuters inside the tunnel while discharge vitiated air in a controlled manner at pre-determined suitable locations of exhaust. The tunnel ventilation system is also required to remove smoke in case of tunnel fire incidents. It is proposed to have three ventilation buildings sited near the western end, mid-length and eastern end of the Bypass to achieve the three objectives of supplying fresh air, extracting vitiated air and removing smoke during fire. To achieve an energy efficient ventilation system by shortening the air extraction path, the location of proposed East Ventilation Building (EVB) needs to be as close to the tunnel portal as possible.Central - Wan Chai Bypass Connecting Island Eastern Corridor Enhancement Scheme for East Ventilation Building Public Consultation Leaflet Gallery File:Central and Wan Chai Reclamation Overview 201007.jpgConstruction site in 2010, looking west from Wan Chai.

Authorized during the government of C√©sar Gaviria but mainly developed during the administration of Ernesto Samper (1994-1998), the CONVIVIR groups quickly became controversial as it was considered to represent something of a revival of the Law 48 of 1968. Members of some former paramilitary groups transitioned into CONVIVIR, where they were joined by newer recruits and victims of guerrilla aggression, while others, such as the ACCU, remained operating independently. The then governor of Antioquia, √Ålvaro Uribe Velez (who later became President of Colombia), whose father had been killed by the FARC during a kidnapping attempt in 1983, gained notoriety for his open support and promotion of the CONVIVIR at the time. Reports argued that some CONVIVIR groups achieved results in providing security to communities and intelligence coordination to military forces, but apparently numerous members committed abuses against civilians, without a serious oversight over their operations and organization. In 1998, HRW stated that \\"we have received credible information that indicated that the CONVIVIR groups of the Middle Magdalena and of the southern Cesar regions were directed by known paramilitaries and had threatened to assassinate Colombians that were considered as guerrilla sympathizers or which rejected joining the cooperative groups\\".Human Rights Watch, Colombia 1997 Events, par.1 After much political debate, a November 1997 decision of Colombia's Constitutional Court stated that CONVIVIR members could not gather intelligence information and could not employ military grade weapons. Other restrictions included increasing legal supervision, and in early 1998 dozens of former CONVIVIR groups had their licenses revoked, because they did not turn in their weapons and withheld information about their personnel. Due to these measures, some gradually turned in their weapons and phased themselves out. 237 of the restricted weapons were returned to authorities by the end of 1997. Other members did not comply and later joined existing paramilitary groups. Human Rights Watch (1998), Guerra sin cuartel, par.8 According to a 2007 U.S. indictment against the Chiquita Brands International fruit company, a number of payments to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia passed through an \\"intermediary\\" Convivir group which operated in the Urab√° region.

Bhaskaran Nair (1 March 1927 ‚Äì 29 March 1990), known by his stage name Adoor Bhasi, was an Indian film actor and film director from Kerala. Adoor Bhasi was almost always cast as the man who stands next to the hero. His hilarious actions and roles became the cynosure of comic scenes in the Malayalam films of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He is also famous for his eloquent speeches in fluent English. He directed three Malayalam films during the late 1970s. Early life Adoor Bhasi was born on 1 March 1927 in Peringanadu, Adoor, Travancore, with a rich lineage to boast of. His father, E. V. Krishna Pillai, was a renowned Malayalam humourist writer, dramatist, pioneering short story writer and essayist, a lawyer and a Member of the then Travancore Legislative Assembly (M.L.C.). His mother, Maheshwari Amma, was the youngest daughter of C. V. Raman Pillai, one among the greatest Malayalam novelists, being the first historical novelist in Malayalam and author of Marthanda Varma, Dharmaraja, Premamritham, and Ramarajabahadur), pioneering dramatist, journalist and social activist. Bhasi was the fourth of the seven children of his parents. His siblings (two sisters and four brothers) were the late Omana Amma, the late K. Ramachandran Nair alias Chandraji, Rajalakshmi Amma, K. Padmanabhan Nair, the late K. Sankaran Nair, who died young at the age of 18, and the late K. Krishnan Nair. His elder brother Chandraji became a film actor much before him. Chandraji entered the Film world of Bollywood and acted in a few Hindi films (Bimal Roy's Parineeta and Hrishikesh Mukherji's films) before moving over with his family to Madras to live with Adoor Bhasi. Chandraji was the manager of RK Studios owned by Raj Kapoor in Mumbai and has acted as villain in the popular Bollywood film Ashique alongside Raj Kapoor. Chandraji then acted in several Malayalam films like Chithram and became well known as an actor. His nephew, B. Harikumar, is a well-known novelist, satirist and actor in Malayalam and has acted in several TV serials and feature films. Bhasi spent his childhood along with his parents in Trivandrum. He had his primary education in a missionary school‚ÄîVadakkekottaaram‚Äîin the capital city. After his father's premature death at the age of 44, Bhasi, along with his mother and siblings moved to his father's native village of Adoor and had his middle and high school studies in the English High School of Adoor. After his school education, he moved over to Trivandrum and lived with his maternal aunt. He then joined the Institute of Textile Technology and passed the professional course of diploma in Textile Chemistry. He did not attend any college for graduation. After acquiring the diploma, he was to do internship in a textile mill in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, but owing to financial difficulties, he could not pursue the prescribed internship. He then worked as an apprentice in the Lakshmi Textiles factory in Trivandrum, but could not secure a job in any textile mill in Travancore. He stayed put in Trivandrum and while staying with his eldest maternal aunt, B. Gourikutty Amma, for more than 12 years in Rosscote Bungalow, the house built by his maternal grandfather, C. V. Raman Pillai, began acting on the amateur stage and taking part in dramas broadcast by All India Radio, Thiruvananthapuram station, along with leading stage actors of the time, like C. I. Parameswaran Pillai, Kainikkara Kumara Pillai, P. K. Vikraman Nair, T. R. Sukumaran Nair, Jagathy N. K. Achary, Nagavally R. S. Kurup, Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair, P. K. Veeraraghavan Nair alias Veeran, T. N. Gopinathan Nair, Aranmula Ponnamma, Mavelikara Ponnamma, and Pattom Saraswathi Amma. During those twelve years, he also worked as the Manager of P. K. Memorial Press run by the well-known playwright, T. N. Gopinathan Nair, and also worked as the Manager of Sakhi weekly, edited by T. N. Gopinathan Nair, Rosscote Krishna Pillai and Kavalam Narayana Panicker. His friendship with T. N. earned for him many close contacts with writers and artistes in the professional world of Malayalam drama and films. That ultimately secured for him entry into the amateur stage and finally to the Malayalam film world. Career Bhasi got his first chance in a small role in a Malayalam feature film, Thiramala, directed by P. R. S. Pillai. His first notable film was Chandrathara's Mudiyanaya Puthran (1961). In the year 1968, he acted in Viruthan Shanku, the first full-length comedy in Malayalam cinema by P. Venu. He went on to become one of the highly sought- after and inalienable actors and celebrities of Malayalam feature films of the 1960s and 1970s. He, along with S. P. Pillai and Bahadur formed the trio that contributed to rollicking comedy scenes in Malayalam films. Bhasi went on to act in over 700 films, mainly in supporting roles. He acted with almost all leading actors in Malayalam in his period, like Sathyan, Prem Nazir, Madhu, K. P. Ummer, Jayan, M. G. Soman, Sukumaran, Mammootty and Mohanlal. He acted as the villain in Karimbana and Itha Oru Manushyan. He did double roles in Kottaram Vilkkanundu, Bhadradeepam and Lankadahanam. He got his first Kerala State Film Award for best actor in 1974 for Chattakkari. He first acted as hero in John Abraham's Cheriyachante Kroorakrithyangal (1978) and got the Kerala State Film Award for best actor in 1979. Later in 1984, he won the Kerala State Film Award for best actor for his performance in April 18 (1983). A memorial to Adoor Bhasi is being built by the District Panchayat of Pathanamthitta, the foundation stone for which was laid on 12 June 2009. A film based on Bhasi's real-life is in the making with Dileep playing the lead role. It is based on a novel by B. Harikumar (his nephew) called Mareecham. The script work is by Harikumar himself and the film is produced and directed by Suku Menon. The location is planned out of Trivandrum and Adoor. Adoor Bhasi is often considered one of the first film makers in South India to recognize the credentials of Kamal Haasan when he cast him as lead in his movie Adiyapadam, Kamal later became one of the greatest stars India has ever produced. Controversies Adoor Bhasi was accused by several artistes including K. P. A. C. Lalitha and director P. Chandrakumar of being a villain in real life as well as drunk and a sadist after his death. Death Bhasi suffered from various health problems like diabetes and hypertension during his last years. He also suffered from kidney disease. Being a lifelong bachelor, he did not have any family support. The death of his co-star Prem Nazir in January 1989 shattered him very much. Nazir was not only Bhasi's co- star in many films, but was also a childhood friend. Finally, he died on 29 March 1990, aged 63. His death occurred on the eve of his father's 52nd death anniversary. He was cremated with full state honours at his home in Adoor. Awards Kerala State Film Awards: *1974: Best Actor ‚Äì Chattakkari (directed by K. S.

She was fitted with two Babcock & Wilcox boilers which delivered steam to two English Electric geared steam turbines, producing to two shafts, which gave Waikato a top speed of . Her range was at , and she had a complement of 18 officers and 248 sailors. In terms of armament, Waikato was a fully armed Batch 2 Leander. With Mk 6 twin 4.5-inch guns, a Seacat GWS22 point defence missile, Limbo anti-submarine mortar and Wasp helicopter. She was identical to the Royal Navy Leanders of her group, with 965M LRAW and 177 hull and 199 Variable depth sonars, while her half sister, HMNZS Canterbury was a larger improved Leander, completed in 1971, with a more automated and remote controllable steam plant, a frigate potentially capable of updating with long range bow sonars and Seawolf missiles. HMNZS Canterbury a similar sensor and weapons to Waikato, because New Zealand could not afford the better screen displays and faster processing systems fitted to 1971/2 RN Leanders, and because cost margins of the last group of the Leanders were tight, it did not receive the more modern sonar and ECM/ESM of the last two Royal Navy Leanders. The Leanders were very expensive for New Zealand and the cost per ton, is just as high as the U.S. Navy , which were poor seaboats. Some Royal Navy Leanders eventually carried bow sonars in the 1980s with the range of power of AN/SQS-26, and all recently refitted clean bottom Leanders and Rothesays were silenced more effectively than early 1980s Type 22 frigates.During the Falklands War, the Argentine submarine San Luis, could hear the gas-turbine powered Type 22 frigates, but not the steam-powered Yarmouth. Operational history For the first nine years of its RNZN service Waikato operated around New Zealand and with the ANZUK naval squadron based at Singapore, which continued in reduced form in 1971‚Äì75 with the Royal Navy sending 5 or 6 frigates and destroyers. From 1975 Royal Navy task forces continued to visit New Zealand and Australia for exercises until 1983, when the Falklands commitment and the aftermath effectively ended the Royal Navy's central involvement with the RAN and RNZN.J F Schink & C.Cameron. Learning from Experience. Lessons from Australia's Collins Subs. Rand Corporation.(2011) St Monica. USA. The Naval Board described the late 1970s Five Power Treaty as in a 'sense transitional'.NZ Navy Report to Defence Council 1979 In 1975‚Äì77, Waikato was given an extensive mid-life refit, and essentially modified to the specifications of HMNZS Canterbury with the mortar and VDS wells suppressed and replaced by an enlarged helicopter landing pad, intended for Lynx helicopters that were never ordered and a closed circuit TV system to monitor helicopter operations from the flight deck. Surface and navigation radar was also updated to current RN standards a rather inexpensive alteration. At the time the RN had already rebuilt its early Leanders at great expense with Ikara missiles and computer action automation of weapon systems and the second batch Leanders of the same type as Waikato were to have their gun turret replaced with Exocet missiles, receiving additional Seacat launchers and improved C3. The cost of the later Ikara RN modernisations and the modernisation the Batch 2 RN Leanders often exceeded that of new built Type 21 frigates.Refer to Janes FS 1981-2 for cf refit costs. The cost of modernisation of the Leanders depended on the hull age, and a nine-year old Leander like Waikato could almost certainly have been rebuilt, with automated 76 mm, CIWS in the mid 1970s, in the pattern of the Dutch Leander modernizationR.

London (1983) ,p 84 at an affordable cost compared with the very costly modernization of a 12-year-old frigate like HMS Dido or HMNZS Wellington. After re-entering service under the command of Captain Ian Bradley, Waikato was involved in the rescue of a seriously injured fishermen from the Soviet trawler Ardatov during which a Wasp, flown by Lieutenant Joe Tunicliffe, was launched in rough sea conditions to pick up the man from a trawler. On 15 November the ship had left Wellington to visit the Bounty Islands, to the southeast of the South Island, in heavy weather. During the forenoon a Russian fishing vessel well to the south of New Zealand called for assistance for a critically injured seaman and Waikato altered course and increased speed to get within flying range. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the fishing vessel, in appalling weather conditions. The vessel was finally located 60 miles from its reported position the following afternoon and with considerable difficulty the sailor was winched off the ship and taken on board, to be flown to hospital at 3.30 am the next morning. For this incident the pilot, Lieutenant Joe Tunnicliffe received the Air Force Cross and Chief Medical Assistant Bill Filmer, who was winched on board the fishing vessel, received the British Empire Medal for gallantry.http://navymuseum.co.nz/hmnzs-waikato-leander-class-frigate/ Later, in January 1978, the while escorting the United States Navy Pintado into Auckland harbour, Waikato faced an armada of anti-nuclear protest yachts, which attempted to block the passage of the possibly nuclear-armed and certainly nuclear-powered submarine. Waikato ran into the harbour ahead of Pintado, with Waikatos Wasp helicopter and another RNZN Wasp in company, deployed over the protest yachts to create downdraft which destabilised the protest yachts, and tipped several over in a controversial move which secured the rapid passage of Pintado to its berth. No one was hurt. While appreciated by the US Navy and crew of the submarine, the move was regarded as aggressive by New Zealand politicians and was condemned by the protesters. The approach was never adopted again. Waikato escorted the nuclear-powered USS Haddo into Auckland harbour with less drama the following February 1979, under the command of Cmdr Ian HunterWaikato Proceedings, 5 Feb 1979, National Archives, Wellington, NZ. in a combined RNZN and Police operation deploying navy patrol craft and the police launch Deodar, but confining use of the intrusive Wasp to transfer of a police inspector to the Haddo and clearing the protest armada with only a kayak capsizing. Waikato earlier had deployed to Pearl Harbor for work up with USN fleet units and performed well in RIMPAC and exercises with the US and Canadian fleet.NZ Naval Report to Defence Council 1979 and I. Bradley, Don't Rock the Boat (2004) During these exercises Commander Bradley, positioned Waikato to land a USN Sea King about to be lost with zero fuel. Some crew believed the frigate and its personnel were endangered by landing a large chopper never before tested upon Leanders and the order was officially noted. However, on the last day of the Falklands War a British Leander, , landed a Sea King helicopter.David Brown. The RN & Falklands. 1987, p329 During and after the Falklands conflict in 1982‚Äì3, Waikato deployed to the Armilla patrol to help free up British ships for deployment.NZ Naval Report to the Defence Council 1983 Waikato alternated with HMNZS Canterbury on these duties, the frigates visiting Colombo, Karachi, Mauritius, Zanzibar, Port Sudan, Muscat, Oman and Diego GarciaNZ Naval Report to the Defence Council 1983 on what was officially known as the Indian Ocean Patrol.NZ Naval Report to Defence Council 1983 During July and August 1990, Waikato was involved in Operation BIGTALK, an intervention that was a direct result of the ongoing civil conflict in and around Bougainville. The New Zealand government was tasked with deploying its naval resources to negotiate a peace accord between the two warring factions, the resulting document is now known as the \\"Endeavour Accord\\". The ships deployed to this incident were the frigates Waikato and HMNZS Wellington and the supply vessel HMNZS Endeavour. Although the naval forces were not engaged during the operation, due to the intense fighting and civil unrest there was serious potential for insurgent attacks on New Zealand naval forces. Commendations were issued to each member of the crews to acknowledge their contribution. On 23 February 2017, it was announced by NZDF that the New Zealand Operational Service Medal (NZOSM) had been awarded to personnel who were in Bougainville for the Operation BIGTALK peace talks. Decommissioning HMNZS Waikato was decommissioned from the Royal New Zealand Navy in 1998 and sold by the government for $1. She was stripped in the Northland port of Opua and sunk off the coast of Tutukaka on 18 December 2000 as an artificial reef. In 2002, the sunken Waikatos bow was separated from the rest of the ship in heavy weather.

It is a branch of astrobiology and botany. It has been a subject of study that plants may be grown in outer space typically in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment in specific space gardens.NASA ‚Äì Growing Plants and Vegetables in a Space Garden In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere.NASA ‚Äì Plants in Space Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity. Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews. The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity.NASA ‚Äì Getting to The Root of Plant Growth Aboard The Space Station This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been shown to make possible space farming in hypo- and micro-gravity. NASA plans to grow plants in space to help feed astronauts, and to provide psychological benefits for long-term space flight.  Extraterrestrial vegetation  Astrobotany has been the investigation of the idea that alien plant life may exist on other planets. Here an artist has envisioned alien plants on shores of an exomoon exosea. The search for vegetation on other planets began with Gavriil Tikhov, who attempted to detect extraterrestrial vegetation via analyzing the wavelengths of a planet's reflected light, or planetshine. Photosynthetic pigments, like chlorophylls on Earth, reflect light spectra that spike in the range of 700‚Äì750 nm. This pronounced spike is referred to as \\"vegetation's red edge.\\" It was thought that observing this spike in a reading of planetshine would signal a surface covered in green vegetation. Searching for extraterrestrial vegetation has been outcompeted by the search for microbial life on other planets or mathematical models to predict the viability of life on exoplanets. Growing plants in space The study of plant response in space environments is another subject of astrobotany research. In space, plants encounter unique environmental stressors not found on Earth including microgravity, ionizing radiation, and oxidative stress.http://astrobotany.com/plants-and-spaceflight/  Challenges of Growing Plants in Space Experiments have shown that these stressors cause genetic alterations in plant metabolism pathways. Changes in genetic expression have shown that plants respond on a molecular level to a space environment. Astrobotanical research has been applied to the challenges of creating life support systems both in space and on other planets, primarily Mars. History Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky was one of the first people to discuss using photosynthetic life as a resource in space agricultural systems. Speculation about plant cultivation in space has been around since the early 20th century.https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/opag.2017.2.issue-1/opag-2017-0002/opag-2017-0002.pdf  Agriculture for Space: People and Places Paving the Way The term astrobotany was first used in 1945 by Russian astronomer and astrobiology pioneer Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov.  The Creator of Astrobotany, Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov Tikhov is considered to be the father of astrobotany. Research in the field has been conducted both with growing Earth plants in space environments and searching for botanical life on other planets. = Seeds = The first organisms in space were \\"specially developed strains of seeds\\" launched to on 9 July 1946 on a U.S. launched V-2 rocket. These samples were not recovered. The first seeds launched into space and successfully recovered were maize seeds launched on 30 July 1946, which were soon followed by rye and cotton. These early suborbital biological experiments were handled by Harvard University and the Naval Research Laboratory and were concerned with radiation exposure on living tissue. In 1971, 500 tree seeds (Loblolly pine, Sycamore, Sweetgum, Redwood, and Douglas fir) were flown around the Moon on Apollo 14. These Moon trees were planted and grown with controls back on Earth where no changes were detected. = Plants = The arugula-like lettuce Mizuna growing for Veg-03 In 1982, the crew of the Soviet Salyut 7 space station conducted an experiment, prepared by Lithuanian scientists (Alfonsas Merkys and others), and grew some Arabidopsis using Fiton-3 experimental micro-greenhouse apparatus, thus becoming the first plants to flower and produce seeds in space.

Algae was the first candidate for human- plant life support systems. Initial research in the 1950s and 1960s used Chlorella, Anacystis, Synechocystis, Scenedesmus, Synechococcus, and Spirulina species to study how photosynthetic organisms could be used for O2 and CO2 cycling in closed systems. Later research through Russia's BIOS program and the US's CELSS program investigated the use of higher plants to fulfill the roles of atmospheric regulators, waste recyclers, and food for sustained missions. The crops most commonly studied include starch crops such as wheat, potato, and rice; protein-rich crops such as soy, peanut, and common bean; and a host of other nutrition-enhancing crops like lettuce, strawberry, and kale. Tests for optimal growth conditions in closed systems have required research both into environmental parameters necessary for particular crops (such as differing light periods for short-day versus long-day crops) and cultivars that are a best-fit for life support system growth. Tests of human-plant life support systems in space are relatively few compared to similar testing performed on Earth and micro-gravity testing on plant growth in space. The first life support systems testing performed in space included gas exchange experiments with wheat, potato, and giant duckweed (Spyrodela polyrhiza). Smaller scale projects, sometimes referred to as \\"salad machines\\", have been used to provide fresh produce to astronauts as a dietary supplement. Future studies have been planned to investigate the effects of keeping plants on the mental well-being of humans in confined environments. More recent research has been focused on extrapolating these life support systems to other planets, primarily Martian bases. Interlocking closed systems called \\"modular biospheres\\" have been prototyped to support four- to five-person crews on the Martian surface. These encampments are designed as inflatable greenhouses and bases. They are anticipated to use Martian soils for growth substrate and wastewater treatment, and crop cultivars developed specifically for extraplanetary life. There has also been discussion of using the Martian moon Phobos as a resources base, potentially mining frozen water and carbon dioxide from the surface and eventually using hollowed craters for autonomous growth chambers that can be harvested during mining missions.  Plant research  The study of plant research has yielded information useful to other areas of botany and horticulture. Extensive research into hydroponics systems was fielded successfully by NASA in both the CELSS and ALS programs, as well as the effects of increased photoperiod and light intensity for various crop species. Research also led to optimization of yields beyond what had been previously achieved by indoor cropping systems. Intensive studying of gas exchange and plant volatile concentrations in closed systems led to increased understanding of plant response to extreme levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and ethylene. Usage of LEDs in closed life support systems research also prompted the increased use of LEDs in indoor growing operations.  Experiments  Illustration of plants growing in a hypothetical Mars base.

Results of experiments  A young sunflower plant aboard the ISSSS038-E-000734 (13 Nov. 2013) Several experiments have been focused on how plant growth and distribution compares in micro-gravity, space conditions versus Earth conditions. This enables scientists to explore whether certain plant growth patterns are innate or environmentally driven. For instance, Allan H. Brown tested seedling movements aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1983. Sunflower seedling movements were recorded while in orbit. They observed that the seedlings still experienced rotational growth and circumnation despite lack of gravity, showing these behaviors are built-in. Other experiments have found that plants have the ability to exhibit gravitropism, even in low-gravity conditions. For instance, the ESA's European Modular Cultivation System enables experimentation with plant growth; acting as a miniature greenhouse, scientists aboard the International Space Station can investigate how plants react in variable- gravity conditions. The Gravi-1 experiment (2008) utilized the EMCS to study lentil seedling growth and amyloplast movement on the calcium-dependent pathways. The results of this experiment found that the plants were able to sense the direction of gravity even at very low levels. A later experiment with the EMCS placed 768 lentil seedlings in a centrifuge to stimulate various gravitational changes; this experiment, Gravi-2 (2014), displayed that plants change calcium signalling towards root growth while being grown in several gravity levels. Many experiments have a more generalized approach in observing overall plant growth patterns as opposed to one specific growth behavior. One such experiment from the Canadian Space Agency, for example, found that white spruce seedlings grew differently in the anti-gravity space environment compared with Earth-bound seedlings; the space seedlings exhibited enhanced growth from the shoots and needles, and also had randomized amyloplast distribution compared with the Earth-bound control group.

Route The road can be thought of as an alternative, but slightly longer route than the A470, the road on which both its termini are. It is a road with two parts of contrasting character, the northern half crossing through the wild rural Brecon Beacons while the southern half is at a lower elevation and is urban in nature. Southbound, the A4059 begins by turning right off the A470 to the south of Storey Arms, just after passing the Beacons Reservoir. The road crosses the top of the reservoir's dam before climbing away from the trees and onto exposed moor land to the west of the A470. Thereafter the A4059 climbs to a height of , following the River Taff 100 m below. At this point along the road, the A470 can be clearly seen in the valley below. As the A4059 continues through the Brecon Beacons, the vegetation is limited to coarse grass, and there are plenty of sheep. Leaving the park after passing through the small village of Penderyn, the road descends into Hirwaun, the first major destination on the southbound A4059. For a short segment past Hirwaun, the A4059 is synonymous with the A465. When the road leaves Hirwaun and the A465, it then turns southeast and follows the Cynon River, passing through Aberdare and Mountain Ash, although most of this urban stretch now runs on a new relief road, so avoiding the centres of the towns.

The equation was actually first published in 1950 at the end of a paper by Yoichiro Nambu, but without derivation. A graphical representation of the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation, showing its recursive definition Due to its generality and its application in many branches of theoretical physics, the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation appears in many different forms. One form, that is quite often used in high energy physics is : \\\\Gamma(P,p) =\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{d^4k}{(2\\\\pi)^4} \\\\; K(P,p,k)\\\\, S(k-\\\\tfrac{P}{2}) \\\\,\\\\Gamma(P,k)\\\\, S(k+\\\\tfrac{P}{2}) where Œì is the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter amplitude, K the interaction and S the propagators of the two participating particles. In quantum theory, bound states are objects that live for an infinite time (otherwise they are called resonances), thus the constituents interact infinitely many times. By summing up, infinitely many times, all possible interactions that can occur between the two constituents, the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation is a tool to calculate properties of bound states. Its solution, the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter amplitude, is a description of the bound state under consideration. As it can be derived via identifying bound-states with poles in the S-matrix, it can be connected to the quantum theoretical description of scattering processes and Green's functions. The Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation is a general quantum field theoretical tool, thus applications for it can be found in any quantum field theory. Some examples are positronium (bound state of an electron‚Äìpositron pair), excitons (bound state of an electron‚Äìhole pair), and mesons (as quark-antiquark bound-state). Even for simple systems such as the positronium, the equation cannot be solved exactly, although in principle it can be formulated exactly. A classification of the states can be achieved without the need for an exact solution. If one of the particles is significantly more massive than the other, the problem is considerably simplified as one solves the Dirac equation for the lighter particle under the external potential of the heavier particle.  Derivation  The starting point for the derivation of the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation is the two-particle (or four point) Dyson equation : G = S_1\\\\,S_2 + S_1\\\\,S_2\\\\, K_{12}\\\\, G in momentum space, where \\"G\\" is the two-particle Green function \\\\langle\\\\Omega \\\\phi_1 \\\\,\\\\phi_2\\\\, \\\\phi_3\\\\, \\\\phi_4 \\\\Omega\\\\rangle , \\"S\\" are the free propagators and \\"K\\" is an interaction kernel, which contains all possible interaction between the two particles. The crucial step is now, to assume that bound states appear as poles in the Green function. One assumes, that two particles come together and form a bound state with mass \\"M\\", this bound state propagates freely, and then the bound state splits in its two constituents again. Therefore, one introduces the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter wave function \\\\Psi = \\\\langle\\\\Omega \\\\phi_1 \\\\,\\\\phi_2\\\\psi\\\\rangle , which is a transition amplitude of two constituents \\\\phi_i into a bound state \\\\psi, and then makes an ansatz for the Green function in the vicinity of the pole as : G \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\Psi\\\\;\\\\bar\\\\Psi}{P^2-M^2}, where P is the total momentum of the system. One sees, that if for this momentum the equation P^2 = M^2 holds, what is exactly the Einstein energy-momentum relation (with the Four-momentum P_\\\\mu = \\\\left(E/c,\\\\vec p \\\\right) and P^2 = P_\\\\mu\\\\,P^\\\\mu ) the four-point Green function contains a pole. If one plugs that ansatz into the Dyson equation above, and sets the total momentum \\"P\\" such that the energy-momentum relation holds, on both sides of the term a pole appears. : \\\\frac{\\\\Psi\\\\;\\\\bar\\\\Psi}{P^2-M^2} = S_1\\\\,S_2 +S_1\\\\,S_2\\\\, K_{12}\\\\frac{\\\\Psi\\\\;\\\\bar\\\\Psi}{P^2-M^2} Comparing the residues yields : \\\\Psi=S_1\\\\,S_2\\\\, K_{12}\\\\Psi, \\\\, This is already the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation, written in terms of the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter wave functions. To obtain the above form one introduces the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter amplitudes \\"Œì\\" : \\\\Psi = S_1\\\\,S_2\\\\,\\\\Gamma and gets finally : \\\\Gamma= K_{12}\\\\,S_1\\\\,S_2\\\\,\\\\Gamma which is written down above, with the explicit momentum dependence. Rainbow-ladder approximation A graphical representation of the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation in Ladder-approximation In principle the interaction kernel K contains all possible two-particle-irreducible interactions that can occur between the two constituents. Thus, in practical calculations one has to model it and only choose a subset of the interactions. As in quantum field theories, interaction is described via the exchange of particles (e.g. photons in quantum electrodynamics, or gluons in quantum chromodynamics), the most simple interaction is the exchange of only one of these force-particles. As the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation sums up the interaction infinitely many times, the resulting Feynman graph has the form of a ladder (or rainbow). While in quantum electrodynamics the ladder approximation caused problems with crossing symmetry and gauge invariance and thus crossed ladder terms had to be included, in quantum chromodynamics this approximation is used phenomenologically quite a lot to calculate hadron masses, since it respects Chiral symmetry breaking and therefore is an important part of the generation of these masses.  Normalization  As for any homogeneous equation, the solution of the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter equation is determined only up to a numerical factor. This factor has to be specified by a certain normalization condition. For the Bethe‚ÄìSalpeter amplitudes this is usually done by demanding probability conservation (similar to the normalization of the quantum mechanical Wave function), which corresponds to the equation :2 P_\\\\mu = \\\\bar\\\\Gamma \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial P_\\\\mu} \\\\left( S_1 \\\\otimes S_2 \\\\right) - S_1\\\\,S_2\\\\, \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial P_\\\\mu}\\\\,K\\\\right)\\\\, S_1\\\\,S_2\\\\right) \\\\Gamma Normalizations to the charge and energy-momentum tensor of the bound state lead to the same equation.

(1973) Eucalypts of the Western Australian goldfields (and the adjacent wheatbelt), Canberra. AGPS p.175 is a mallee that is endemic to the south coast of Western Australia. It has smooth bark, thick lance- shaped to oblong adult leaves, single flower buds arranged in leaf axils, red to pink flowers and square, prominently winged fruit. Description Eucalyptus tetraptera is low, straggly mallee that typically grows to a height of and a similar width. It usually has a single low branching trunk with smooth, grey or whitish-grey bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg- shaped to broadly elliptical leaves that are long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, thick, lance-shaped to oblong, long and wide, the base tapering to a narrowly flattened petiole long. The flower buds are arranged singly in leaf axils on a rigidly down-turned peduncle long, the peduncle often wider than long. Mature buds are cubic with broad, curved wings, long and wide with a pyramid-shaped operculum long. Flowering occurs from late winter to mid summer and the flowers are red to pink. The fruit is a woody, red, sessile, oblong capsule, long and wide including the wings on each corner. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus tetraptera was first formally described by the Russian botanist Nikolai Turczaninow in 1849 in the journal, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou from specimens collected in 1848 by James Drummond. The specific epithet (tetraptera) is from ancient Greek words meaning \\"four\\" and \\"winged\\" referring to the fruit of this species. Distribution and habitat The distribution of the square-fruited mallee is limited to coastal sandplains where it is also found among granite outcrops of southern Western Australia, north from the Stirling Ranges and south to around Albany east to Israelite Bay in the Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions where it grows in white or grey sandy soils in heath. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses E. tetraptera is one of the most bizarre of the eucalypts with its spectacular, large, red buds and fruit. A popular ornamental,Brooker, I. & Kleinig, D., Eucalyptus, An illustrated guide to identification, Reed Books, Melbourne, 1996 it grows well in full sun in semi-arid climates but is slower growing in cooler climates. It is smog and frost resistant and can be kept in containers. As the plant becomes straggly with age it can be cut back to ground level to rejuvenate. The plant is commercially available as seedlings or as seeds. As for most Eucalypts, the seeds will germinate readily.

He was made heir to his uncle Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley. He was married four times. His third wife was Lady Isabel, daughter of Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk; and his fourth wife was the Lady Joan Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. Lord Berkeley was involved in a bitter feud with his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of the fifth Baron Berkeley and wife of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. He was unable initially to claim Berkeley Castle, as it was taken in possession by the Earl and Countess of Warwick. In 1421, when the Warwicks finally gave up Berkeley Castle, James was summoned to Parliament by writ as Lord Berkeley. The feud did not end there as his third wife Isabel was captured by the Countess of Warwick's son-in-law the Earl of Shrewsbury, and held imprisoned until her death in 1452. Lord Berkeley was succeeded by his son from his third marriage, William, who was created Marquess of Berkeley in 1489. Marriages and issue He firstly married the daughter of John St. John on 9 April 1410, by contract, and had no issue. His second marriage was to the daughter of Sir Humphrey Stafford of Hook Dorset in 1415. No issue came from this marriage. In about 1424, he was wed to Lady Isabel de Mowbray (b. 1396 - d. 29 November 1452), in which James was her second husband and Henry Ferrers was her first. They had the following issue: *Elizabeth de Berkeley (b. 1425 - d. 1482) *Sir William de Berkeley, Earl of Nottingham (c. 1427 - 1492); William became the 2nd Baron Berkeley sometime after his father's death in 1463. *James de Berkeley, Esquire (b. 1429) *Alice de Berkeley (b. 1432) *Sir Maurice de Berkeley VI, Lord Berkeley (c. 1435 - 1 September 1506), who was married to Isabel Meade, daughter of merchant Phillip Meade and his wife Isabel, in 1465 and had issue. *Thomas de Berkeley, Esquire (b. 1435 - d. 1484) *Isabel de Berkeley (b. 1438 - d. 1482) His fourth marriage to Joan Talbot was before 25 July 1457.

Life and career Sent by Pope Leo X as papal nuncio to England (1515‚Äì17), he also filled a similar office in Portugal and in Spain (1519), becoming acquainted with Cardinal Adrian Florent, Bishop of Tortosa, the Dutch preceptor of Charles V, and later Pope Adrian VI. Diet of Nuremberg, War against Turks, Magellan's expedition One of Pope Adrian's first acts, after his entry into Rome, was to make Chieregati, whose learning and virtue the pope esteemed, Bishop of Teramo in the Kingdom of Naples; he then sent him to the Diet of Nuremberg, called for the autumn of 1522. He was commissioned to obtain from the German princes a more energetic pursuit of the war against the Turks in Hungary, also a more vigorous suppression of Lutheranism and the execution of the Edict of Worms (26 May 1521) against Martin Luther. In two discourses (19 November and 10 December) he urged the princes to co-operate for the expulsion of the Turks from Christian Hungary; on the latter date he also demanded the immediate execution of the Edict of Worms, whereby Luther had been put under the ban of the empire, which formal outlawry he had hitherto escaped through the protection of Frederick of Saxony and other friendly princes. Finally, on 3 January 1523, Chieregati read publicly two important documents, sent after him from Rome. They were a papal brief (issued on the previous 25 November) to the members of the Diet and an instruction for Chieregati himself. The former contained an appeal to the Catholic piety, religious traditions, and magnanimity of the representatives of the German people, and besought the Diet to quench religious sedition and compel the submission of Luther and his adherents. The personal instruction, issued probably on the same date, and read to the Diet by Chieregati, is one of the most important documents for the early history of the Protestant Reformation. In it Pope Adrian confesses that the sins of ecclesiastics were the chief cause of the tribulations of the Church, and that in the Roman Curia itself, both head and members, popes and prelates, had been guilty of abuses.For the text of the Instruction see Odorico Raynaldi, Annales Ecclesiastici (Louvain, 1781), II, 144ff; Francesco Sforza Pallavicino, Storia del Concilio di Trento (Rome, 1656), I (2), 4-6; especially Wrede, \\"Deutsche Reichstagskten\\" (Munich, 1893), III, 391; see below, Pastor, and Hergenr√∂ther- Kirsch. The reply of the Diet was discouraging; the princes and representatives avoided an answer to the pope's requests, proposed the celebration of a general council in some German city, and renewed in the earlier antipapal complaints of the Germans, the famous Centum gravamina teutonicae nationis; Pastor addsPastor, p. 97. that the failure of Chieregati was in large measure owing to the great German prelates who were by no means ready to repeat the confession of the pope. The latter has often been blamed for his frankness,See remarks of Pallavicino in Hergenr√∂ther-Kirsch. but Pastorp. 94. defends him, saying that his admissions were necessary. Chieregati was the patron of Antonio Pigafetta, who accompanied the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan. Pigafetta sent his journal of the expedition, and the voyage round the world completed by its only surviving ship, the Victoria, to Chieregati while he was at the Diet. Chieregati made it available to Diet attendees.Chieregati to Isabella d‚ÄôEste Gonzaga, Nuremberg, 26 December 1522, Archivio di Stato di Mantova, Archivio Gonzaga, b. 523, c. 152; quoted in Guglielmo Berchet, Carteggi diplomatici, Reale Commissione colombiana pel Quarto Centenario dalla Scoperta dell' America, Fonti italiane per la Storia della Scoperta del Nuovo Mondo, Raccolta di Documenti e Studi, Roma, 1892, Parte III, vol. I, p.175, doc.x. An account of the expedition, with a globe illustrating the voyage, was also sent by Emperor Charles V to his brother Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, who was presiding at the Diet. The account was probably that taken down by Maximilianus Transylvanus, and the globe a copy of the one made by him. The globe was displayed to the attendees. Chieregati, having examined the globe, described the Victoria‚Äôs itinerary to his patron, Isabella d‚ÄôEste Gonzaga, Marchesa of Mantua.Chieregati to Isabella d‚ÄôEste Gonzaga, Nuremberg, 10 January 1523, Guglielmo Berchet, Carteggi Diplomatici, Reale Commissione Colombiana pel Quarto Centenario dalla Scoperta dell' America, Fonti italiane per la Storia della Scoperta del Nuovo Mondo, Raccolta di Documenti e Studi, Roma, 1892, Parte III, vol.

At Columbia, Russell had been a member of St. Anthony Hall, the secret fraternal college society, and within a year of his joining his great uncle's firm, in 1879, Renwick completed the first St. A's Chapter House, at 25 East 28th Street, likely with Russell involved in the design work.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF1031F931A3575AC0A966958260&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=1 In New York City's ambitious building boom , Clinton and Russell were responsible for designing the world's largest apartment building, the world's largest office building, and a cluster of early downtown skyscrapers along Broadway and Wall Street for banks and insurance companies. Many of the firm's important commissions related to real estate investments of the Astor family. The landmark Astor Hotel that served as an anchor for the development of Times Square, the Astor Apartments, the Graham Court Apartments, and The Apthorp were among their projects for William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor.

Labour hire arrangements often overlap with, but are distinct from the practice of temporary staffing. Labour hire arrangements are situations in which an employee has a legal employer, but no direct employment contract with their place of work. Companies that provide labour hire are often referred to as 'recruitment agencies', however, labour hire arrangements do not involve an agency relationship with an employee or the worksite in a legal sense. The labour hire company is paid for services provided to the worksite by the employee, they are not paid as an agent for the cost of recruitment per se. The labour hire arrangement can be contrasted with other recruitment business dealings, that involve a finder's fee paid to an agency for helping a workplace obtain an employee.  Labour hire industry  = Labour hire firms = As of January 2020, the total revenue of the labour hire industry in Australia is approximately $29 billion; according to industrial analysts. The analyst firm IBISWorld claims that there are 9,634 labour hire businesses and 362,800 labour hire employees in the industry. The largest companies in the Australian labour hire industry are Hays, Persol Holdings (which owns both Programmed & Skilled Group), Recruit (trading as RGF Staffing), CIMIC Group (trading as WorkPac), ManpowerGroup, Adecco, and Randstad. Other notable labour hire firms include Ingeus (notable for being founded by Th√©r√®se Rein, the wife of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd), and Serco (notable for its labour hire procurement to government departments). = Industrial clients = Labour hire arrangements are used by many large companies in Australia in their workforce. A prominent example is the Amazon MEL1 facility, located in Dandenong South. It was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald that 100% of the non-managerial workforce at that facility is provided by Adecco. Reportedly, Amazon's other facilities in Australia are operated on similar terms. Labour hire is also used in great quantity by the Commonwealth Government. Legal issues = Legal responsibility = As the de jure employer, labour hire providers are legally responsible for ensuring compliance with Australian Industrial law, including the Fair work act. Labour hire employees must be offered wages & conditions in compliance with the applicable Industrial award. = Liability for injuries at client worksites = Labour hire companies have been found legally liable for the injuries of their employees, on the tort ground of Negligence. In the case Drake Industrial v WorkCover Authority the common law duty of care owed by employers toward their employees, was affirmed to include circumstances in which that employee worked on a premises not controlled by the labour hire employer. The court noted that: > \\"An employer who sends its employees into another workplace over which they > exercise limited control is ... under a particular positive obligation to > ensure that those premises, or the work done, do not present a threat to the > health, safety or welfare of those employees.\\" = Enterprise bargaining agreements = Enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) applicable to a workplace do not legally cover labour hire employees and their employers, unless there is a clause written into the agreement expressing that to be the case. Instead, EBAs are formed between employees of the labour hire company, and the labour hire company itself. This can result in a pay difference between actual employees of a worksite, and those working there through labour hire; a aspect that has been criticized by the Australian Labor Party. Labour hire companies have been accused of using spurious legal tactics to undermine EBAs existing between employees and their existing workplaces; on behalf of clients. In 2016, Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) attempted to abolish an in-force EBA with its workforce, by paying the company Programmed to become their legal employer. Programmed then attempted to force the workers onto an EBA that had been created years earlier, with different workers; with substantially lower wages. When some workers refused to sign-on to the new agreement, Programmed attempted to replace them with labour hire. CUB and Programmed's actions resulted in a consumer boycott and picketing campaign against the company that lasted six months. (see also: Carlton & United Breweries dispute)  Regulation  De jure employers in a labour hire arrangement are subject to the industrial laws that generally bind all employers. This includes any applicable Industrial awards, as well as additional laws specifically regulating the conduct of labour hire businesses. In Victoria and Queensland, labour hire businesses must obtain a license to operate from the State government.  Terminology  While labour hire is the term used in Australia and Namibia, the concept has varying terminology depending on jurisdiction. Practices analogous to labour hire in Australia have been referred to as Labor Contracting (USA), and Labour brokering (South Africa), among other names. Likewise, labour hire providers are referred to by differing names depending on country. Some terms include Employment agency (UK), professional employer organization (USA), among others.

It was a Parliamentarian victory by detachments of the New Model Army over the last Royalist field army. In the spring of 1646, King Charles I of England was getting ever more desperate to hold the Royalist cause together whilst waiting for the long promised relief forces from Ireland, Scotland and France. Sir Jacob Astley took command of the Royalist forces in the west and began to gather up the remnants from the handful of Royalist garrisons still left in the West Midlands to create a new field army. At this point in the war, Royalist morale was low. However, Astley, a stalwart of the Royalist commanders and an experienced soldier, was able to cobble together a force of 3,000. While returning to Oxford he was intercepted and defeated at Stow-on-the-Wold. Prelude The year of 1646 began badly for Charles I. On no side was there the smallest break in the gloom that surrounded him. He had no army, and there was but small chance of his being able to raise one. All his resources were exhausted. Without money, without arms, without supplies, his fate was clear. But, what was still worse, if possible, was the disunion among the Royalists: Charles' quarrel with his nephews, although patched up, might break out again at any minute. It was obvious to all, Royalists or Parliamentarians, that whatever the rights or wrongs of the struggle might originally have been, its continuance could do no good to either party, and only aggravated the prevailing discontent. Lord Astley left Oxford on 22 December 1645, to go round the different garrisons in the West Midlands, trying to raise an army. His task was a difficult one, and not the less so by his extreme want of money. Had Astley a good supply of this, he might have raised a fairly formidable force, without it he could do nothing with the drunken dissolute bands of robbers who formed the bulk of the soldiers in the Royalist garrisons. Astley arrived at Worcester early in 1646. One of his first acts was to march out to Madresfield. The Royalist garrison there had been besieged since October, by men from the Gloucester and Evesham Parliamentary garrisons, but it had held out, and Astley was now able, with a party from the Worcester garrison, to drive off the besiegers and raise the siege. Astley went from Worcester to Ludlow, intending to unite with Sir William Vaughan, but the presence of Parliamentarian troops and the floods arising from the breaking up of the great frost and the thaw made movement impossible, and prevented Astley from attempting anything. He fell back towards Bewdley. On 5 February 1646, Chester surrendered. Lord Byron had held out to the last and had to yield from want of fuel and of food. Horses, dogs, and cats had been eaten, and Byron was unable to do more. He had held the place for sixteen weeks, and there was no hope of relief. The fall of Chester was a serious blow to the Royalist cause, in that it set free a large force who would now operate upon the other Royalist garrisons. Astley, finding that it was useless to look towards Chester, set to work to collect men to go to the relief of the King at Oxford (see Siege of Oxford (1646)). But he was too late. In the Cotswolds, barring his way, was Sir Thomas Morgan, the governor of the Gloucester garrison, with a formidable force. On his right flank was John Birch, the governor of Hereford, with a force more than equal to any that Astley could bring into the field, while in his rear, pushing him onwards towards Morgan and Birch, was Sir William Brereton, his army now able to act as Chester had fallen. Astley had visited Stafford and other garrisons to collect his force. He had tried to relieve the besieged High Ercall Hall, but had failed. At last, he perceived that, if he was to join the Charles I at Oxford, the time had come to do so. Therefore, in the beginning of March, he gave orders for all the men from the different garrisons who would join him, to rendezvous at Bridgnorth; here he collected some 3,000 men. Astley was in dire need of money, so much so that he had to borrow from the corporation of Bridgnorth to pay his personal expenses there. It may be imagined to what straits the Royalists were reduced when it is said that out of these more than half were \\"reformado\\" officers, that is, officers of regiments that had either ceased to exist, from being destroyed or disbanded, or become so reduced in numbers there was no need for such officers. They formed a desperate band of broken men, who had all to gain by plunder and everything to lose by peace. Having collected his men Astley advanced from Bridgnorth to Kidderminster. Some sort of a post, probably a look-out post, to watch any movement of men, was kept at Trimpley. A skirmish took place near Kidderminster, as the registers show that Captain Charles Dungham and one of his soldiers were killed and buried. From Kidderminster, Astley marched to Worcester, where he halted for a few days, and his troubles began. He was aware that Morgan and Birch were waiting for him at Broadway, and Brereton was moving up in his rear and pressing him forward. Astley's task was a difficult one. Evesham had a Parliamentary garrison and the River Avon could not be crossed there. In the hills, on his road to Oxford, were Morgan and Birch, waiting for the first sight of his men to unite and fall on him; while still nearer Oxford, if he got past these forces, Charles Fleetwood was waiting between Stow and Oxford to intercept any Royalist attempt to relieve Astley, or to cut off any of Astley's men who got past Morgan. Astley's first move quite deceived his opponents. He sent some of his men forward towards Evesham, but with the main body he marched back to Droitwich, thus leading Brereton to think he was about to attack him. Then making across country by Feckenham and Inkberrow to Bidford and Cleve Prior, he crossed the Avon, and pushed down Buckle Street to Honeybourne, leaving Morgan at Broadway on his right, he marched past his flank to Campden, Blockley, Bourton-on-the-Hill, for Stow. Battle Battle viewpoint On 20 March, Morgan, finding that Astley had out-manoeuvred him, made a series of attacks on his rearguard, harassing and delaying their march, so as to give time for Birch to come up in front and Brereton to advance in the rear. Astley, by pushing on, had reached Donnington, a village in Gloucestershire about two miles from Stow-on-the-Wold. Astley chose a low hill just to the west of Donnington to make his last stand. Brereton having now come up, Morgan attacked the wearied Royalists in the dark, two hours before dawn, on the 21 March. Birch in front, and Morgan in the rear tried to surround the Royalists. Morgan charged Astley's rear with 200 firelocks and 400 horse. He was repulsed twice, and Astley nearly succeeded in breaking through the ring that was surrounding him. But as Astley pressed through Morgan's men in the rear, Birch pressed his charges home in the front. Still Astley showed a stubborn resistance. Birch's horse was shot under him, his regiment had 32 men killed. The Royalists fought a running retreat into the streets of Stow. In spite of all the Royalist efforts, the ring gradually tightened round Astley. At last, seeing a possible way of escape, some of the Royalists broke and fled; through their broken ranks Birch's horse rode in; there was nothing then left but to surrender. Aftermath With the surrender, and the last Royalist field army ceased to exist. Lord Astley, Sir Charles Lucas, Colonel Corbet, Colonel Gerrard, Colonel Molesworth, Lieutenant Colonel Broughton, and Major Billingsley were among the prisoners. Out of the 3,000 men Astley had with him Morgan returned 1,600 prisoners. Many were killed, more were wounded, the rest dispersed. Those who had broken through were possibly the worst off; they were overtaken, cut down and killed by Fleetwood's dragoons. All the Royalist arms and ammunition were taken. The rout was complete; Astley's force, which he had collected with so much care and manoeuvred with so much skill, was destroyed. Astley fully recognised this. Worn out by his marches, his manoeuvres and his fight, he sat down on a drum and, addressing Morgan's men, said: This was a fitting epitaph to the last major battle of the First Civil War from the man who is often quoted for his soldiers' prayer at the first major battle. So ended the last Royalist field army, because as Clarendon wrote in his history: \\"There remained from that time no possibility for the King to draw any other troops into the field\\". Charles had fought from August, 1642, to March, 1646, with the result that the Parliament only had to reduce the few strongholds that still held out for him. When this was done Parliament's military victory was completed. Legacy In St. Edward's Church, there is a monument to Sir Hastings Keyte, who was a Royalist captain killed in the battle, aged 23.

The type species is T. triassicus. This genus is notable not only due to being one of the most complete Australian Triassic reptiles known, but also due to being a very close relative of Archosauriformes. Once believed to be a proterosuchid, this taxon is now believed to have been intermediate between advanced non-archosauriform archosauromorphs such as Prolacerta, and basal archosauriforms such as Proterosuchus. Features traditionally used to define Archosauria and later Archosauriformes, such as the presence of an antorbital fenestra and serrated teeth, are now known to have evolved prior to those groups due to their presence in Tasmaniosaurus.  History and Classification  Blocks of the type specimen First named as a nomen nudum in 1974, the genus received a formal description by paleontologists Charles Lewis Camp and Maxwell Banks in 1978. These descriptions considered it a proterosuchid archosaur. A rediscription by British paleontologist Tony Thulborn in 1986 agreed with this interpretation. Since then, cladistic work has redefined the term \\"archosaur\\" to only include Avemetatarsalia (a lineage including pterosaurs and dinosaurs, such as modern birds) and Pseudosuchia (a lineage including modern crocodylians and their extinct relatives such as aetosaurs and raisuchids). As proterosuchids evolved prior to the split between these two groups, they are not considered archosaurs using this definition. In lieu of this revelation, the clade Archosauriformes is now used to encompass proterosuchids and archosaurs (as well as several other families) under one group. Archosauriformes is itself a component of Archosauromorpha, a broader clade which refers to all animals more closely related to archosaurs than to lepidosaurs, the other main group of reptiles including lizards, snakes, and tuataras. During this transition, Tasmaniosaurus remained ignored. This was rectified when the genus received a thorough redescription by Martin Ezcurra in 2014. In 2016, Ezcurra also included the genus in his comprehensive analysis of Archosauromorphs, which indicated that proterosuchidae (as it was usually defined) was an invalid polyphyletic grouping. This analysis included a phylogenetic analysis which incorporated Tasmaniosaurus and found that it was not in fact a proterosuchid. Rather, it was found to be the sister taxon of Archosauriformes, meaning that it was the closest known relative of members of that clade without technically being part of it (as it was not closer to either proterosuchids or other archosauriforms).  Description  Tasmaniosaurus is known from a single partial skeleton, UTGD (University of Tasmania School of Earth Sciences) 54655. This holotype specimen consists of various skull fragments, vertebrae, ribs, an interclavicle, and bones of the back legs. The specimen as a whole is jumbled and missing many elements, and some of the bones preserved within it have not been identified with absolute certainty. Even so, it is considered one of the most complete skeletons of any Triassic reptile unearthed in Australia. A few other bone fragments collected around Tasmania have been occasionally referred to this genus, but they are currently considered indeterminate and lost. = Skull and teeth =  Snout bones  The premaxilla (a tooth-bearing bone forming the snout tip) was initially mistaken to be very short due to crushing. However, it was later found to be proportionally similar to that of most archosauriforms. It is rounded from the front and possesses a long and tall 'maxillary process' (rear extension). By comparing the orientation of this process with the tooth row, the snout tip was determined to be only slightly projected downwards, in contrast to the drastically hooked snout of putative proterosuchids. Although only a few teeth are preserved in the right premaxilla, a count of the tooth sockets helps estimates that 6 or 7 teeth were present in each premaxilla during life. The maxilla (a tooth-bearing bone on the side of the snout) has a long tooth row and a tapering rear tip. The front tip also forms a tapering 'anterior process' which smoothly transitions into a triangular and upward- projecting 'ascending process'. This contrasts with proterosuchids, which have a less abruptly tapering anterior process, and erythrosuchids, which have a pillar-like ascending process. The shape of the upper edge of the maxilla indicates that Tasmaniosaurus had an antorbital fenestra, a hole in the side of the snout which seemingly characterizes archosauriforms. The presence of an antorbital fenestra supports the very close relation between Tasmaniosaurus and archosauriforms. As the skull bones are all preserved lying face down, it is difficult to assess whether an antorbital fossa (a depression which rings around the antorbital fenestra) was also present. The left maxilla preserves 14 teeth while the right preserves 9. An estimated 21 teeth were present in each maxilla during life. The lacrimal bone (in front of the orbit, or eye hole) is L-shaped and particularly similar to that of Proterosuchus. On the medial (inside) face, a large tuberosity (bony bump) is present where the forward and downward extensions meet. A partial pterygoid bone (a tooth- bearing part of the roof of the mouth) is preserved in the specimen, and is almost identical to that of Proterosuchus and Prolacerta. It preserves six or seven teeth, and likely represents the front part of the pterygoid. Skull roof bones of Tasmaniosaurus  Skull roof  Several bones of the skull roof were also preserved connected to each other in the holotype. Camp & Banks considered these to be frontals, parietals, an interparietal, and postfrontals, all bones of the rear of the skull. Thulborn instead interpreted them as frontals, nasals, and postorbitals, on the upper side of the snout. Most recently, Ezcurra discussed both of these interpretations and concluded that Camp & Banks were correct in their identification of the bones. The frontals are long and unfused, and possess thin \\"finger-like\\" extensions which would have connected to the nasals. Each postfrontal, which formed the upper rear edge of the orbit, is similar to that of Archosaurus but the extent of its contact with the other bones is unclear. The parietals are unfused and have wide and concave outer edges, forming the inner edge of the upper temporal fenestrae (a pair of large holes on each side of the back of the head). The back of each parietal has a long bony rod which extends backwards and curves outwards (a posterolateral process), forming an angle of about 20 degrees with the midline of the skull. A large crescent shape interparietal lies at the back of the skull roof, between the posterolateral processes of the parietals, similar to proterosuchids. Two smaller bone fragments were also found near the skull roof and may have been a supraoccipital and epipterygoid (both bones of the braincase), although such an assignment is uncertain.  Lower jaw  The dentaries (the main tooth-bearing bones of the lower jaw) are long, thin, and straight, similar to those of Prolacerta and Protorosaurus but contrasting with the robust and/or upwards-curving jaws of most basal archosauriforms. In fact, the tooth row at the very tip of the jaw slightly curves downward, forcing the first few teeth to project a bit forwards as well as upwards. The rear edge of each dentary has two tapering bony extensions, a short (but partially broken) 'posterodorsal process' on top and a much more prominent 'central posterior process' on the bottom. The dentaries are long enough that the front tip extends almost as far forward as the snout tip while the tooth row would extend almost as far back as the tooth row of the maxilla, both features unlike Prolacerta and Proterosuchus. Only 5 teeth are preserved in the left dentary, but more than 22 were likely present in life. A thick left splenial (a bone of the inside and lower edge of the lower jaw), similar to that of Proterosuchus, is also preserved.  Teeth  The teeth of Tasmaniosaurus are ankylothecodont, meaning that they are both fused to the skull and jaw bones by thin ridges (ankylodont) as well as placed in deep sockets (thecodont). They are also serrated, similar to those of archosauriforms but unlike practically every other archosauromorph. Although not all of the teeth are preserved in good condition, those that are have a curved shape and are compressed from the side, making them knife-like, similar to most carnivorous archosauromorphs. = Spine and ribs =  Vertebrae  Illustrations of various vertebrae and limb bones of Tasmaniosaurus. The Tasmaniosaurus holotype preserves 2 presacral (pre-hip) vertebrae, one probably from near the transition between the neck and back and the other probably from mid-way down the back. The cervico-dorsal (neck-back) vertebra is slightly compressed with a shallow depression each side, and does not possess an opening for the spinal cord. Both the neural arch (the portion of the vertebra typically above the spinal cord) and neural spine (a plate-like extension on the top of the vertebra) are tall. The second preserved vertebra, a dorsal, is incomplete but similar to the cervico-dorsal. A curving table- like ridge (lamina) on the side of the vertebra extends forward (as a 'prezygodiapophyseal lamina') and then dips downwards (as a 'paradiapophyseal lamina') towards the front of the vertebra. Various other archosauromorphs also have prezygodiapophyseal laminae, but they are notably lacking in Proterosuchus. On the other hand, the tip of the neural spine does not expand outwards in this vertebra, similar to the condition in Proterosuchus. A few putative intercentra (small bones wedged between the lower part of the vertebrae) have also been reported in Tasmaniosaurus. Various caudal (tail) vertebrae from different parts of the tail have been preserved, some articulating with each other. Vertebrae believed to have been at the front of the tail are more simple than the dorsal vertebrae, but seem to retain neural spines. On the other hand, vertebrae towards the rear of the tail are very simple, lacking any distinguishable neural spines, articulating plates, or laminae. There are also several haemal arches (arch-like projections from the bottom of the tail vertebrae) which expand into plate-like structures, similar to those of Proterosuchus.  Ribs and gastralia  Various ribs have been preserved in the specimen, with some being incorrectly interpreted as other bones. The most complete rib gradually curves inwards, but it is unknown whether any of the ribs are holocephalous (connecting to the vertebrae with one joint) or dichocephalous (with two joints). Gastralia (belly ribs) are present, and correspond to three different forms which broaden towards the back of the body, similar to those of Proterosuchus. = Other bones = The interclavicle of Tasmaniosaurus (A) compared to that of Prolacerta (B) and Proterosuchus (C).  Interclavicle  The only preserved portion of the front appendages in the Tasmaniosaurus holotype is the interclavicle, a large and thin bone which runs down the center of shoulder girdle. This bone is characteristic, as the front part ends in a wide, diamond-shaped structure, which smoothly transitions to the main shaft of the bone. This resembles the condition in some archosauromorphs (like Prolacerta) but contrasts with most others (including Proterosuchus), which have a \\"T-shaped\\" interclavicle with a boxy front tip that abruptly transitions to the main shaft. Nevertheless, the front tip of this structure possesses a notch which is shallower than that of Prolacerta, more similar to that of Proterosuchus. The main shaft is very long and thin, with the thinnest section right behind the front structure.  Leg and foot bones  The specimen preserves several bones of the back legs, including a poorly preserved bone which has sometimes been identified as either a fibula or a femur. On the one hand, it is seemingly thinner than the preserved tibiae, supporting its identification as a fibula. On the other hand, this quality may be due to crushing, and the fact that it is longer in length than the tibia supports its identification as a femur. The other two leg bones are more easily identifiable as both tibiae. They are more robust than those of Proterosuchus and have wide proximal (near) ends. There is a depression in the middle of the proximal end of each tibia, dividing that end into two low ridges: a cnemial crest and a ventral condyle. This is similar to the state of the tibiae of Prolacerta. Both back feet are preserved in the specimen, although jumbled and missing some bones. Each metatarsal V (the outermost main foot bone) has a hook-shaped proximal end. However, most of the other bones of the foot are difficult to evaluate. Some stout phalanges (toe bones) can be identified, as well as unguals (claws) which are dull and only slightly curved.  Paleobiology  = Brain = A latex endocast of the front part of the specimen's brain. The well-preserved skull roof of Tasmaniosaurus allowed for Ezcurra to reconstruct part of the creature's brain by means of a latex endocast. This endocast showed that the specimen's brain had large olfactory bulbs at the front, which lead into a thin olfactory tract in the middle and a somewhat wider cerebellum in the back. There are also wide and flat extensions at the front of the brain which are separated from the olfactory bulbs by a small groove. These extensions may have been the edge of additional non-brain organs (such as a Jacobson's organ) or alternatively another component of the olfactory bulbs, which would indicate that those parts of the brain were unusually large. Both of these interpretation have significant ramifications on the biology of this animal. If they are a Jacobson's organ, then the notion that such an organ was not present in archosauromorphs can be proven false. This notion was originally formed due to the fact that neither crocodilians nor birds (the two extant groups of archosauromorphs) possess such an organ. However, Ezcurra notes that both of these groups have specialized modes of life which may have caused the organ to have been lost. If they are parts of the olfactory bulbs, then Tasmaniosaurus would have had a superb sense of smell. It has been noted that aquatic animals have generally diminished olfactory capabilities compared to their terrestrial counterparts. Thus, this interpretation significantly lowers the likelihood that Tasmaniosaurus or its relatives (such as proterosuchids) were mainly aquatic. Other sources have also supported the idea that proterosuchids were terrestrial rather than aquatic or semiaquatic. = Diet = The specimen of Tasmaniosaurus also preserved a bone from another animal: a maxilla complete with teeth. This maxilla was originally interpreted as belonging to a temnospondyl amphibian. It was believed to have been a piece of gut content, the only known example of such preserved in a \\"proterosuchid\\". However, Ezcurra noted that several aspects of the specimen's preservation makes this assignment uncertain at best. In addition, he noted that the maxilla had a relatively low number of teeth compared to temnospondyls, and that it also had an ascending process which may have been the front edge of an antorbital fenestra. These factors made it much more likely that the maxilla belonged to a small archosauriform or potentially even a juvenile specimen of Tasmaniosaurus itself. Identification to any particular group is uncertain, but according to Ezcurra it is unlikely that the creature which the bone belonged to was a meal of Tasmaniosaurus. Nevertheless, the curved and serrated teeth of Tasmaniosaurus means that it is practically certain that it was a carnivore of some sort.

It has thick, rough, fissured, fibrous bark on the trunk and larger branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glaucous, sessile heart-shaped to more or less round leaves arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same green to bluish green colour on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs between February and May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical or hemispherical capsule long and wide on a pedicel up to long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus nova-anglica was first formally described in 1899 by Henry Deane and Joseph Maiden who published the description in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (nova-anglica) refers to this species' occurrence in the New England area of New South Wales.

The game begins on May 25, 2496, as the player begins their employment with TetraCorp (a large interstellar megacorporation) who have set up a new asteroid mining franchise operation in the Fragmented Sectors. There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources. Beginning with one building and one million credits, the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation to sell as much ore as possible to the Federation. Diplomacy is crucial to the success or failure of this franchise operation as the players' colonies begin to encroach on one another. The game features complex diplomacy between players and includes real-time lip-synced animations for in-game actors. Described as a combination of SimCity 2000, Civilization and Risk, Fragile Allegiance uses an icon based GUI for all menus and game commands. Unlike other RTS games, there is no defined tech tree, with technology being unlocked by the purchase of 36 blueprints at any time during the course of the game. Fragile Allegiance is the spiritual successor to K240 and there are many similarities between the two. Fragile Allegiance generally scored well with reviewers, with PC Gamer UK giving the game the Game of Distinction award and it was praised for its graphics, interface and sound. The game has problems running on Windows XP and later Windows versions, as it was designed for MS- DOS and ported to Windows 95.  Gameplay  Gameplay takes place in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to colonise and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated. The Asteroid View screen shows the currently selected asteroid's surface. Here, a player can place buildings, construct ships and missiles and also is the only screen where ore is able to be loaded onto the federal transporter for sale to the Federation. Fragile Allegiance has a simplistic combat system with the player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can be attacked using ships, missiles and agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and anti-missile turrets shoot out incoming missiles. Small ships are built in a shipyard while the larger ships require a space dock for construction. Ships range from the small Scoutship (used to discover new asteroids), to the gigantic Command Cruiser (which is used for transporting combat fleets over vast distances that they would otherwise be unable to travel without refueling). Each ship has a limited number of hardpoints to which weapons and other devices can be attached, and ships can be grouped together into fleets. There are a total of seven races in the game, but only TetraCorp (representing the human race) is playable. Upon discovering an alien race, diplomacy can be initiated in order to arrange actions such as non-aggression pacts and joint- combat treaties, as well as accuse them of spying or trading with the Mauna (Trading with the Mauna is illegal under Federation law). If a faction is found to be trading with the Mauna, Jane Fong (Federal minister for trade relations in addition to her role as Terran ambassador for the Fragmented Sectors) can be informed, who will in turn tell the Federation, which could result in increased hostility towards the offending faction from all others or, they can be threatened with blackmail and forced to pay a tribute in return for the players silence. Each race has a unique look and diplomatic strategies and everything happens in real time with highly detailed characters that are well animated and lip-synced. One of the factions‚ÄîThe Mauna‚Äîare not members of the Federation and are unable to be negotiated or traded with. As the player's empire expands, agents and supervisors will make themselves available for employment. Agents are used for gathering intelligence on alien asteroids and can also be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter- intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased if there is a spy satellite orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony Supervisors are able to be employed to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies. There is no research in the game, as this popular mechanic is replaced with the Sci-Tek blueprint system which allows players to buy new technologies as needed. Multiplayer is available over an IPX network with TetraCorp being the only playable race.  Plot  The Asteroid Field View shows the entire game map. Here, a player can see all discovered asteroids and incoming enemy fleets and missiles. The icons to the right are the games user interface. The player begins the game as the latest recruit to TetraCorps mining franchise operation and is tasked with selling as much ore as possible to the Federation, which is a coalition of six of the seven known alien cultures: the Terrans, the Artemia, the Mikotaj, the Achean Gatherings, the Braccatia and the Rigellians. The Federation was inaugurated in 2439 following a coup deposing the last Terran Emperor Dramon Salaria in 2437 and was established to encourage commercial competition rather than full-scale wars between its constituent parties. The authority of the Federation is constantly challenged ‚Äî in part by those who helped to create it, and the further away from the Federal center a person is, the less the Federation can influence their day-to-day lives. The seventh alien culture ‚Äî the Mauna are not members of the Federation and it is revealed in the game that they are an untrustworthy and cruel species. It is not known if the Mauna were consulted with prior to the creation of the Federation, and trading with the Mauna is frowned upon by the Federation. Numerous megacorporations exist within the Federation and TetraCorp is one of the largest and oldest. Their sister company is Sci-Tek, which manufactures and supplies most of the technology that the player has access to. Sci-Tek also has blueprints for advanced technologies that the player can purchase. The opening cinematic plays like a corporate recruitment video and at one point is jammed by a Terran male who tells the viewer that TetraCorp has a history of exploiting workers of all races and cultures with low pay and wretched working conditions. The movie is jammed a second time by an Artemian who tells the player that Terran progression was responsible for 68% of all alien mortalities during the past three centuries and that the reason for this high percentage is due to megacorporations such as TetraCorp.  Development  For the US market, the box art omits the dead colonist in the foreground and the nuclear fireball; other elements of the image have been rearranged. Fragile Allegiance is essentially a remake of Gremlin Interactive's 1994 Amiga game K240, with the graphics and user interface revamped for the improved PC hardware available at the time. The core gameplay elements of K240 are retained; the game is set in an asteroid belt, the Sci-Tek blueprint system replaces research and the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation. Many of the buildings, ships and missiles have the same names and functions as those in K240 and in both games there are six alien races competing against the player. The soundtrack for the game was composed by Patrick Phelan who also composed the soundtrack for K240. The game was released in 1996 and competed against other empire building titles such as Ascendancy and Master of Orion 2. Fragile Allegiance was marketed as an intense deep space real-time strategy game complete with complex face-to-face diplomacy. It was the first game to use Gremlin Interactive's facial motion capture technology which allowed for highly detailed and realistic looking alien ambassadors, giving depth and adding atmosphere to the games diplomacy. Two versions of the game were released ‚Äî a European version and a North American version, with each region having different box art. There were two different demo versions, one with audio and one without audio. A cheat code is available for the game and is entered slightly differently between the two versions. For the European version the code is \\"FRAGILE /cKim.Jon.fmsti\\", while \\"FRAGILE /c.Osiris.fmsti\\" must be entered for the North American version. These codes reward the player with decreased construction time, extra money, the ability to see all asteroids in play, the ability to change the game speed in-game and gives the player access to all of the information in the game. Historically, people reported that Fragile Allegiance did not work properly on Windows XP and later Windows platforms, as the game was designed for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95. The most common issues being reported are no audio, the game failing to start, and the game crashing when trying to rename anything, including saved games. As no patch was ever released for the game, people have had to use emulators such as VDMSound or DOSBox in order to get the game to function properly but it may still crash when trying to rename a saved game. The game is now however available for purchase from Steam and is packaged with a Dosbox build, making it compatible with Windows 7 and later versions of Windows.  Reception  Fragile Allegiance was generally well received, achieving average to good scores from reviewers. It was praised for its graphics and icon driven interface which was considered slick and well integrated but a little confusing at first. Reviewers noted that after figuring out what all the icons did the game was immensely engrossing, with the player always having something to do. The game was criticised for its difficulty, its simplistic combat model, the time spent transporting ore between asteroids, and the large amount of micromanagement involved when the player's empire got large ‚Äî although reviewers noted that the latter two could be countered by the \\"Ore Teleporter blueprint\\" and Colony Supervisors respectively. There were mixed feelings regarding the replacing of research with the Sci-Tek blueprint system, which meant that any blueprint could be bought in any order provided the player had the money to do so. The game was also criticised for only having one playable race (TetraCorp). Despite these criticisms PC Gamer UK gave it the Game of Distinction award for Christmas of 1996 stating, \\"Takes ages to work out what's going on, and immense concentration. But this is completely engrossing.\\" and awarded it a score of 91%. Users of internet gaming site GameSpot rated Fragile Allegiance significantly higher than the site reviewer, rating it 8.6/10. Gamezilla's review rated it at 75% while GameRankings gave the game a score of 65%.

The cores are designed to form the CPU part in system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs with speed ranging up to 600 MHz, thus making them ideal for embedded applications. The e200 core is developed from the MPC5xx family processors, which in turn is derived from the MPC8xx core in the PowerQUICC SoC processors. e200 adheres to the Power ISA v.2.03 as well as the previous Book E specification. All e200 core based microprocessors are named in the MPC55xx and MPC56xx/JPC56x scheme, not to be confused with the MPC52xx processors which is based on the PowerPC e300 core. In April 2007 Freescale and IPextreme opened up the e200 cores for licensing to other manufacturers. Continental AG and Freescale are developing SPACE, a tri-core e200 based processor designed for electronic brake systems in cars. STMicroelectronics and Freescale have jointly developed microcontrollers for automotive applications based on e200 in the MPC56xx/SPC56x family.  Cores  The e200 family consists of six cores, from simple low-end to complex high-end in nature. = e200z0 = The simplest core, e200z0 features an in order, four stage pipeline.

A statue of Tregonwell in the town of Bournemouth which he founded. Early life Born 1758 in Anderson, Dorset, Tregonwell lived at Cranborne Lodge as the squire. His second wife was Henrietta Portman. When Henrietta‚Äôs second child Grosvenor Tregonwell died, having been accidentally given a double dose of medicine, Henrietta sank into a melancholia, which resulted in the Tregonwells holidaying at Mudeford, near Christchurch, Hampshire, to recuperate. During their holiday they visited ‚ÄòBourne‚Äô which they found so delightful that they bought land, in 1810, built a house and so precipitated the growth of Bournemouth. More than 200 years earlier, Tregonwell‚Äôs direct ancestor, Henry Hastings, the eccentric Dorset sportsman (son of George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon), had briefly controlled the land that his great-great-great grandson bought, when he was lord of the manor of Christchurch from 1597 until 1601. Hastings‚Äô youngest daughter Dorothy married Thomas Tregonwell. Military career By 1796 Tregonwell was Captain of the Dorset Rangers and led cliff top patrols of the Dorset Yeomanry in the area of Bourne Heath between 1796 and 1802 during the Napoleonic Wars. The eastern part of Dorset was under the command of Henry Bankes of Kingston Lacy; Bankes divided his area into several smaller parcels, and allocated officers to each area. Tregonwell was matched with the easternmost region, which took him up to the Liberty of Westover (now the site of Bournemouth). The rangers‚Äô duty was to keep watch for smugglers, particularly along the cliff-tops, where Chines (wide fissures in the soft cliffs) allowed potentially easy access for smugglers and French invaders. Tregonwell was also a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Dorset. After the Battle of Trafalgar the threat of invasion by the French lessened and so in 1810 he felt that he was able to retire from the service.  Later life  = Summer Mansion = In 1810 the Tregonwells decided to build a house near Bourne Heath to live in over the summer months, their main residence was Cranborne Lodge. Tregonwell was able to buy of what is now Bournemouth town centre for just ¬£179 11s (¬£179.55) from Sir George Ivison Tapps, the Lord of the Manor of Christchurch. On 4 July 1810 Tregonwell and his wife took their friends, the Grove family, on a visit to Bourne Mouth.Diary of Harriet Grove They slept in the new house for the first time on 24 April 1812.Diary of Henrietta Tregonwell The house survives to this day as a wing of the Royal Exeter Hotel. = Portman Lodge = Tregonwell built his butler Symes his own cottage, original known as Symes' Cottage, but later renamed Portman Lodge, after Henrietta's maiden name. This building was badly damaged in a fire in 1922 and later demolished in 1930.  Legacy  In 1832 Tregonwell died at the age of 73 and was buried in Anderson, but in 1843 his widow had his remains transferred to a vault in St Peter's Churchyard at Bournemouth. For many years Tregonwell was revered as 'The Founder' (of Bournemouth) the Mayor of Bournemouth would attend an annual Founder's Service at Saint Peter's, during which he would lay a wreath on Tregonwell's tomb. When Portman Lodge was demolished in 1930 suspicions were raised that Tregonwell, or Symes at the very least, were involved in some way with smuggling. A secret chamber was found below the ground surface, with an arched roof above the floor. It was in length and in width, and was accessible through a trapdoor. The Symes clan of Cranborne, Verwood and Sixpenny Handley had long been involved in smuggling, and the butler never appeared to travel with Tregonwell, so it is possible that he looked after his master's smuggling activities while he was away. There is documentary evidence, mostly in private diaries, for instance of the Earl of Malmesbury, that the gentry colluded in smuggling activities; Tregonwell's smuggling connections, however, remain entirely speculative. Underground rooms were often used as ice-houses, as the only available form of refrigeration; it is largely wishful thinking that links such structures with smuggling. When Bournemouth was mostly heathland, it was small gravelly hollows surrounded by gorse bushes which were most likely to be used as hiding places, as contraband made a swift journey inland.

The film starred Sunil and Aarthi Aggarwal. This movie is the remake of Tamil film Sundara Purushan. Released on 11 August 2006, The film was a success at the box office. Plot Ramudu (Sunil) has tremendous love for his cousin Radha (Aarthi Aggarwal) right from his childhood. Things go wrong for him when his mother dies; his father marries another woman which he dislikes and runs away from home. He returns home (to his grandmother) after twelve years only after his father's death. He even accepts his brother (Venu Madhav) born to his step mom. Ramudu's love for Radha remains unchanged. In fact, he returns home after so long time only to win Radha's love and marry her. On the contrary, Radha loves another person, Raghu (Akash) who is an orphan and also jobless. Radha's father (Kota Srinivasa Rao) dislikes this; he lays a condition that he would agree for their marriage only if Raghu finds a job. Ignorant of the fact, but with good intention, Ramudu offers a job to Raghu. Later, he learns about the fact and gets despaired. In such a circumstance, Ramudu's brother resolves to unite his brother with Radha and eliminate Ramudu's misery. Ramudu's brother tactfully implicates Raghu in a murder and sends him to prison. Thus he plays a spoil game in averting marriage between Radha and Raghu. In such a distressed condition, Radha's father with no other option remaining pleads with Ramudu to marry Radha. Ramudu readily agrees and marries Radha. What happens when Radha learns about the fact later? Will she continue her married life with Ramudu or will she go to Raghu or anything strange happens ... The remaining part of the movie is based on these circumstances.

The software was created by Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004. Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. A large fraction of web servers use NGINX, often as a load balancer. A company of the same name was founded in 2011 to provide support and Nginx Plus paid software. In March 2019, the company was acquired by F5 Networks for $670 million. , Netcraft estimated Nginx served 36.48 percent of all active websites ranked, ranking it first, above Apache at 24.51 percent, while according to W3Techs, Apache is ranked first at 40.1 percent and Nginx second at 31.8 percent.  Popularity  According to Netcraft's November 2016 Web Server Survey, Nginx was the second-most widely used web server across all \\"active\\" sites (18 percent of surveyed sites) and for the top million busiest sites (28 percent of surveyed sites). According to W3Techs, it was used by 38 percent of the top 1 million websites, 50 percent of the top 100,000 websites, and by 57 percent of the top 10,000 websites. According to BuiltWith, it is used on 38 percent of the top 10,000 websites, and its growth within the top 10k, 100k and 1 million segments increased. A 2018 survey of Docker usage found that Nginx was the most commonly deployed technology in Docker containers. In OpenBSD version 5.2 (November 2012), Nginx became part of the OpenBSD base system, providing an alternative to the system's fork of Apache 1.3, which it was intended to replace, but later in version 5.6 (November 2014) it was removed in favor of Apache with OpenBSD's own httpd(8).  Features  Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer. Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests. Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads. Nginx default configuration file is \`nginx.conf\`. = HTTP proxy and Web server features = * Ability to handle more than 10,000 simultaneous connections with a low memory footprint (~2.5 MB per 10k inactive HTTP keep-alive connections) * Handling of static files, index files and auto-indexing * Reverse proxy with caching * Load balancing with in-band health checks * TLS/SSL with SNI and OCSP stapling support, via OpenSSL * FastCGI, SCGI, uWSGI support with caching * gRPC support since March 2018, version 1.13.10. * Name- and IP address-based virtual servers * IPv6-compatible * WebSockets since 1.3.13, including acting as a reverse proxy and do load balancing of WebSocket applications. * HTTP/1.1 Upgrade (101 Switching Protocols), HTTP/2 protocol support * URL rewriting and redirection = Mail proxy features = * TLS/SSL support * STARTTLS support * SMTP, POP3, and IMAP proxy * Requires authentication using an external HTTP server or by an authentication script Other features include upgrading executable and configuration without client connections loss, and a module-based architecture with both core and third- party module support. The paid Plus product includes additional features such as advanced load balancing and access to an expanded suite of metrics for performance monitoring.  Nginx vs Nginx Plus  There are two versions of Nginx: OSS Nginx and Nginx Plus. Nginx Plus offers additional features not included in OSS Nginx, such as active health checks, session persistence based on cookies, DNS-service-discovery integration, Cache Purging API, AppDynamic, Datalog, Dynatrace New Relic plug-ins, Active-Active HA with config sync, Key- Value Store, on-the-fly with zero downtime updates upstream configurations, and key‚Äëvalue stores using Nginx Plus API and web application firewall (WAF) dynamic module.  Nginx vs Apache  Nginx was written with an explicit goal of outperforming the Apache web server. Out of the box, serving static files, Nginx uses much less memory than Apache, and can handle roughly four times as many requests per second. However, this performance boost comes at a cost of decreased flexibility, such as the ability to override systemwide access settings on a per-file basis (Apache accomplishes this with an .htaccess file, while Nginx has no such feature built in). Nginx also has a reputation of being harder to install and configure than Apache. Formerly, adding third- party modules to Nginx required recompiling the application from source with the modules statically linked. This was partially overcome in version 1.9.11 in February 2016, with the addition of dynamic module loading. However, the modules still must be compiled at the same time as Nginx, and not all modules are compatible with this system; some require the older static linking process. Nginx is generally considered to be less stable on Windows Server than it is on Linux, while Apache has equal support for both.  Nginx Unit  Nginx Unit is an open-source web application server, released in 2017 by NGINX, Inc. to target multi-language microservices-based applications. The initial release supported applications written in Go, PHP, and Python. By version 1.11.0, the support was extended to Java, Node.js, Perl, and Ruby applications; other features include dynamic configuration, request routing, and load balancing.  History  Igor Sysoev began development of Nginx in 2002. Originally, Nginx was developed to solve the C10k problem, and to fill the needs of multiple websites including the Rambler search engine and portal, for which it was serving 500 million requests per day by September 2008. Nginx Inc. was founded in July 2011 by Sysoev and Maxim Konovalov to provide commercial products and support for the software. The company's principal place of business is San Francisco, California, while legally incorporated in British Virgin Islands. In October 2011, Nginx, Inc. raised $3 million from BV Capital, Runa Capital, and MSD Capital, Michael Dell's venture fund. The company announced commercial support options for companies using Nginx in production. Nginx offered commercial support in February 2012, and paid Nginx Plus subscription in August 2013.Support packages focus on installation, configuration, performance improvement, etc. Support includes proactive notifications about major changes, security patches, updates and patches. Nginx, Inc. also offers consulting services to assist customers in custom configuration or adding additional features. In October 2013, Nginx, Inc. raised a $10 million series B investment round led by New Enterprise Associates. That round included previous investors, as well as Aaron Levie, CEO and founder of Box.com. In December 2014, Nginx raised a $20 million series B1 round led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from e.ventures (formerly BV Capital), Runa Capital, Index Ventures and Nginx's own CEO Gus Robertson. In September 2017, Nginx announced an API management tool, NGINX Controller, which would build off of their API Gateway, NGINX Plus. In October 2017, Nginx, Inc. announced general available Nginx Amplify SaaS providing monitoring and analytics capabilities for Nginx. In June 2018, Nginx, Inc. raised $43 million in Series C Funding in a round led by Goldman Sachs \\"to Accelerate Application Modernization and Digital Transformation for Enterprises\\". On 11 March 2019, F5 Networks acquired Nginx, Inc. for US$670 million. On 12 December 2019, it was reported that the Moscow offices of Nginx Inc. had been raided by police, and that Sysoev and Konovalov had been detained. The raid was conducted under a search warrant connected to a copyright claim over Nginx by Rambler‚Äîwhich asserts that it owns all rights to the code because it was written while he was an employee of the company. On 16 December 2019, Russian state lender Sberbank, which owns 46.5 percent of Rambler, called an extraordinary meeting of Rambler's board of directors asking Rambler's management team to request Russian law enforcement agencies cease pursuit of the criminal case, and begin talks with Nginx and with F5.

It is in the Asia themed land, the Kingdom of Anandapur. It shares this area with the Kali River Rapids white water raft ride and the Expedition Everest runaway train rollercoaster. Story The trail is themed as if it had once been the hunting grounds for a wealthy maharajah who enclosed the forest to allow for easier hunting and then some time later died in a hunting accident. The themed storyline continues with subsequent maharajahs (including the original maharajah's bachelor brother) transforming the area into a nature preserve where the villagers live in harmony with the animals therein. These maharajahs are memorialized on the walls of the tiger enclosure. The forest was, at one point, also run by imperial British visitors, as evidenced in the Western spelling on the sign at the entrance to the Jungle Trek, which reads \\"Royal Anandapoor Forest\\". The Asian animals include tigers, Komodo dragons, Eld's deer, tapirs, flying foxes, water buffaloes, gibbons, and various Asian birds. When their occupation of southern Asia ended, the British turned the forest over to the villagers of Anandapur, whom you encounter as you walk through the jungle. The trail's storyline also includes an homage to the founder of the Kingdom of Anandapur, Anantah, in the form of a tomb and sarcophagus situated at the entrance to the Jungle Trek's aviary.

This gives an easy definition within the lattice of the recursively enumerable sets. Maximal sets have many interesting properties: they are simple, hypersimple, hyperhypersimple and r-maximal; the latter property says that every recursive set R contains either only finitely many elements of the complement of A or almost all elements of the complement of A. There are r-maximal sets that are not maximal; some of them do even not have maximal supersets. Myhill (1956) asked whether maximal sets exist and Friedberg (1958) constructed one. Soare (1974) showed that the maximal sets form an orbit with respect to automorphism of the recursively enumerable sets under inclusion (modulo finite sets). On the one hand, every automorphism maps a maximal set A to another maximal set B; on the other hand, for every two maximal sets A, B there is an automorphism of the recursively enumerable sets such that A is mapped to B.

History The road is mainly newly constructed, being built to regenerate the former coal-mining areas of Barnsley in the late 1990s. It has many at- grade roundabouts, and no grade-separated junctions. It is not so much a through-route, but for local access. A lot of the road, often at junctions, looks half-finished. Most of it looks like a spine access road on a typical industrial estate. The area was given Enterprise Zone status in the mid-1990s. =Construction= The Dearne Towns Link Road (the dual-carriageway section) was officially opened on Monday 12 October 1998 by Richard Caborn, Minister for the Environment. It was built by AMEC Civil Engineering Ltd and VHE. It cost ¬£30m. The route was planned by Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council. Work started on the Little Houghton and Grimethorpe section in mid-2002. The A628 Shafton bypass opened on 30 October 2003.Shafton bypass Route =Dual-carriageway= Near Jump and Blacker in September 2007 This section is known as the Dearne Link or the Dearne Towns Link Road.VHE Construction The dual-carriageway section consisted of Stage 1 and Stage 2A/B.

The road is not a trunk road. After around barely 300 metres there is the Rockingham Roundabout near Birdwell, with one newly constructed exit; blossoming industry (economic redevelopment) is hoped to find its way to South Yorkshire one day; there is the KFC Rockingham. Near Upper Hoyland, to the east, there is the Shortwood Roundabout (Shortwood Business Park). At Platts Common, there is the Platts Common Roundabout for the B6096, and Euramax Solutions (uPVC windows). At Roebuck Hill, it crosses the former Hoyland- Wombwell road (B6096) with two closely situated roundabouts; the (second) Roebuck Hill Roundabout gives access to Jump, South Yorkshire. This section to the east bypasses Wombwell, to the south. It crosses the railway, and the Hemingfield Road Roundabout gives access to Wombwell railway station, to the north, and Hemingfield, to the south. Near Brampton (Rotherham), there is the Cortonwood Roundabout for the Cortonwood Retail Park (a Morrisons, in Rotherham borough), where it crosses the Barnsley Boundary Walk next to the Elsecar Canal and runs alongside the Rotherham boundary and the Trans Pennine Trail.

Recruits were taken from the Pauperes Lugdunenses (the original name of the Waldensians); the distinguishing name was given by Pope Innocent III. Background The background was the growth of the Albigensians in Provence. Innocent III complains bitterly, in a letter to the bishops, saying that the people are hungry for the Bread of Life, but that there is no one to break it for them. Public preaching, exclusively in the hands of the bishops, had become a rare event. Having thus far failed in its attempts to suppress the heresy, on account of the inadequate methods of its missionaries, the Catholic Church now adopted a new method, preaching the word of God and leading a life of resignation and evangelical poverty. Through the missionary activities of Bishop Diego of Osma and St. Dominic, a small group of Waldenses, under the leadership of Duran of Huesca (Spain), was won back to the Catholic Church during a religious discussion at a meeting held at Pamiers (France) towards the end of 1207. History Innocent III gave them, initially seven in number, a constitution by which they could retain their former rule of life. Aside from this they had to make a profession of faith. It represented the doctrine of the Church relative to all current heresies, and was intended, not only to free their minds from all heretical tendencies and subject them to the authority of the Church, but also to offer them a guide according to which they could enter upon missionary activities with a series of formulated truths giving them a clear outline of their faith and absolute certainty in their work. After having promised allegiance to the pope and the doctrines of the Church, they entered upon their mission in the beginning of 1208. They were active, not only through Southern France, but as far as Milan where they founded a school in 1209 to gather and educate recruits for their order. Three years later, 1212, a group of penitents placed themselves under their spiritual direction. Within four years of their foundation they extended their activities over the Dioceses of B√©ziers, Uz√®s, N√Æmes, Carcassonne, Narbonne, Taragon, Marseilles, Barcelona, Huesca, and Milan. After 1212 they began to disintegrate. Innocent III stood by them for four years, making concession after concession, repeatedly urging the bishops to support them, recommending them to the King of Taragon; he exempted them from taking the oath of allegiance, as this was contrary to the teachings of the Waldenses, and finally placed them under the protectorate of St. Peter. They did not show positive results and, for this reason, the pope abandoned them in 1212 and gave his attention to the Preaching Friars of St. Dominic and the Friars Minor of St. Francis of Assisi. In 1237 Pope Gregory IX requested the provincial of the Preaching Friars to visit the provinces of Narbonne and Taragon and compel the Poor Catholics to adopt one of the approved rules. In Milan we find them until 1256 when, by a Decree of Pope Innocent IV, they were united with the Augustinian Hermits. Organization The whole enterprise was looked upon as an innovation contrary to established rights and privileges of the clergy. Laymen, although they had received the tonsure and were regarded as clerics, publicly preached the doctrine of the Church, under the protection of the supreme pontiff himself. The only means of support were the daily offerings of the faithful. It was thought that, by giving the Poor Catholics this organization, the Waldenses could be won back easily to the Church. Their chief occupation remained, as it was before their reconciliation, the preaching of the word of God directed against the heretics. Innocent III placed himself as sole director at the head of the organization, thus replacing the majoralis, leader of the Waldenses. He gave them the name of \\"Pauperes Catholici\\", to show that they practised poverty in common with the \\"Pauperes Lugdunenses\\" but were separated from them in enjoying the benefits and sympathy of the Church. The division into \\"perfecti\\" and \\"credentes\\" remained the same, only the names were changed into \\"fratres\\" and \\"amici\\". In their activity the Waldenses were divided into three classes: the \\"sandaliati\\", who had received sacred orders and the especial office to confute the heresiarchs; the \\"doctores\\", who had charge of the instructing and training of the missionaries; and the \\"novellani\\"\\", whose chief work consisted in preaching to the common people. The work of the Poor Catholics had the same division; however, the names \\"sandaliati\\", \\"doctores\\", and \\"novellani\\" were changed into \\"doctiores\\", \\"honestiores\\", and \\"idonei\\". The habit, a light gray, remained unchanged except the buckles on the sandals, by which the Waldenses were known as heretics. Manual labour was forbidden as before. Reconciled Lombards Peter Waldes had not confined his teaching to Lyons. When he was expelled from that city, he decided to go to Rome and make a personal plea for his cause to the pope. Going through Lombardy, he propagated his ideas. The lay people readily accepted his views on religion and formed a religious body known by the name of Humiliates (humiliati). Some of them appeared in Rome with him the following year, 1179, and asked Pope Alexander III to sanction their rule or form of life, which consisted in leading a religious life in their separate homes, abstaining from the oath, and defending the Catholic doctrine by public preaching. The pope granted them permission to lead a religious life in their homes, but forbade them to preach. Continuing their former life, they were excommunicated by Pope Lucius III about the year 1184. In this state they remained until 1201, when, upon presentation of their constitution, Innocent III reconciled them with the Church, and reorganized them in conformity with their economic and religious customs, also approving of the name \\"Humiliati\\". This brought most of them back to the Church; but a number persevered in the heresy and continued their former life under the direction of the Poor of Lyons. Economic and religious difficulties, however, aggravated long-felt dissensions between the two groups and, in 1205, these non-reconciled Humiliates separated from the Lyonese and formed a distinct group, adopting the name of Poor Lombards, \\"Pauperes Lombardi\\". In order to bring the Poor Lombards back to the Church, Innocent III founded and organized in 1210 the order of the Reconciled Lombards, under the immediate supervision of the supreme pontiff. The recruits were taken from the ranks of the Poor Lombards. Their first superior was Bernard Primus, a former Lombard leader, who, with a few followers, had given the impetus for the foundation of the order by presenting a rule of life to the pope. The Lombards and the Humiliates gave manual labour the first place. Every member, irrespective of position or talent, had to learn a trade in order to make his living. This predominance of manual labour we also find a deciding factor in the reorganization of the Reconciled Lombards. Two years later, however, Innocent III gave them a new constitution, in which he retained manual labour for all the members of the order, but declared it only of secondary value for the missionaries or friars to whom he assigned the study of Holy Scripture and preaching as main occupation. He also makes a more definite division of the members into three classes, or orders, comprising respectively the missionaries or friars, the women who took the vows, and the married people. The object of this second constitution was to bring order into the chaos of social and religious agitation among the different classes of members and, at the same time, to bring the better elements to the front to train them for missionary work against the Cathari. The Reconciled Lombards, like the Poor Catholics, did not meet with the expectations of the Roman Curia.

Research Patterson has made more than 300 scholarly contributions, including over 180 peer-reviewed journal publications and book chapters. Patterson is also an international lecturer and media commentator, primarily contributing to increasing public awareness of environmental issues. He co- founded and served as Executive Editor (1997-2000) of Palaeontologia Electronica (PE).

He also previously served as Associate Editor for the Journal of Foraminiferal Research (1995-2008), and the journal Micropaleontology (1990-1997). Patterson works on a wide array of research subjects, most of which are based on analysis of marine and lake sediments to reconstruct past environments. He uses many techniques to understand the history of marine and lake environments from the perspective of: 1) the influence of climate variability on aquatic ecosystem services (AES); 2) the impact of degradation resulting from human activities on AES, and 3) the degree to which remediation and mitigation efforts are successful in improving AES. He has developed technologies that permit extraction of very high- resolution paleoenvironmental records, and uses time series analysis techniques to recognize trends and cycles in the climate record. Other research focuses on assessing the impact of nutrient loading and road salt contamination on lake environments. He is also engaged in research on tracking the influence of climate change on metal transport in northern lakes and has partnered with indigenous peoples of the Northwest Territories to develop research tools to calibrate western scientific reconstructions of past climate against the oral histories that are provided by First Nations communities. In June 2007 he authored a general interest article in the Financial Post (the business section of the National Post, a major Canadian newspaper) predicting general climatic cooling as the sun enters Solar cycle 25 about 2018. He based his prediction on the close correlation between solar and climate cycles in his high resolution analysis of late Holocene cores deposited under anoxic conditions within deep Western Canadian fjords. Solar cycle 25 will be as weak as solar cycles in the early 19th century during a very cold phase of the Little Ice Age. At this time drought and short growing seasons would have made present day agricultural practices used in areas like the grain growing region of western Canada impossible. In a November 2015 address to the Canadian International Council (CIC) \\"Climate Change: Ottawa, and the Provinces are Going to Paris\\" he stated that in addition to concerns over the long-term impact of global warming it would be prudent for Canadian policy makers and planners to be made aware that \\"climatic cooling associated with Solar Cycle 25 and a corresponding trough in the Gleissberg Cycle may negatively impact the Canadian agricultural sector. During any climatic warming agricultural methods used to the south can be immediately adapted. However, cooling such as may occur beginning about 2018 would be an agricultural and national disaster as no one is farming north of us.\\" A similar approach based on generic geochemical data and astrophysical deliberations was published by Jan Veizer and Nir J. Shaviv in GSA Today, describing a reduced (capped) influence of carbon dioxide to Climate Change and attributing a more significant influence to cosmic rays. While the mechanism seems not yet to be fully understood, the empirical data showed a suitable fit. The results, not the thesis are in line with the minimal level of the consented temperature predictions of the IPCC.  Select publications  *Patterson, R.T., Swindles, G.T., 2015.

The Station supports 19 federally listed threatened species, including the Sand Skink (Neoseps reynoldsi) and 13 endemic plant species. It is a venue for field research and education. The station and grounds are open to visitors, who must register at the main office. There are some displays about the property and its history, a video about the biodiversity and conservation of the Lake Wales Ridge, a 1/2 mile nature trail and picnic tables. Nature and environmental education programs are offered for schools, adults and specialty groups. On July 20, 2007, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Archbold acquired the initial land for the biological research station through his friend Donald Roebling from his father, John A. Roebling II. Subsequently, additional land was purchased. Climate The climate of Archbold Biological Station is classified as humid subtropical (K√∂ppen Cwa), with hot, humid summers and warm, dry winters. Due to its location on the well-drained sandy soil of the Lake Wales Ridge, the station experiences unusually low minimum temps, especially during summer.

Both creations are extant as of 2008. The Cave Baronetcy, of Stanford Hall, Leicestershire, was created in the Baronetage of England on 30 June 1641. For more information on this creation, see Cave-Browne-Cave baronets. The Cave Baronetcy, of Cleve Hill, in the parish of Mangotsfield, in the County of Gloucester, of Sidbury Manor, in the parish of Sidbury, in the County of Devon, and of Stoneleigh House, in the parish of Clifton, in the City and County of Bristol, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 21 July 1896 for the banker Charles Cave. He was a descendant of General Sir Richard Cave, who was killed at the Battle of Naseby during the Civil War. The first Baronet's great-grandfather, John Cave (1736‚Äì1800), was the founder of the Cave bank of Bristol. As of 2018 the title is held by the first Baronet's great-great-great-grandson (the baronetcy having succeeded from father to son), the sixth Baronet, who succeeded in 2018.

Origin  It was created on 30 June 1641 for Thomas Cave, a Royalist who fought in the English Civil War. Granted lands in South and North Cave in Yorkshire by William the Conqueror, by the fifteenth century the Caves had moved to Stanford on the boundary of Northamptonshire and Leicestershire to become \\"a wealthy and powerful clan, foremost among the new men of the age, the nouveaux riches, the shrewd, rapacious, grasping gentry raised up by the Tudor dynasty\\".Barbara Winchester, Tudor Family Portrait, Jonathan Cape, London, 1955, p. 25 Sir Thomas's aunt Eleanor was married to the diplomat Sir Thomas Roe; his great-grandmother, Margaret, was a sister of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's Lord High Treasurer; and her husband Roger's uncle Sir Ambrose Cave was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster under Elizabeth. Roger Cave and Margaret had several daughters including Elizabeth who married Walter Bagot of Blithfield Hall in Staffordshire, their son Hervey Bagot being created a baronet by King Charles I; Margaret (1565-1594) who married William Skipwith; and Dorothy who married Thomas Hartopp of Freeby in Leicestershire.  Descendants  Sir Thomas Cave's son, the second Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Coventry. His son, the third Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Leicestershire. He married the Hon. Margaret, daughter of John Verney, 1st Viscount Fermanagh, and a descendant of Edmund Braye, 1st Baron Braye. Their elder son, the fourth Baronet, died unmarried in 1734 and the baronetcy devolved on his younger brother, who also sat as Member of Parliament for Leicestershire. His elder son, the sixth Baronet, was a Fellow of the Royal Society and High Sheriff of Leicestershire. His son, the seventh Baronet, sat briefly as Member of Parliament for Leicestershire but died childless at an early age. His sister Sarah Otway, the sixth Baronet's only daughter, then inherited the family seat of Stanford Hall, Leicestershire, and in 1839 became the third Baroness Braye when the abeyance of the barony of Braye was terminated in her favour (see the Baron Braye for further history of this branch of the family). The seventh Baronet was succeeded by his uncle, the eighth Baronet. He was an unmarried clergyman and on his death in 1810 the line of the third Baronet failed. The late Baronet was succeeded by his second cousin, William Cave-Browne, the ninth Baronet. He was the son of John Cave- Browne (who in 1752 had assumed the additional surname of Browne by Act of Parliament), son of Roger Cave, eldest son of the second marriage of the second Baronet, by his wife Catherine, daughter of William Browne of Stretton en le Field in Derbyshire. In 1839 the ninth Baronet's assumption of the additional surname of Cave was confirmed by royal licence. He was succeeded by his son, the tenth Baronet. He was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1844. His son, the eleventh Baronet, was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Derbyshire. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the twelfth Baronet. He was initially a soldier and fought in the Boxer Rebellion and First World War, but was later ordained. He died childless and was succeeded by his first cousin, the eldest surviving son of the thirteen children of Ambrose Syned Cave-Browne-Cave, younger son of the tenth Baronet.

They made a significant contribution toward establishing comedy as the predominant genre of Malayalam cinema. Bahadoor also appeared in some serious roles and in professional plays. His last film was Joker which was released shortly after his death. Early life Bahadoor was born as P. K. Kunjalu in 1930 in Kodungalloor, near Thrissur in Kingdom of Cochin (present day Kerala, India). As one of the nine children of Padiyath Blangachalil Kochumoideen and Khadeeja. Out of his eight siblings, seven were sisters. His family was financially poor and the seven young women added to the burden as the Kerala social system openly supported dowry at that time. He had affinity towards plays from very young age itself. He passed 10th Standard with First Class and joined Farook College, Calicut for Intermediate. He could not complete his studies due to financial troubles and had to start working for a living. He found his first job in a private bus as the bus conductor. He still wished to be an actor. He met Thikkurussi Sukumaran Nair through a relative. Thikkurussi gave him the chance to act in films and renamed him Bahadoor. Family He was married to Jameela. The couple have three children, Siddhiq, Muhammed and Rukiya. Career Bahadoor made his debut with a minor role in Avakasi (1954).http://www.veethi.com/india- people/bahadoor-profile-4189-14.htm At that time he also acted in Akashavani and amateur-professional plays and got established as a good actor. Bahadoor got his first break with his role as Chakkaravakkan in Neela Production's Padatha Painkili. The film, which went on to become a big hit, marked Bahadoor's presence in the industry. He along with Adoor Bhasi formed a box office ruling combination and the duo is being compared to Laurel and Hardy. Bahadoor became the hero in Neelisali and Mucheettu Kalikkarante Makal. Bahadoor found time for acting in plays as well. He partnered a play production theatre which made blockbuster plays like Manikyakkottaram and Ballatha Pahayan. These plays were later made into feature films by him. In his entire career he appeared in a Tamil film Sathya starring Kamal Haasan, which was his only appearance in a non-Malayalam film to date, he played a supporting role as the father of Haasan's character. Bahadoor started a black and white processing studio in Trivandrum named K. C. Lab. But the studio's establishment was ill-timed as films were shifting to colour. This caused financial troubles for Bahadoor and finally the studio was taken over by people to whom Bahadoor was indebted. Bahdoor also started a film distribution company only to face failures. He produced few films all of which failed at the box office. Even with his commercial debacles from the industry, he could meet his family's monetary requirements and mark his presence in the field of acting. Bahadoor was last seen in Lohithadas's Joker. He did the role of a mentally ill veteran joker in a circus camp. In the film, he commits suicide by letting himself into the lion's cage in the circus den.

A descriptive atlas of the eucalypts of Australia and the adjoining islands\\" (1879) Eucalyptus pleurocarpa foliagejuvenile specimen in Maranoa Gardens Eucalyptus pleurocarpa, commonly known as tallerack, talyerock or tallerack is a species of mallee that is endemic to the southwest of Western Australia. It has smooth bark, broadly lance-shaped to elliptical, grey or glaucous leaves that are arranged more or less in opposite pairs, flower buds in groups of seven, whitish flowers and glaucous, barrel-shaped fruit. It is easily recognised in the field by its form, large, white, waxy leaves and, when in flower, its stamens clustered in four groups. Description Eucalyptus pleurocarpa is a mallee that typically grows to high, wide and forms a lignotuber and has smooth bark. It has a spreading to erect, straggly habit with many thin stems with smooth, greyish bark. The foliage is thick, leathery and waxy with a bluish grey colour and the flower buds, fruit and stems are white and waxy. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section with a wing on each corner, egg-shaped to oblong or elliptical to heart- shaped, long and wide, petiolate and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are very similar to the juvenile leaves, arranged more or less in opposite pairs, the same dull greyish green on both sides, broadly lance-shaped to egg- shaped or elliptical, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on a flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a four-sided floral cup, a rounded operculum and the stamens in four clusters. Flowering occurs from January to April or from October to December and the flowers are whitish. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped to cubic, four-angled capsule long and wide.Brooker, I. & Kleinig, D., Eucalyptus, An illustrated guide to identification, Reed Books, Melbourne, 1996 Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus pleurocarpa was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Lehmann's book, Plantae Preissianae from specimens collected near Cape Riche. In 1867 George Bentham mentioned it as a synonym of Eucalyptus √ó tetragona, previously described by Ferdinand von Mueller, based on Robert Brown's Eudesmia tetragona. Eucalyptus pleurocarpa has been regarded as a synonym of E. tetragona including in the Flora of Australia in 1988. The specific epithet (pleurocarpa) is from ancient Greek meaning \\"a rib\\" and \\"-fruited\\". The type specimen for the subgenus Eudesmia is also the type specimen for E. tetragona but because that type is intermediate between the glaucous E. pleurocarpa and the non-glaucous E. extrica, and because the name E. pleurocarpa was published before E. tetragona, the name Eucalyptus tetragona is no longer accepted at the Australian Plant Census. The Noongar names for the species are talyerock or tallerack. The species name for the plant pleurocarpa is from the Greek words pleura meaning rib and carpos meaning fruit - because of the ribbed fruits. The species belongs to the sub- genus Eudesmia which all have the stamens in four bundles each at the corner of the square-shaped flower. The sub-group also includes E. erythrocorys Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus pleurocarpa is found at two different locations on the undulating sandplains of south-western Western Australia from Eneabba in the Wheatbelt region in the north and between Albany and Esperance in the Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions to the south. It grows in grey to white sandy soils, often also containing gravel. It is emergent and conspicuous in shrubby heath-land communities. Associated eucalypt species include E. decipiens, E. falcata, E. hebetifolia, E. incrassata, E. thamnoides, E. uncinata and E. wandoo. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Like most mallees, the species is well suited to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is sold commercially as an ornamental plant and the flowers and foliage are used as cut flowers. It is drought tolerant but is susceptible to frost and can grow in a range of soils in a full sun position.

He worked with the London Corresponding Society and the Society for Constitutional Information and also wrote an influential letter, A Convention the Only Means of Saving Us from Ruin. He was arrested for his radical views and convicted of sedition in 1794. Subsequently, he was deported to Sydney, where he died from tuberculosis in 1796.  Early and family life  Gerrald was born in St. Kitts, West Indies to Joseph Gerrald, a wealthy Irish planter, and Ann Rogers. In 1765, Gerrald and his family moved to London, where he attended a boarding school in Hammersmith until he was 11. Gerrald's mother died when he was very young ‚Äì shortly after his family moved to England, and his father died when he was just 12 years old. After his father died in 1775, Gerrald was sent to study at Stanmore school under Dr. Samuel Parr. While at Stanmore, Gerrald performed very well in several subjects, such as Greek, Latin, and art, and became very close with Parr. Despite these successes, Parr needed to expel Gerrald because of 'extreme indiscretion'. In 1780, Gerrald moved back to the West Indies to tend to matters of the family fortune. Unfortunately, his father had been lavishly spending and had reduced the family estate considerably. During his stay, he brashly married a woman and they had a son and daughter together. Gerrald's wife died soon after the birth of the second child and he was left to raise two young children without much money. He then decided to move to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he was a lawyer for several years. In 1785, he was listed in the muster roll for the City of Philadelphia, in the 3rd company 6th battalion of the Philadelphia militia.Pennsylvania Archives. Samuel Hazard, John Blair Linn, et al. (eds), Pennsylvania Archives. J. Severns & Company, 1907, p. 1175. Accessed 6 December 2015. Gerrald returned to London in 1788, but in 1789 he moved to Bath due to his declining health.Davis, Michael T. Gerrald, Joseph (1763‚Äì1796). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Online ed. Ed. Lawrence Goldman. Oxford: OUP, 2004. Accessed 22 Nov. 2015.  Political reformer  After Gerrald's return to England, he began writing anonymous letters about politics and joined the Society for Constitutional Information and the more radical London Corresponding Society. He became popular among radical reform groups due to his eloquence and pleasant demeanor. These groups were under continuous observation by royal authorities due to their promulgation of radical ideas; these ideas, in conjunction with eruption of war all over Europe during the 1790s, raised fears of a similar revolution in Britain. Gerrald was mostly concerned with parliamentary reform and was a large proponent of a national convention, alongside Thomas Paine. The convention would be democratically elected and would focus on sorting out the laws of England. Gerrald drew his ideas from the successful precedent of the Saxons' Convention, and outlined his plans in his pamphlet, A Convention the Only Means of Saving Us from Ruin (1793).Parssinen, T. M.. ‚ÄúAssociation, Convention and Anti-parliament in British Radical Politics, 1771-1848‚Äù. The English Historical Review 88.348 (1973): 504‚Äì533. = A Convention the Only Means of Saving Us from Ruin = Gerrald sets the tone of the letter by discussing how legislators and the government may be offended by the criticisms he presents, but states that the government exists to represent the people and should learn from their suggestions. He draws on the trajectories and repercussions of the wars of the 18th century, including the American Revolution, to form his argument that the British should not have engaged in the current war, which Prime Minister William Pitt was carrying through. Throughout this pamphlet, Gerrald addresses the people of England on the need for common folk to be involved in politics. He believed that this was important because of the eruption of war between England and France, caused by the majority British opposition to French Revolution. He argues that even though the government declares war, it is made possible only because of the contributions of others ‚Äì in the form of taxes and soldiers ‚Äì and thus that people are morally obliged to understand and justify the wars. On this front, Gerrald uses the young United States, an example showing that there exists a country that doesn't go to war unless its citizens decide to. Gerrald also found civic involvement necessary because the wars themselves were not constructive. He suggests that negotiations could have made a larger impact on the people because the outcomes of the wars left civilians in a worse state than they had started with. In addition, he refers to the Society of the Friends of the People's report that many current representatives are self-elected or are tools for the aristocracy, and that the current system favors neither wealth nor population size. To overcome these issues, Gerrald suggests a plan where people can elect representatives who will follow instructions set by the general body.Gerrald, Joseph. A convention the only means of saving us from ruin. In a letter, addressed to the people of England, by Joseph Gerrald. The second edition. London, MDCCXCIV. [1794]. Eighteenth Century Collections Online. Gale. Carnegie Mellon University Libraries. 30 Nov. 2015  Plans for the convention  The convention will have 250 deputies from England and 125 from Scotland and these 375 men will speak out for the welfare of both England and Scotland. Any male can be elected to the convention unless a jury has found him to be a criminal, idiot, or lunatic. In order to determine the deputies in the convention, there will first be a primary assembly for each parish, 1250 in total. In this assembly, any males that are 21 and over and not deemed a criminal, lunatic, or idiot can vote. The members of the parish will vote for ten members to form a second assembly composed of the elected individuals from ten parishes. Each second assembly will then choose two deputies for the national convention. This process results in every deputy representing 5000 males each. Gerrald argues that because the deputies are elected with the specific purpose of speaking for their constituents, the people will have more political liberty while politics will have less corruption. He also states that war will be eliminated, as people will now have a voice in the declaration of it. = London Corresponding Society = On October 24, 1793, Gerrald and Maurice Margarot were chosen as delegates for a convention of reformers, the British Convention of the Delegates of the People, in Edinburgh. While attending, Gerrald took a trip to the Scottish countryside to publicize the reform movement. This convention was considered incendiary because of its goals of universal suffrage and annual parliaments and Gerrald's participation in the convention is what led to his arrest.  Arrest and conviction  The aims of the British Convention were moderate, but Gerrald and others were arrested and in March 1794 he was tried for sedition. It was felt that the case was prejudiced, and while out on bail Gerrald had been urged to escape by his friends such as Dr. Parr, but he considered that his honour was pledged. At his trial in Edinburgh he made an admirable speech in defence of his actions but was condemned to 14 years transportation. The apparent courtesy and consideration with which the trial was conducted could not conceal the real prejudice which ruled the proceedings. Throughout the trial, Gilbert Wakefield provided Gerrald with moral support.Gerrald, Joseph, and Porcia. ‚ÄúLetter from Joseph Gerrald to Gilbert Wakefield‚Äù. The Belfast Monthly Magazine9.52 (1812): 372‚Äì374. Web... Gerrald was imprisoned in London until May 1795, when he was hurried on board the storeship about to sail for Sydney. He arrived there on 5 November 1795. He was then in a poor state of health suffering from tuberculosis and was allowed to buy a small house and garden in which he lived. He died on 16 March 1796.John Earnshaw, 'Gerrald, Joseph (1760‚Äì1796)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gerrald- joseph-2089/text2625, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 10 December 2015.  Legacy  Gerrald was a man sustained by his belief in the rights of mankind. In the account of his death David Collins speaks of his \\"strong enlightened mind\\" and that he went to his death \\"glorying in being a martyr to the cause which he termed that of Freedom and considering as an honour that exile which brought him to an untimely grave\\".Collins, D., King, P.

Johnson (March 18, 1927 ‚Äì January 20, 2006) was an outdoor writer from Wisconsin. His career included nature writing, investigative reporting on environmental issues, and traditional outdoor writing about hunting, fishing, and related pursuits.  Early life  Born March 18, 1927, Johnson grew up in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, but spent much of his boyhood on family farms in Dodge and Buffalo counties, hunting and fishing. He graduated from Nathan Hale High School in West Allis, then served with the U.S. Navy in combat forces in the South Pacific during World War II. In 1949, he married Lorraine Senn. The couple had a son, Douglas, and a daughter, Lynn. He attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where he studied conservation and journalism and where he met Aldo Leopold. After graduating, he worked for several newspapers in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Career  In 1962, Johnson joined The Milwaukee Sentinel as the newspaper's outdoor writer, a post he held until 1984. During those years, Johnson reported on hunting, fishing, and wildlife throughout Wisconsin. He also reported on conservation issues, including an expos√© of mercury pollution in the Wisconsin River and a series on pesticide pollution. In 1966, Johnson wrote a series of investigative reports about high concentrations of DDT in state waters. Despite threats of lawsuits and demands by chemical companies that he be fired, Johnson kept pursuing environmental stories. The series played a key role in making Wisconsin the first state to ban DDT, which ultimately led to a national ban.Don L. Johnson. \\"Finally, the DDT Story\\", Dunn County News, September 17, 2000. In another series, Johnson challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as it tried to ditch and drain the Cache River bottomlands in Arkansas, for which he received an award from the Arkansas Wildlife Federation. Johnson also took notes on his nature hikes, which he crafted into vignettes, many published in the Milwaukee Sentinel during the years that he worked as outdoor writer for that newspaper. In November 2005, a collection of his nature essays was published, titled Summer's Song and Other Essays. Johnson left the Sentinel in 1984, but continued to write, freelancing articles and photographs to magazines. He published a 1995 book Grouse & Woodcock: A Gunner's Guide.  Personal life and death  Johnson was an adventurer who hiked, hunted, fished, and photographed in such far-flung places as Africa, Cuba, the Andes, the Amazon, Mexico, the Yukon, and Alaska. Johnson died on January 20, 2006, after a struggle with both Parkinson's disease and cancer.

Linstead had significant business interests in the pharmaceutical industry. His politics were on the moderate side of the Conservative Party and he was a strong supporter of the National Health Service. Family and training Linstead was educated at the City of London School, and then obtained the Jacob Bell Scholarship to the Pharmaceutical Society's School. He worked as a pharmaceutical chemist, and in 1926 was appointed Secretary of the Pharmaceutical Society. In the late 1920s he also trained in law at Birkbeck College, and he was Called to the Bar in 1929 by the Middle Temple. Linstead married Alice Freke in 1928; the couple had two daughters. Pharmaceutical industry His position in the Pharmaceutical Society brought him membership of the Home Office Poisons Board. Linstead was a strong defender of the integrity of all those involved in pharmacy. He complained in 1936 that the law did not allow any action to be taken against the author of an article attacking the profession as a whole.\\"An Article on Pharmacy\\" (Letter), The Times, 24 September 1936. In 1937, Linstead was awarded the OBE for services to the industry. In 1938 when the Central Pharmaceutical War Committee was set up, Linstead became its Secretary. He was also involved in the Scouting movement, being Commissioner for Training Scout Officers for the Boy Scouts' Association from 1932. By-election candidate In March 1942 Linstead supported the Guild system in pharmaceutical retailing, arguing that after the end of the war, \\"state control, cartels, and individual effort will all be needed\\".\\"Back to the Guilds?\\", The Times, 10 March 1942. The next month he was chosen as Conservative Party candidate for Putney after the death of Marcus Samuel. He faced opposition from Captain Bernard Acworth RN (retd.) who stood as an Independent; due to the electoral truce the Labour Party gave their support to Linstead. Controversy was caused in the by- election when Winston Churchill, in his letter of support to Linstead, accused Acworth of supporting a negotiated peace with Japan.\\"Mr. Churchill's Call To Putney\\", The Times, 6 May 1942. Acworth insisted this was untrue. Linstead asked that Acworth publish the letter he sent to members of parliament to clear the matter up.\\"Putney Electors Stirred\\", The Times, 7 May 1942. The controversy raged until polling day, when Linstead won comfortably with 8,788 votes to Acworth's 2,939.\\"Putney Election Result\\", The Times, 11 May 1942. Beveridge report Linstead proved a moderate MP. He joined the Tory Reform Committee and in October 1944 welcomed the report of the Beveridge Committee on social insurance.\\"Tory Reformers' Views\\", The Times, 9 October 1944. He was particularly supportive of moves to create a national health service; he cautioned that the administration must be kept efficient.\\"Comprehensive Medical Service\\", The Times, 12 January 1945. At the 1945 general election, Linstead faced a five-cornered fight against not only Labour and Liberal candidates but also Sir Richard Acland, the leader of Common Wealth and Mrs. E. Tennant, a former Conservative candidate now standing as an Independent. Linstead won a majority of 3,887.\\"The Times House of Commons 1945\\", p. 40. The post-war Labour government set up a Joint Negotiating Committee for Hospital Staffs in preparation for the National Health Service in 1946, and Linstead was appointed as chairman. At the time of the dispute between Health minister Aneurin Bevan and representatives of doctors, Linstead called for arbitration between the two, which was involved in all other professions who were to become part of the new service.\\"Mr. Bevan and the Doctors\\", The Times, 18 February 1948. When the NHS started in 1948 he became chairman of the Wandsworth Group Hospital Committee. 1950 election At the 1950 general election, Linstead's constituency underwent boundary changes, bringing into the constituency 12,000 voters from a Labour-held ward formerly in Wandsworth Central.\\"Party Prospects in Wandsworth\\", The Times, 13 February 1950. Despite this change, Linstead was re-elected with an increase in his majority to 5,692.\\"The Times House of Commons 1950\\", p. 78. In 1951 he was appointed by the Ministry of Health to the Central Health Services Council. NHS organisation Linstead received a knighthood in the Coronation Honours' List of 1953.\\"The Coronation Honours\\", The Times, 1 June 1953. At the 1953 Conservative Party conference, he submitted a paper on \\"Health and Hospitals\\" which advocated greater financial freedom for hospital committees including the ability to roll savings over between financial years, and also supported bringing general practitioners within the hospital system.\\"Conservatives' Faith in Local Authorities\\", The Times, 8 October 1953. Linstead served as President of the International Pharmaceutical Federation from 1953. In November 1953, Linstead was inadvertently the cause of some political difficulties to the Conservative government. He moved a motion to annul an Order in Council which lifted an embargo on cut glass imports, arguing that to do so would damage the domestic industry. After debate he intended to withdraw the motion, but the Labour opposition (which wanted to continue the embargo) objected and put the motion to the vote; with the Conservative whips not expecting a division, they lost by four votes.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 12 November 1953. This was the first vote which the government had lost.\\"Government's First Defeat\\", The Times, 12 November 1953. Criticism of medical profession The Home Secretary named Linstead to the Wolfenden Committee investigation prostitution and homosexuality in 1954;\\"Inquiry into Laws on Homosexuality\\", The Times, 27 August 1954. Linstead endorsed the conclusions of the report that male homosexuality be decriminalised, and criticised the government for not bringing in legislation.\\"'Conspiracy of Silence' Over Wolfenden Report\\", The Times, 4 September 1958. He kept up his interest in the pharmaceutical industry in Parliament, complaining in February 1955 that the public too often believed \\"magic .. was attached to a bottle of medicine\\" and that prescriptions were frequently \\"no more than a palliative given to the patient to satisfy him in a rather vague psychological way\\".\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 17 February 1955. After the 1955 general election, Linstead served two years as Chairman of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee. He was also chairman of the Franco-British Parliamentary Committee from 1955 to 1960. Inquiries and scrutiny In October 1955, Linstead protested that large Communist-inspired delegations urging members of parliament to co-operate more closely with the Soviet Union crowded out \\"people of good will, anxious to do anything they could to promote international understanding\\".\\"Keeping The Peace\\", The Times, 19 October 1955. In January 1956, he was named as the Parliamentary Charity Commissioner for England and Wales, an appointment in the government's control.\\"Treasury Post Filled\\", The Times, 25 January 1956. He defended the BBC television programme Your Life in Their Hands in 1958, which looked sceptically at the medical profession; some MPs had urged that the BBC be ordered not to broadcast it.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 27 February 1958. However, he criticised the Public Accounts Committee over a report which criticised the pricing of NHS medicines, arguing that the committee did not take evidence from experts.\\"Accounting to the Public\\" (Letter), The Times, 16 August 1958. One member of the committee complained that the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry had refused to take part in the inquiry.\\"Public Accounts\\" (Letter), The Times, 21 August 1958. In 1959, Linstead was appointed as the House of Commons member on Medical Research Council.\\"Medical Research Appointments\\", The Times, 17 October 1959. He called for an inquiry into the pay of professions allied with medicine in November 1961;\\"13 M.P.s Want N.H.S. Professions Review\\", The Times, 30 November 1961. and when the birth defects associated with thalidomide were discovered Linstead believed the problems associated with the drug could not have been predicted.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 24 July 1962. In the 1960s, Linstead became interested in television, and was appointed to the General Advisory Council of the BBC. He believed that the second BBC channel should be funded by a Treasury grant balanced by a payment into the treasury of the profits of independent television.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 1 August 1962. Linstead was on the Joint Subcommittee of the English and Scottish Standing Medical Advisory Committee that was set up following the thalidomide disaster, and was in favour of legislation governing the testing of new drugs. Cannabis legislation After winning a spot in the ballot for Private Members Bills in November 1963, Linstead introduced a Bill to make the cultivation of cannabis illegal.\\"Exempting Cheques From Stamp Duty\\", The Times, 16 December 1963. His Bill passed into law.See Success of Private Members' Bills. He led the fight against the Government's Bill to abolish resale price maintenance in 1964, believing it to be damaging to small chemists;\\"56 Rebel Against Prices Bill\\", The Times, 11 March 1964. later he moved an amendment to defend the position of chemists which was defeated by only one vote.\\"Chemists offer first challenge to Mr. Heath on resale prices, and fail by one vote\\", The Times, 25 March 1964. Post-Parliamentary career Linstead was defeated at the 1964 general election, and failed to recapture the seat in 1966. He became Chairman of Macarthys Pharmaceuticals Ltd after leaving Parliament, and also served as Renter Warden for the Worshipful Company of Farriers for 1968‚Äì69, Middle Warden for 1969‚Äì70, Upper Warden for 1970‚Äì71 and Master for the year 1971‚Äì72.

It is the third book of the Dragonkeeper series. The books before it are Dragonkeeper and Garden of the Purple Dragon. It is followed by Blood Brothers, Shadow Sisters and Bronze Bird Tower http://carolewilkinson.com.au/ The trilogy, based in ancient China, during the Han Dynasty, has won many awards. Dragon Moon continues the story of the Dragonkeeper Ping, as she tries to fulfill her first dragon's wishes to care for his son, Kai, and take him to the Dragon Haven, where he can be raised by his own kind. Plot When the story starts out Liu Che, (Ping's former friend and the emperor of China), has his troops attack the Duke of Yan's palace where Ping has been living for a year, because he believes that they kidnapped his former imperial dragon Kai. Meanwhile, Ping decides to wake Kai up from his winter hibernation for his safety, and finds that he has not only grown greatly in size, but knowledge as well. Ping leaves the palace with Kai to search for the Dragon Haven to further insure his safety. On the way, they find the emperor, Liu Che, wounded with a shard of Kai's dragon stone in his hand. He repents his crimes and decides to abandon his quest for immortality. At the morning, Ping refuses his offer of love and continues on her journey. As they near the Great Wall of China, they are held hostage by imperial soldiers, who ignore her claim of being the Dragonkeeper. Kai and her are then rescued by barbarians, who also give them a horse. On the way, she meets Jun, and together they find an old man, \\"Lao Long Zi\\", one of Danzi's former dragon keepers, at Tinkling Village. He brings them most of the way to Long Gao Yuan before dying. After getting there, however, Ping discovers only a heap of dragon bones from a massacre by dragon hunters. Ping and Kai are discouraged, and Kai refuses to leave. One day, a yellow dragon swoops down from the sky and carries Kai away. Ping stumbles towards the mountain in a half-dead state, until she too is picked up by the dragon (not too gently), who also spits in her face, in order to hide the location of the Dragon Haven from her, and brought to the real, current dragon haven. There, she learns that many years ago, Hei Lei's dragon keeper had abandoned him for a woman, and that his girlfriend, in her old age, had then betrayed the location of the dragon haven to a band of dragon hunters for three pieces of gold. They had killed many of the dragons in hibernation. Only Hei Lei, the black dragon, was awake, and attacked the hunters just in time. Still, they managed to get away with many dead dragons in their greedy hands, with only a handful escaping. Ping is distraught as she watches Kai pick up many of the wild dragons' habits and feels him slowly drawing away from her. During a moon gathering, Kai and Hei Lei end up in a fight, and Kai, who wins, is revealed to be a \\"dragon of five colors\\" (green, yellow, black, white, and red). A \\"dragon of five colors\\" will automatically assume the position of leader (and no one can challenge him, as the dragons formerly had none). Ping eventually wins the trust and friendship of all the dragons, but realizes that she does not belong with the other dragons, and decided to leave, despite Kai's wish for her to stay till spring. She is taken away from the Haven, and dropped in an empty grassland, where she is rescued by Hei Lei, who she manages to convince to go back to the Dragon Haven. The book ends with Ping beginning a new life with Jun, as she saw in one of her visions of her future. Major characters * Ping ‚Äì Ping is the main protagonist of the Dragonkeeper series. She was formerly a slave girl, working in the Huangling Mountains until a dragon named Long Danzi took her away from her life and raised her to be a Dragonkeeper. She was the current Dragonkeeper of Kai, whom she raised since he was a baby. * Kai ‚Äì Kai is Ping's green (formerly purple) dragon, a young premature dragon who enjoys eating and playing games. Though he may be mischievous, he shows feelings for Ping and respects her. Kai is the son of Long Danzi, Ping's former dragon, as well as the Dragon of Five Colours, and the leader of the dragons. * Jun ‚Äì Jun is Ping's companion whom she meets throughout the book. Jun was formerly a boy from a poor village who tried to take Ping's position as Dragonkeeper until he turned against the Emperor. He is now a young man whom travels across China to sell silk. In the end they live together. * Gu Hong ‚Äì Gu Hong is the elder red dragon in the dragon haven. Though she has never been raised by a Dragonkeeper, she can still communicate to Ping by writing Chinese characters in the dirt. She is apparently the oldest dragon in the Dragon Haven. Her name means \\"Ancient Red\\". In the end, Ping learns to understand her, but they still choose to communicate via Chinese characters. * Jiang ‚Äì Jiang is Gu Hong's daughter. Unlike her mother, Jiang has been raised by another Dragonkeeper. Thus she is able to communicate to Ping like she can with Kai. Her name meaning is \\"Ginger\\". * Hei Lei ‚Äì Hei Lei is a massive black dragon who is supposedly the leader of the dragons. He has a fierce hatred towards all humans including Ping. Hei Lei once had a Dragonkeeper whom left him for a woman he loved leaving Hei Lei betrayed. Hei Lei once challenged Danzi who was once leader of the dragons and later is challenged by Kai for insulting Danzi. Embarrassed, Hei Lei leaves the Dragon Haven. The name Hei Lei means \\"Black Thunder\\". At the end of the book, Ping convinces Hei Lei to return to the Dragon Haven. * Tun ‚Äì Tun is a male yellow dragon whom lost his sister during the dragon massacre. Like Hei Lei, he shows some dislike towards all humans including Ping at first. In the end, he accepts her in the Dragon Haven. His name meaning is \\"Morning Sunlight\\" * Sha ‚Äì Sha is a shy female yellow dragon whom acts as a healer within the Dragon haven. She is Tun's mate and has laid three dragon eggs which were already dead when they were laid. The name Sha means \\"Sandy\\". * The three white dragons ‚Äì The three white dragon sisters: Bai Xue, Shuang and Lian act as the scouts of the Dragon Haven. They possess the shapeshifting ability to turn themselves into white eagles. Their mother was one of the many dragons who were killed during the dragon massacre. Their names meanings are \\"White Snow\\", \\"Frost\\" and \\"Lotus\\" respectively. * Lao Long Zi ‚Äì He is the former Dragonkeeper of Long Danzi who aids Ping throughout her journey. Because he started to lose his sense of hearing, he is forced to leave Danzi and his role as Dragonkeeper because dragons have poor hearing. Since then, he is shunned by many people from Tinkling Village. He leads her to Long Gao Yuan before passing away. Dragon Dawn Carole Wilkinson wrote a short prequel called Dragon Dawn. Based on Danzi's past, it does not mention Ping or any recent characters in it except for a few minors.

Fomes fomentarius is a stem decay plant pathogen Dry rot and water damage A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation. Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil. Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.Viitanen, T. et al. (2010). Towards modelling of decay risk of wooden materials. European Journal of Wood and Wood Products 68:303-313. Wood-decay fungi can be classified according to the type of decay that they cause. The best-known types are brown rot, soft rot, and white rot. Each produce different enzymes, can degrade different plant materials, and can colonise different environmental niches.Vane, C. H., et al. (2005). \\"Decay of cultivated apricot wood (Prunus armeniaca) by the ascomycete Hypocrea sulphurea, using solid state 13C NMR and off-line TMAH thermochemolysis with GC‚ÄìMS.\\" International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation 55(3): 175-185. The residual products of decomposition from fungal action have variable pH, solubility and redox potentials. Over time this residue will become incorporated in the soil and sediment, so can have a noticeable effect on the environment of that area. Brown rot Cubical brown rot on oak Brown-rot fungi break down hemicellulose and cellulose that form the wood structure. Cellulose is broken down by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that is produced during the breakdown of hemicellulose. Because hydrogen peroxide is a small molecule, it can diffuse rapidly through the wood, leading to a decay that is not confined to the direct surroundings of the fungal hyphae. As a result of this type of decay, the wood shrinks, shows a brown discoloration, and cracks into roughly cubical pieces, a phenomenon termed cubical fracture. The fungi of certain types remove cellulose compounds from wood and hence the wood becomes a brown colour. Brown rot in a dry, crumbly condition is sometimes incorrectly referred to as dry rot in general. The term brown rot replaced the general use of the term dry rot, as wood must be damp to decay, although it may become dry later. Dry rot is a generic name for certain species of brown-rot fungi. Brown-rot fungi of particular economic importance include Serpula lacrymans (true dry rot), Fibroporia vaillantii (mine fungus), and Coniophora puteana (cellar fungus), which may attack timber in buildings. Other brown-rot fungi include the sulfur shelf, Phaeolus schweinitzii, and Fomitopsis pinicola. Brown-rot fungal decay is characterised by extensive demethylation of lignins whereas white-rot tends to produce low yields of molecules with demethylated functional groups.Vane, C. H., et al. (2001). \\"The effect of fungal decay (Agaricus bisporus) on wheat straw lignin using pyrolysis‚ÄìGC‚ÄìMS in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).\\" Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis 60(1): 69-78. There are very few brown rot fungi in tropical climates or in southern temperate zones. Most brown rot fungi have a geographical range north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5¬∞ latitude), and most of these are found north of the 35¬∞ latitude, corresponding to a roughly boreal distribution. Those brown rot fungi between latitudes 23.5¬∞ and 35¬∞ are typically found at high elevations in pine forest regions, or in coniferous forest regions such as the Rocky Mountains or the Himalayas. Soft rot wood decayed Fungus in log of woods ) Soft-rot fungi secrete cellulase from their hyphae, an enzyme that breaks down cellulose in the wood. This leads to the formation of microscopic cavities inside the wood, and sometimes to a discoloration and cracking pattern similar to brown rot. Soft-rot fungi need fixed nitrogen in order to synthesize enzymes, which they obtain either from the wood or from the environment. Examples of soft-rot-causing fungi are Chaetomium, Ceratocystis, and Kretzschmaria deusta. Soft-rot fungi are able to colonise conditions that are too hot, cold or wet for brown or white-rot to inhabit. They can also decompose woods with high levels of compounds that are resistant to biological attack. Bark in woody plants contains a high concentration of tannin, which is difficult for fungi to decompose, and suberin which may act as a microbial barrier.Vane, C. H., et al. (2006). \\"Bark decay by the white-rot fungus Lentinula edodes: Polysaccharide loss, lignin resistance and the unmasking of suberin.\\" International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation 57(1): 14-23. The bark acts as form of protection for the more vulnerable interior of the plant. Soft-rot fungi do not tend to be able to decompose matter as effectively as white-rot fungi: they are less aggressive decomposers. White rot White-rot fungi break down the lignin in wood, leaving the lighter-colored cellulose behind; some of them break down both lignin and cellulose. As a result, the wood changes texture, becoming moist, soft, spongy, or stringy; its colour becomes white or yellow. Because white- rot fungi are able to produce enzymes, such as laccase, needed to break down lignin and other complex organic molecules, they have been investigated for use in mycoremediation applications. There are many different enzymes that are involved in the decay of wood by white-rot fungi, some of which directly oxidize lignin.Vane, C. H., et al. (2003). \\"Biodegradation of Oak (Quercus alba) Wood during Growth of the Shiitake Mushroom (Lentinula edodes): A Molecular Approach.\\" Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 51(4): 947‚Äì956. The relative abundance of phenylpropane alkyl side chains of lignin characteristically decreases when decayed by white-rot fungi. It has been reported that the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) preferentially decays lignin instead of polysaccharides.Vane, C. H., et al. (2001). \\"Degradation of Lignin in Wheat Straw during Growth of the Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) Using Off-line Thermochemolysis with Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide and Solid-State 13C NMR.\\" Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 49(6): 2709‚Äì2716. This is different from some other white-rot fungi, e.g., Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which shows no selectivity to lignocellulose. Honey mushroom (Armillaria spp.) is a white-rot fungus notorious for attacking living trees. Pleurotus ostreatus and other oyster mushrooms are commonly cultivated white-rot fungi, but P. ostreatus is not parasitic and will not grow on a living tree, unless it is already dying from other causes. Other white-rot fungi include the turkey tail, artist's conk, and tinder fungus. White-rot fungi are grown all over the world as a source of food ‚Äì for example the shiitake mushroom, which in 2003 comprised approximately 25% of total mushroom production.Vane, C. H. (2003). \\"Monitoring Decay of Black Gum Wood (Nyssa sylvatica) During Growth of the Shiitake Mushroom (Lentinula edodes) Using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy.\\" Applied Spectroscopy 57(5): 514‚Äì517.  Induced fungal decay  A special way of giving grown wood an unusual structure is to infect it with a parasitic fungus by storing it in a humid environment (fungal decay). The fungus penetrates the layers of the wood and changes the nature of the cells. This process creates individual patterns and shades of colour. The wood treated in this way is then excellently suited for the production of all kinds of design objects. In order to stabilise the wood structure weakened by the fungus, resins or plastics are usually introduced into the material by special vacuum processes. A special icing process applied to beech wood leads to results similar to those obtained with fungal decay. After the wood has been soaked, it is iced and then dried. The result is a very light wood with an almost black grain. This result, which also occurs very rarely in nature, is called ice-beech.  Natural durability  Natural durability is the inherent capability of wood to tolerate and resist fungal decay and insect attacks, such as woodboring beetles and termites, and marine organisms. This protective feature is attributable to specific biological compounds, called extractives that are toxic to wood- destroying organisms. Along with the tree‚Äôs growth, the sapwood converts into heartwood and this brings to physical and chemical changes to the wood. As a result, the permeability decreases while the natural durability increases. Thus, the extractives responsible for natural durability are mainly present in the heartwood, although they may also be contained in small amounts in the sapwood. Different chemicals have been isolated from the heartwood of naturally rot-resistant trees and have shown to be protectants, including polyphenols, lignans (e.g. gmelinol, plicatic acid), flavonoids (e.g. mesquitol), tropolones (e.g. hinokitiol and other thujaplicins), sesquiterpenoids (e.g. Œ±-cadinol). The natural durability varies between tree species, geographic regions, environmental conditions, growth stage, and increases with the age. Thereby, some trees are more resistant to fungal diseases and insects and their timber lasts longer than other trees. Notably, the timber of these trees remain durable for a long-time period, even around a century, thereby they have been used as a reliable building material for centuries. Since the young trees do not produce enough protecting chemicals, some trees grow with a hollow, rotten trunk at an early age. However, the stands of old-growth trees are more naturally durable than second-growth stands. Tree species that have significant natural durability include Lagarostrobos franklinii (Huon pine), Intsia bijuga (Ipil), Eucalyptus species (Ironbark), Podocarpus totara (Totara), Vitex lucens (Puriri), Agathis australis (Kauri), trees of the Cupressaceae family, such as Chamaecyparis obtusa (Hinoki cypress), Thuja plicata (Western red cedar), Thujopsis dolabrata (Hinoki asunaro), Juniperus cedrus (Canary Islands juniper), Cedrus atlantica (Atlas cedar), Chamaecyparis taiwanensis (Taiwan cypress), and many other species belonging to this family. According to the EN 350:2016 standards by the APA ‚Äì The Engineered Wood Association, the durability of wood and wood- based products to fungal decay can be classified into five categories: very durable (DC1); durable (DC2); moderately durable (DC3); slightly durable (DC4); and not durable (DC5). And the durability to insect attacks can be categorized as durable (DC D); moderately durable (DC M); and not durable (DC S). Generally, the heartwood of durable tree species is considered as very durable, whereas the sapwood of all tree species is considered as not durable and is the most vulnerable.  Wood preservation  A wide selection of timber preservation has been developed to give the wood an improved durability and to protect it from decay. The wood can be treated according to the purpose (biological protection, e.g. fungi, insects, marine organisms) and the environment (interior, exterior, above ground, in ground, in water) of its use. Timber preservatives include chromated copper arsenate (CCA), alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), copper azole (CuAz), borates, sodium and potassium silicate, oil-based preservatives, such as creosote and pentachlorophenol, light organic solvent preservatives (LOSP), propiconazole-tebuconazole- imidacloprid, epoxy resins, wood acetylation, natural or biological preservation, such as treatment with heat (thermally modified wood), mud, tung oil, impregnation using biopolymers from agricultural waste (biological modified timber), covering wood with copper sheats, etc. Treatment of timber with natural extractives derived from rot-resistant trees, such as hinokitiol, tannins, and tree extracts, is another promising environmentally-friendly wood preservation method. The more permeable is the wood, the easier is it to treat. According to the EN 350:2016 standards, the treatability of woods can be categorized in four levels: (1) easy to treat; (2) moderately easy to treat; (3) difficult to treat; and (4) extremely difficult to treat. = Safety = Over the years a lot of concerns have arisen regarding the arsenic and chromium contents of the CCA. In 1986, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized arsenic as a human carcinogen. The water contamination with arsenic and its compounds is a serious public health issue, and their release to the environment and soil pollution is another environmental problem. Different regulatory interventions have been undertaken worldwide to restrict their use in wood industry, especially in timber for residential use. By the end of 2003, the U.S EPA and the wood industry agreed to discontinue the use of CCA in treating timber for residential use. Its use is also prohibited in Canada, Australia and European Union.

Zweigelt was one of the most influential and internationally renowned figures in Austrian wine growing between 1921 and 1945. He was Head of State Vine Cultivation during the period of the First Austrian Republic and also acted as Director of the School of Viticulture and Horticulture in Klosterneuburg near Vienna. The grape variety \\"Blauer Zweigelt\\" is named after him. Blauer Zweigelt is grown across an area of some 6,400 hectares in Austria, making it by far the most significant red wine grape cultivated in the country.

In 1912, he entered the services of the Imperial School of Viticulture and Horticulture in Klosterneuburg near Vienna, Austria's first and only state- owned vine cultivation station.Friedrich Zweigelt, curriculum vitae of 9 January 1912 (personnel file, Austrian Ministry of Agriculture, √ñMinLW).

After gaining a doctorate in entomology,Wilhelm Zw√∂lfer, Laudatio, in: Zeitschrift f√ºr angewandte Entomologie Vol. 54 (1964), pp. 11-13. he was appointed Head of this institute in 1921.For more information on the eventful history of the oldest school of viticulture in the German speaking countries, cf. \\"Programm und Jahresbericht der k.k. h√∂heren Lehranstalt f√ºr Wein- und Obstbau in Klosterneuburg, zugleich Jubil√§umsschrift anl√§√ülich ihres 50j√§hrigen Bestehens\\" (Vienna 1910), \\"Denkschrift zur 70j√§hrigen Bestandesfeier der H√∂heren Bundes-Lehranstalt und Bundesversuchsstation f√ºr Wein-, Obst- und Gartenbau in Klosterneuburg\\" (Klosterneuburg 1939), and Emil Planck, \\"90 Jahre H√∂here Bundes-Lehranstalt und Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Wein-, Obst- und Gartenbau Klosterneuburg.

Zweigelt's first crossings (undertaken from 1921) included a seedling given the cultivation number 71 (St. Laurent x Blaufr√§nkisch). This particular hybrid proved highly promising from an early stage.Fritz Zweigelt, Der gegenw√§rtige Stand der Klosterneuburger Z√ºchtungen (autumn 1924), special edition of the ‚ÄûAllgemeine Wein-Zeitung\\" 41 (1924) and 42 (1925).

In 1922, Zweigelt also successfully crossed Welschriesling with Orangetraube (creating a variety which was to be included in the Austrian Grape Variety Index for Qualit√§tsweine (Quality Wines) as \\"Goldburger\\" in 1978Ordinance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of 20 September 1978 (Federal Law Gazette No. 517/1978)). This was followed by a Blauer Portugieser x Blaufr√§nkisch crossing in 1923 (added to the Austrian Grape Variety Index for Qualit√§tsweine (Quality Wines) as \\"Blauburger\\" in 1978). Zweigelt had also been editing the journal Das Weinland since 1929. There was soon no other viticulture specialist in Austria who enjoyed better international connections and renown.Franz Wobisch, Dr. Zweigelt ‚Äì zu seinem 70. Geburtstag, in: √ñsterreichische Weinzeitung 13 (1958), Issue 1. From the late 1920s onwards, Zweigelt began to join forces with all leading experts from Europe's major wine growing countriesCf. the report made to the International Wine and Viticulture Congress in Conegliano, probably written by Zweigelt himself, in: Allgemeine Wein-Zeitung 44 (1927), pp. 188‚Äì190. to promote the production of quality wine and to try to stem the cultivation of so-called direct producers.Friedrich Zweigelt, Die Ertragshybriden und ihre Bedeutung f√ºr den europ√§ischen Weinbau, in: Internationale Landwirtschaftliche Rundschau. Part I: Agrikulturwissenschaftliche Monatsschrift, Rome, March 1930, No. 3. This also contains a concise summary of the cultivation of direct producers in all European wine growing countries. Zweigelt published a highly informative report on \\"Pr√ºfung von Hybridenweinen in Klosterneuburg\\" in Das Weinland 3 (1932), pp. 19-21. Similar and comprehensive treatments may also be found in Das Weinland 5 (1933), pp. 29-33, pp. 68-71, p. 103, pp. 213-215, pp. 250-254, pp. 291-295 and pp. 367-372. His book on direct producers, co- authored with Albert Stummer (Nikolsburg), remains a standard work right down to the present day.Albert Stummer/Friedrich Zweigelt, Die Direkttr√§ger, Vienna 1929. The book received several plaudits, including a prize awarded by the International Wine Office (Paris). See Das Weinland 5 (1933), p. 10. =1933-1945= Zweigelt was a strong German nationalist who was deeply opposed to clericalism.Senior civil servant Dr. Fritz Zweigelt (undated self- disclosure, presumably 1938), Volksgericht file Vienna City and State Archive Vg 2e Vr 3281/45 Supplement 1. He saw himself as a \\"borderer\\"Zweigelt himself on the Austrians in general: Dem F√ºhrer Dank und Gel√∂bnis, in: Das Weinland 11 (1939), p. 109. On himself: \\"Borderers know more about the worries and dangers of foreign infiltration. After all, they have experienced the humiliation of deprivation of privileges, mistrust and constant betrayal of their national rights without interruption. This makes them tougher and more receptive than others who live in a closed and landlocked state and have never had to fight for their national rights.\\" Fritz Zweigelt, In celebration of 13 March 1941, typed statement in: Volksgericht file Vg 2e Vr 3281/45, Sheets 147-169, citation Sheets 148 ff., and began to view Nazi Germany as a place of yearning after 1933. Zweigelt joined the Austrian NSDAP and remained loyal to the party, even during the period when it was banned.Interview/written record, Vienna Police Department/State Police Group XXVI, 6 July 1945, Volksgericht file Vienna City and State Archive Vg 2e Vr 3281/45. Sheets 21-22. Following the annexation of Austria in March 1938, it seemed that Zweigelt's dream was about to become true. He would be able to lead \\"his\\" Klosterneuburg to new heights as a sister institute to the much larger State School of Viticulture, Fruit Growing and Horticulture in Geisenheim am Rhein.Friedrich Zweigelt, Zu neuer Arbeit, in: Der deutsche Weinbau 17 (1938), pp. 391-393. In his capacity as Head and subsequently (after 1943) Director of Klosterneuburg,A decree issued by the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture on 28 May 1941 made Zweigelt the \\"Permanent Head\\" of the Testing and Research Institute with retrospective effect from 1 April 1941. (Personnel file, Austrian Ministry of Agriculture, √ñMinLW Sheet 40). Appointment to the position of Director followed on 27 May 1942. Ibid. Sheet 61. Zweigelt did everything he possibly could to turn the institute into a \\"stronghold of National Socialism\\"Heinrich Konlechner, Dr. Fritz Zweigelt. 30 Jahre an der Klosterneuburger Lehranstalt t√§tig, Das Weinland 14 (1942), p. 41.. However, he began to be caught between the different fronts. Adherents of the Austro-Fascist Dollfu√ü-Schuschnigg regime were keen to prevent his rise, and they were not alone in this aspiration. Zweigelt also found himself in the way of other rival colleagues who had only recently embraced the ideas of National Socialism. However, during the summer of 1938, he succeeded in forcing numerous undesirable teaching staff members to leave the school. These were then replaced by dyed- in-the-wool National Socialists.Volksgericht file Vienna City and State Archive Vg 2e Vr 3281/45. The Nazi Government in Germany adopted the most progressive viticulture policies in the world and soon gained international recognition. The culmination and end of this development occurred at an international viticulture congress staged in Bad Kreuznach in late August 1939.Cf. Daniel Deckers, Im Zeichen des Traubenadlers. Eine Geschichte des deutschen Wein, Mainz 2010/2. Frankfurt edition 2018, pp. 109-147.

Zweigelt, now elevated to the status of Reich Official, was one of the participants. Despite numerous personal disappointments, Zweigelt clung firmly to his National Socialist convictions until 1945. He often expressed such views to his pupil body in addresses that were full of drastic warlike rhetoric.Archive of the Federal Institute of Viticulture and Fruit Production in Klosterneuburg, Dr. Fritz Zweigelt ‚Äì personal papers. \\"Das Weinland\\", the journal he edited, had been the mouthpiece of Austrian viticulture since 1929. In 1943, however, publication ceased by order of the Reichsn√§hrstand (a government body set up in Nazi Germany to regulate food production) in Berlin.Cf. correspondence between Zweigelt and the Reichsn√§hrstand in Berlin. Archive of the Federal Institute of Viticulture and Fruit Production in Klosterneuburg, Dr. Fritz Zweigelt ‚Äì personal papers. Zweigelt's only son Rudolf was conscripted into the German army upon completion of his medical studies. He was killed in East Prussia in 1944, and Zweigelt would never get over his death.Verbal information provided by Thomas Leithner, Langenlois, great-grandson. =After 1945= After the collapse of the Third Reich, Zweigelt was held in a detention camp in Klosterneuburg. During this time of imprisonment, he portrayed himself as an idealist who had been led astray.Personnel file, Austrian Ministry of Agriculture, √ñMinLW. Nevertheless, after various sessions of questioning and examinations of witnesses, criminal proceedings were instigated against Zweigelt at the end of 1945. He was summoned to stand trial at the Volksgericht in Vienna (\\"Volksgerichte\\" were special courts set up in Austria after the Second World War to deal with crimes committed under National Socialism).Volksgericht file Vienna City and State Archive Vg 2e Vr 3281/45. A pupil named Josef Bauer (born in 1920) had been arrested by the Gestapo for being a member of the \\"Austrian Freedom Movement\\", a group founded by Roman Scholz, an Augustinian canon regular at Klosterneuburg.For information on Roman K. Scholz, Klosterneuburg and the Austrian Resistance cf. in particular: Das Geheimnis der Erl√∂sung als Erinnerung, Herausgegeben aus Anlass der Enth√ºllung einer Gedenktafel f√ºr Roman Karl Scholz and \\"√ñsterreichische Freiheitsbewegung\\", Klosterburg, year of publication not stated. Cf. also a book written by Scholz's pupil Grete Huber-Gergasevicis, Roman Karl Scholz, Klosterneuburg 2010. This work was very much influenced by her personal acquaintance with Scholz. Bauer had then been expelled from the institute,Josef Bauer was taken into custody in June 1940, just after Scholz's own arrest. A copy (dated 25 September 1945) of the minutes of a teachers' staff meeting held on 28 August 1940 has been retained in the Documentary Archive of the Austrian Resistance (D√ñW) in Vienna together with various other files relating to the Roman K.

Zweigelt spent his final years in Graz, where he died on 18 September 1964 some years after the death of his wife Friederike (Fritzi).Viktor Richter, Prof. Dr. Fritz Zweigelt (1888-1964) +, in: Zeitschrift f√ºr angewandte Entomologie, Vol. 55 (1964-1965), pp. 100-101.

Zweigelt, Von den H√∂hepunkten meines Lebens ‚Äì Werk und Freude, in: Zeitschrift f√ºr angewandte Entomologie 54 (1964), pp. 13-21. He was buried on the St. Peter City Cemetery in Graz. Starting in 2002, an annual Dr. Fritz Zweigelt Wine Tasting Prize was awarded to estates in the Kamptal Region. This prize was last conferred in 2015, after which time it was discontinued in the wake of severe criticism. The \\"Zweigelt\\" grape variety Zweigelt's long-standing staff members Paul Steingruber and Leopold M√ºller resurrected vine cultivation at Klosterneuburg after the war and went on to produce an outstanding St. Laurent x Blaufr√§nkisch crossing. This was described as being \\"of a magnificent colour, with an excellent taste and smell, a splendid red wine variety.\\"Paul Steingruber/Leopold M√ºllner, Drei√üig Jahre Rebenz√ºchtung III, in: Mitteilungen der H√∂heren Bundeslehr- und Versuchsanstalten f√ºr Wein-, Obst- und Gartenbau Klosterneuburg und f√ºr Bienenkunde Wien-Grinzing 1 (1951), pp. 135-138. Zweigelt's pupil and admirer Lenz Moser propagated the plant material at his vine nursery and introduced self-rooted cuttings onto the sales market from 1960 onwards.Lenz Moser, from 1960: Zweigelt-Kreuzungen im Verkauf, in: √ñsterreichische Weinzeitung 13 (1958), Issue 2, p. 11.

The name of the variety was altered to \\"Blauer Zweigelt\\" in 1978.Ordinance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of 20 September 1978 (Federal Law Gazette No. 517/1978). At the request of the School of Viticulture and Horticulture in Klosterneuburg, the synonym \\"Rotburger\\" was created at the same time. The aim here was to make it clear that the new cultivations of Blauburger, Goldburger and Rotburger/Blauer Zweigelt all shared a common origin.Verbal explanation provided by Josef Weiss, Director of the Federal Institute of Viticulture and Fruit Production in Klosterneuburg for many years.

After the Battle of Jutland in 1916, Packer was mentioned in dispatches for firing 12 rounds (though all fell short of their target) at the line of German High Seas Fleet's battleships under local control. The Warspite was heavily damaged and direction and gunnery control was disabled. Bertie Packer was also made a Lieutenant R.N. In the years between the wars, Packer served in HMS Dublin, HMS Excellent, married South African author and journalist Joy Petersen in 1924, served in HMS Warspite, and in the Mediterranean Sea, qualified as a Naval Interpreter in French, took a course at the RN Staff College,and then joined the crew of the cruiser HMS Kent as Fleet Gunnery Officer of the China Station in Wei Hai Wei. In 1936 Captain Packer was appointed \\"Naval Attach√© to the Embassy in Angora, and to His Majesty's Legations at Belgrade and Athens with headquarters at Athens\\". Second World War On 24 August 1939 Packer was appointed to command the cruiser HMS Calcutta. In February 1940 the Calcutta and the destroyer HMS Cossack chased the German supply-ship Altmark. Captain Philip Vian of the Cossack led a boarding party, in still-neutral Norwegian waters and freed the 300 captive British sailors on board. As captain of HMS Manchester Captain Packer was involved in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. On 27 November 1940 the 18th. Cruiser Squadron attacked and dispersed a superior Italian fleet off the Sardinian coast. Captain Packer, an aggressive commander, suggested in his report that the Admiralty \\"stow more ammunition for the forward turrets, possibly at the expense of the after turrets\\" as it was \\"an experience common to many, if not all, of H.M. ships in action, both in this war and the last, and I am willing to prophesy that it is a situation that is likely to continue, that the foremost turrets fired many more rounds than the after turrets\\". Between 1941 and 1943 Captain Packer was Commanding Officer of HMS Excellent, a shore installation, the Gunnery School on Whale Island, near Portsmouth. In the spring of 1943 Captain Packer was put in command of his first battleship - the veteran HMS Warspite. The battleship was the H.Q. of Rear Admiral A.W. la Touche Bisset and part of Force H. The guns bombarded Catania and supported the Allied landings on Sicily and the Italian mainland. HMS Warspite was shelling Salerno on 15 September 1943 when a new German weapon was aimed at her. Wireless bombs, the Fritz X, controlled by an aircraft at 6000 meters high, crashed through the decks and one of them exploded in the boiler room. Captain Packer managed to bring the crippled ship, under tow, back to Malta and was once again Mentioned in Despatches. He has the rare honour of having been so honoured for his conduct on the same ship in two different wars. Rear Admiral Packer spent the rest of the war as a staff officer (Commodore administration) and then Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet. For planning the amphibious operations in Sicily and Southern France Rear-Admiral Packer was awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in January 1945. Later in that year he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his conduct in Italy. The American government made him an Officer in their Legion of Merit, and the French awarded him the Croix de Guerre avec Palme and made him a Commandeur in the Legion d'Honneur. Post-war activities Rear Admiral Sir Herbert Packer hoisted his flag in HMS Superb, and commanded the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. In 1948 he became Fourth Sea Lord and Chief of Supplies and Transport. For his services to the United Kingdom he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Retirement Sir Herbert Packer's last command was that of Commander in Chief South Atlantic Station. He was a full admiral now and retired in 1953. Sir Herbert Packer retired in Cape Town and died in September 1962, aged 67.The Papers of Admiral Sir Herbert Packer He left a wife and a son, the surgeon Piet Packer who emigrated to Australia. The ashes of Herbert Packer were scattered from the side of the frigate HMSAS Good Hope near Cape Point where the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet. Other activities Packer played a single first-class cricket match in 1920, appearing for a Royal Navy cricket team against Cambridge University; he batted as a tail-ender in the match, scoring 0 and 3, and took two catches as wicketkeeper.

Career Powel started playing football at AFC Quick 1890 and succeeded at the non-professional club Roda '46. Powel was discovered by FC Den Bosch, and in 2003 he made his debut for the club's first team. In his first season at the club, he scored 9 goals in 26 games for Den Bosch, when they played in the Eerste Divisie. Powel became champions with his club and FC Den Bosch promoted to the Eredivisie. In the Eredivisie he scored two goals in 29 games. Den Bosch was relegated to the Eerste Divisie again, following that some of their key players; Koen van de Laak, Mourad Mghizrat, Jochen Janssen and Dennis Schulp left the club, making Powel the most important player of the club. After 26 games and 19 goals in the 2005‚Äì06 season, he moved to Millwall to become a more complete player. In his first game for Millwall, he scored a goal after only two minutes, giving Millwall a draw against Cardiff City. After Millwall relegated to the Football League One, he moved to De Graafschap where he signed a contract for three seasons. Playing for the Doetinchem side, he had an important role during the first half of his first season, scoring 29 goals and becoming the topscorer of Eerste Divisie. On 31 January 2008, FC Groningen signed Powel for a one-and-a-half-year deal, after Erik Nevland was sold to Fulham. A year later Powel moved again, this time to ADO Den Haag after a row with FC Groningen coach Ron Jans. On 25 August 2010, Powel was signed by Spanish club Gimn√†stic de Tarragona, currently playing in the Spanish Second Division, on a free transfer. On 4 September he scored two goals in his first game against Girona FC. The game ended 2‚Äì0. Although his performance in training sessions was impressive, he failed to score in the next four matches, which ended in four goalless defeats for Gimn√†stic. After he was advised by the technical team not to play as a reference striker but as a more mobile player up front, he displayed another impressive performance in the Cartagena v Gimn√†stic game. The Spanish team was losing 1‚Äì0 when he entered the pitch, and thanks to a goal by Powel, Gimn√°stic eventually led 1‚Äì2 before receiving a late goal (2‚Äì2). Powel did not score his fourth goal of the season until six games later, at Alcorc√≥n, a penalty shot in the 68th minute that gave Gimn√†stic a point. Powel kept on being top scorer at Gimn√†stic although he had not scored for four and six games in a row (spaces between second and third goal, and third and fourth). After the sacking of manager Luis C√©sar Sampedro the situation changed for Gimn√†stic and for Berry altogether. With new manager Juan Carlos Oliva, Gimn√†stic reached places out of the relegation zone and Berry scored in four matches in a row (against Salamanca, Rayo Vallecano, Celta and Xerez). Powel established himself as a hero for many Gimn√†stic supporters and local media gave him the nickname \\"The Killer of Utrecht\\". After one and a half seasons, Powel's contract with N√†stic was rescinded, when he was seen in a club days after undergoing an operation for a muscular injury. On 5 June 2012, Powel signed a two-year contract with Elche CF. After promoting to La Liga, Powel left Elche on a free transfer in August 2013. After being on trial with De Graafschap, Powel signed an amateur deal with Eredivisie side Heracles Almelo. However, only six weeks later and having made four appearances for the club, Powel left Heracles as he could sign a professional contract with Roda JC Kerkrade until the end of the season.

Early life Gay was born at Bridge of Weir, in Renfrewshire, Scotland, eldest child of William Gay and his wife Jane n√©e Tagg. Gay senior was a religious man, an engraver of patterns for wallpaper and calico, his mother came from an educated family. The family moved not long afterwards to the town of Alexandria, where Gay was educated at a boarding school. At 14 he became a monitor at the school and winning a bursary went to the University of Glasgow. His father wanted him to be a minister, but the boy felt he could not conscientiously follow that profession and went to London hoping to make a living there. Travel and career Destitution and illness followed and Gay had to go back to his people. Again he went to London but his strength was not sufficient and he had to go into hospital in Glasgow. Tuberculosis threatened, and a sea voyage was tried and he arrived at Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1885. Gay obtained work as a purser's clerk on vessels of the Union Line for nearly two years, when illness again led to his living with some relatives at Hawke's Bay who nursed him back to comparative health. In 1888 he went to Melbourne and obtained a mastership at Scotch College but teaching was beyond his strength. In 1891 he was in the Austin hospital, and in 1893 went to live at Bendigo. His first volume Sonnets and Other Verses, published in 1894, was followed by two other volumes Sonnets and Christ on Olympus and Other Poems in 1896. A small selection appeared in 1910 and The Complete Poetical Works of William Gay in 1911. A prose essay Walt Whitman: His Relation to Science and Philosophy was issued in 1895. Gay was a supporter of Federation and edited \\"The Commonwealth & the Empire\\" with Mary Sampson. Gay died on 22 December 1897. Legacy Gay was a slight man of average height and was said to have had some resemblance to Tennyson. When an invalid at Bendigo one of his little volumes yielded him a profit of ¬£40 and another was even more successful. This could only have happened with the help of friends as the volumes are without popular appeal. Gay was fortunate that so many discerning and kindly people were able to help him and care for him until his death, because he was worthy of care. His sonnets rank with the best that have been done in Australia, and in a few poems such as \\"The Crazy World\\" he has written poetry expressing simple, forceful and unstrained emotion. His life was short and marred by ill- health borne with courage. Although the amount of Gay's work was small, it holds an honoured place in the history of Australian poetry.

They usually involve various extra-legal plots, designed to give political power to someone, while his opponents try to stop him. They can involve national or international political scenarios. Political corruption, terrorism, and warfare are common themes. Political thrillers can be based on true facts such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy or the Watergate Scandal. There is a strong overlap with the conspiracy thriller. When reviewing the film The Interpreter, Erik Lundegaard attempted a definition: Literature Before 1950, there were spy novels with political elements. Some earlier examples, however, can be found in the historical novels of Alexandre Dumas (particularly his Three Musketeers novels, which often involve political conspiracies), as well as such literary works as Joseph Conrad's novel The Secret Agent. The actual political thriller came to life in the early days of the Cold War. Graham Greene's The Quiet American (1955) tells about the American involvement in Vietnam during the First Indochina War. Richard Condon's The Manchurian Candidate (1962) is set in the aftermath of the Korean War and the days of McCarthyism. In Frederick Forsyth's The Day of the Jackal, an assault on Charles de Gaulle has to be prevented. Other authors of political thrillers include Jeffrey Archer and Daniel Silva. In Bengali literature, Samaresh Majumdar's Aat Kuthuri Noy Dorja (‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ : ‡¶Ü‡¶ü ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶†‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡¶ø ‡¶®‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶¶‡¶∞‡¶ú‡¶æ, meaning: eight rooms and nine doors) is one example. Film Several Alfred Hitchcock films already contain elements of the political thriller. In The Man Who Knew Too Much, a political assault has to be prevented. In 1962, John Frankenheimer made a film adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate. All the President's Men is based on the Watergate Scandal. Other examples of political thrillers are Seven Days in May, Z, Three Days of the Condor, V For Vendetta, Romero, City Hall, Air Force One, Snowden and The Post. Several post-9/11 political thriller films refer to the September 11 attacks or terrorism in general. Television Shonda Rhimes' television series Scandal contains many elements of a political thriller in a chronological format. The 1990 British drama serial House of Cards, later adapted for Netflix in 2013, is a political thriller set after the end of Margaret Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The subsequent Netflix adaptation is set in the United States. The former ABC and now Netflix series Designated Survivor depicts the political power struggle that follows as a result of a terrorist attack that destroys the United States Capitol during the State of the Union, assassinating the President and all but one of his line of succession. 2015's Okkupert (English: Occupied) quickly became Norway's most expensively produced TV series, depicting Russia and the European Union cooperating to get Norway to restore its gas and oil production. The series had a budget of over 90 million Norwegian Krona (3.8 Million GBP). It was first broadcast on TV2 in Norway, and then broadcast on Sky Arts in the United Kingdom. It was later added to Netflix worldwide. The 2017 ABS-CBN's Revenge Crime-Political Suspense Epic Wildflower tells of a woman named Ivy Aguas/Lily Cruz (Maja Salvador) plots her vengeance for the loss of her family and is willing to determine to dethrone the exploitative and oppressive Ardiente Political Dynasty. Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, or simply Jack Ryan, is an American action political thriller web television series, based on characters from the fictional \\"Ryanverse\\" created by Tom Clancy, that premiered on August 31, 2018 on Amazon Video. In 2018, British political thriller Bodyguard quickly achieved popularity throughout the UK, achieving the BBC's highest viewing figures since 2008. The series depicts PS David Budd, a British Army war veteran suffering from PTSD. He is working for the Metropolitan Police within their Royalty and Specialist Protection Branch. He is assigned to protect the ambitious Home Secretary, Julia Montague, whose politics stand for everything he despises. It was released on Netflix worldwide on 24 October 2018.

According to the Pew Research Center (PRC) estimated that 62% of the population was Christian, around 36% is Muslim., being 1% followers of Christianity, mostly followers of Oriental Orthodoxy and, to a lesser extent Roman Catholicism-Eritrean Catholicism, and P'ent'ay Evangelicalism. Eritrea was one of the first Christian countries in the world having officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century and Christianity is the oldest world religion practiced in the country. One of oldest monasteries in the country Debre Sina dates back to the 4th century, it is one of the oldests monasteries in Africa and the world. Christians in Eritrea constitute to three main groups; the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church (not recognized by government). The Catholic dioceses in Eritrea are the Eparches of Asmara, Barentu, Keren and Segeneiti. In 2002, Isaias Afwerki, the president of Eritrea, declared all independent Protestant Churches enemies of the state. For this reason, more than 2000 independent Protestants are detained due to their faith. Oriental Orthodoxy in Eritrea The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was granted autocephaly by Pope Joseph II of Alexandria, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1950. At that time Eritrea was regarded as a province of Ethiopia, so the Coptic Church in Eritrea was simply a division of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Following the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed to Pope Shenouda III of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. Tensions were high between the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and no representative from the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church attended the official recognition of the newly autocephalous body. However, the Ethiopian Church has recognized the Autocephalous status of the Church of Eritrea although it objected to the method in which the Coptic Church went about granting it. Eritrea's first two Patriarchs were originally Archbishops of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the first Patriarch, Abune Phillipos did visit Addis Ababa during joint efforts by the two Churches to explore a possible resolution to a border conflict that had broken out between the two countries in 1998. The two churches, remain in full communion with each another and with the other Churches of Oriental Orthodoxy, although the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, along with the Coptic Orthodox Church have not recognized the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, and the enthronement of the fourth Patriarch. The first Patriarch of Eritrea was Abune Phillipos who died in 2004 and was succeeded by Abune Yacob. The reign of Abune Yacob as Patriarch of Eritrea was very brief as he died not long after his enthronement, and he was succeeded by Abune Antonios as 3rd Patriarch of Eritrea. Abune Antonios was elected in 2004-03-05, and enthroned as the third Patriarch of Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea on 2004-04-24. Pope Shenouda III presided at the ceremony in Asmara, together with the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and a Coptic Orthodox Church delegation. In August 2005, the Patriarch of Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Eritrea, Abune Antonios, was confined to a strictly ceremonial role. In a letter dated 2006-01-13 Patriarch Abune Antonios was informed that following several sessions of the church's Holy Synod, he had been formally deposed. In a written response that was widely published the Patriarch rejected the grounds of his dismissal, questioned the legitimacy of the synod, and excommunicated two signatories to the 13 January letter, including Yoftahe Dimetros, whom the Patriarch identified as being responsible for the church's recent upheavals. Patriarch Antonios also appealed his case to the Council of the Monasteries of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Abune Antonios was deposed by the Eritrean Holy Synod. Many believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed and still consider him Patriarch. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with the Eritrean government making decisions in religious matters. Catholicism in Eritrea and Ethiopia The Portuguese voyages of discovery at the end of the fifteenth century opened the way for direct contacts between the Catholic Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Due largely to the behaviour of the Portuguese Afonso Mendes whom Pope Urban VIII appointed as Patriarch of Ethiopia in 1622 and who was expelled from the country in 1636, these contacts, which had seemed destined for success, led instead to the complete closure of Ethiopia to further contact with Rome. In 1839, Saint Justin de Jacobis arrived in the country as Prefect Apostolic of Ethiopia, in charge therefore of a Latin-rite jurisdiction. He preferred instead to use the Ethiopic liturgical rite. Many Ethiopian priests were attracted to his sanctity and his teaching, thus giving rise to what became in 1930 the Ethiopic Catholic Church, when, in view of its continual growth, an ordinariate for the Ethiopic Rite faithful of Eritrea, entrusted to an Eritrean bishop, was established. Eritrea, an Italian possession since 1894, already had a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction, headed by an Italian titular bishop, for Latin-rite Catholics, mainly Italians. The Latin Rite had become established in the south of Ethiopia in areas that had not been Christian and that were incorporated into the modern country only at the end of the nineteenth century. The Italian occupation of Ethiopia in 1936 gave rise to an increase in the number of Latin Rite jurisdictions, but the expulsion of foreign missionaries at the end of the Second World War meant that the Ethiopic Rite clergy had to take responsibility for larger areas than before. Accordingly, in 1951, the Ethiopic Rite Apostolic Exarchate of Addis Ababa was established, and the ordinariate for Eritrea was elevated to the rank of exarchate. Ten years later, on 9 April 1961, an Ethiopic metropolia (ecclesiastical province) was established, with Addis Ababa as the metropolitan see and Asmara (in Eritrea) and Adigrat (in Ethiopia) as suffragan eparchies. In 1995, two new eparchies, Barentu and Keren, were established in Eritrea, and the Latin Rite apostolic vicariate was abolished. Eritrea thus became the only country where all Catholics, whatever their personal liturgical rite, belong to an Eastern Catholic jurisdiction. In 2003, one more eparchy was created in Endibir in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region of Ethiopia, and on Friday, February 24, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI erected the new Eparchy of Segheneity. The Ethiopic Catholic Metropolitan Church now consists of seven sees, three in Ethiopia and four in Eritrea. There are also Latin-Rite jurisdictions in the south of Ethiopia, none of them raised to the rank of diocese. Eight are apostolic vicariates, headed by a titular bishop; one is an apostolic prefecture, headed by a priest. Ge'ez, a Semitic language fallen out of daily use several centuries ago, is the liturgical language of the Ethiopic Church, whose liturgy is based on the Coptic. Protestantism in Eritrea Protestants in Eritrea number about 91,232, which represents 2% of the population. The Evangelical Lutheran Church is the only recognised Protestant Church. Torture is used against independent Protestants in Eritrea causing more than 2000 Christians being subject to arrest in 2006. The U.S. State Department names it a Country of Particular Concern due to its violation of religious liberty. It has been reported that entire families are thrown into jail. In 2009, International Christian Concern said that over 3,000 Christians were being held prisoner in Eritrea, and alleged a December 2009 mass arrest of 30 mostly elderly women who were praying together in a house.\\"Eritrea says not aware of mass arrest of Christians\\", Reuters, Jeremy Clarke, December 10, 2009, Retrieved June 11, 2011. According to the Barnabas Fund, in April 2010 a 28-year-old student died after she was held in a metal shipping container for 2 years, after being arrested for attending a Protestant Bible study.

KMB Route 1 is a bus route operated in Kowloon, Hong Kong. It is run by Kowloon Motor Bus and connects Star Ferry and Chuk Yuen Estate in Wong Tai Sin. The bus runs via Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Kowloon City and Lok Fu. Major milestones in the service history The route was started in the 1920s, then known as route 6. The route served between Tsim Sha Tsui and Kowloon City. Fares were divided into first and second classes at that time. The route ceased operation during the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941 and resumed January 10, 1942 as the Japanese military government in Hong Kong reorganized the bus services. The route was renumbered route 1 in October, 1942. August 12, 1943, the route was shortened to serve between Tsim Sha Tsui and Waterloo Road due to shortage of fuel. After the Japanese occupation this route was the only bus route remaining in service in Kowloon at the end of the occupation. In mid-February, 1946 KMB resumed the route. The first four double decker buses in Hong Kong were allocated to this route on April 17, 1949 as the population in Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok and Kowloon City increased rapidly. The route was one of only few routes still in service in Kowloon during the 1967 riots. In 1972 the route was extended to Wang Tau Hom to serve the newly developed areas. And in 1976 the route was extended to Lok Fu to serve the newly developed areas. In 1984 the route was further extended to Chuk Yuen Estate, its current terminus. As the population in Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Kowloon City, which are in the centre of Kowloon Peninsula, has increased steadily since World War II, buses on this route are often full, and it has become one of the major bus routes in Kowloon. Fleet Single decker buses were used before World War II, and double deckers joined the route from 1949. Air conditioned services started from 3 August 1992, and since 2014, more and more Volvo B9TL buses have been deployed in the route. The route is currently operated with 15 double decker buses, with most of them being Volvo B9TL buses.

He is from Corduff in County Monaghan. He officiated many high- profile inter-county matches, including four finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Many would rate McEnaney as the best Gaelic football referee of his time. He also refereed several International Rules Series tests, as well as games in countries such as France, Luxembourg and the United States. Early life McEnaney attended Referagh School. Playing career As a player, McEnaney won a Monaghan Junior Football Championship and a Monaghan Intermediate Football Championship with Corduff in 1998. McEnaney still plays at Junior \\"B\\" level for Corduff. He described his \\"first priority\\" as \\"probably playing club football\\"; refereeing at inter-county level followed on from this. Refereeing career McEnaney first took up refereeing when he was 21 years of age, after damaging his left knee while playing association football for Carrick Rovers (from nearby Carrickmacross). P√°raic Duffy, a figure within Monaghan refereeing back then, invited McEnaney to officiate at some matches \\"because I could run in straight lines!\\", McEnaney later said. Finding that he enjoyed it, McEnaney kept going and progressed up the ranks. McEnaney refereed the 1996 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final between Mayo and Meath and even by his own admission \\"became famous for all the wrong reasons\\". This was due to a mass brawl between both teams on the pitch. McEnaney sought to punish those he deemed the worst offenders. He decided he would send off Mayo's Liam McHale and Meath's John McDermott. \\"When it all settled down my gut instinct was to send off McDermott with McHale. I had my mind made up on that\\", McEnaney later said. Then he consulted with umpire Francie McMahon, who had witnessed something dreadful. \\"Pat,\\" he said. \\"You're going to have to send off Colm Coyle. He's after dropping about six of them\\". One of the linesmen, Kevin Walsh, intervened to also highlight Coyle's indiscretions. McEnaney sent off McHale and Coyle. McHale has never claimed not to have been involved in the brawl that day; indeed, he is on record as saying: \\"I was right in the middle right from the start\\". Coyle had arrived later. Inaccurate stories spread afterwards that McEnaney had received hate mail at his home, but, McEnaney later said, the only letter he received (from a Meath supporter) praised McEnaney for how he had handled the brawl. McHale and McEnaney had not spoken, as of 2009. McEnaney's father died that November. His efforts at overcoming the events of 1996 were rewarded when he was given the task of refereeing the 2000 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final between Galway and Kerry. He was a lot happier with how that game went. McEnaney also refereed the 2004 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, which incidentally also involved Mayo. After refereeing one All-Ireland final (2000?), he went to Crossmaglen to officiate \\"at a tournament game, I think\\". The announcer informed the large crowd gathered: \\"We would like to welcome referee Pat McEnaney who refereed last Sunday's All-Ireland\\". McEnaney received a round of applause :\\"I couldn't believe it. That was my one and only time\\". He also refereed the first test of the 2006 International Rules Series at Pearse Stadium in Galway. He referred games outside Ireland, including in Paris, Luxembourg, New York, San Francisco and Australia. He trained every second night during his refereeing career. McEnaney retired at the conclusion of the 2010 championship. He plays squash.

The elongate peninsula is long, and between wide. It sets apart the Gorgan Bay from the Caspian Sea. The elevation of the peninsula from the sea level is 23 meters. Four villages are situated on it, namely: Ashuradeh, Qezel-e shomali, Qezel-Mehdi, and Qavasatl. The city situated at the opposite side of the peninsula's end is Bandar Torkaman. The island of Ashuradeh lies off the eastern tip of the peninsula. Ecology Miankaleh peninsula is one of the richest ecological havens in West Asia and perhaps in the whole world. It is home to many unique Caspian bird and reptile species native to this region. It is also a very important internationally recognized refuge for migratory birds. Flora and fauna include: * Plants: Raspberry, common medlar, Mediterranean hackberry, Jerusalem thorn, Populus, Salsola, Cyperaceae, and Polygonum; * Fish: Common carp, Caspian white fish, zander, crucian carp, mullet; * Birds: Coot, purple swamphen, smew, flamingo, white- headed duck, red-breasted goose, whooper swan, black francolin, peregrine falcon, and little bustard; * Mammals: Wolf, jackal, fox, hedgehog, wild boar, Caspian seal. The peninsula, with Gorgan Bay, has been designated an International Wetland (Ramsar site) in 1975Ramsar sites database and an international UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1976.UNESCO biosphere reserve directory On the national level, it is protected under the \\"Wildlife Refuge\\" status by the Iranian Dept. of Environment.The Iranian Dept. of Environment Website =Siberian Tiger Introduction Project= One of the indigenous predators of Iran, the Caspian tiger, used to live in the north-western to north-eastern parts of the country. In 2010, a pair of Siberian tigers was sent from Russia to Iran's Tehran Zoological Garden in exchange for their Persian leopards. The Siberian tigers currently in captivity are set to be reintroduced in the wild to replace the Caspian tigers on the Miankaleh peninsula. Iran received two more pairs of Siberian tigers in 2012. Threats This nature reserve is vulnerable to industry and tourism. While tourism-related activities continue to pollute the area, the Iranian government plans to build a huge hotel complex right in the middle of this nature park. Parts of the peninsula have already been sold by the government for industrial and residential purposes. The number of migratory birds has fallen significantly during the past few years. Extensive fishing and hunting has damaged the ecological balance, and many species are either moribund or under threat of total extinction.

The Noongar names for the tree are colaille, gooloorto, koolert and moitch. This tree has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and large branches, smooth greyish bark above, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and bell-shaped, cup-shaped or hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus rudis is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The trunk is usually short and has a poor form with a wide-spreading crown. It has rough, dark and light grey box-style bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth greyish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and dull greyish green, egg-shaped to more or less round leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole wide. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, long and wide conical operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from July to November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, bell-shaped, cup-shaped or hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding strongly. North of Perth, E. rudis intergrades with Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. obtusa so the bark may be smooth and very similar to Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus rudis was first formally described in 1837 by Stephan Endlicher in Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de H√ºgel authored by Endlicher, Eduard Fenzl, George Bentham and Heinrich Wilhelm Schott from samples collected by Charles von H√ºgel around the Swan River Colony. In 1993, Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus rudis subsp. cratyantha Brooker and Hopper has buds up to long and fruit up to wide; * Eucalyptus rudis Endl. subsp. rudis has buds up to long and fruit up to wide. Distribution and habitat The tree is widespread from the Eneabba district (29¬∞ S. Lat.) southwards in the Darling Range, west central wheatbelt and high rainfall areas of south-west Western Australia commonly on watercourses, swampy ground or very occasionally on granite rock.Brooker & Kleinig, Field Guide to Eucalypts, Vol 2 South Western and Southern Australia, Bloomings Books, Melbourne, 2001, Subspecies cratyantha only occurs from Mandurah and Pinjarra south and south-west to Cape Naturaliste. Flooded gum occurs typically in open woodlands, associated species include with wandoo, Corymbia calophylla and Eucalyptus marginata. Ecology This tree is often heavily attacked in spring by insects, including leaf miners, leaf blister sawflies and lerps. The crown regenerates in late spring and into summer. Conservation status Subspecies rudis is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, but subspecies cratyantha is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. Uses The tree is relatively fast-growing with potential for remediation of land affected by moderate levels of salinity. Natural stands are used in the apiculture industry as a source of pollen producing a light amber honey. It is also being assessed as a fast-growing source of biomass for bioenergy and reconstituted wood products in the South West region. Historically it has been used as firewood but the wood also has potential for use as specialty timber. The heartwood is hard, cross grained and a yellow to light reddish brown colour. It has a green density is about kg/m3, and air-dried density about 775 kg/m3.

It is endemic to the Taita Hills region of southeast Kenya. Reproduction Boulengerula taitana is an egg-laying burrowing caecilian. Because young specimens do not have the same tooth structure as adults, Boulengerula taitana has developed a strange habit. Once the young have hatched, the mother develops a thick, nutritious skin which the young eat. This does not appear to harm the adult. This behaviour is also found in its South American relative Siphonops annulatus. The skin-feeding behavior of the young was captured on film for the BBC series Life in Cold Blood (released in 2008). Diet Generally, Boulengerula are believed to be predators of soil macrofauna. The large proportion of decaying plant material and unidentifiable organic matter in guts of Boulengerula taitana has led to a suggestion that it is an omnivore or detritivore. However, the organic matter and soil in their diet seems to originate from prey items such as earthworms. Other important dietary items are termites, dipteran larvae and other soil macrofauna. Habitat and conservation Boulengerula taitana occurs in montane forests and in secondary habitats, including plantation forests and cultivated land, at elevations of above sea level. It lives in soil, favouring moist soils rich in organic matter. It can be found in microhabitats such as under decomposing leaves, logs, and debris. It can also be found alongside permanent water, including drainage channels. Boulengerula taitana is locally abundant. It tolerates low- intensity agricultural practices, but is threatened by intensification of agriculture and deforestation. The overall population is believed to be declining. The forest fragments on the Taita Hills are protected by the Kenya Forest Service, but habitat disturbance still takes place. There are some plans for habitat rehabilitation.

Amsterdammertje is Dutch for 'little one from Amsterdam'. The bollards bear the three Saint Andrew's Crosses from the coat of arms of Amsterdam. Since the 1980s, the city council has been removing and selling Amsterdammertjes. __TOC__ History Around 1800, many people in Amsterdam started to use bollards to protect the pavement in front of their houses. These bollards were made of metal (originally old cannons, see also Bollards), stone, or wood. In the late 19th century the first cast iron bollards were made. From 1915 onwards there was a standard bollard of cast iron, weighing 70 kg, with three Saint Andrew's Crosses from the coat of arms of Amsterdam. This bollard already looked like the modern Amsterdammertje, although, amongst other differences, it was thinner and heavier. From 1972 the Amsterdammertjes were no longer made from expensive and heavy cast iron, but from plates of steel, approximately 1.35 m high and weighing only 20 kg. This type is currently used in the city; all 1915 type bollards have been replaced or removed. In 1984, there were approximately 100,000 Amsterdammertjes. As trucks ran over the Amsterdammertjes more and more frequently, cars were able to pass between, and the bollards were no longer effective. In their place, the pavements were elevated slightly in the 2000s. Around two thousand Amsterdammertjes are being removed every year. In 2003, there were 37,616 Amsterdammertjes left.

It fired the 7.92√ó33mm Kurz (or \\"Pistolenpatrone 7.9mm\\") intermediate cartridge at a cyclic rate of around 450 rounds per minute. Overview The early Mauser Ger√§t 06H prototype assault rifle StG 45(M) with a 10-round magazine inserted The origin of this rifle can be traced back to the final years of World War II when Mauser engineers at the Light Weapon Development Group (Abteilung 37) at Oberndorf am Neckar designed the MKb Ger√§t 06 (Maschinenkarabiner Ger√§t 06 or \\"machine carbine instrument 06\\") prototype assault rifle chambered for the intermediate 7.92√ó33mm Kurz cartridge, first with the Ger√§t 06 model using a roller-locked mechanism which was unique for being gas operated, as opposed to recoil operation, originally adapted from the MG 42 machine gun, but with a fixed barrel and conventional gas-actuated piston rod.Senich, Peter: The German Assault Rifle: 1935‚Äì1945, page 153. Paladin Press, 1987. After observing bolt-bounce during firing trails of the roller locked Ger√§t 03 prototype semi-automatic rifle Dr. Karl Maier, one of Mauser's scientists at the time, realized that with careful attention to the mechanical ratios, the gas system could be omitted.Do You Know Your HK‚Äôs Parents?Senich, 158 The resultant weapon, the Ger√§t 06H (the \\"H\\" suffix is an abbreviation for halbverriegelt or \\"half-locked\\") was assigned the designation StG 45(M) (Sturmgewehr 45(M)). Though appearing simple, developing the roller-delayed blowback firearm action was a hard technical and personal effort, as German engineering, mathematical and other scientists had to work together on a like-it-or-not basis led by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer, the director of Mauser Werke's Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Experiments showed roller-delayed blowback firearms exhibited bolt-bounce. To counter bolt- bounce the perfect angle choice on the nose of the bolt head had to be found. Mathematician Dr. Karl Maier provided analysis of the components, assemblies in the development project. In December 1943 Maier came up with an equation that engineers used to change the angles in the receiver to 45¬∞ and 27¬∞ on the locking piece relative to the longitudinal axis solving the bolt-bounce problem. With these angles the geometrical transmission ratio of the boltcarrier to the bolthead became 3:1, so the rear boltcarrier was forced to move three times faster than the bolthead. The rearward forces on the boltcarrier and receiver were 2:1. The force and impulse transmitted to the receiver increases with the force and impulse transmitted to the boltcarrier. Making the boltcarrier heavier lessens the recoil velocity. For Mausers Ger√§t 06H/StG 45(M) project Maier assumed a 120 g bolthead and 360 g boltcarrier (1 to 3 ratio). However, the design required that the bolt started moving while the bullet was still in the barrel and the spent case fully pressurized. Using traditionally cut chambers resulted in separated cartridge case heads during testing. This problem was solved by cutting 18 longitudinal gas relief flutes in the chamber. Fluting the end of the chamber allowed combustion gasses to float the neck and front of the cartridge case providing pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior. During the process, the front cartridge case would typically show blackened, longitudinal scorch marks around the diameter of the case which was characteristic for later roller- delayed blowback-operated small arms, which also used the fluted chamber principle. The roller-delayed blowback firearm action was patented by Mauser‚Äôs Wilhelm St√§hle and Ludwig Vorgrimler. Like the German FG 42 battle rifle/automatic rifle and Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle the StG 45(M) was one of the first inline firearms incorporating a \\"straight-line\\" recoil configuration. This layout places both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal axis of the barrel bore, a feature increasing controllability by reducing muzzle rise during burst or automatic fire.Senich, Peter: The German Assault Rifle: 1935‚Äì1945, page 239. Paladin Press, 1987. The elevated sight line over the bore axis layout was also adopted from these designs as it helps to extend the \\"battle zero\\" range. The current trend for elevated sights and flatter shooting higher-velocity intermediate cartridges in assault rifles is in part due to a desire to further extend the maximum point-blank range, which makes such a rifle easier to use. The StG 45(M) was intended to replace the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle, because the latter was rather expensive and time-consuming to produce. Compared to the StG44's cost of 70 Reichsmarks, the StG45(M)'s calculated cost was 45 Reichsmarks. Like the Sturmgewehr 44 the weapon made extensive use of for the 1940s advanced cost-saving pressed and stamped steel components rather than machined parts. Parts for only 30 complete rifles were produced before the war ended. The StG 45(M) had an elevated iron sights line over the bore axis in part to optimize the maximum point-blank range of the compared to full-power rifle cartridges modest external ballistic performance of the 7.92√ó33mm Kurz cartridge, ergonomics and recoil management. While the StG45(M) was intended to use the same 30-round magazine as its predecessor, the rifle is commonly pictured with the 10-round magazine designed for the Volkssturmgewehr. The shorter magazine was used by Mauser engineers during testing, as its lower profile was easier to use when test-firing at the Mauser facility range. Post‚ÄìWorld War II developments CEAM Mod√®le 1950, a French effort to put the StG 45(M) concept into mass production. Chambered in .30 Carbine. The German technicians involved in developing the Sturmgewehr 45 continued their research in France at CEAM. The StG45 mechanism was modified by Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor L√∂ffler at the Mulhouse facility between 1946 and 1949. Three versions were made, chambered in .30 Carbine, 7.92√ó33mm Kurz as well as the 7.65√ó35mm cartridge developed by Cartoucherie de Valence and adopted in 1948. A 7.5√ó38mm cartridge using a partial aluminium bullet was abandoned in 1947. L√∂ffler's design, designated the Carabine Mitrailleuse Mod√®le 1950, was retained for trials among 12 different prototypes designed by CEAM, MAC, and MAS. Vorgrimler later went to work at CETME in Spain and developed the line of CETME automatic rifles. Germany eventually purchased the licence for the CETME design and manufactured the Heckler & Koch G3 as well as an entire line of weapons built on the same system, one of the most famous being the MP5. A few other post‚ÄìWorld War II weapons used the roller-delayed locking system, such as the SIG SG 510.

After two games of third grade and just one of second, Donoghue cemented a first grade berth just four games into his career and stayed in the first grade team until retirement. His aggressive and relentless style of play ensured his rapid rise in the game. A Rabbitohs legend and favorite son, Denis Donoghue played ten seasons for South Sydney between 1948‚Äì1957, playing 171 first grade games for the club and became a multi premiership winner with them.Alan Whiticker- The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players, 2005 He won man of the match honors in Souths Sydney's losing Grand Final side against St George Dragons in 1949, and starred in their subsequent premierships in 1950 and 1951. Donoghue played in the controversial 1952 Grand Final loss to Western Suburbs, where the referee was accused of costing Souths the game. Winning back to back premierships in 1953-54, his last grand final appearance was in Souths miracle 1955 campaign. Losing stars Greg Hawick and Clive Churchill mid season and running equal last, the bunnies won 11 consecutive games to take out the championship, beating Newtown by a single point. Denis Donoghue was a fearsome, tough forward, and a crowd favorite at Redfern. Judges like Tom Goodman were quoted in the press at the time stating \\"he was the best front rower in the code\\". A rock-solid defender and strong runner of the ball, his specialty was scrummaging. He was the backbone of the South Sydney Rabbitohs pack, playing in seven grand finals and winning six of them. South Sydney‚Äôs unbroken run of grand final appearances that began in 1949 stopped in 1956 when they lost the qualifying final to Balmain by 3 points in controversial circumstances. Donoghue played one final season after this. He retired to the Wollongong competition in 1957, playing as captain-coach for one year at the Collegians, before returning to the South Sydney Rabbitohs as first grade coach for the next five seasons. Donoghue took up the position of club president following his tenure as coach with friend and teammate Clive Churchill coaching the bunnies through their last ‚ÄòGolden Era‚Äô during 1967-1971.http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org =Representative career= Donoghue's representative career was plagued by injury. He represented New South Wales on ten occasions between 1950-1954. He also played in the winning 1951 City side that defeated Country, receiving man of the match honors. Donoghue was selected to represent Sydney against France during their 1951 tour of Australasia in a match that ended in a 19-all draw. Donoghue was also part of the now infamous 1954 match between NSW and England at the Sydney Cricket Ground where referee Aub Oxford turned his back and walked off as almost all players stopped playing the game and commenced street brawling.

There exist both traditions of religious music, as sung at the synagogue and domestic prayers, and of secular music, such as klezmer. While some elements of Jewish music may originate in biblical times, differences of rhythm and sound can be found among later Jewish communities that have been musically influenced by location. In the nineteenth century, religious reform led to composition of ecclesiastic music in the styles of classical music. At the same period, academics began to treat the topic in the light of ethnomusicology. Edward Seroussi has written, \\"What is known as 'Jewish music' today is thus the result of complex historical processes\\".Seroussi et al., (n.d.) A number of modern Jewish composers have been aware of and influenced by the different traditions of Jewish music. Religious Jewish music =Religious Jewish music in the biblical period= The history of religious Jewish music spans the evolution of cantorial, synagogal, and Temple melodies since Biblical times. The earliest synagogal music of which we have any account was based on the system used in the Temple in Jerusalem. The Mishnah gives several accounts of Temple music.See, e.g. Mishnah Sukkot, chapter 5, on website of Oceanside Jewish Centre, accessed 8 June 2014. According to the Mishnah, the regular Temple orchestra consisted of twelve instruments, and a choir of twelve male singers.Jonathan L. Friedmann, \\"The Choir in Jewish History\\", Jewish Magazine website, accessed 8 June 2014. The instruments included the kinnor (lyre), nevel (harp), shofar (ram's horn), ·∏•atzotz·µärot (trumpet) and three varieties of pipe, the chalil, alamoth and the uggav.Idelsohn (1992), 9‚Äì13. The Temple orchestra also included a cymbal (tziltzal) made of copper.Idelsohn (1992), 15. The Talmud also mentions use in the Temple of a pipe organ (magrepha), and states that the water organ was not used in the Temple as its sounds were too distracting.Idelsohn (1992), 14. No provable examples of the music played at the Temple have survived.Idelsohn (1992), 18. However, there is an oral tradition that the tune used for Kol Nidrei was sung in the temple. After the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD and the subsequent dispersion of the Jews to Babylon and Persia, versions of the public singing of the Temple were continued in the new institution of the synagogue. Three musical forms were identified by scholars of the period, involving different modes of antiphonal response between cantor congregation: the cantor singing a half-verse at a time, with the congregation making a constant refrain; the cantor singing a half-verse, with the congregation repeating exactly what he had sung; and the cantor and congregation singing alternate verses. All of these forms can be discerned in parts of the modern synagogue service.Idelsohn (1992), 19‚Äì21. =Jewish prayer modes= Jewish liturgical music is characterized by a set of musical modes. These modes make up musical nusach, which serves to both identify different types of prayer, as well as to link those prayers to the time of year, or even time of day in which they are set. There are three main modes, as well as a number of combined or compound modes. The three main modes are called Ahavah Rabbah, Magein Avot and Adonai Malach. Traditionally, the cantor (chazzan) improvised sung prayers within the designated mode, while following a general structure of how each prayer should sound. There was no standard form of musical notation utilised by the Jews and these modes and synagogue melodies derived from them were therefore handed down directly, typically from a chazzan to his apprentice meshorrer (descant). Since the late eighteenth century, many of these chants have been written down and standardized, yet the practice of improvisation still exists to this day. The synagogal reading of the parashah (the weekly extract from the Torah) and the haftarah (section from the Prophets), may recall the melodic tropes of the actual Temple service. Ashkenazic Jews named this official cantillation 'neginot' and it is represented in printed Hebrew versions of the Bible by a system of cantillation marks (sometimes referred to as neumes). In practice the cantillation often echoes the tones and rhythms of the countries and ages in which Jews lived, notably as regards the modality in which the local music was based. =Traditional religious music= Synagogues following traditional Jewish rites do not employ musical instruments as part of the synagogue service. Traditional synagogal music is therefore purely vocal. The principal melodic role in the service is that of the hazzan (cantor). Responses of the congregation are typically monophonic‚Äîthe introduction of a choir singing in harmony was largely a nineteenth-century innovation. However, during the mediaeval period among Ashkenazi Jews there developed the tradition of the hazzan being accompanied for certain prayers by a bass voice (known in Yiddish as singer) and a descant (in Yiddish, meshorrer). This combination was known in Yiddish as keleichomos.Conway (2012), 21. \\"Emet El Shmeha\\", traditional Jewish 17th century song. There are many forms of song which are used in Jewish religious services and ceremonies. The following are notable examples. With the piyyutim (liturgical poems‚Äîsingular: piyut), dating from the first millennium after the destruction of the Temple, one stream of Jewish synagogal music began to crystallize into definite form. The hazzan sang the piyyutim to melodies either selected by themselves or drawn from tradition. Piyyutim have been written since Mishnaic times. Most piyyutim are in Hebrew or Aramaic, and most follow some poetic scheme, such as an acrostic following the order of the Hebrew alphabet or spelling out the name of the author. A well-known piyyut is Adon Olam (\\"Master of the World\\"), sometimes attributed to Solomon ibn Gabirol in 11th century Spain. Pizmonim are traditional Jewish songs and melodies praising God and describing certain aspects of traditional religious teachings. Pizmonim are traditionally associated with Middle Eastern Sephardic Jews, although they are related to Ashkenazi Jews' zemirot (see below). One tradition is associated with Jews descended from Aleppo, though similar traditions exist among Iraqi Jews (where the songs are known as shba÷¥hoth, praises) and in North African countries. Jews of Greek, Turkish and Balkan origin have songs of the same kind in Ladino, associated with the festivals: these are known as coplas. Some melodies are quite old, while others may be based on popular Middle Eastern music, with the words composed specially to fit the tune. Zemirot are hymns, usually sung in the Hebrew or Aramaic languages, but sometimes also in Yiddish or Ladino. The words to many zemirot are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the Middle Ages. Others are anonymous folk songs. The baqashot are a collection of supplications, songs, and prayers that have been sung for centuries by the Sephardic Aleppian Jewish community and other congregations every Sabbath eve from midnight until dawn. The custom of singing baqashot originated in Spain towards the time of the expulsion, but took on increased momentum in the Kabbalistic circle in Safed in the 16th century, and were spread from Safed by the followers of Isaac Luria (16th century). Baqashot reached countries all round the Mediterranean and even became customary for a time in Sephardic communities in western Europe, such as Amsterdam and London. Nigun (pl. nigunim) refers to religious songs and tunes that are sung either by individuals or groups; they are associated with the Hassidic movement. Nigunim are generally wordless. =Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century synagogue music= Changes in European Jewish communities, including increasing political emancipation and some elements of religious reform, had their effects on music of the synagogue. By the late eighteenth century, music in European synagogues had sunk to a low standard. The Jewish scholar Eric Werner notes that among the European Ashkenazi communities of Europe \\"between 1660 and 1720 the musical tradition was waning, and the second half of the eighteenth century witnessed its worst decay\\".Werner (1976), p. 169 The historian of Jewish music Abraham Zevi Idelsohn considers that \\"Eighteenth century manuscripts of Synagogue song display a striking monotony of style and texts\\".Idelsohn (1992), p. 213 In this context the English music historian Charles Burney visiting the Ashkenazi synagogue of Amsterdam in 1772, gave the opinion of one who was clearly ignorant of synagogue music (but did not regard that as a disqualification for comment) that the service resembled \\"a kind of tol- de rol, instead of words, which to me, seemed very farcical\\".Conway (2012), p. 21 Others in England were more sympathetic to the synagogue service. The singing of the chazan Myer Lyon inspired the Methodist minister Thomas Olivers in 1770 to adapt the melody of the hymn Yigdal for a Christian hymn, The God of Abraham Praise.Conway (2012), 76. Many synagogue melodies were used by Isaac Nathan in his 1815 settings of Lord Byron's Hebrew Melodies, and the popularity of this work drew the attention of Gentiles for the first time to this music (although in fact many of Nathan's melodies were not Jewish in origin, but contrafacta adapted from European folk melodies).Conway (2012), 93‚Äì97. Franz Schubert around 1828 made a choral setting of Psalm 92 in Hebrew for the Vienna chazan Salomon Sulzer.Conway (2012), 135. A score is available at IMSLP German congregations commissioned works from other Gentile composers, including Albert Methfessel (1785‚Äì1869).Conway (2012), 156‚Äì7. Later in the century, as synagogues began to utilize choirs singing in Western harmony, a number of hazzanim, who had received formal training in Western music, began to compose works for the synagogue, many of which are still in use today in the congregations of their countries. These included Sulzer in Vienna,Conway (2012), 133‚Äì6 Samuel Naumbourg in Paris,Conway (2012), 219‚Äì20 Louis Lewandowski in Berlin,Conway (2012), 158 and Julius Mombach in London.Conway (2012), 103‚Äì4 =Contemporary Jewish religious music= Secular Jewish music Secular Jewish music (and dances) have been influenced both by surrounding Gentile traditions and Jewish sources preserved over time. =Klezmer= Around the 15th century, a tradition of secular (non-liturgical) Jewish music was developed by musicians called kleyzmorim or kleyzmerim by Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe. The repertoire is largely dance songs for weddings and other celebrations. They are typically in Yiddish. =Sephardic/Ladino= Sephardic music was born in medieval Spain, with canciones being performed at the royal courts. Since then, it has picked up influences from across Spain, Morocco, Argentina, Turkey, Greece and various popular tunes from Spain and further abroad. There are three types of Sephardic songs‚Äîtopical and entertainment songs, romance songs and spiritual or ceremonial songs. Lyrics can be in several languages, including Hebrew for religious songs, and Ladino. These song traditions spread from Spain to Morocco (the Western Tradition) and several parts of the Ottoman Empire (the Eastern Tradition) including Greece, Jerusalem, the Balkans and Egypt. Sephardic music adapted to each of these locals, assimilating North African high-pitched, extended ululations; Balkan rhythms, for instance in 9/8 time; and the Turkish maqam mode.  Jewish art music  =Preclassical, classical, romantic and 20th-century composers= Salamone Rossi (1570 ‚Äì c. 1630) of Mantua composed a series of choral settings called \\"The Songs of Solomon\\", based on Jewish liturgical and biblical texts. Most art musicians of Jewish origin in the 19th century composed music that cannot be considered Jewish in any sense. In the words of Peter Gradenwitz, from this period onwards, the issue is \\"no longer the story of Jewish music, but the story of music by Jewish masters.\\"Gradenwitz (1996), pp. 174‚Äì5. Jacques Offenbach (1819‚Äì1880), a leading composer of operetta in the 19th century, was the son of a cantor, and grew up steeped in traditional Jewish music. Yet there is nothing about his music which could be characterized as Jewish in terms of style, and he himself did not consider his work to be Jewish. Felix Mendelssohn, the grandson of the Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, continued to acknowledge his Jewish origins, even though he was baptized as a Reformed Christian at the age of seven. He occasionally drew inspiration from Christian sources, but there is nothing characteristically Jewish about any of his music. =The Jewish national revival in art music= At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries many Jewish composers sought to create a distinctly Jewish national sound in their music. Notable among these were the composers of the St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Folkmusic. Led by composer-critic Joel Engel, these graduates of the St. Petersburg and Moscow Conservatories rediscovered their Jewish national roots, and created a new genre of Jewish art music. Inspired by the nationalist movement in Russian music, exemplified by Rimsky-Korsakov, Cui and others, these Jewish composers set out to the \\"shtetls\\"‚Äîthe Jewish villages of Russia‚Äîand meticulously recorded and transcribed thousands of Yiddish folksongs. They then set these songs to both vocal and instrumental ensembles. The resulting music is a marriage between often melancholy and \\"krekhtsen\\" (moaning) melodies of the shtetl with late Russian romantic harmonies of Scriabin and Rachmaninoff. The Jewish national revival in music was not only in Russia. A number of Western European composers took an interest in their Jewish musical roots, and tried to create a unique Jewish art style. Ernest Bloch (1880‚Äì1959), a Swiss composer who emigrated to the United States, composed Schelomo for cello and orchestra, Suite Hebraique for violin and piano, and Sacred Service, which is the first attempt to set the Jewish service in a form similar to the Requiem, for full orchestra, choir and soloists. Bloch described his connection to Jewish music as intensely personal: > It is not my purpose, nor my desire, to attempt a 'reconstitution' of Jewish > music, or to base my work on melodies more or less authentic. I am not an > archeologist.... It is the Jewish soul that interests me ... the freshness > and naivet√© of the Patriarchs; the violence of the Prophetic books; the > Jewish savage love of justice...Quoted in Mary Tibaldi Chiesa, \\"Ernest Bloch > - The Jewish Composer\\" in Musica Hebraica, Volume 1‚Äì2 (Jerusalem, 1938) As a child in Aix-en-Provence, Darius Milhaud (1892‚Äì1974) was exposed to the music of the Proven√ßal Jewish community. \\"I have been greatly influenced by the character\\" of this music, he wrote.Darius Milhaud, La Musique Juive au Comtat-Venaissin in Musica Hebraica, Volume 1‚Äì2 (Jerusalem, 1938) His opera Esther de Carpentras draws on this rich musical heritage. Mario Castelnuovo- Tedesco (1895‚Äì1968), an Italian composer who immigrated to America on the eve of World War II, was strongly influenced by his Sephardic Jewish upbringing. His second violin concerto draws on Jewish themes, as do many of his songs and choral works: these include a number of songs in Ladino, the language of Sephardic Jews. Israeli music =Art music in Mandatory Palestine and Israel= The 1930s saw an influx of Jewish composers to British Mandatory Palestine, later Israel, among them musicians of stature in Europe. These composers included Paul Ben-Haim, Erich Walter Sternberg, Marc Lavry, √ñd√∂n P√°rtos, and Alexander Uriah Boskovich. These composers were all concerned with forging a new Jewish identity in music, an identity which would suit the new, emerging identity of Israel. While the response of each of these composers to this challenge was intensely personal, there was one distinct trend to which many of them adhered: many of these and other composers sought to distance themselves from the musical style of the Klezmer, which they viewed as weak and unsuitable for the new national ethos. Many of the stylistic features of Klezmer were abhorrent to them. \\"Its character is depressing and sentimental\\", wrote music critic and composer Menashe Ravina in 1943. \\"The healthy desire to free ourselves of this sentimentalism causes many to avoid this...\\".Menashe Ravina, The Songs of the Land of Israel, monograph published by the Institute for Music, Ltd., Jerusalem, 1943 From these early experiments a large corpus of original Israeli art music has been developed. Modern Israeli composers include Betty Olivero, Tsippi Fleischer, Mark Kopytman and Yitzhak Yedid. =Israeli folk= From the earliest days of Zionist settlement, Jewish immigrants wrote popular folk music. At first, songs were based on borrowed melodies from German, Russian, or traditional Jewish folk music with new lyrics written in Hebrew. Starting in the early 1920s, however, Jewish immigrants made a conscious effort to create a new Hebrew style of music, a style that would tie them to their earliest Hebrew origins and that would differentiate them from the style of the Jewish diaspora of Eastern Europe, which they viewed as weak.Edel, Itzhak (1946) \\"HaShir HaEretz-Yisraeli\\" (\\"The Songs of the Land of Israel\\") (Tel Aviv: Monograph published by Merkaz HaTarbut, Histadrut). This new style borrowed elements from Arabic and, to a lesser extent, traditional Yemenite and eastern Jewish styles: the songs were often homophonic (that is, without clear harmonic character), modal, and limited in range. \\"The huge change in our lives demands new modes of expression\\", wrote composer and music critic Menashe Ravina in 1943. \\"... and, just as in our language we returned to our historical past, so has our ear turned to the music of the east ... as an expression of our innermost feelings.\\"Menashe Ravina, \\"The Songs of the People of Israel\\", published by Hamossad Lemusika Ba'am, 1943 Your Land, a Hebrew song adapted to a traditional Bedouin Melody. The youth, labor and kibbutz movements played a major role in musical development before and after the establishment of Israeli statehood in 1948, and in the popularization of these songs. The Zionist establishment saw music as a way of establishing a new national identity, and, on a purely pragmatic level, of teaching Hebrew to new immigrants. The national labor organization, the Histadrut, set up a music publishing house that disseminated songbooks and encouraged public sing-alongs (◊©◊ô◊®◊î ◊ë◊¶◊ô◊ë◊ï◊®). This tradition of public sing-alongs continues to the present day, and is a characteristic of modern Israeli culture. =Mizrahi= Mizrahi music usually refers to the new wave of music in Israel which combines Israeli music with the flavor of Arabic and Mediterranean (especially Greek) music. Typical Mizrahi songs will have a dominant violin or string sound as well as Middle Eastern percussion elements. Mizrahi music is usually high pitched. Zohar Argov is a popular singer whose music typifies the Mizrahi music style. Non-Jewish composers using Jewish music A number of non-Jewish composers have adapted Jewish music to their compositions. They include: * Maurice Ravel wrote M√©lodies h√©bra√Øques for violin and piano. * Max Bruch, a German Protestant, (but a student of the German Jewish composer Ferdinand Hiller) made an arrangement, Kol Nidrei, of the Jewish Yom Kippur prayer Kol Nidre for cello and orchestra.Conway (2012), 193. * Sergei Prokofiev wrote Overture on Hebrew Themes, an arrangement of traditional Jewish folksongs for clarinet, string quartet, and piano. * Dmitri Shostakovich incorporated elements of Jewish music in some of his compositions. Most notable are the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry, and the 13th symphony, titled Babi Yar.  See also  *List of Jewish musicians *Klezmer Notes  References  Bibliography * Burney, Charles, ed.

It is 328 ft. above sea-level, on the northwest slope of the Pratomagno mountain chain. The village of Vallombrosa (\\"shaded valley\\") lies among forests, and was originally the location of a hermitage dedicated to Santa Maria d'Acquabella. Later, the large Benedictine Vallombrosa Abbey was built and remains a major landmark of the region. The Abbey can accommodate a limited number of visitors. Vallombrosa is a toponym which indicates both a forest located on the southern slopes of Pratomagno, and a place, located within this forest, in the territory of Commune of Reggello. The Reggello Vallombrosa meteorological station is located there. In the Vallombrosa area there is the homonymous nature reserve, as well as the renowned Vallombrosa Arboretum and a vast lawn, very popular in the summer period, especially by the inhabitants of Florence looking for rustic relaxation. Vallombrosa as a tourist destination The fame of the Vallombrosa-Saltino complex as a health resort was born in the second half of 19th century, and reached its peak at the beginning of the 20th century, thanks in part to the railway Sant'Ellero-Saltino, long since abandoned. Italy's annexation of Trentino following WWI led to a decided loss of interest for Vallombrosa and Saltino, as Italian vacationers preferred the new Alpine destinations, relegating those two vacation spots to a local interest. Despite this constant decline, the town seemed to find, starting in 1960, a tourist revitalization with the construction of a ski resort on the peak of the neighboring Monte Secchieta. The natural ski area that was created allowed Vallombrosa, thanks to its proximity to Florence, to offer an elitist tourist image compared to other mountain tourist resorts in Tuscany. The closure of the ski facilities, which took place in 1988, was not followed up, partially due to lively controversy over the environmental damage that might result from invasive plant species. The closure left the site without the possibility of offering alternatives to tourists in the winter period.

Comparison Compared to the 1998 Yangtze River Floods, this flooding was more severe in terms of total flow of water, but less in terms of the highest level that the flood water reached. This is probably a result of the intense logging on the banks of the upper reach of Yangtze River during the later part of the 20th century.

His life span covered the period of the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648) which was a Dutch Revolt against Spain resulting in the secession of seven provinces that came to form the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. At the time of his birth, Antwerp was the most prominent harbor of Western Europe. Over the first half of the 16th century, also known as its Golden Age, Antwerp grew to become the second largest European city north of the Alps.Focus on the Port: Port History http://www.portofantwerp.com/portal/page/portal/POA_EN/Focus%20op%20de%20haven/Havengeschiedenis The religious revolution of the Reformation erupted in Antwerp with violent riots in August 1566, the Eighty Years' War followed shortly. The Spanish Crown succeeded in recapturing parts of the southern provinces of Flanders and Brabant. In 1579 the city of Antwerp joined the Union of Utrecht and became the capital of the Dutch revolt. In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, eventually captured Antwerp after a long siege. As part of the terms of surrender of Antwerp, its Protestant citizens were given four years to settle their affairs before quitting the city.Alfons K. L.

There he saw the wealth that was produced by the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Some time after the seizure of Antwerp by the Spanish in 1585, Usselincx moved to the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, first to Middelburg and later to Amsterdam. He was convinced that the Netherlands would win independence and should capture colonies from Spain and Portugal.

Like his friend Usselincx, Peter Minuit had also been disappointed by the Dutch West India Company and was replaced as governor of New Amsterdam. As early as 1626, Usselinx had described the advantages to Sweden of contributing in an overseas venture. He referred to the wealth acquired by Spain and The Netherlands in similar enterprises and extolled Sweden's resources for success in the marketplace. Usselinx received royal privileges from king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden for a trading company. The king commissioned Usselinx to raise the capital for the Swedish South Company through stock subscriptions in Sweden and its territories.which included parts of Norway and Finland, parts of the Baltic states, parts of Germany and parts of Denmark. Usselincx relocated from The Netherlands to Sweden but the process of the founding of the new company was difficult and time consuming,because of the wars Sweden was involved in (with the catholics in the south), there were many setbacks, most of the funds he raised for the company were initially even used by the king for building a military fleet. despite the support of Axel Oxenstierna, Swedish Lord High Chancellor. Its charter included Swedish, Dutch, and German stockholders led by directors of the New Sweden Company. In 1637, Minuit made arrangements with the Swedish government to create New Sweden, the first Swedish colony in the New World. But by that time, Usselincx was largely financially ruined due to bad investments and unable to profit from his vision. Between 1638 and 1655, the company sponsored 11 expeditions to Delaware in 14 separate voyages (two did not survive). In 1649 the Swedish South Company lost its monopoly on tobacco, granted by the king of Sweden in 1641. In 1655 New Sweden was annexed by New Netherland, this brought an end to the activities of the Swedish South Company, it was dissolved in 1680. The Swedish East India Company (Swedish: Svenska Ostindiska Companiet or SOIC) would not be founded until 1731 for the purpose of conducting trade with the far east.Account of Willem Usselincx and the South, Ship, and West India Companies of Sweden (translated by Gregory B.

Opened in the last decade of the nineteenth century, it was part of a drive by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to develop holiday traffic to Cornwall. The LSWR had opened a line connecting Exeter with Holsworthy in 1879, and by encouraging the North Cornwall Railway it planned to create railway access to previously inaccessible parts of the northern coastal area. \\"There are few more fascinating lines than the one which leads to North Cornwall from Okehampton\\" says T.W.E. Roche in his popular tribute to the network of railway lines operated by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in North and West Devon and North Cornwall. History =First railways= In the nineteenth century, Padstow was an important fishing port, but it was hampered by lack of land communication with its markets. The Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway opened in 1834, but it limited its horizons to connecting the harbour at Wadebridge to the immediate hinterland. Trunk railway connection reached Cornwall with the opening of the Cornwall Railway in 1859, allied with the associated companies which formed the alliance led by the Great Western Railway, whose lines used the broad gauge. The Cornwall Railway ran east to west in the southern part of the county, and it had exhausted its financial resources in building its line through the difficult terrain. The struggle to achieve dominance in Cornwall had been fierce and the rival London and South Western Railway (LSWR) had the intention of having a line in the county; in 1847 it had purchased the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway, at a time when the nearest section of its own network was at Bishopstoke (Eastleigh). Finding the necessity of concentrating its resources further east, it had been unable to make progress towards connecting Cornwall into its system. =The LSWR reaches Devon= Through the medium of nominally independent local companies, the LSWR had reached Lidford (now spelt Lydford) in Devon in 1874, giving it access to Plymouth over the South Devon Railway, and in 1879 it built a branch from Meldon Junction, west of Okehampton, to Holsworthy in north west Devon. Now the LSWR had the opportunity to enter Cornwall, and to connect with its isolated Bodmin and Wadebridge line. A North Cornwall Railway company, supported by the LSWR, was formed to develop the northern part of the Cornish peninsula; its line was to leave the Holsworthy line (which was later extended to become the Okehampton to Bude Line) at Halwill and continue through Launceston to Wadebridge. The prospectus of the North Cornwall company indicated that a further extension of would be required to bring the railway from Wadebridge to the county town of Truro. =Opening in stages= The North Cornwall Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 18 August 1882, but money was scarce and construction was slow, so it was not until 21 July 1886 that the first section opened, and the line was completed in 1899. (In fact to facilitate raising capital, the Company was segmented into several sections for financial purposes; the total authorised capital was ¬£660,000 with borrowing powers of ¬£220,000.) The LSWR was to work the line for 55% of gross receipts. The line was opened in stages: * Halwill to Launceston; ; 21 July 1886 * Launceston to Tresmeer; ; 28 July 1892Wilson says 21 July 1892. * Tresmeer to Camelford; ; 14 August 1893 * Camelford to Delabole; ; 18 October 1893 * Delabole to Wadebridge; ; 1 June 1895 * Wadebridge to Padstow; ; 27 March 1899. The Great Western Railway (GWR) already had a station at Launceston, opened in 1865, and the North Cornwall Railway station was built adjacent to it. At Wadebridge, the line joined with the Bodmin and Wadebridge line; the original station had been expanded when the GWR line from Bodmin was opened in 1888. =Commercial potential= The fishing activity at Padstow had long been declining, and the LSWR had hopes of reviving it. Their wishes were realised and a substantial increase of fish tonnage carried was experienced over the first years; a special connection to the fish quay had been provided. Tourist and holiday passenger traffic was also sought, as by the end of the nineteenth century this business was well established at comparable locations. There was a large slate quarry at Delabole, at the time said to be the largest man-made excavation in the world and considerable traffic was derived from that. However apart from Launceston and Wadebridge the very long single-track line served only small rural communities, and never achieved the importance that its promoters had hoped for. Fish traffic and ice for the ships were always important commodities on the line, as was the seasonal holidaymaker traffic for Padstow and several resorts served indirectly by the railway. =Takeover by the LSWR= Worked throughout its existence by the LSWR, the North Cornwall Line was dependent on the larger company, and in 1894 terms were agreed for a sale to the LSWR: =On to Penzance?= In 1894, with rapid progress being made in building the line, a parliamentary notice was issued for a line from Padstow to Newquay and Truro, and from there with running powers over the GWR to Falmouth and Penzance. However this was an aspiration for which there was no possibility of raising the necessary finance,Williams, page 279 and the proposal came to nothing, but the GWR were concerned at this planned penetration, and it is said that this prompted the scheme to build a line from Truro to Newquay. This became the Atlantic Coast Line, which links the GWR mainline at Par to Newquay. In 1905 powers were granted to provide a line to Newquay diverging in the vicinity of Bodmin Road. Proposals for light railways in the country between Padstow and Newquay continued until 1911, but none came to anything. =Padstow harbour improvements= In 1911 a scheme was developed to improve the fishing harbour arrangements at Padstow; this was supported by the government and the LSWR; the Company alone spent ¬£10,350 on the dock wall and sidings and sheds, and took up ¬£30,000 of the Harbour Commissioners' bonds. The work was completed by 1920, by which time the LSWR was the dominant partner in the operation of the harbour. =Financial reconstruction= The building of the North Cornwall Line had been undertaken by four different financial entities for reasons of raising finance at a difficult time. In 1912 the LSWR chairman, Herbert Walker, proposed a capital reconstruction under which a single North Cornwall Railway Leased Line stock would be created from the four subsidiaries; ¬£825,000 of capital was transferred in this way, the arrangement receiving Parliamentary authority on 15 August 1913. =Grouping of the railways, and nationalisation= Under the terms of the Railways Act 1921, the railway companies of Great Britain were to be amalgamated into four \\"groups\\"; the new Southern group was to include the LSWR (as a \\"constituent\\"), and the North Cornwall Railway was to be absorbed: the Company was still in existence as an entity although the line was worked as an intrinsic part of the LSWR. This process of \\"grouping\\" took practical effect at the beginning of 1923, although a number of technical requirements resulted in the official transfer dates varying. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1947 the railways of Great Britain passed into national ownership at the beginning of 1948. Closure Throughout its existence the North Cornwall line had operated against the odds, its long line serving sparsely populated and relatively unproductive terrain. As the costs of unproductive railway operation came into focus following the Beeching Report, the line had only its romantic appeal to offer, with even the highly seasonal summer holiday traffic falling away in the face of road transport and more attractive destinations. It closed on 3 October 1966, the Wadebridge to Padstow section continuing to be served by Bodmin trains until it too closed on 28 January 1967. Train services The thin population meant that little intermediate traffic was generated, and a passenger service of four or five daily trains was operated almost throughout the life of the line. The route between Launceston and Padstow was not designed for speed. The single line route required several sections at a gradient of 1 in 73 to allow for the rise from near Sea Level at Padstow to a summit at 860 feet above Sea Level between Camelford and Otterham and the line constantly curved, typically with a radius of 30 chains, in order to follow the contours and avoid costly earthworks. The result was a typical journey from Halwill to Padstow that occupied 90 to 100 minutes down and up to 110 minutes in the up direction. These times were reduced over the years with more powerful locomotives so that by the 1940s journey times between Launceston and Padstow were typically 80 minutes in the down direction and 90 minutes in the up. The maximum speed permitted on the North Cornwall line was 55 mph. The 1938 Bradshaw's Railway Guide shows five down and six up trains a day (Monday to Friday) on the line, plus a first up train from Launceston to Halwill and a last up train from Padstow to Launceston, and a last down train from Halwill to Launceston. All the trains called at all stations with the exception of the Atlantic Coast Express, the 11:00 from Waterloo, which ran non-stop Exeter St Davids to Halwill, then Launceston, Otterham, Camelford, Delabole, Port Isaac Road and Wadebridge, arriving in Padstow at 4:24 after a journey. The train conveyed a restaurant car throughout. The Saturday service was similar, although congestion earlier in the journey meant a slightly slower journey. There was no Sunday service. Tender engines were preferred on the line, the Adams Jubilee class being dominant at first, supplanted by the T9 class 4-4-0 being dominant in the Edwardian era. Until the mid-1940s the weight restriction over Meldon Viaduct and the short turntable at Padstow prevented anything larger than the Southern Railway mixed traffic 2-6-0 types from working over the line. However, after the turntable was replaced, the Bulleid Light Pacific locomotives were able to use the line. On summer Saturdays in the 1950s, some trains loaded to ten coaches, and in that era the Standard 2-6-4T class came into use on the line. While the GWR could easily serve major Devon and Cornwall resorts on its main line and branches, the rugged North Cornwall terrain prevented this. However Southern National omnibus connections gave journey options: Tintagel and Boscastle had good connections from Camelford, Newquay from Wadebridge, and Bedruthan and Trevone Bay from Padstow. Otterham is marked in the timetable as being the \\"Station for Wilsey Down and Davidstow (2¬Ω miles) and Crackington Haven (5 miles)\\". By 1964 the passenger service had declined to four trains a day plus a Halwill to Launceston short return journey. Motive power in later years had been the T9 4-4-0 Greyhounds and the N class 2-6-0s but with Bulleid Pacifics, often on uneconomically short trains, putting in an appearance. Topography =Route= The North Cornwall line crossed Petherick Creek on this three-span iron bridge, now used to carry the Camel Trail cycleway From Halwill the line describes a loop turning from north to south west; it runs downhill at gradients of 1 in 74 and 1 in 82 to join the valley of the River Carey, following this down for nearly to cross the River Tamar just east of Launceston, the first station actually in Cornwall. From a summit at Otterham, 800 feet (244 m), the line descends into the upper reaches of the Camel valley, passing through Camelford Station over 2 miles west of Camelford town and then leaving the valley for a gentle climb to the coastal uplands. At Delabole the line skirts the slate quarry, and then descends to the Allen valley, diving briefly through Trelill Tunnel (333 yards, 304 m), before returning to the Camel valley, crossing the river and joining the Bodmin and Wadebridge line into Wadebridge station. Once past Wadebridge the character changes as the line hugs the tidal River Camel until crossing Little Petherick Creek over a three-span iron bridge and rounding Dennis Hill, it reaches Padstow station which was located on a narrow strip of reclaimed land with the Atlantic Ocean, visible in the distance. =Stations= Map of stations on the North Cornwall Railway Halwill and Beaworthy; LSWR station on the Holsworthy line; renamed Halwill Junction March 1887 Ashwater;see Ashwater railway station Tower Hill; see Tower Hill railway station (Devon) Launceston ; the first station on the line in Cornwall, adjacent to the GWR station. '; Egloskerry station opened on 3 October 1892, and had a simple layout with only four points. There was a passing loop, and the station building and signal box were both located on the up platform, with a siding behind serving cattle pens. There was a level crossing at the down end of the station immediately at the platforms' end, the only one between Launceston and Wadebridge. The population of the surrounding area dropped between the building of the railway in the early 1890s and closure in the 1960s; it was always sparse and revenue poor resulting in various economies over the years. In the late 1920s responsibility for the station was passed to the Stationmaster at Otterham, and in 1930 the block instruments were moved from the signalbox to the Booking Office under the charge of a porter-signalman. The goods facilities closed on 9 May 1961 and the goods sidings were removed the following year. The station closed on 3 October 1966. The former station building is now a guest house. The old station of Tresmeer Tresmeer; Tresmeer station was located in a nearby hamlet, Splatt, and was the closest station to Crackington Haven; this kept passenger numbers up until a bus from Launceston started running in 1935. The station was due to open on 1 July 1892 but a landslip in an adjacent cutting delayed this until 28 July. As at all stations on the line there was a passing loop here, with the station building on the down platform and signal box on the up platform. A single siding behind the down platform gave access to a goods shed and loading dock; goods facilities officially ceased in September 1964 although the line to the loading dock had been removed three months earlier. The siding and passing loop were officially taken out of use on 14 November 1964, with the station becoming unstaffed on 6 January 1965. The station closed on 3 October 1966. The Station is now a guest house. '; Otterham station opened on 14 August 1893 Southern Region Record by R.H.Clark was situated in bleak sparsely populated country at the junction of the A39 and the B3262. At above sea level it occupied the most exposed section of the line, open to the fury of Atlantic gales in winter - the LSWR planted a group of Scots Pines on the embankment above the down platform to provide some shelter from weather. A footpath linked the station with the village, which was more than a mile away: by road the distance was . Otterham Station was also the name of a hamlet which grew up near the station. The down platform was provided with a waiting shelter while the station building and signal box were on the up platform; all three were built of local stone. A single siding on the up side provided access to a loading dock, but there was no goods shed. A second siding parallel to the first was added later. In 1928 Otterham returned the lowest ticket sales on the line. The station was host to a Southern Railway camping coach from 1935 to 1939. Following the withdrawal of goods facilities on the line on 7 September 1964, the passing loop, sidings, and signal box were officially taken out of use on 7 February 1965, and the trackwork was removed that October. Under the Western Region the station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and appeared as Otterham Halt in WR timetables. The station closed on 3 October 1966, and for many years after closure operated as a caravan site. More recently a new road of houses has occupied the trackbed at the eastern end of the old platforms.The station building is now a private residence. Camelford; Camelford station in 1971 looking towards Launceston from the now-demolished road bridge. Photo by Roger Geach The former station building at Camelford station is now a private residence and former cycle museum Camelford station was situated more than from the town \\"at a road junction in wild country almost devoid of trees\\". The station had a passing loop with the station building (including canopy) and signal box on the up platform. Like the waiting shelter on the down platform, the buildings were constructed from local stone. As elsewhere on the line, no footbridge was provided. Cattle pens were provided on the single siding, with the goods shed on a loop between the siding and headshunt. The station opened on 14 August 1893, with station signs proclaiming \\"Camelford for Boscastle and Tintagel\\". Camelford was the busiest intermediate station between Launceston and Wadebridge, but the distance from the town kept the passenger numbers low: in 1928 there was an average of just over 20 tickets issued daily, with 35 collected, and this number steadily declining with improved road transport. No alterations were made to the station layout throughout its life; the sidings were officially taken out of use on 30 November 1965 after the end of goods traffic the previous year, but the signal box and passing loop remained operational until closure on 3 October 1966. The small settlement of Camelford Station grew up around the railway and the station site was for a time occupied by the British Cycling Museum (subsequently closed). More information about the area can be found in the article on Slaughterbridge. The station is now a private residence. Delabole; The adjacent Delabole Slate quarry, Delabole station resulted in considerable outwards mineral traffic. The station opened on 18 October 1893 after the slate company donated 1.5 miles of trackbed free to the LSWR. It was equipped with a passing loop and two platforms. A single siding was provided behind the up platform, which was where the signal box was sited. On the down side the platform had the station building and a short loading dock with the goods shed on a further siding running behind the platform. A single road through engine shed was provided, with a turntable beyond between the goods shed and a line extending to the quarry. There was a considerable narrow gauge tramway network within the quarry, in existence before the construction of the North Cornwall line. There had earlier been a three-foot gauge network with a four track incline, but by 1879 this had been converted to a 2-feet gauge system with a six-track incline. As it was situated in the village itself, the station was better used than many on the route, and the proximity of the quarry ensured that freight receipts remained healthy. Goods services were withdrawn on 7 September 1964 and the loading dock was removed; the siding on the down side had been removed some time previously. The station closed on 3 October 1966. The station building is now in use as a private residence, and houses have been built on the site of the up platform. '; the station was three miles (5 km) from Port Isaac itself, and opened on 1 June 1895, and had a passing loop and a single siding with headshunt that served a goods shed and loading dock. All buildings were of local stone; the station building and signal box locking room were on the up platform, the small waiting shelter on the down platform, and the goods shed. Ticket sales were low, with nearly 4500 annually in 1928, this dropping to under 2000 in 1936; freight dropped in a similar way over the same period. The station was host to a Southern Railway camping coach from 1937 to 1939. The station layout never changed; the station siding was taken out of use in December 1965. The station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and closed on 3 October 1966. The station buildings are the best preserved example on the line. St Kew Highway; The bridge east of St Kew Highway which carried the line over the A39 road. This section of the road has been bypassed to avoid the low bridge The station here was built at an existing settlement on the main Camelford to Wadebridge road and about south of St Kew village. Opened on 1 June 1895, there was a passing loop and a single siding of 15 wagon capacity with headshunt that served a goods shed and cattle dock with an additional short spur to an end-loading ramp, these all being situated on the west (up) side behind the station buildings. Both lines through the station had platforms although the down platform had no buildings and was only accessible via a foot crossing at the down end of the station. The station building itself, like the goods shed, was substantially constructed out of local stone, as was the locking room of the signal box which was sited off the down end of the up platform. The passing loop was extended in 1939, but the up loop, sidings and signal box were taken out of use on 21 November 1965 as goods services had ceased on 7 September the previous year. Traffic was never very heavy and by the late 1930s was averaging 5 passengers per day, less than a third of that ten years earlier. The station was unmanned from 6 December 1965 and closed on 3 October 1966, although the building functioned for some time as a guest house and is now a private residence. Wadebridge Junction, about a mile east of Wadebridge station, was the point of convergence of the Bodmin lines with the North Cornwall line; from 3 February 1907 a second independent track was provided, the two lines running parallel; the junction signal box was abolished. Wadebridge; Wadebridge Station buildings are currently in use as \\"The John Betjeman Centre\\". Padstow; Steam railway A section of trackbed from Launceston is now in use as the Launceston Steam Railway, and the section from Wadebridge to Padstow is now part of the Camel Trail. Poetical reference The North Cornwall Railway is commemorated in Sir John Betjeman's classic verse autobiography Summoned by Bells. Betjeman travelled from London to his childhood holiday home in Trebetherick: > \\"The emptying train, wind in the ventilators, > Puffs out of Egloskerry to Tresmeer > Through minty meadows, under bearded trees, > And hills upon whose sides, the clinging farms hold bible Christians > Can it really be that this same carriage came from Waterloo? > On Wadebridge's platform what a breath of sea scented the Camel valley! > Soft air, soft Cornish Rains, and silence after steam....\\" See also * Southern Railway routes west of Salisbury Notes References Further reading  External links * Map of route * North Cornwall Railway Category:Rail transport in Cornwall Category:Closed railway lines in South West England Category:Railway companies established in 1882 Category:Railway lines opened in 1886 Category:Standard gauge railways in England ","title":"North Cornwall Railway"},{"id":"10496392","text":"Essex High School is a high school located in the town of Tappahannock, in Essex County, Virginia, United States.

It consists of the South Leeds Stadium, Aquatics Centre, Indoor Athletics Centre and Tennis Centre. It was previously named the South Leeds Stadium (although the actual stadium is still known by this name) and was renamed to honour John Charles (1931‚Äì2004), the former Leeds United, Juventus F.C. and Wales footballer. It is located to the south of Leeds city centre roughly on the border of Beeston, Belle Isle and Hunslet. The sports centre opened in 1996, with the Aquatics Centre opening in 2007. The stadium has been used by Leeds United for reserve matches, and since November 1995 by rugby league club Hunslet. It is the principal athletics stadium in the Leeds area and is the home of Leeds City Athletics Club. The sports complex also includes a tennis centre and indoor bowls and athletics centre. The stadium is one of the best available to clubs at Hunslet's level. The complex is comparable with the Gateshead International Stadium. Layout =Stadium= The main stand The stadium was the first part of the sports centre to be built. It has a two tier stand at the west end of the ground which has a capacity of 4,000. It also houses the changing rooms, corporate boxes and the Phoenix Bar. The stadium has a running track as well as a pitch and is mainly used for rugby league and athletics. =Aquatics Centre= The Aquatics Centre The Aquatics Centre opened on 29 October 2007. The Olympic size swimming pool replaced previous facilities at the 40-year-old Leeds International Pool. Two submersible booms built into the main pool enable it to be divided into three pools of different sizes and depths, allowing a flexible daily swimming programme. A floating floor allows the depth of the diving pool and ‚Öì of the main pool to be varied from two metres to shallow water for teaching and 0‚Äì5 metres for the diving pool. The centre is also suitable for national and international swimming and diving, with seating for 950 people overlooking the main pool and for 150 overlooking the diving area. The ¬£16.5m centre also includes an aerobics studio and multi-use rooms. The movement of the city's main public swimming facilities to South Leeds attracted criticism. It left the city centre deprived of facilities and the new centre is difficult to reach for people without the use of a car. The South Leeds Stadium is also remote for people in north Leeds and outlying villages and towns, although other public sport facilities are available throughout Leeds. =Tennis Centre= The tennis centre at John Charles Centre for Sport consists of 6 indoor courts and 6 outdoor courts. There is also a spectator balcony, changing facilities, meeting room, and cafeteria. The courts are available to hire on a pay and play basis and can be booked up to seven days in advance or eight days in advance by LEEDSCard holders. There are a wide range of tennis sessions available to adults and youths including coaching, individual lessons, social tennis, and competitive league opportunities. =Indoor bowls= The indoor bowls and athletics centre The centre has a large indoor bowls complex, this features eight bowls rinks and hosts bowls leagues and tournaments. It is the home venue of Leeds and District Indoor Bowls Club Usage =Rugby League= The stadium has been home to Hunslet since it was opened in 1996. Although the ground is not located in Hunslet it is just over the motorway from the club's original home at Parkside. The stadium has also held other rugby league events. =Gaelic Football= The stadium is also used for Gaelic matches for time to time. Teams from all over Yorkshire, Manchester and Ireland compete for a trophy every year. =Swimming= Since April 2008, the City of Leeds Synchronised Swimming Club adopted the facilities as their main centre for training and administration. The club are a regional club which consist of competitive swimmers throughout the whole of the North East. In May 2012, the Dutch and Chinese Olympic Swimming Teams announced that they would train at the centre in the lead up to the 2012 London Olympics. =Diving= The Centre is the primary training facility for the City of Leeds Diving Club and is responsible for producing some of the best divers in the country who have been chosen to compete at an international and Olympic level. The Club has trained a number of successful athletes including Rebecca Gallantree, Alicia Blag, Dan Goodfellow and Matty Lee as well as Great Britain's first ever diving gold medallists Jack Laugher and Chris Mears. =American Football= Since 2016 the stadium has been home of English American Football club Yorkshire Rams. The stadium has also hosted the Championship Games of the BAFA National Leagues Divisions 1 and 2 since 2015. Map Street plan 2010 election The centre was used as the venue to count the general election votes in 2010 for all Leeds constituencies. Previously Leeds Town Hall was used for this purpose. In 2015 this function was moved to the First Direct Arena.

Many Orthodox Jews use the term ‚Äúreligious‚Äù to refer to a strict adherence to Jewish law. For the purposes of this article, ‚Äúreligious‚Äù refers to the content and context of the music itself: liturgical or implicit references to the divine. Jewish ethnomusicologist Mark Kligman notes, ‚ÄúThe scope of contemporary Jewish music encompasses a wide range of genres and styles, including music for the synagogue, folk and popular music on religious themes, Yiddish songs, klezmer music, Israeli music, and art music by serious composers. Every sector of the Jewish community ‚Äì from the most right-wing Orthodox to the most secular ‚Äì participates in the Jewish music endeavor, creating, performing, and listening to the particular music that meets its taste and needs.‚ÄùKligman. The question of what is Jewish music and what makes music Jewish continues to be explored in academic and artistic circles alike. It may be seen in the work of Velvel Pasternak, who spent much of the late twentieth century as a preservationist committing what had been a strongly oral tradition to paper. Also, John Zorn's record label, Tzadik, features a \\"Radical Jewish Culture\\" series that focuses on exploring what contemporary Jewish music is and what it offers to contemporary Jewish culture. History and influence =Hasidic influence= Within the traditional Jewish community, cantoral and chasiddic melodies were the musical standard. In the 1950s and early 1960s recordings began to be made of noncantorial Jewish music, beginning with Ben Zion Shenker's recording of the music of the Modzitz chassidic sect Kligman, p. 96. and Cantor David Werdyger's Gerrer recordings. The annual Israeli Hasidic Song Festival, first held in 1969, became a stage which saw the premi√®res of pieces like Nurit Hirsh's Oseh Shalom; Tzvika Pik's Sh‚Äôma Yisrael; and Shlomo Carlebach's Od Yishama and V‚Äôha‚Äôeir Eineinu. =Israeli influence= With the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, American Jews showed increasing interest in Israeli music. This trend dramatically accelerated with the Six-Day War. ‚ÄúThe practice of singing Israeli songs in American synagogues, camps, and at social gatherings, which spread in the 1950s, accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s as young American Jews looked to Israel as a positive model for Jewish identity, and the songs‚Äô popularity also served as a Jewishly unifying factor.‚Äù An additional influence was in the pronunciation of Hebrew both in worship and song. The Reform Movement, which previously had used Ashkenazic pronunciation of Hebrew (reflecting a German-Polish tradition), switched to Sephardic pronunciation (reflecting the way Israelis spoke). =Folk music influence= Largely influenced by the folk music revival of the time, in the 1960s and 1970s, a new genre of worship music grew out of the Reform summer camp movement. From almost the beginning of Reform worship, the music centered around the use of organ and choir.Schiller. Rather than the paradigm of organ and choir, the new music was composed for acoustic guitar and group singing.‚ÄùDreyfus. This new style focused on making the music \\"simpler, thoroughly democratic in its singability, largely Hebrew, and playable on guitar.\\" This influence is also clear in the music of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. Carlebach gained fame for bridging between the folk world and the traditional Jewish Hasidic tunes. =Rock influence= At the same time as the folk revival made waves in Jewish worship, established composers like Gershon Kingsley and Ray Smolover utilized contemporary genres like jazz and rock in their compositions. As in the broader world, the influence of rock music was debated and still is in some circles. Influence of the rock world came to the Orthodox world with bands like the Diaspora Yeshiva Band, founded in 1975 by American-born student-musicians at the Diaspora Yeshiva in Jerusalem.Besser, Yisroel. \\"We All Get Another Chance\\". Mishpacha, March 12, 2014, pp. 48-58. The founding members were Avraham Rosenblum on guitar, Ben Zion Solomon on fiddle and banjo, Simcha Abramson on saxophone and clarinet, Ruby Harris on violin, mandolin, guitar, and harmonica, Adam Wexler on bass, and Gedalia Goldstein on drums; other student-musicians also played with the group between 1973 and 1986. The Diaspora Yeshiva Band infused rock and bluegrass with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called \\"Hasidic rock\\" or \\"Country and Eastern\\". The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at David's Tomb. It inspired later bands such as Blue Fringe, Even Sh'siyah, Reva l'sheva, Soulfarm, the Moshav Band, and Shlock Rock. Periodically Jewish music jumps into mainstream consciousness, with the reggae artist Matisyahu being the most recent example. The 2007 Grammy Awards were a landmark in Jewish music, as the Klezmatics (a klezmer/folk group) became the first Jewish band to win a Grammy. Their music combines lyrics by Woody Guthrie, the famous American lyricist, with classical klezmer tunes. =Important figures= * Shlomo Carlebach is considered by many to be the most influential Jewish songwriter of the last half century. * Michael Isaacson grew up in Reform Jewish summer camps and was the primary innovator in Jewish camp music. He has since established himself as a prominent composer of synagogue music. * Tofa'ah, founded in 1981, was the first all-women Jewish rock/jazz band. It sets traditional religious Jewish texts to its own compositions, as well as composes original Jewish inspirational songs. The band is unique in that it adheres strictly to the Jewish laws of kol isha and performs only for female audiences. Its work is featured in the archives of Hebrew University and the Rubin Academy of Music and Dance. * Debbie Friedman, another product of Reform Jewish summer camps, was the first woman to set religious Jewish texts in the American folk genre, rendering them easily accessible and popular across the denominations. Her settings of the prayers for the Havdalah ceremony and the \\"Mi Shebeirach\\" prayer are ubiquitous in virtually every Jewish community. Julie Silver and Rabbi Shefa Gold have both followed in Debbie Friedman's footsteps as prolific female composers of contemporary Jewish religious music in their own right. * Kol B'Seder, consisting of Cantor Jeff Klepper and Rabbi Daniel Freelander, also arose out of the Reform Jewish camp movement as one of the pioneering groups devoted to composing and fostering what is sometimes called ‚ÄúAmerican Nusach: \\"the late 20th century refashioning of liberal Jewish worship to reflect the attitudes and beliefs of life in North America\\". Some of their well-known settings include \\"Modeh Ani\\", \\"Or Zarua\\", and \\"Shalom Rav\\". * Craig Taubman grew up in Conservative Jewish camps and has also contributed a great deal of music to the genre, such as his settings of \\"L'cha Dodi\\" and \\"Hashkiveinu\\". * Safam, a six-man band founded in Boston in 1973, prides itself on a \\"Jewish-American Sound:\\" a wide breadth of American musical styles while maintaining a decidedly Jewish flavor. One of the group's founders, Robert Solomon, is a prominent cantor and composer in his own right. Modern trends =Trends in the Orthodox community= In recent years, the time lag in style between the broad music world and its adoption by the Jewish music world had been decreasing. Many groups and singers have released albums with noticeable influences from contemporary pop, rock music, etc. This is partly a result of a new wave of young Jewish musicians arriving out of yeshivas and universities. Examples of this trend include The Chevra with clear pop-boy band overtones and dance moves and Blue Fringe with its extended jam sessions echoing Phish and the Dave Matthews Band. Other examples include acts such as Chaim Dovid or Shlomo Katz who echo Shlomo Carlebach's musical style. One type of music that is very popular among Orthodox artists and their listeners usually consists of a formulaic mix including brass, horns and strings. These songs are often a joint effort by a composer and an arranger with the singer having little to no input. Many of the entertainers are former yeshiva students who perform in dress suits. Many have day jobs or are studying in kollel and sideline singing at Jewish weddings. Musical background and training varies from no formal training to very high levels (though rarely academic). Lyrics are most commonly short passages in Hebrew from the Torah or the siddur, with the occasional passage from the Talmud. Sometimes songs with original lyrics compiled in English, Hebrew or Yiddish deal with central themes such as Jerusalem, the Holocaust, Jewish identity, and the Jewish diaspora. As a solution to the Jewish law against men hearing women singing, Jewish boys choirs became popular in the 1970s. Among the more notable of these groups are Pirchei London, the Toronto Boys Choir, the Miami Boys Choir, and the Yeshiva Boys Choir. Currently the Miami Boys Choir led by Yerachmiel Begun is perhaps the most popular, with a number of albums amongst the top record sales in Orthodox Jewish circles. In addition, some female Orthodox musicians, including singers like Julia Blum, Kineret, and Ruthi Navon and groups such as Tofa'ah, Ashira, and Bulletproof Stockings, have found success performing for women only.Kligman, p. 27. In addition to Matisyahu, some well- known Orthodox contemporary Jewish musicians include Yossi Green, Martin Davidson, and Abie Rotenberg; well-known producers and arrangers of this type of music are Yisroel Lamm, Daniel Kapler, Eli Leshinsky. Popular artists include Mordechai Ben David, Avraham Fried, Benny Friedman, Lipa Schmeltzer, Shulem Lemmer, Shloime Dachs, Dedi Graucher, Simcha Leiner, Mordechai Shapiro, Beri Weber, Shmueli Ungar, Motty Steinmetz and Yaakov Shwekey. =Trends in the Reform and Conservative communities= The Reform Jewish summer camps continue to be a source of contemporary Jewish worship music, where artists like Craig Taubman,Brown. Dan Nichols,Charlotte Observer, July 6, 1994. Rick Recht,Daniels. Josh Nelson,Union for Reform Judaism, wikipedia. Alan Goodis and others have shared their newest compositions with the latest generation of campers. Nichols and Recht are among the leading Jewish rock singers of the present day and remain extremely popular among Jewish summer campers. Sam Glaser, Sue Horowitz, Noam Katz, Beth Schafer, Julie Silver, Peri Smilow and others have contributed significantly to modern Reform Jewish music and have been included in Ruach, the biennial music compilation produced by the Union for Reform Judaism. =Children's music= A large body of music produced by Orthodox Jews for children is geared toward teaching religious and ethical traditions and laws. The lyrics of these songs are generally written in English with some Hebrew or Yiddish phrases. Country Yossi, Abie Rotenberg, Uncle Moishy, and the producers of the 613 Torah Avenue series are examples of Orthodox Jewish musicians/entertainers whose music teach children Jewish traditions. Parallel performers exist in Israel with the lyric in Hebrew or Yiddish. In the Reform and Conservative communities, there has been a body of contemporary children's music written in the last 20 years. Children's music tends to focus on teaching Jewish values and ethics, Hebrew alef-bet and vocabulary, and teaching about the holidays. Though well-known Jewish songwriters like Debbie Friedman and Craig Taubman have written many children's songs, there are some who focus almost exclusively on this genre, like Peter and Ellen Allard and Shira Kline.

Facilities The DUSA building is located in Airlie Place, in the centre of the University's Main Campus and caters as a private members' club offering bar, nightclub and refectory services for many students, particularly undergraduates. It is also responsible for the operation of a number of small shops throughout the university's campuses. In 2004, it underwent major refurbishment work. This included adding a new nightclub, and redesigning the interiors of the bars and recreational spaces. The building also contains the University's main swimming pool. DUSA also provides a number of other typical students' union services such as advocacy on behalf of its membership and assistance to individual students. The largest of the buildings four bars is located on level three, and is known as The Liar. It takes its name from the novel of the same name written by former Rector Stephen Fry. The building also contains a grocery shop of the Premier franchise, of which all profits are given to DUSA. History of the Association Ellenbank, former home of the Students' Association The Students' Association was founded by the merger in 1969 of the Students' Union and Students' Representative Council (SRC). Both bodies had existed since the University of Dundee's period as a college of the University of St Andrews. The Dundee Students' Union was mainly responsible for meeting the physical needs of students, and ran a bar, shop, and launderette. There were two restaurants: Old Dines, located in the Ellenbank building, and New Dines, built in 1963. The SRC handled other aspects of student welfare, including negotiation with the University authorities (from 1967) and with the college authorities during Dindee's period as a constituent of the University of St Andrews. The Union gained its first accommodation by the renting of the Ellenbank building in 1905 with ¬£4,000 raised from the University College Bazaar - a fairly regular event of official speakers, entertainments, live music, comedy and stalls - held in October 1903. The building itself had been constructed as a villa in 1813 and had been acquired by the University College in more recent years. Ellenbank was initially separated by levels, providing separate rooms for the male and female students - with the ladies entering up a flight of stairs to the rear and the gentlemen having sole use of the \\"handsome\\" entrance hall. Despite the segregation, this was probably the first Students' Union in the United Kingdom to admit both men and women to the same association and also to allow them use of the same building. Ellenbank later underwent extensive renovation in the 1920s, and was connected to the neighbouring (and similar) Union Mount building, which housed the College library. By 1969, it was decided that new and larger premises were necessary and a new building was completed in 1974. New Dines was demolished in 1986. The Ellenbank building is now used by the university's School of Accountancy. Student Media =Publications= The present publication issued by the Association is known as The Magdalen. From its beginnings in 2006, the magazine has undergone several transformations. Content is more politically focussed with issues addressing both domestic and international development. A free publication, the magazine is circulated within the DUSA building and associated buildings on the campus, as well as further afield in local cafes, pubs and shops. The present Students' Association building (top centre) and the university's Airlie Place There is a long history of student publications at Dundee - before 2006, The Magdalen was known as The Student Times and criticised for being bland and inoffensive.Virgin Alternative Universities Guide, 2005-06 This bucked the tradition of very political publications such as Annasach (Gaelic: Unusual, Unconventional) which was edited for a time by controversial ex-MI5 agent David Shayler, who was responsible for printing extracts from Peter Wright's Spycatcher - a book banned in the UK at the time. Lord George Robertson was also a columnist for the newspaper in its early days. Another former Labour MP, Brian Wilson, was also involved as an early Editor of Annasach. It was his experience as Editor that helped him found the West Highland Free Press in 1972. Annasach survived from the University's independence in 1967 until 1994.Reference in University Library catalogue. Prior to this, College was the publication in general circulation at Queen's College Dundee, which went on to become the university. In 2006, The Student Times became The Magdalen. As the 2006/07 term neared an end, a long term plan was drafted and The Magdalen received the financial backing required to regularly publish 8 issues throughout the student year. The Magdalen's position is both an entertainment magazine and a tool for on-campus political commentary. A Memorandum of Understanding between DUSA and The Magdalen was established, ensuring the magazine would be supported financially, and that the Editor would be elected by the students, alongside the annual DUSA Executive elections. The current Editor in Chief of The Magdalen is Barbara Mertlov√°. =JAM - DUSA Radio= Jam Radio is a 24/7 student led radio station situated in the city of Dundee. Funded and facilitated by DUSA, it provides entertainment to students and non-students alike. It is run by, and for, the students of Dundee and aims to help students get their first foot on the media industry ladder. With more shows than ever and making the move to live streaming and new Jam Sessions with live bands, Jam radio is the station to listen to in 2018. Jam's current radio manager is Indy Bruckner. =Tay Productions= Tay Productions (formerly known as 'DUSA TV') was formed in late 2009 and regularly produces content by students, for students, which are then published on DUSA TV's YouTube channel and the DUSA Media website. Content includes a weekly news programme, The Soc Adventures focusing on societies and sports clubs as well as sketches and longer pieces of fiction. In 2015 Tay Productions was named 'Best Broadcaster' at NaSTA. In 2019 they expanded their focus to produce independent shorts as well as online digital content. All of this was achieved, despite DUSA not providing a studio space for the outlet. The current manager of Tay Productions is Gonzalo Fraguas Bringas. =Fibre - Online= In 2012 DUSA appointed its first Online Media Manager, Harrison Kelly, to coincide with the launch of a DUSA Media website. This website hosts articles written for the site, articles from The Magdalen, as well as hosting DUSA TV's videos and a DUSA Radio live feed. The current manager is Alexander Arnaudov. Executive Officers There are six sabbatical officers of the Students' Association, and two non-sabbatical officers who form the Students' Association Executive. At present, the 2020/21 officers, who took up their positions on 1 July 2020 are: * President: Scott Quinn * Vice President of Academia: Martha Umeh Ude-Eze * Vice President of Communications and Campaigns: Saffron-Louise Cook * Vice President of Student Activities: Kellie Ioannou * Vice President of Student Welfare: Lauren MacGregor * Vice President of Representation: Rebecca Johnston * Vice President of Engagement: Izuin Hanis Binti Abu Bakar * Vice President of Fundraising: Megan-Rose Birdsall The DUSA Executive along with six external trustees form DUSA's Board of Trustees which meets on a regular basis along with DUSA's senior managers and the Executive Support Officer Rachael MacAuley. Affiliations DUSA is affiliated to the Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland (CHESS) and the National Postgraduate Committee. Unlike most students unions in the United Kingdom, DUSA is not affiliated to the National Union of Students. DUSA was part of the Scottish Union of Students which became part of the NUS in 1971. But in 1980 DUSA disaffiliated from the NUS, only to re-affiliate again in the mid-1980s until 1994 when it left once more. This stance was confirmed in a referendum held on 1 and 2 April 2010 in which 1,795 students voted against and 467 voted for NUS affiliation. The Union has a collective purchasing and co-ordination agreement with a number of other Scottish students bodies through the Northern Services group. The Sports Union is affiliated to British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS). Unlike in many universities, the Sports Union is a separate body from the main Students' Union, instead, it is officially part of the University's structure. DUSA and the Sports Union collaborate on many projects, and the Sports Union Executive officers used to be based in the main DUSA building. They are now based in the University's Institute of Sport and Exercise. The current Sports Union President is Dan Sayer.

Because of its size, the Palaearctic is often divided for convenience into two, with Europe, North Africa, northern and central parts of the Arabian Peninsula, and part of temperate Asia, roughly to the Ural Mountains forming the western zone, and the rest of temperate Asia becoming the Eastern Palaearctic. Its exact boundaries differ depending on the authority in question, but the Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa: The Birds of the Western Palearctic (BWP) definition is widely used, and is followed by the most popular Western Palearctic checklist, that of the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC). The Western Palearctic realm includes mostly boreal and temperate climate ecoregions. The Palaearctic region has been recognised as a natural zoogeographic region since Sclater proposed it in 1858. The oceans to the north and west, and the Sahara to the south are obvious natural boundaries with other realms, but the eastern boundary is more arbitrary, since it merges into another part of the same realm, and the mountain ranges used as markers are less effective biogeographic separators. The climate differences across the Western Palearctic region can cause behavioral differences within the same species across geographical distance, such as in the sociality of behavior for bees of the species Lasioglossum malachurum.

It has mostly smooth bark, glossy green, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, green flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical to bell-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus ovata is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber, but with a variable habit, from a straggly sapling in east Gippsland to stout-boled elsewhere. It has smooth, grey, whitish or pinkish-grey new bark, sometimes with loose rough bark near the base of larger trees. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptical to egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle, long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from June to November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical to slightly bell-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level.Brooker & Kleinig, Field Guide to Eucalypts, Vol 2 South Western and Southern Australia, Bloomings Books, Melbourne, 2001, Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus ovata was first formally described in 1806 by Jacques Labillardi√®re in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The specific epithet (ovata) is from the Latin ovatus, referring to the leaf shape. In 1916, Joseph Maiden described two varieties of E. ovata in his book, A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus, and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus ovata var. grandiflora Maiden; * Eucalyptus ovata Labill. var. ovata.

It is most well known in Australia, where it is also called currant bush or, more ambiguously, native currant or even black currant. It is, however, neither closely related to plums (Prunus) nor to true currants (Ribes), which belong to entirely different lineages of eudicots. In India, it is also called wild karanda /wild karavanda, referring to the related karanda (C. carandas). Carissa spinarum is often discussed under its many obsolete synonyms (see below). Foliage of the small-leaved \\"ovata\\" type It grows as a multi-stemmed shrub, 0.5 to 3 metres in height. The leaves are glossy green, opposite, narrow ovate to lanceolate and 1‚Äì5 cm in length. The branches bear thorns of 1‚Äì3 cm length. White, star-shaped flowers ~1 cm across are followed by ovate green berries, 1‚Äì2 cm in length, which turn black or dark purple when ripe. Ecology Ripe fruit Raw fruit Carissa spinarum is most often found in semiarid coastal regions on fine-textured soils such as clays and clay-loams; in more arid regions the plant tends to be confined to areas of higher moisture such as at the base of hills or floodout areas. But it has a high ecological tolerance and can live in a wide range of habitats. In Australia for example, it is often found in association with Eucalyptus brownii, poplar box (E. populnea), gidgee (Acacia cambagei) or brigalow (A. harpophylla), in coastal rainforest, gallery forest and vine thickets in regions receiving in excess of 900 mm annual rainfall, as well as softwood scrubs and open eucalypt savannas receiving less than 700 mm annual rainfall. Conkerberries are edible, but only when fully ripe; they have a sweet flavour, but the milky sap of this plant - and its unripe fruit - is poisonous, as typical for the Apocynaceae. They are a popular bush tucker food for Australian Aborigines in Central Australia. The fruit is known as merne arrankweye in the Arrernte language, anwekety in Anmatyerr and nganango in Pintupi. The fruits are also a popular food for the Australian bustard, emu and many other birds in its range. Its leaves provide food for butterflies (e.g. Australian crow, Euploea core) and moths (e.g. some hawkmoths) Carissa spinarum is frequently a weed in grazing land in northern Australia, choking out grasses, reducing the ability of livestock to feed, interfering with stock handling and providing a refuge for vermin. The plant is capable of reproducing rapidly by layering and is difficult to control mechanically and expensive to manage with herbicides. On the other hand, it has been used in attempts to restore small-bird habitat in disturbed dry rainforest in Queensland, Australia. Parts of the plant are used medicinally for joint and muscle pain by the Maasai people of Kenya.Bussmann, R. W., et al. (2006). Plant use of the Maasai of Sekenani Valley, Maasai Mara, Kenya. J Ethnobiol Ethnomed 2 22. Synonyms Well known for its fruit to locals and quite variable across its wide range and diverse habitat types, the conkerberry has been described time and again by botanists under a number of names. Robert Brown alone described it no less than four times under different names, and R.H. Beddome not only described it twice as a \\"new species\\" of Carissa, but believed two other growth-forms of it to be mere varieties of Karonda (C. carandas). The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records the plant under the name Carissa Ovata and says \\"This little bush produces a very pleasant fruit, which is both agreeable and wholesome. It is like a sloe, egg-shaped, and about half-an-inch long. It exudes a viscid milky juice and contains a few woody seeds. \\"I can testify that the fruit is both agreeable and wholesome, and I never knew an instance of any evil consequences, even when they were partaken of most abundantly.\\" (Tenison- Woods, Vol. vii., 571., Proc. Lirin. Soc. N.S.W.)\\". But in fact, C. spinarum was already named by Carl Linn√© in his 1771 Mantissa Plantarum, and thus all subsequent names are treated as junior synonyms. In Myanmar, it is known as . The following list gives the names under which the conkerberry has been placed in Carissa. Apart from that, it has also been assigned, under various names, to Antura and Arduina (both now synonymized with Carissa), as well as Azima, Cabucala, Chapelieria, Damnacanthus, Strychnos, Carandas, and Jasminonerium.Tropicos.org [2009] \\"Edulis\\"-type habitus \\"Ovata\\"-type habitus * Carissa abyssinica R.Br. * Carissa africana A.DC. * Carissa axillaris Roxb. * Carissa brownii F.Muell. * Carissa campenonii (Drake) Palacky * Carissa candolleana Jaub. & Spach * Carissa carandas var. congesta (Wight) Bedd. * Carissa carandas var. paucinervia (A.DC.)

The CCC used locally quarried sandstone and locally harvested lumber to build the lodge. In 1936, the lodge and cabins were dedicated by Illinois Governor Henry Horner. The CCC later added a dining room and kitchen as well as six additional cabins to the complex. They were also responsible for building the lodge's furniture; the quality of the wooden furniture led Pere Marquette State Park to commission the 696th Company to furnish their lodge as well. In 1985, the lodge and cabins were added to the National Register of Historic Places; the original cabins were demolished and replaced by replica cabins in the same year, and several new cabins were constructed.

It is a setting of six poems by Th√©ophile Gautier. The cycle, completed in 1841, was originally for soloist and piano accompaniment. Berlioz orchestrated one of the songs in 1843, and did the same for the other five in 1856. The cycle was neglected for many years, but during the 20th century it became, and has remained, one of the composer's most popular works. The full orchestral version is more frequently performed in concert and on record than the piano original. The theme of the work is the progress of love, from youthful innocence to loss and finally renewal. Background Berlioz and the poet Th√©ophile Gautier were neighbours and friends. Gautier wrote, \\"Berlioz represents the romantic musical idea ... unexpected effects in sound, tumultuous and Shakespearean depth of passion.\\"Blakeman, p. 3 It is possible that Berlioz read Gautier's collection La com√©die de la mort (The Comedy of Death) before its publication in 1838.Anderson, p. 3 Gautier had no objection to his friend's setting six poems from that volume, and Berlioz began in March 1840.Holoman, p. 275 The title Nuits d'√©t√© was Berlioz's invention, and it is not clear why he chose it: the first song is specifically set in spring rather than summer. The writer Annagret Fauser suggests that Berlioz may have been influenced by the preface to a collection of short stories by his friend Joseph M√©ry, Les nuits de Londres, in which the author writes of summer nights in which he and his friends sat outside until dawn telling stories.Fauser, pp. 119‚Äì120 In a 1989 study of Berlioz, D. Kern Holoman suggests that the title is an allusion to Shakespeare, whose works Berlioz loved.Holoman, pp. 92‚Äì93 and 275 Gautier in 1839 The cycle was complete in its original version for voice (mezzo-soprano or tenor) and piano by 1841. Berlioz later made arrangements for baritone, contralto, or soprano, and piano.G√©rard, p. 6 The piano version is not as often performed in concert or on record as the orchestrated score, which Berlioz arranged between 1843 and 1856.Cairns, pp. 3 and 12 David Cairns wrote in 1988 that the success of the piano version was impeded by the inferior quality of the piano part in the published score: it is not Berlioz's own, and Cairns described it as \\"a clumsy, inauthentic piece of work\\".Cairns, p. 12 In 1843 Berlioz orchestrated the fourth song, \\"Absence\\" for his lover, Marie Recio, who premiered it in Leipzig on 23 February 1843; it was not until 1856, that he returned to Les nuits d'√©t√©, making an orchestral arrangement of \\"Le spectre de la rose\\" for the mezzo-soprano Anna Bockholtz-Falconi. The publisher was in the audience for the premiere, and, much impressed, prevailed on Berlioz to orchestrate the rest of the cycle.Holoman, p. 514 The orchestration left the existing melodic and harmonic writing generally unchanged, but for \\"Le spectre de la rose\\" the composer added an introduction for muted solo cello, flute and clarinet; the orchestration of this song, unlike the other five, includes a harp.Anderson, p. 4 The original piano version had a single dedicatee ‚Äì Louise Bertin, whose father, Louis-Fran√ßois Bertin, was editor of the Journal des d√©bats, for which Berlioz wrote musical criticism and other articles. Each of the six songs of the orchestral cycle was dedicated individually, to singers well known in Germany, some of whom had performed Berlioz's music there: Louise Wolf (\\"Villanelle\\"), Anna Bockholtz- Falconi (\\"Le spectre de la rose\\"), Hans von Milde (\\"Sur les lagunes\\"), Madeleine Nott√®s (\\"Absence\\"), Friedrich Caspari (\\"Au cimeti√®re\\") and (\\"L'√Æle inconnue\\"). For the orchestral version, Berlioz transposed the second and third songs to lower keys. When this version was published, Berlioz specified different voices for the various songs: mezzo-soprano or tenor for \\"Villanelle\\", contralto for \\"Le spectre de la rose\\", baritone (or optionally contralto or mezzo) for \\"Sur les lagunes\\", mezzo or tenor for \\"Absence\\", tenor for \\"Au cimeti√®re\\", and mezzo or tenor for \\"L'√Æle inconnue\\".Cairns, p. 4 The cycle is nevertheless usually sung by a single soloist, most often a soprano or mezzo-soprano.Cairns, p. 6 When the cycle is sung by sopranos the second and third songs are usually transposed back to their original pitches; when lower voices sing the cycle some other songs are often transposed downwards; in the view of the Berlioz scholar Julian Rushton this has a particularly deleterious effect in the first song, the lighthearted \\"Villanelle\\". Although Berlioz wrote more than fifty songs, twenty of them with orchestral accompaniment, those in Les nuits d'√©t√© are the only ones published as a set. They are not a cycle on the German model of Schubert's Winterreise or Schumann's Dichterliebe, with narrative and thematic continuity, but form a unified whole by virtue of the single authorship of the words and the composer's use throughout of delicate, atmospheric musical shading.Cairns, pp. 4‚Äì5 The structure of the cycle has four sombre songs framed by exuberant opening and closing ones. The critic A. E. F. Dickinson wrote in a 1969 study, \\"Their common theme is nominally love unrequited or lost, symbolizing, arguably, an ache for vanished or unattainable beauty. But their musical order is apparently fortuitous, and forms an acceptable, rather than a compulsive, association.\\" Berlioz's innovative creation of an orchestral song cycle had few successors until Mahler took the genre up in the late 19th century. As far as is known, the orchestral cycle was not performed in its entirety during the composer's lifetime.Holoman, p. 367 The work was neglected for many years, but during the twentieth century it was rediscovered and has become one of Berlioz's best-loved works. Music By Berlioz's standards the orchestration is on a modest scale. There is no percussion, and the forces stipulated are the normal string section of violins, violas, cellos and double-basses; woodwind: two flutes, two clarinets, two bassoons, one oboe; brass: three horns; harp.Berlioz, I‚ÄìVI =Villanelle= Quand viendra la saison nouvelle, Quand auront disparu les froids, Tous les deux nous irons, ma belle, Pour cueillir le muguet aux bois; Sous nos pieds √©grenant les perles Que l'on voit au matin trembler, Nous irons √©couter les merles Siffler. Le printemps est venu, ma belle, C'est le mois des amants b√©ni, Et l'oiseau, satinant son aile, Dit des vers au rebord du nid. Oh! viens donc, sur ce banc de mousse Pour parler de nos beaux amours, Et dis-moi de ta voix si douce: Toujours! Loin, bien loin, √©garant nos courses, Faisons fuir le lapin cach√©, Et le daim au miroir des sources Admirant son grand bois pench√©; Puis chez nous, tout heureux, tout aises, En paniers enla√ßant nos doigts, Revenons, rapportant des fraises Des bois. When the new season comes, When the cold has vanished, We will both go, my lovely, To gather lily of the valley. Gathering the pearls underfoot, That one sees shimmering in the morning, We will hear the blackbirds Whistle. Spring has come, my lovely, It is the month blessed by lovers; And the bird, preening his wing, Speaks verse from the edge of his nest. Oh! come now to this mossy bank To talk of our beautiful love, And say to me in your sweet voice: \\"Always!\\" Far, far away, straying from our path, Causing the hidden rabbit to flee And the deer, in the mirror of the spring Bending to admire his great antlers, Then home, completely happy and at ease, Our hands entwined round the basket, Returning carrying strawberries From the wood. :Allegretto :Key: A major; orchestration: 2 flutes, 1 oboe, 2 clarinets in A, 1 bassoon, strings.Berlioz, I The first of the set, \\"Villanelle\\" is a celebration of spring and love. It tells of the pleasures of wandering together in the woods to gather wild strawberries, returning home with hands entwined. The setting is strophic; Berlioz maintains the villanelle rhythm of the original poem, while varying the orchestral accompaniment with string counterpoints, and, at the end of each verse, a bassoon solo, pitched higher at each iteration. Rushton comments that these variations \\"add to the sense of the natural variety and freshness of spring\\". =Le spectre de la rose= Soul√®ve ta paupi√®re close Qu'effleure un songe virginal; Je suis le spectre d'une rose Que tu portais hier au bal. Tu me pris, encore emperl√©e Des pleurs d'argent, de l'arrosoir, Et parmi la f√™te √©toil√©e Tu me promenas tout le soir. √î toi qui de ma mort fus cause, Sans que tu puisses le chasser, Toutes les nuits mon spectre rose √Ä ton chevet viendra danser. Mais ne crains rien, je ne r√©clame Ni messe ni De profundis: Ce l√©ger parfum est mon √¢me, Et j'arrive du paradis. Mon destin fut digne d'envie: Et pour avoir un sort si beau, Plus d'un aurait donn√© sa vie, Car sur ton sein j'ai mon tombeau, Et sur l'alb√¢tre o√π je repose Un po√®te avec un baiser √âcrivit: Ci-g√Æt une rose, Que tous les rois vont jalouser. Open your closed eyelids Touched by a virginal dream! I am the ghost of a rose That you wore yesterday at the ball. You took me, still pearly With silver tears, from the watering can, And in the starlit party, You carried me all evening. O you who caused my death Without being able to chase it away Every night my rose-coloured spectre Will dance by your bedside. But fear not, I claim neither Mass nor De Profundis. This light scent is my soul And I come from Paradise My destiny is enviable And to have a fate so beautiful More than one would have given his life; For on your breast I have my tomb, And on the alabaster on which I repose A poet with a kiss Wrote, \\"Here lies a rose Of which all kings will be jealous.\\" :Adagio un poco lento et dolce assai :Key: B major; orchestration: 2 flutes, 1 oboe, 2 clarinets in A, 2 horns in E, 1 harp, strings.Berlioz II \\"Le spectre de la rose\\" tells of a girl's dreams of the ghost of the rose she had worn to a ball the previous day. Although the rose has died, it has ascended to paradise; to have died on the girl's breast was a fate that kings might envy. The setting is through- composed.Fauser, p. 119 Holoman describes the song as \\"among the most perfect expressions of French Romanticism\\".Holoman, p. 239 =Sur les lagunes: Lamento= Ma belle amie est morte: Je pleurerai toujours Sous la tombe elle emporte Mon √¢me et mes amours. Dans le ciel, sans m'attendre, Elle s'en retourna; L'ange qui l'emmena Ne voulut pas me prendre. Que mon sort est amer! Ah! sans amour s'en aller sur la mer! La blanche cr√©ature Est couch√©e au cercueil. Comme dans la nature Tout me para√Æt en deuil! La colombe oubli√©e Pleure et songe √† l'absent; Mon √¢me pleure et sent Qu'elle est d√©pareill√©e! Que mon sort est amer! Ah! sans amour s'en aller sur la mer! Sur moi la nuit immense S'√©tend comme un linceul; Je chante ma romance Que le ciel entend seul. Ah! comme elle √©tait belle Et comme je l'aimais! Je n'aimerai jamais Une femme autant qu'elle. Que mon sort est amer! Ah! sans amour s'en aller sur la mer! My beautiful friend is dead, I shall weep always; Under the tomb she has taken My soul and my love. To Heaven, without waiting for me, She has returned; The angel who took her Did not want to take me. How bitter is my fate! Ah! Without love to sail on the sea! The white creature Lies in a coffin; How in nature Everything seems to me in mourning! The forgotten dove Weeps and dreams of the absent one. My soul weeps and feels That it is deserted! How bitter is my fate! Ah! Without love to sail on the sea! Over me the vast night Spreads like a shroud. I sing my song That only Heaven hears: Ah! How beautiful she was And how I loved her! I shall never love A woman as much as her... How bitter is my fate! Ah! Without love to sail on the sea! :Andantino :Key: F minor; orchestration: 2 flutes, 2 clarinets in B, 2 bassoons, 1 horn in C , 1 horn in F, strings.Berlioz III \\"Sur les lagunes: Lamento\\" (On the Lagoons: Lament), with its sombre harmonies and orchestration is imbued with melancholy; the undulating accompaniment suggests the movement of the waves. The poem is the lament of a Venetian boatman at the loss of his beloved, and the pain of sailing out to sea unloved.Holoman, p. 516 This is the second of the two through-composed songs in the cycle. =Absence= Reviens, reviens, ma bien-aim√©e! Comme une fleur loin du soleil, La fleur de ma vie est ferm√©e Loin de ton sourire vermeil. Entre nos c≈ìurs quelle distance! Tant d'espace entre nos baisers! √î sort amer! √¥ dure absence! √î grands d√©sirs inapais√©s! Reviens, reviens, ma belle aim√©e! Comme une fleur loin du soleil, La fleur de ma vie est ferm√©e Loin de ton sourire vermeil! D'ici l√†-bas que de campagnes, Que de villes et de hameaux, Que de vallons et de montagnes, √Ä lasser le pied des chevaux! Reviens, reviens, ma belle aim√©e! Comme une fleur loin du soleil, La fleur de ma vie est ferm√©e Loin de ton sourire vermeil! Come back, come back, my beloved! Like a flower far from the sun, The flower of my life is closed Far from your bright red smile! Between our hearts what a distance! So much of space between our kisses! O bitter fate! O harsh absence! O great desires unappeased! Come back, come back, my beautiful beloved! Like a flower far from the sun, The flower of my life is closed Far from your bright red smile! Between here and there what fields, What towns and hamlets, What valleys and mountains, To tire the hoofs of the horses. Come back, come back, my beautiful beloved! Like a flower far from the sun, The flower of my life is closed Far from your bright red smile! :Adagio :Key: F-sharp major; orchestration: 2 flutes, 1 oboe, 2 clarinets in A, 1 horn in A, 1 horn in D, strings.Berlioz IV The rhetorical \\"Absence\\" pleads for the return of the beloved. Rushton suggests that unlike the other five songs, this one may make use of existing music, written for an abandoned cantata, Erigone, and this possibly explains why in this song alone Berlioz cut and rearranged Gautier's verses. This song, and \\"Au cimeti√®re\\", which follows, are strophic, with the form A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA. =Au cimeti√®re: Clair de lune= Connaissez-vous la blanche tombe O√π flotte avec un son plaintif L'ombre d'un if? Sur l'if une p√¢le colombe Triste et seule au soleil couchant, Chante son chant; Un air maladivement tendre, √Ä la fois charmant et fatal, Qui vous fait mal, E qu'on voudrait toujours entendre; Un air comme en soupire aux cieux L'ange amoureux. On dirait que l'√¢me √©veill√©e Pleure sous terre √† l'unisson De la chanson, Et du malheur d'√™tre oubli√©e Se plaint dans un roucoulement Bien doucement. Sur les ailes de la musique On sent lentement revenir Un souvenir; Une ombre une forme ang√©lique Passe dans un rayon tremblant, En voile blanc. Les belles de nuit, demi-closes, Jettent leur parfum faible et doux Autour de vous, Et le fant√¥me aux molles poses Murmure en vous tendant les bras: Tu reviendras? Oh! jamais plus, pr√®s de la tombe Je n'irai, quand descend le soir Au manteau noir, √âcouter la p√¢le colombe Chanter sur la pointe de l'if Son chant plaintif! Do you know the white tomb, Where there floats with a plaintive sound The shadow of a yew tree? On the yew a pale dove Sitting sad and alone at sunset, Sings its song: An air morbidly tender At once charming and deadly, That hurts you And that one would like to hear for ever; An air like the sigh in Heaven Of a loving angel. One might say that an awakened soul Weeps under the ground in unison With the song, And for the misfortune of being forgotten Complains, cooing Very softly. On the wings of the music One feels slowly returning A memory. A shadow, an angelic form Passes in a shimmering ray In a white veil. The belle de nuit flowers, half closed, Cast their weak and sweet scent Around you, And the ghost in a gentle pose Murmurs, stretching its arms to you: Will you return? Oh! Never again by the grave Will I go, when evening falls In a black cloak, To hear the pale dove Singing at the top of the yew Its plaintive song. :Andantino non troppo lento :Key: D major; orchestration: 2 flutes, 2 clarinets in A; strings.Berlioz V \\"Au cimeti√®re: Clair de lune\\" (At the Cemetery: Moonlight), is a further lament, with the bereaved lover now more distant from the memory of his beloved, and perturbed by a ghostly vision of her. = L'√Æle inconnue = Dites, la jeune belle, O√π voulez-vous aller? La voile enfle son aile, La brise va souffler. L'aviron est d'ivoire, Le pavillon de moire, Le gouvernail d'or fin; J'ai pour lest une orange, Pour voile une aile d'ange, Pour mousse un s√©raphin. Dites, la jeune belle, O√π voulez-vous aller? La voile enfle son aile, La brise va souffler. Est-ce dans la Baltique? Dans la mer Pacifique? Dans l'√Æle de Java? Ou bien est-ce en Norv√®ge, Cueillir la fleur de neige, Ou la fleur d'Angsoka? Dites, dites, la jeune belle, dites, o√π voulez-vous aller? Menez moi, dit la belle, √Ä la rive fid√®le O√π l'on aime toujours! Cette rive, ma ch√®re, On ne la conna√Æt gu√®re Au pays des amours. O√π voulez-vous aller? La brise va souffler. Tell me, young beauty, Where do you want to go? The sail swells its wing, The breeze begins to blow. The oar is of ivory, The flag is of moire, The rudder of fine gold; I have for ballast an orange, For sail an angel's wing For cabin boy a seraph Tell me, young beauty, Where do you want to go? The sail swells its wing, The breeze begins to blow. Is it to the Baltic? To the Pacific Ocean? The isle of Java? Or perhaps to Norway, To pick the snow-flower Or the flower of Angsoka? Tell, me, tell me, young beauty, tell me, where do you want to go? Take me, says the beautiful one, To the faithful shore Where one loves for ever! That shore, my dear, Is almost unknown In the land of love. Where do you want to go? The breeze begins to blow. :Allegro spiritoso :Key: F major; orchestration: 2 flutes, 1 oboe, 2 clarinets in B, 2 bassoons, 1 horn in F, 1 horn in C, 1 horn in B, strings.Berlioz VI \\"L'√Æle inconnue\\" (The Unknown Island) hints at the unattainable ‚Äì a place where love can be eternal. Rushton describes the song as \\"cheerfully ironic\\", set by Berlioz \\"with a Venetian swing\\". This closing song is strophic with the form A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚ÄìC‚ÄìA‚Ä≤‚ÄìD‚ÄìA‚Ä≥. Recordings The growing popularity of the work was reflected in the number of complete recordings issued in the LP era. Among those are versions sung by Suzanne Danco, Eleanor Steber and Victoria de los √Ångeles in mono recordings and R√©gine Crespin, Leontyne Price and Janet Baker in stereo. More recent recordings have featured V√©ronique Gens, Anne Sofie von Otter, Bernarda Fink and Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. Recordings by male singers include those by Nicolai Gedda, Ian Bostridge, St√©phane Degout and Jos√© van Dam. The piano version has been recorded from time to time, and there have been three studio recordings of the orchestral version with multiple singers, as stipulated in the orchestral score; these were conducted by Sir Colin Davis, Sir John Eliot Gardiner and Pierre Boulez. Conductors of other versions have included Ernest Ansermet, Sir John Barbirolli, James Levine, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Charles Munch and Fritz Reiner.Cairns, p. 3; and \\"Les nuits d'√©t√©\\", WorldCat, retrieved 2 July 2015 Notes, references and sources =Notes= =References= =Sources=    External links * *Scores and texts of Berlioz songs for voice and piano, BerliozSongs.co.uk *Texts of Les nuits d'√©t√© Category:Song cycles by Hector Berlioz Category:M√©lodies Category:1841 compositions Category:Classical song cycles in French Category:Music dedicated to ensembles or performers ","title":"Les nuits d'√©t√©"},{"id":"10496640","text":"Paul Robert Cherry (born 14 October 1964) is a former professional footballer.

After making 70 appearances and scoring 13 goals for Cowden, Cherry signed for Alex Totten's St Johnstone. He remained at Muirton Park, firstly, and then McDiarmid Park, for eight years, clocking up over 200 league appearances. He played under two other managers during his time in Perth - John McClelland and Paul Sturrock. In 1996, Cherry joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle, where he saw out the remainder of his professional career. He moved into junior football in 1999 with Newburgh. Post-retirement Cherry set up the Scottish subsidiary of Stellar Group, a sports management consultancy, with fellow ex-Saint Allan Preston. Stellar Scotland's first major move was assisting in the transfer of John Hartson from Coventry City to Celtic in 2001. Cherry later formed Independent Financial Services Company, which was based in Perth. The business was sold to Stubbs Insurance Services in 2008. In 2005, Cherry and his wife Nicola set up the Spanish Estate Agency Chersun, which is based in Murcia, Spain.\\"Paul Cherry on Somerset Park memories, St Johnstone and the Scottish Cup\\" - Perthshire Advertiser, 24 January 2020 References External links Profile at londonhearts.com Category:1964 births Category:Sportspeople from Derby Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Heart of Midlothian F.C. players Category:Cowdenbeath F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:St Johnstone F.C. players Category:Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. players Category:Newburgh F.C. players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Paul Cherry"},{"id":"10496650","text":"The Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography or N.N. Miklukho-Maklai Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology (; abbreviated as –ò–≠–ê in Russian and IEA in English) is a Russian institute of research, specializing in ethnographic studies of cultural and physical anthropology. The institute is a constituent institute of the History branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, with its main building on Leninsky Prospekt, Moscow. The Institute is named after the renowned 19th century ethnologist and anthropologist Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay. Institutional History The Institute was established in the Soviet Union by the amalgamation of the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (MAE) and the Institute for the Study of Ethnic Groups of the USSR (IPIN) in autumn 1933. Its first director was Nikolay Matorin. On 23 December 1933 he was dismissed by the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and replaced by Ivan Meshchaninov on 1 January 1934. On 25 January 1935, the IAE was transformed into the Institute of Anthropology, Archaeology and Ethnography. Meshchaninov remained director until this organisation was in turn dissolved in 1937. On 11 February 1937, the Institute was restructured with sections being replaced by several departments or cabinets: * Europe and the Caucasus, headed by Dmitrii Zelenin * Siberia and Western Central Asia, headed by Y. P. Koshkin; * East and South Asia, headed by Nikolay Kyuner; * Africa, America, Australia and Oceania, headed by Isaak Vinnikov; * Archaeology, headed by P. P. Efimenko; * Folklore, headed by Mark Azadovsky; * History of Religion, headed by Yury Frantsev. The Museum of Anthropology, Archaeology and Ethnography was set up as separate part of the institute under the directorship of Dmitrii Alekseevich Olderogge. It consisted of various departments: * Europe, Caucasus and Western Central Asia, headed by Nikolai Kislyakov; * Siberia, headed by V. N. Chernetsov; * India, Indonesia, and the Far East, headed by Nikolay Kyuner; * The Early Stage of the Primeval Society, Australia and Oceania, headed by Isaak Vinnikov; * North, Central and South America, headed by S. A. Sternberg; * Africa, headed by Dmitrii Alekseevich Olderogge; * Archaeology, headed by S. N. Zamyatnin; * Physical Anthropology, headed by B. N. Vishnevskii. On August 5, 1937, the Institute of Anthropology, Archaeology and Ethnography was renamed the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography. Activities of the IAE The IAE brought together ethnographers and physical anthropologists from throughout the Soviet Union to research the physical-constitutional and socio- historic development of the population. Political leaders had set the anthropologists the task of showing that \\"race\\" from the Marxist-Leninist point of view was not a significant factor in the \\"historical process\\". This was a response to the Nazi development of a \\"race science\\" (Rassenkunde) which was presented as the scientific basis for political theory and practice. Activities of the Institute of Ethnography In 1966 Yulian Bromley was appointed Director of the Institute and retained that position until 1989, having a major impact on Soviet Anthropology.

It was originally made and introduced by Kenner in 1973, and reintroduced by Hasbro in 2006. History =1970s-1980s= The first Baby Alive doll was introduced by Kenner in 1973. It could be fed food packets mixed with water, and came with a bottle, diapers, and feeding spoon. The spoon would be inserted into its mouth, and a lever on its back pushed to have it chew the food. The food would move through her and end up in her diaper; this version did not speak, so you had to check the diaper a few moments after feeding. It also produced droppings and threw up regularly. The dolls sold in the mid-70s were battery powered. They chewed and drank from the bottle. They were activated by the spoon, the bottle, or a finger. These also peed and pooped. They did not throw up. =1990s= In 1992 the first talking Baby Alive doll was produced. It was fed in the same manner, but swallowed automatically without the need for a lever, and used a potty instead of a diaper. There were sensors located inside the doll to detect what stage the food was at, and trigger its voice to say \\"I have to go potty\\" or \\"All done now.\\" These dolls did not sell well due to the loud gear noises and her \\"deep adult voice.\\" It was later discontinued, and a non-speaking baby was released in 1995 with snacks and juice boxes, although these came in boxes and cans rather than packets that were mixed with water. They, as opposed to modern Baby Alive doll food and juice, had names such as Yummy Juice and Baby Cherries. It only came in two versions, Baby Alive and Baby All Gone. It appeared as a doll with blue eyes and messy curly blonde hair, not dissimilar to the modern doll, although the 1990s version seemed more traditional and less \\"cartoon-ey\\". Nowadays, Baby All Gone is fed bananas and yogurt instead of cherries, and the juice or milk is given from a bottle instead of a juice box, which saved on cardboard waste from empty boxes. A new, updated doll was introduced called Juice & Cookies Baby Alive who could be fed juice from a box, and cookies could actually be made, when a mix was put in a triangular mould, baked and removed with a scoop. The doll drank and chewed automatically. =Present= After The Kenner Company folded into Hasbro, Hasbro redesigned Baby Alive and in 2003 released a more realistic speaking doll, with additional accessories sold separately.https://www.hasbro.com/ Newborn dolls *Sip 'N Slurp, A baby which when her tummy is squeezed she \\"drinks\\" from her juice cup with a straw attached and \\"wets\\" her diaper. A Sip 'n' Slurp birthday doll was released in 2008 is the same principle as sip n' slurp, but her birthday can be celebrated everyday because she can \\"blow\\" on her party blower and \\"blow\\" out a candle on her cupcake she has a cup with attached straw just like the Sip 'n' Slurp. *Wets 'N Wiggles, This doll comes in either a girl or a boy and is given juice and lets you know it is wet by crying and wiggling and then the diaper is changed. Unlike the other dolls, it does not speak. *Pat 'N Burp, A newborn baby that \\"drinks\\" from her bottle and when pat or squeezed, she \\"burps\\". She can come in numerous skin and eye colors. *Sip 'N Snooze, A baby that gets \\"sleepy\\" as you feed her a bottle and gets snuggled when she falls asleep. She can come in blonde or brunette hair colors. Speaking toddler dolls *Baby Alive Learns to Potty: A new potty training version of the doll, where the baby gets fed and is given a bottle and tells you when she has to go potty by saying phrases such as \\"Potty time!\\" or \\"Hurry-hurry!\\", and she \\"goes\\" when the food and water move through her, but she has a diaper just in case and then she says \\"Oops! I had an accident\\" if she is not put on the potty in time. She also says \\"I'm a big girl\\" or \\"I love you, Mommy\\", says \\"Yummy!\\" or \\"Mmm, good!\\" when she is fed with her doll food or from her bottle, and sings a discordant version of \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\\". Also, she has a learning feature, where she gets better at using her potty after each feeding. She will ask to use it twice after the second feeding before she goes in her diaper, and so on until the fifth feeding. *Baby Alive Baby's New Teeth: A doll who is \\"teething\\". If her tongue is pressed, new teeth will appear. She has a special teething chew ring, and if you give her a teething cookie she will actually \\"take a bite\\". She drinks from her cup and then wets her diaper. She comes with a toothbrush and toothpaste so the child can \\"brush\\" them. *Baby Alive Soft Face 2006 doll: she can be fed a doll food paste made from a powder, and given a bottle of water. They move through her and end up in her diaper, which is then changed. *Baby Alive Real Surprises: A reissue of the 2006 doll, who eats her doll food and drinks from her bottle, and then wets and messes her diaper afterwards saying \\"Uh-oh! I made a poo-poo\\" or \\"I made a stinky!\\" or \\"Surprise!\\". She talks, sucks her pacifier and sings a discordant version of \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\\". Many people make handmade bottles, doll food and pacifiers for these dolls instead of using those designated. A new version of this doll was introduced in 2013. *Baby Alive Bouncing Babbles: A doll who can bounce up and down, operated by a small internal motor, and which makes giggling and cooing sounds. *Baby Alive Better Now Baby: A doll who is ill and needs treatment. She drinks water from a cup, and then wets her diaper. She is given medicine and the child can \\"check her up\\" as if they are a doctor caring for a patient. A new version of this doll was introduced in 2013. *Baby Alive Baby Go Bye Bye: A doll that is designed for travel by having a papoose and baby carrier in one unit. *Baby All Gone: a doll who is fed \\"bananas\\" on a magnetic spoon and makes them \\"disappear\\", although the food and drinks do not move through to minimise mess caused by doll food moving through. They seem to go into the doll's mouth when they are mechanically retracted back into the spoon. Also, she drinks juice from her bottle, although this doll, unlike other Baby Alive dolls, does not wet. The juice, although seeming to disappear, is also retracted back into the bottle instead of being consumed and moving through. A new version of this doll with drink and wet features was introduced in 2017. *My Baby Alive: a doll who is fed powdered doll food mixed with water and water from her bottle. She makes a belching sound, wets and messes her diaper, and then asks \\"Did I make a stinky?\\". She comes in numerous skin, eye and hair colors. Baby Alive dolls at present are more sophisticated than those of the past, including a stationary bracelet with a button, which when pressed activates the doll to say a phrase, a moving mouth which opens when it senses its special magnetic spoon, bottle or pacifier, or it speaks, and large cartoon-like eyes which can be programmed to open and close, rather than traditional closing eyes when the doll is put down.

Born in 1906 in the town of Mir, Poland, Rabbi Shapiro studied at the prestigious Mir yeshiva from the age of twelve. He also learned at the Radu≈Ñ Yeshiva, and was a pupil of the Chofetz Chaim. Rabbi Shapiro studied at the ≈Åom≈ºa yeshiva, where he was appointed teacher to senior students preparing for semicha. He studied in the ≈Åom≈ºa Kollel under the renowned Gaon Rabbi Aaron Yosef Bakst, and received semicha at the age of 23 from Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor. Due to a directive from Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman for a permanent yeshiva with a head to be set up in Glasgow, a \\"call\\" was sent to Rabbi Shapiro, who arrived to lead the fledgling institution in 1936, three years after its founding. Rabbi Shapiro went on to lead the yeshiva for forty years until 1976. During this period, he married a daughter of Rev. Dr. Israel W. Slotki of Manchester and founded the Glasgow Vaad Hayeshivos (yeshiva council), the Tiferes Bochurim youth movement and the Sabbath Observance Organisation. He also obtained an MA from the University of Glasgow. In 1956, he was appointed rabbi of the newly amalgamated Great Central Synagogue, Glasgow, and later became vice-president of the Glasgow Association of Rabbis. During his extensive tenure in Glasgow, Rabbi Shapiro delivered several long-running shiurim in the city and lectured extensively; he was a tireless advocate of traditional Jewish life and learning. Rabbi Shapiro retired to Jerusalem in 1976, where he died in 1981. He was buried on Har HaMenuchot, and eulogies were delivered by the head of the Vaad Hayeshivos and the rabbi of the Gerrer shtibl where Rabbi Shapiro prayed in his final years. He was survived by his widow Shulamit Rose.

It represents approximately 130 liberal arts colleges in the United States. These colleges work together to promote a greater understanding of the goals of a liberal arts education through their websites, as well as through independent research. Its current chair is Stephen D. Schutt, the president of Lake Forest College. Background The Annapolis Group was first organized in early 1993 in Annapolis, Maryland. Its original members included and expanded upon the Oberlin Group which was first organized in 1984. The Annapolis Group was created by the presidents of Franklin & Marshall College, Gettysburg College, and Dickinson College. Criticism of rankings An article was published on the website for the Annapolis Group (collegenews.org) in 2004, titled, \\"Liberal Arts College Presidents Speak Out on College Rankings.\\" The article included statements made by the presidents of Dickinson, Reed, Puget Sound, St. John's College, Hamilton, Earlham, Hendrix, Colgate, Washington & Jefferson, Centre, Ursinus, Connecticut, Kenyon, Mt. Holyoke, and Skidmore. =Presidents Letter= The Presidents Letter (dated May 10, 2007), developed by Lloyd Thacker of the Education Conservancy, was sent to college and university presidents in the United States in May 2007, concerning the U.S. News & World Report college rankings. The letter does not ask for a full boycott but rather states that: :while we believe colleges and universities may want to cooperate in providing data to publications for the purposes of rankings, we believe such data provision should be limited to data which is collected in accord with clear, shared professional standards (not the idiosyncratic standards of any single publication), and to data which is required to be reported to state or federal officials or which the institution believes (in accord with good accountability) should routinely be made available to any member of the public who seeks it. Instead, it asks presidents not to participate in the \\"reputational survey\\" portion of the overall survey (this section accounts for 25% of the total rank and asks college presidents to give their subjective opinion of other colleges). The letter also asks presidents not to use the rankings as a form of publicity: :Among other reasons, we believe [...] rankings: imply a false precision and authority that is not warranted by the data they use; obscure important differences in educational mission in aligning institutions on a single scale; say nothing or very little about whether students are actually learning at particular colleges or universities; encourage wasteful spending and gamesmanship in institutions' pursuing improved rankings; overlook the importance of a student in making education happen and overweight the importance of a university's prestige in that process; and degrade for students the educational value of the college search process. We ask you to make the following two commitments: 1. Refuse to fill out the U.S. News and World Report reputational survey. 2. Refuse to use the rankings in any promotional efforts on behalf of your college or university, and more generally, refuse to refer to the rankings as an indication of the quality of your college or university.\\" List of colleges and universities Twelve college and university presidents originally signed the letter in early May. The letter currently has 130 signatures, though others may be added at a later date. =2007 movement= On June 19, 2007, during the annual meeting of the Annapolis Group, members discussed this letter. As a result, \\"a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the U.S. News reputational rankings in the future.\\" The statement also said that its members \\"have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process.\\" This database will be web based and developed in conjunction with higher education organizations including the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and the Council of Independent Colleges. On June 22, 2007, U.S. News & World Report editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, \\"In terms of the peer assessment survey, we at U.S. News firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the 'intangibles' of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all- important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges.\\" In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, \\"It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] U.S. News has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. U.S. News first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of U.S. News.\\" References  Notes External links * Official website *List of members Category:College and university associations and consortia in the United States .

Plot summary  Mikami Inaba was fighting a person from another school on her school's rooftop. As they fought, her friend Haru appeared. Seeing Mikami distracted, the man charged at her, causing both of them to break the nearby rabbit cages and fall off the roof. As Mikami fell, she desperately grabbed the rabbit. Suddenly, a flash of pink light appeared. Mikami fused with the rabbit, and gained another personality, called Mimika. Now, Mikami only appears when various people threaten her and her friends. Otherwise, she takes on the form of the innocent, happy-go-lucky Mimika. She gains an incredibly voluptuous body, including an unfeasibly huge bosom. The story continues with the plot of an evil organization trying to uncover the power that causes merging. Characters =Protagonists= ;Haru Matogi: : :The main male lead of the series.

She is incredibly outgoing and carefree. She is also in love with Haru, and showers him with affection whenever possible, sometimes going beyond the bounds of common decency. Her ears are capable of sending out signals that tell most people she is human and that her presence is normal, allowing her to integrate herself into Haru's school with her classmates believing that she has always been there. :Though she has inherited Mikami's looks, she is easily distinguishable from Mikami as she has blonde hair, buckteeth and an even larger bust. She also wears white gloves, in contrast to Mikami's black gloves. =Antagonists= ;Chou of Benten: : :A man who has merged with a dog and is part of some unknown evil organization.

Most likely one of the same woman mentioned in the other myths below.Teseida Or \\"Theseid of the Nuptials of Emilia\\" by Giovanni Boccaccio, translated by Vincenzo Traversa p.387 Harpalyce, daughter of Clymenus Harpalyce was the daughter of King Clymenus of Arcadia, son of either Schoeneus (first version) or of Teleus of Argos (second version). Clymenus was overcome with passion for his daughter. There are several versions of what happened next, of which all embody an incestuous father and a vengeful feast in which a child is killed and served up.This mytheme also figures in the stories of Tantalus and Pelops, of Tereus and Philomela, and of Thyestes and Atreus In the first version Clymenus, son of Schoeneus, raped his daughter and she became pregnant. When the son was born she served him up as a meal at a banquet to his father, who killed her over that. In an alternative version of this tale, she was instead transformed into a bird, the chalkis (see second version below).Hyginus. Fabulae, 206, 238, 239, 246, 253, 255.Nonnus. Dionysiaca, 12. 70, note 11. In the second versionParthenius of Nicaea. Love Stories, 8. Harpalyce was the daughter of Clymenus son of Teleus of Argos, and of Epicasta, and has two brothers: Idas and Therager. Clymenus was overcome with passion for his daughter and secretly embarked on an affair with her that lasted for some time. Finally, Alastor, descendant of Neleus, came to claim Harpalyce as his wife, she having been betrothed to him since she was young. When the couple were halfway to their home, Clymenus abducted her back and lived with her openly as his wife. Harpalyce, being upset by father's treatment of her, killed her younger brother and served him up to his father at a banquet. She then prayed to the gods and was transformed into a bird called the chalkis (a sort of night owl). Clymenus took his own life. Harpalyce, daughter of Harpalycus Harpalyce was the daughter of Harpalykos, king of the Amymnei in Thrace. Her mother died and her father suckled her from the teats of heifers and mares. He trained her as a warrior, intending for her to succeed him as ruler. When Neoptolemus, returning from Troy, attacked Harpalycus and severely wounded him, his daughter retaliated, putting the enemy to flight and saving her father. After her father's death at the hands of the rebellious people, Harpalyce took to plundering herds of cattle, taking advantage of her own ability to run outstandingly fast; eventually she was killed by a group of herdsmen as she got caught in a snare.Hyginus.

History of religious Jewish music The history of religious Jewish music is about the cantorial, synagogal, and the Temple music from Biblical to Modern times. The earliest synagogal music was based on the same system as that used in the Temple in Jerusalem. According to the Mishnah, the regular Temple orchestra consisted of twelve instruments, and the choir of twelve male singers. A number of additional instruments were known to the ancient Hebrews, though they were not included in the regular orchestra of the Temple: the uggav (small flute), the abbuv (a reed flute or oboe-like instrument). After the destruction of the Temple and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people, music was initially banned.

Mourning the destruction of the second temple resulted in the prohibition of using musical instruments. The Yemenites, stringent in their observance, accepted this ban literally. Instead of developing the playing of musical instruments, they perfected singing and rhythm.\\" (See Yemenite Jewish poetry. For the modern Yemenite- Israeli musical phenomenon, however, see Yemenite Jewish music.) It was with the piyyutim (liturgical poems) that Jewish music began to crystallize into definite form. The cantor sang the piyyutim to melodies selected by their writer or by himself, thus introducing fixed melodies into synagogal music. The music may have preserved a few phrases in the reading of Scripture which recalled songs from the Temple itself; but generally it echoed the tones which the Jew of each age and country heard around him, not merely in the actual borrowing of tunes, but more in the tonality on which the local music was based. Classical Jewish religious music From the time of the Renaissance Jewish communities in western Europe have shown some interest in modernizing the service by introducing composed music on the European model. Salamone Rossi, a composer at the court of Mantua, published a volume of psalm settings in a Baroque style similar to Monteverdi, but this did not become widely popular in synagogue use until revived in the late 19th century. In the 18th century the Venice community commissioned a number of works from non-Jewish composers such as Carlo Grossi and Benedetto Marcello. Already in 1603, the sources tell us that harpsichords were used in the Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in Hamburg. Particularly in the Amsterdam community, but to some degree also in Hamburg and elsewhere, there was a flourishing of classical music in the synagogues in the 18th century. Important composers of the time include Abraham de Casseres, Christian Joseph Lidarti and others. There was formerly a custom in Amsterdam, inspired by a hint in the Zohar, of holding an instrumental concert on Friday afternoon prior to the coming in of the Sabbath, as a means of getting the congregants in the right mood for the Friday night service. In the Ashkenazi world, the main impetus towards composed Jewish music came in early 19th century Vienna, where Salomon Sulzer composed settings for a large part of the synagogue service, reflecting traditional Jewish music but set in a style reminiscent of Schubert, who was a friend and contemporary. Settings in a somewhat similar style were composed by Louis Lewandowski of Berlin, Samuel Naumbourg of Paris and Japhet of Frankfurt. From this period dates the widespread use of choirs and organs, though in Orthodox synagogues the organ is not played on Shabbat or festivals, and its use is often confined to celebrations such as weddings. 20th century Anglo-Jewish composers in the same taste are Samuel Alman, Mombach and Saqui. Contemporary Jewish religious music Religious Jewish Music in the 20th century has varied greatly. Religious Jewish Music in the 20th century has spanned the gamut from Shlomo Carlebach's nigunim to Debbie Friedman's Jewish feminist folk, to the many sounds of Daniel Ben Shalom. Velvel Pasternak has spent much of the late 20th century acting as a preservationist and committing what had been a strongly oral tradition to paper. Periodically Jewish music jumps into mainstream consciousness, with the reggae artist Matisyahu being the most recent example. In the 1970s, Jewish boys choirs became popular such as Pirchei (Volumes 1 -6), Miami Boys' Choir, Toronto Pirchei, and London School of Jewish Song. In addition, vocal groups became a fad with the Rabbis' Sons, Rashi and the Rishonim, Simchatone, and Ohr Chodosh. Also, many Orthodox Jews often limit their children's exposure to music produced by those other than Orthodox Jews, so that they will not be influenced by what the parents see as harmful non-Orthodox ideas and fashions. A large body of music produced by Orthodox Jews for children is geared toward teaching religious and ethical traditions and laws. The lyrics of these songs are generally written in English with some Hebrew or Yiddish phrases. Cantillation Probably the oldest surviving tradition in Jewish music is the melodies used in chanting readings from the Scriptures. These melodies are denoted by special signs printed above or below each word in the Hebrew Bible, and differ greatly between Jewish communities, though some features found in many traditions suggest a common origin. They may also differ depending on the book or passage being read, or the time of year (e.g. there are special melodies for the scriptural readings on the High Holy Days, Tisha B'Av, Purim, and the three festival holidays, Sukkot, Pesach and Shavu'ot, as well as deviations from the typical melodies for the chanting of the 10 commandments, the song of the sea and some other smaller sections of text.) Prayer chants Many of the passages in the prayer book, such as the Amidah and the Psalms, are chanted in a recitative rather than either read in normal speech or sung to a rhythmical tune: the style of chant in a particular community is sometimes known as its nusach. The recitatives follow a system of musical modes, somewhat like the maqamat of Arabic music. For example, Ashkenazi cantorial practice distinguishes a number of steiger (scales) named after the prayers in which they are most frequently used, such as the Adonoi moloch steiger and the Ahavoh rabboh steiger. Mizrahi communities such as the Syrian Jews use the full maqam system. The scales used may vary both with the particular prayer and with the season. For examples, there are often special modes for the High Holy Days, and in Syrian practice the scale used depends on the Torah reading for the week (see Weekly Maqam). In some cases the actual melodies are fixed, while in others the reader has freedom of improvisation. Certain passages in the prayers, such as Nishmat, the Kaddish preceding Barechu, and the Kedushah, lend themselves to more elaborate individual rendition or choral singing. In some traditions the tunes of popular hymns are borrowed for these, while in others there are special choral compositions. Piyyut A piyyut is a Jewish liturgical poem, usually designated to be sung, chanted, or recited during religious services. Piyyutim have been written since Mishnaic times. Most piyyutim are in Hebrew or Aramaic, and most follow some poetic scheme, such as an acrostic following the order of the Hebrew alphabet or spelling out the name of the author. Many are in the quantitative metres used for Arabic poetry. Many piyyutim are familiar to regular attenders of synagogue services. For example, the best-known piyyut may be Adon Olam (\\"Master of the World\\"), sometimes attributed to Solomon ibn Gabirol in 11th century Spain. Its poetic form consists simply of rhyming eight-syllable couplets, and it is so beloved that it is often sung at the conclusion of many synagogue services, after the ritual nightly saying of the Shema, and during the morning ritual of putting on tefillin. Another well-beloved piyyut is Yigdal (\\"May God be Hallowed\\"), which is based upon the Thirteen Principles of Faith developed by Maimonides. Piyyutim have traditional tunes, but these vary greatly between communities, and a single community may have up to ten different tunes for well-known piyyutim such as Adon Olam and Yigdal. Modern Jewish composers such as Philip Glass often compose choral settings of piyyutim. Zemirot Zemirot are Jewish hymns, usually sung in the Hebrew or Aramaic languages, but sometimes also in Yiddish or Ladino. The best known zemirot are those sung around the table on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Some of the Sabbath zemirot are specific to certain times of the day, such as those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and Seudah Shlishit, the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon. In some editions of the Jewish prayerbook (siddur), the words to these hymns are printed after the opening prayer (kiddush) for each meal. Other zemirot are more generic and can be sung at any meal or other sacred occasion. The words to many zemirot are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the Middle Ages. Others are anonymous folk songs that have been passed down from generation to generation. Nigun Nigun refers to religious songs and tunes that are sung by groups. It is a form of voice instrumental music, often without any lyrics or words, although sounds like ‚Äúbim-bim-bam‚Äù or ‚ÄúAi-ai-ai!‚Äù are often used. Sometimes, Bible verses or quotes from other classical Jewish texts are sung repetitively in the form of a nigun. Nigunim are largely improvisations, though they could be based on thematic passage and are stylized in form. A revival of interest in Nigun was sparked as part of Hasidism. Different Hasidic groups have their own nigunim, often composed by their Rebbe or leader. One of the most famous court composers was Yankel Talmud, who led the Ger choir in the main Ger synagogues in Poland and in Jerusalem, and also composed more than 1,5000 nigunim to accompany the prayers.Marks, Yehudah. \\"Sing Only for Hashem's Honor\\". Hamodia Israel News, September 12, 2013, pp. A24-A25. Hasidim gather around holidays to sing in groups. There are also nigunim for individual meditation, called devekus or devekut (connecting with God) nigunim. These are usually much slower than around-the-table nigunim, and are almost always sung without lyrics. The Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, spoke of devekus nigunim as ‚Äúsongs that transcend syllables and sound.‚Äù Nigun has also been used by the Musar movement, by the Jewish renewal movement, and in other Jewish movements.https://forward.com/life/faith/387641/niggun-meet-jam- session-joey-weisenberg-may-be-the-future-of-jewish-music Pizmonim Pizmonim are traditional Jewish songs and melodies with the intentions of praising God as well as learning certain aspects of traditional religious teachings. They are sung throughout religious rituals and festivities such as prayers, circumcisions, bar mitzvahs, weddings and other ceremonies. Pizmonim are traditionally associated with Middle Eastern Sephardic Jews, although they are related to Ashkenazi Jews' zemirot. The best known tradition is associated with Jews descended from Aleppo, though similar traditions exist among Iraqi Jews (where the songs are known as shba÷¥hoth, praises) and in North African countries. Jews of Greek, Turkish and Balkan origin have songs of the same kind in Ladino, associated with the festivals: these are known as coplas. The texts of many pizmonim date back to the Middle Ages or earlier, and are often based on verses in the Bible. Many are taken from the Tanakh, while others were composed by poets such as Yehuda Halevi and Israel Najara of Gaza. Some melodies are quite old, while others may be based on popular Middle Eastern music, with the words composed specially to fit the tune. Baqashot The Baqashot are a collection of supplications, songs, and prayers that have been sung by the Sephardic Aleppian Jewish community and other congregations for centuries each week on Shabbat morning from midnight until dawn. Usually they are recited during the weeks of winter, when the nights are much longer. The custom of singing Baqashot originated in Spain towards the time of the expulsion, but took on increased momentum in the Kabbalistic circle in Safed in the 16th century. Baqashot probably evolved out of the tradition of saying petitionary prayers before dawn and was spread from Safed by the followers of Isaac Luria (16th century). With the spread of Safed Kabbalistic doctrine, the singing of Baqashot reached countries all round the Mediterranean and became customary in the communities of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Rhodes, Greece, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Turkey and Syria. It also influenced the Kabbalistically oriented confraternities in 18th-century Italy, and even became customary for a time in Sephardic communities in western Europe, such as Amsterdam and London, though in these communities it has since been dropped. By the turn of the 20th century Baqashot had become a widespread religious practice in several communities in Jerusalem as a communal form of prayer.

Also, there are distinct code paths in the assembly language or C source code which support certain hardware. Therefore, the source code can be successfully compiled onor cross-compiled fora great number of computer architectures. Furthermore, the required free and open-source software has also been developed to interface between Linux and the hardware Linux is to be executed on. For example, compilers are available, e.g. GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and LLVM/Clang. For cross-compilation a number of complete toolchains are available, like GNU toolchain, OpenWrt Buildroot or OpenEmbedded. The Yocto Project is targeted at embedded use cases. The portability section of the Linux kernel article contains information and references to technical details. Note that further components like a display server, or programs like Blender, can be present or absent. Fundamentally any software has to be ported, i.e. specifically adapted, to any kind of hardware it is supposed to be executed on. The level of abstraction that has been kept in mind while programming that software in the first place dictates the necessary effort.

The target also comprises the \\"system design\\" of the entire system, be it a supercomputer, a desktop computer or some SoC, e.g. in case some unique bus is being used. In former times, the memory controller was part of the chipset on the motherboard and not on the CPU-die. Although the support of a specific instruction set is the task of the compiler, the software must be written with a certain level of abstraction in mind to make this portability possible. Any code written in Assembly language will be specific to the instruction set.

Edgar Thurston CIE (1855‚Äì 12 October 1935) was a superintendent at the Madras Government Museum who contributed to studies in the zoology, ethnology and botany of India and published works related to his work at the museum. Thurston was educated in medicine and lectured in anatomy at the Madras Medical College while also holding his position at the museum. His early works were on numismatics and geology and these were followed by researches in anthropology and ethnography. He succeeded Frederick S. Mullaly as the superintendent of ethnography for the Madras Presidency. Early life Edgar Thurston was the son of Charles Bosworth Thurston of Kew, London. Schooled at Eton College, he then studied medicine at King's College, London, qualifying as LRCP in 1877. He worked as a medical officer in Kent County Lunatic Asylum and became a curator of the museum at King's College before joining the Madras Museum in 1885 as a superintendent. Ethnography and geography Whereas early European ideas on phrenology were applied to identify mental traits of individuals, advocates of scientific racism used what they considered to be more refined anthropometric measurements to identify castes. Thurston was one such person. He believed that intelligence was inversely proportional to the breadth of the nose and claimed that he scrutinised this as well as handwriting when recruiting clerks in his office. He gave lectures to the students of the Madras University and sometimes to the Madras Police on practical anthropology during the 1890s, and he trained the Madras Police in the use of anthropometry for criminal identification. The Bertillon system had already been incorporated in the Bengal and Madras Police departments by the 1890s and Thurston's training was intended to help the police identify membership of what were then termed as \\"criminal castes\\". In 1901, Thurston was appointed to the Ethnographic Survey of India project, established at that time following the success of Herbert Hope Risley's Ethnographic Survey of Bengal. Risley was an adherent to the theories of scientific racism and had been appointed as director of Ethnology in India. Thurston worked as a part of this project to collect accurate anthropometric measurements. These included a number of measurements of the skull and derived indices or proportions such as the nasal index. He did this work alongside his role as superintendent of the Madras Museum, a position that he did not leave until 1908. Among other published works, Thurston wrote the seven volumes of Castes and Tribes of Southern India, published in 1909 as part of the Ethnographic Survey of India. In that work he was assisted by K. Rangachari, a colleague from the Madras museum who had also assisted him in a 1906 ethnographic study, Ethnographic Notes in Southern India. Rangachari had supplied most of the forty photographs used in this earlier study. The September 1910 edition of Nature described the 1909 publication as Thurston also authored The Madras Presidency, with Mysore Coorg, and the associated States, being the third volume of the four-volume series \\"Provincial Geographies of India\\" which was published between 1913‚Äì23 by the Cambridge University Press under the editorship of Thomas Henry Holland. Kavita Philip describes it as combining \\"a textbook style account of physical and cultural geography with ethnographic detail on habits, customs and festival of the natives\\". Botany and zoology Thurston made numerous collections of plant and animals specimens, many of which were sent to the British Museum. In the late 1880s he was involved in studies on pearl fishing in the Gulf of Mannar. On a visit to Europe he sought to find electric lights that would work at a depth of 20 fathoms so as to assist in pearl harvesting. Some species have been named after him, including the marine organisms Manaria thurstoni (E.A. Smith, 1906), Sepia thurstoni (W. Adam & W. J. Rees, 1966), Mobula thurstoni (Lloyd, 1908), and Ecteinascidia thurstoni (Herdman, 1890). Also, a species of Indian snake, Gerrhopilus thurstoni (Boettger, 1890), is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Thurston\\", p. 265). Museum and art Aside from his role at the Madras Museum, Thurston was for some time Honorary Secretary to the now- defunct Fine Arts Society of Madras and was influential in promoting the artistic works of Raja Ravi Varma and his brother C. Raja Raja Varma. Later life Thurston was awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, first class, on 26 June 1902. He was made C.I.E. in 1909. He retired to England and spent his winters at Penzance where he studied the local plants and regularly hosted a New Year party for the local botanists. He died on 12 October 1935 at Penzance.

It was supported by a major buildup of US naval forces and aggressive exercising in seas proximate to the USSR; it explicitly targeted Moscow's strategic missile submarines with the aim of pressuring the Kremlin during crises or the early phases of global war.

Name Erycius Puteanus is a latinization of his name, which was rendered in various ways, including Hendrick van den Putte (Put, Putten), Errijck (Eryck, Eerryck) de Put or Eric van der Putte. This was also Latinized as Ericus Puteanus. He was also known as Henry du Puy. Life He was born in Venlo and studied at the schools of Dordrecht and Cologne (College of the Three Crowns), where he took the degree of Master of Arts, 28 February 1595. He then followed, at Leuven, the lectures on ancient history given by Justus Lipsius. In 1597 he travelled to Italy and met scholars, especially Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, through whom he was appointed professor of Latin at the Palatine School of Milan from 1600 to 1606. Then the States of Brabant offered him the chair left vacant by Lipsius at Leuven. He taught at the Collegium Trilingue at the University of Leuven for forty years. He was loaded with favours by reigning princes: the Archduke Albert appointed him his honorary counsellor (1612), and increased his annual pension by 200 ducats (1614), adding the reversion of Ch√¢teau-C√©sar. At the same time he filled, after 1603, the post of historiographer to Philip III of Spain, on behalf of the Milanese, with other appointments. His outspoken language provoked political animosities, and he was almost driven into exile by request of King James I of England, who wrongly believed him to be the author of Corona Regia (1615), a scandalous satire about James's parentage and behaviour. He fathered 17 children, and died in Leuven. Work Puteanus was an encyclopedist; in one period of his literary activity (1603‚Äì19), he detached himself from Lipsius by aiming at personal leadership of a school. He then went back to chronological works. As a philologist some of his dissertations were reproduced in the Thesauri of Gr√¶vius and Gronovius. Among his more than 90 works is a treatise on music, Modulata Pallas, which also appeared in four later substantially altered adaptations. One of these is Iter Nonianum, which was a comprehensive scholarly study of music theory. One distinctive feature is his extension of the Guidonian hexachord (ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la) with a seventh note bi, accompanied by a justifying cosmological and numerological emphasis on the number seven.

There also was an amusement park in construction. It was said to reopen in September 2010, but the promise never came through. There was also a Unity-programmed version of the game called Myepets 3D, which works similar to the EarthBound series, in which the player's pets can use physical and psychic attacks, buy weapons and armour and fight enemies and bosses.

It succeeded the Council of the Governor-General of India, and was succeeded by the Constituent Assembly of India and after 1950, was succeeded by Parliament of India. During the rule of the East India Company, the council of the Governor-General of India had both executive and legislative responsibilities. The council had four members of the Council elected by the Court of Directors. The first three members were permitted to participate on all occasions, but the fourth member was only allowed to sit and vote when legislation was being debated. In 1858, the British Crown took over the administration from the East India Company. The council was transformed into the Imperial Legislative Council, and the Court of Directors of the Company, which had the power to elect members of the Governor-General's Council, ceased to have this power. Instead, the one member who had a vote only on legislative questions came to be appointed by the Sovereign, and the other three members by the Secretary of State for India. Predecessors The Regulating Act of 1773 limited the influence of the Governor-General of India and established the Council of Four, elected by the East India Company's Court of Directors. Pitt's India Act of 1784 reduced the membership to three, and also established the India Board. 1861 to 1892 The Indian Councils Act 1861 made several changes to the Council's composition. The council was now called the Governor- General's Legislative Council or the Imperial Legislative Council. Three members were to be appointed by the Secretary of State for India, and two by the Sovereign. (The power to appoint all five members passed to the Crown in 1869.) The Viceroy was empowered to appoint an additional six to twelve members . The five individuals appointed by the Indian Secretary or Sovereign headed the executive departments, while those appointed by the Governor- General debated and voted on legislation. =Indians in the Council= There were 45 Indians nominated as additional non-official members from 1862 to 1892. Out of these 25 were zamindars and seven were rulers of princely states. The others were lawyers, magistrates, journalists and merchants. The participation of the Indian members in the council meetings was negligible. * Raja Sir Deo Narayan Singh of Benaras (Jan 1862-1866) * Narendra Singh, Maharaja of Patiala (Jan 1862-1864) *Dinkar Rao (Jan 1862-1864) *Yusef Ali Khan, Nawab of Rampur (Sep 1863-1864) * Maharaja Sir Mirza Gajapati Viziaram, Raj Bahadur of Vizianagram (Jan 1864-1866)(Apr 1872-1876) * Raja Sir Sahib Dayal of Kishen Kot (Jan 1864-1866) * Mahtabchand Bahadur, Raja of Burdwan (Nov 1864-1866) * Khwaja Abdul Ghani, Nawab of Dacca (Dec 1867-1869) * Prasanna Coomar Tagore (Dec 1867-1873) * Dheoraj Singh of Kashipur (Jan 1868-1870) * Sawai Ram Singh II, Maharaja of Jaipur (Aug 1868-1870)(Aug 1871-1875) * Digvijay Singh, Raja of Balrampur (Oct 1868-1870) * Ramanath Tagore (Feb 1873-1875) *Raja Shamsher Parkash of Sirmur * Sir Ishwari Prasad Narayan Singh, Maharaja of Benaras (1876) * Sir Narendra Krishna Deb (1876) * Nawab Faiz Ali Khan, Nawab Bahadur of Pahasu (1877) * Kalb Ali Khan, Nawab of Rampur (1878-1887) * Syed Ahmad Khan (1878-1882) * Jatindramohan Tagore (Bengal Zamindars) (1880-1881) * Raghubir Singh of Jind (1880) * Raja Shiva Prasad of Benaras * Durga Charan Laha, Maharaja of Shyampukur (1882) (Calcutta Merchants) * Kristo Das Pal (1883) *Syed Ameer Ali (1883- ) * Vishvanath Narayan Mandlik (1884-1887)http://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/greater_bombay/publiclife.html * Sir Shankar Bakhsh Singh (1886) * Peary Mohan Mukherjea * Dinshaw Maneckji Petit (1886) * Khwaja Ahsanullah * Sir Romesh Chandra Mitra, Bengal * Krishnaji Lakshman Nulkar, Bombay (1890-1891) * Rashbihari Ghosh (1892) 1892 to 1909 The Indian Councils Act 1892 increased the number of legislative members with a minimum of ten and maximum of sixteen members.

The Governor-General nonetheless retained significant power over legislation. He could authorise the expenditure of money without the Legislature's consent for \\"ecclesiastical, political [and] defence\\" purposes, and for any purpose during \\"emergencies\\". He was permitted to veto, or even stop debate on, any bill. If he recommended the passage of a bill, but only one chamber co-operated, he could declare the bill passed over the objections of the other chamber. The Legislature had no authority over foreign affairs and defence. The President of the Council of State was appointed by the Governor-General; the Central Legislative Assembly elected its own President, apart from the first, but the election required the Governor- General's approval. Under the Indian Independence Act 1947, the Imperial Legislative Council and its houses were dissolved on 14 August 1947 and was replaced by the Constituent Assembly of India and the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan.

The school is located on two sites in Haslemere and Hindhead in Surrey, England. It has a Christian foundation and accepts pupils from six weeks to 18 years. It was formerly a girls' school and became a diamond school in 2011. History The original Royal Naval School was founded in 1840 as The Royal Female School for the Daughters of Vocal and Marine Officers, one of the earliest academic girls' schools in England. The co-ancestor of The Royal School, The Grove School, was founded in the 1850s and was, equally, a pioneer in girls' education. From the outset the founders' ambition was for the girls to become independent. There are specific reasons for this. =The Royal Naval School= In 1815 The Battle of Waterloo finally put an end to the Napoleonic Wars. In the following peace, the Navy was put on half or even quarter pay. Peace also brought an end to the prize money from captured ships. As the Navy had been at war pretty well non-stop since the 1770s, the potential for Senior Officers to become wealthy and to set themselves up as country gentlemen had become established. The peace brought significant change in their way of life. After Waterloo many Naval Officers found themselves in financial difficulty. They were able to send their young sons from age nine upwards to sea as mid-shipmen where they would gain an education and valuable experience. Their daughters, however, were in a more difficult position. They were too high up the social scale to engage in any menial work to earn their own living but too poor to attract the attention of eligible husbands. Admiral Jahleel Brenton, Admiral Sir Thomas Williams and Captain Hon. Francis Maude established The Royal Naval Female School as it was then known, specifically to provide a sound education which would enable the girls to go out into employment almost certainly as teachers and governesses. The school was founded for the daughters and sisters of Naval and Marine Officers. Queen Victoria and the Queen Dowager were among the first subscribers and from the outset the School had the patronage of The Queen. The Patron, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, opened the QEII Sixth Form building in 1989. In 1975 Princess Anne inherited the Presidency from her uncle, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, after whom the Humanities block is now named. Princess Anne has visited the school, her most recent visit being for Prize Day in 2010. The Princess Anne Sports Hall was opened by her in 1986. =The Grove School= The inheritance from The Grove School is interesting in terms of its intellectual adventurousness; from the start a thorough education was offered. The founder Mrs Lacey was devoted to the cause of women's education at a time when it was generally considered of minor importance. The Laceys were committed both to education and to the Christian faith; the name frequently appears through succeeding generations within The Grove records and beyond, in educational and missionary service abroad. Apart from lessons in their own establishment, extension classes at the University College of Nottingham ‚Äì opened in 1881 ‚Äì were well attended by both teachers and pupils. From the outset the school combined a significant commitment to charity work among disadvantaged girls in London with academic ambition. A number of its pupils were amongst the earliest female students at Oxford and Cambridge. The second Headmistress, Miss Lacey, who took over from her mother, Mrs Lacey, achieved a first class degree in Modern History in the 1890s. It was not until the 1920s, when Oxford formally decided to confer degrees on female pupils, that Miss Lacey was among the number of middle aged people whose academic achievements were finally recognised. =The Royal School= The two schools joined together in 1995. The pupils' are accepted from six weeks (for daycare) and up to 18 years. The evolution of the Diamond model ‚Äì teaching boys and girls separately ‚Äì is unique in the county and provides the opportunity for pupils of both genders to enjoy the social benefits of co-education with the academic benefits of single-sex teaching between the ages of 7 and 16. There are elements of the uniform that have a historical connection ‚Äì the girls' suit jackets are cut short in the naval style and the tippets are as used at the funeral of Queen Alexandra in 1925. The founder schools were among the very first to take the education of girls seriously.

Looney Tunes cartoon. The short stars Bugs Bunny, and features the Genie and Caliph Hassan Pfeffer, who is after Bugs and the genie in his lamp. The voices of Bugs Bunny and Caliph Hassan Pfeffer are voiced by Mel Blanc, and the voice of the genie is played by Jim Backus. The cartoon is a takeoff of the story of Aladdin's Lamp. Elements of this short would later be re-used for the Arabian era in Bugs Bunny & Taz: Time Busters. Plot Bugs finds Aladdin's lamp while digging a rabbit hole; believing it is junk, he starts to clean it, rubbing the dirt off so he can use it as an ashtray. A genie appears and tells him to make a wish. Calling him \\"Smokey,\\" Bugs reluctantly starts to make multiple wishes, only to be interrupted by the genie each time. Bugs ultimately requests two carrots, which the genie produces. \\"Smokey\\" remarks that he wants to return to his home in Baghdad, and Bugs, imagining how fabulous it must be, remarks to himself that he wishes he could go to Baghdad. Interpreting it as an actual wish, the genie then puts Bugs in the lamp and fires him from it like a cannon, and the two fly off to Baghdad. As they arrive, Bugs sputters and 'conks out,' and he and the lamp fall into the Royal Palace of Caliph Hassan Pfeffer, angering the caliph, who then wants the lamp. When Bugs refuses, the caliph threatens Bugs at swordpoint, and a chase ensues, during which Bugs' attempts to enlist the lazy genie's help fail. Bugs eventually tries to escape from the caliph by taking a magic carpet rigged with an outboard motor. When Bugs tries to draw the genie again, the genie becomes angered and warns Bugs saying, \\"If you disturb me once more, I'll beat you to a pulp.\\" The carpet's motor runs out of gas, and Bugs crash-lands back into the palace, and the caliph now has possession of the lamp. When the caliph tries to draw the genie out of the lamp, in spite of Bugs' warning not to try this, the genie emerges, larger and angrier than before, and beats the caliph to a pulp. Cheering Bugs on his victory, he grants Bugs a wish as a celebration. He whispers to \\"Smokey,\\" who produces a ball that becomes a puff of smoke when dropped. The scene concludes showing Bugs as a caliph himself, surrounded by a harem of female rabbits, and wondering \\"what the poor rabbits are doing this season.\\" Home video releases A-Lad-In His Lamp has been released on the Warner Home Video laserdisc Wince Upon A Time, and the VHS releases Bugs Bunny's Hare Raising Tales and Looney Tunes Collector's Edition: Daffy Doodles. Depiction of Middle Easterners This short was the earliest in the Bugs Bunny series to be set in either the Middle East or North Africa, and the first to feature Arabs or Islam. In this case, the setting is Baghdad, depicted with Las Vegas-style flashy signs and desert-like streets. Also depicted is the used rug lot of Mad Man Hassan, where people can sell their magic carpets.Sensoy (2010), p. 113-123 The scene soon shifts to the palace of Caliph Hassan Pfeffer, built on a G.I. loan, a mortgage loan for veterans guaranteed by the federal government of the United States. The caliph is depicted as a lazy man, reclining on pillows and smoking a hookah. When he discovers the magic lamp of Aladdin, his expression turns to \\"child-like glee\\" and his motive for the rest of the short is greed. His facial expressions during the pursuit of the lamp tend toward the grotesque, while he is waving a big sword and growling. As do Middle Eastern villains in other Looney Tunes shorts, he has bushy eyebrows, moustache and beard which enhance his physically intimidating presence. Such shorts reinforce stereotypes concerning Muslims and Middle Easterners, depicting them as lazy, hedonistic, pleasure-seeking, easily angered, and indiscriminately and irrationally violent. Punishments for various offenses are depicted as too severe, Draconian in favoring capital punishment for the most minor of offenses. \\"Death is the default punishment\\" is a concept used to reinforce such stereotypes. The G.I. loan that financed the building of the caliph's palace fits another stereotype: that of Muslim men deriving their power from the support of the Western world. These shorts tend to make no distinctions among Arabs, Muslims, and Persians, terms which in popular culture tend to be depicted as \\"interchangeable\\". For all the menace of their weapons (often swords), they are inept in using them and easily manipulated by the \\"Western hero\\" Bugs. Also lacking are depictions of diligence and productivity in the Middle East, thus portraying the Middle East as being a cultural backwater, unaffected by modernity. In 1991 when the short was one of 120 Looney Tunes being shown in AMC Theatres nationwide prior to, and during, the Gulf War; Warner Bros. responded to criticism from Casey Kasem, voice artist and radio personality of Arab descent, by issuing the following statement: > \\"To see the short is to recognize it as simply a classic cartoon, produced > 43 years ago, satirizing a classic children‚Äôs fairy tale, intended - as all > our cartoons are - only as good-natured fun\\". Vivian Boyer of Warner Bros. further clarified that \\"it was never intended to be a racist cartoon\\".

One case of expropriation from a private landowner named Younis became a test case before the High Court of Israel in 1953, as the land had been expropriated by the government without notifying the owner. In 1954 the court ruled that the law did not require the owner to be notified and did not provide a right for the owner to contest the expropriation in advance. This ruling and one other effectively ended the possibility of land owners using the courts to contest the seizure of their land. The neighboring village of  øAra was merged with Ar'ara in 1985. Maqam Shaykh Khalaf Maqam Shaykh Khalaf is the only building which was noted by the antiquities authorities in the Mandate area, and it is located on a slope by the highest point in the village, set in the middle of extensive graveyards. The Maqam is a single rectangular chamber, covered by a dome. The two top courses are chamfered towards the dome. On the north side is a doorway, and double window set inside shallow arches. There is also a set of windows on the west side. Inside, there are three cenotaphs, located east-west, close to the west wall. A mihrab is located on the south wall.

He was the twin brother of Juan de Vald√©s. Alfonso de Vald√©s was born c. 1490 in Cuenca, Castile, Spain.J. A. Fern√°ndez-Santamar√≠a, The State, War and Peace: Spanish Political Thought in the Renaissance, 1516-1559, (Cambridge University Press, 1977), 38. His talents gave him early advancement and he accompanied Charles V in 1520 on the journey from Spain to the coronation at Aachen, and in 1521 to the Diet of Worms. From 1522 he was a secretary of the imperial chancellery and as secretary wrote a number of important state papers: in 1525, he drew up the report of the battle of Pavia; in 1526 the energetic, graphic, and at times deliberately sarcastic state paper addressed to Pope Clement VII, in which the faithlessness of the pope is stigmatized, and an appeal is made for the convoking of an Ecumenical Council. After the capture and sack of Rome in 1527, Vald√©s wrote the dialogue Lactantius in which he violently attacked the pope as a disturber of the public peace, an instigator of war, and a perfidious deceiver, declared the fate of Rome the judgment of God, and called the Papal States the worst governed dominion in the world.Juan and Alfonso de Valdes, K. Benrath, The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol.12, Ed. Samuel Macauley Jackson, (Funk & Wagnalls Company, 1912), 125. The dialogue was printed in 1529 and was widely read. The papal nuncio at Madrid, Baldassare Castiglione, brought an accusation before the Inquisition, but the trial amounted to nothing because Charles V took his servant under his protection, while the grand inquisitor also declared that it was not heretical to speak against the morals of the pope and the priests. Consequently, it was decided that the dialogue was not calumnious. Vald√©s was full of enthusiasm for the ideas of Erasmus of Rotterdam and sought to gain currency for them in Spain. In 1529 he accompanied the emperor to Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. At the Diet of Augsburg in 1530 he was an influential negotiator with Philip Melanchthon and the Protestants, and met them in a pacific and conciliatory spirit; yet it cannot be said that he shared their views or showed that he understood Martin Luther's motives; his point of view was solely that of a statesman. In October, 1531, he wrote from Brussels the letter of congratulation to the Catholics of Switzerland after the victory over Zwingli. He died in Vienna in October 1532.

In 2019, there were around 200 pupils in the Junior School and 700 in the Senior School. History St John's Hospital site of the school from 1633 to 1878 The School traces its origins from the opening of the Exeter Free Grammar School on 1 August 1633, attended mainly by the sons of the City freemen. Exeter's wealthy merchants, notably Thomas Walker, provided the finance, with sufficient bequests to pay the Headmaster ¬£50 a year and to install the school in the medieval buildings of St John's Hospital, which had stood on the south side of the High Street since the 12th century. In 1878, the school opened as Exeter Grammar School at a new campus designed by noted architect William Butterfield. The school occupies this site on Victoria Park Road to this day. The cost at the time was ¬£7,600 with a further ¬£16,750 spent on the erection of buildings. It was decided that St John's Hospital Trust had to pay to Exeter School the net annual income of all endowments for Exhibitions and Scholarships attached to the School, and it also had to pay a proportion of the residue of its income. In 1920, the Governors of Exeter School decided that it was no longer possible for the school to continue without considerable assistance. The Exeter Education Authority agreed to assist but only if the school came under its direct control so, in April 1921, control of the school was handed over to the City. It then became a \\"maintained\\" school until 1929 when it became an \\"aided\\" school, thus regaining charge of its own finances under a newly appointed Governing Body.Bush, R.J.E.

In September 1976, the first \\"independent\\" pupils were admitted to the school.\\"Study of Occupational Change\\", Nuffield College, Oxford, 1972 From 1979, the School participated in the Assisted Places Scheme, taking over 200 pupils at its peak, but the scheme was abolished by the government in 1997 and the last of those pupils left in the summer of 2004.\\"Exeter Middle School's Cup Final\\", The New Millennium In 1981, the Sixth Form became coeducational. Following the success of the move, girls were admitted to all years in 1997. The school maintains links with its former pupils through the Old Exonian Club which meets annually around the country. There is an Alumni Office which opened in September 2013. It was set up to develop and foster lifelong relationships between the School and its past pupils and staff. Academic standards In March 2014, the Independent Schools Inspectorate reported upon eight areas: the quality of the pupils' achievements and learning; the contribution of curricular and extra-curricular provision; the contribution of teaching; the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils; the contribution of arrangements for pastoral care; the contribution of arrangements for welfare, health and safety; the quality of governance; and the quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, carers and guardians. The report concluded that the 7-18 co-educational day school was at the highest level, excellent, in each of the eight areas. The team of nine reported that \\"the quality of the pupils' achievements is excellent in their academic work and their activities.\\" The ISI report continues: \\"Teaching is excellent and promotes high quality learning. The broad curriculum enables pupils to have a wide range of experiences and the extra -curricular provision is extensive. Pupils achieve individual and team successes in a wide range of activities and national competitions. Pupils have an excellent attitude to their work and this makes a significant contribution to their achievement and progress.\\" The report also commented on the excellent relationships between staff and pupils where learning is seen as a co-operative venture. \\"Teachers have high expectations of their pupils and pupils feel well supported by staff who offer much help and encouragement beyond the classroom with drop in sessions, academic clubs, work on the intranet and individual support.\\" In the summer of 2019, Exeter School celebrated another set of very good A Level results with a 100% pass rate. 21% of all grades were A*, four times the national average, and 54% of grades were either A* or A, more than double the national average of 25.2%. 81% of all grades were A*, A or B. Summer 2019's GCSE results were also excellent; 74% were 9-7 grades, over three times the national average. Of the 118 pupils in Year 11, 67 achieved 8 or more 9-7 grades with 37 pupils scoring ten or more 9-7 grades. In December 2017, The Sunday Times named Exeter School ‚ÄòSouth-West Independent Secondary School of the Year 2018‚Äô. The 25th edition of its annual Schools Guide, Parent Power, awarded the top place to the co- educational independent school, based on its outstanding academic achievements and overall educational provision.

In Iceland, linguistic purism is archaising, trying to resuscitate the language of a golden age of Icelandic literature. The effort began in the early 19th century, at the dawn of the Icelandic national movement, aiming at replacing older loanwords, especially from Danish, and it continues today, targeting English words. It is widely upheld in Iceland and it is the dominant language ideology. It is fully supported by the Icelandic government through the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies, the Icelandic Language Council, the Icelandic Language Fund and an Icelandic Language Day. History =Early innovations= A page of '''' The first signs of the Icelanders' pre-occupation with their mother tongue date back to the mid-12th century with the First Grammatical Treatise ('), which undertook to design an alphabet for the language and proposed separate (non-Latin) letters for the distinctive Icelandic phonemes. It was, in a way, an attempt to give the young Icelandic people a language of their own. Also significant was the Icelandic historiography, which started at an early date with Ari √ûorgilsson's √çslendingab√≥k and ranged through the Landn√°mab√≥k (book of colonization) to Snorri Sturluson's '. In particular, the prose of the sagas of the Icelanders and 's skaldic poetry are clear signs of appreciation of the native language. By 1300, after the Icelanders had joined in union with the Norwegian crown, Icelandic had developed several characteristics that distinguished it from the dialects of the Norwegian districts from where many had migrated to Iceland centuries earlier. By the 16th century, the language was so differentiated from the languages spoken in Scandinavia that Icelanders coined the term √≠slenska to denote their native tongue. A serious effort to preserve the now quite distinct Icelandic from the \\"corrupting\\" influences of foreign words, especially by the Danish and German merchants who dominated Iceland's trade, began in the early 17th century thanks to Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson. =18th and 19th centuries= The first real instigator of Icelandic linguistic purism (') was Eggert √ìlafsson (1726‚Äì68). Between 1752 and 1757 he accompanied his friend on an expedition through Iceland. In his report, he described the situation of the Icelandic language as lamentable. This inspired him to write the poem ', in which he personifies his mother tongue as a woman, who has fallen mortally ill through an infection with too many foreign words. She sends her children to look for good and pure Icelandic that can cure her, but uncontaminated language is nowhere to be found, and she dies. At the end of the poem he urges his compatriots to defend their language and reminds them of the great esteem in which Icelandic is held abroad and how well it has been preserved by their forefathers. Eggert √ìlafsson was very well-read in Old Icelandic literature and this was noticeable in his writings. This interest in the old language brought him into contact with other Icelandic students in Copenhagen, where he joined a secret society called (1720‚Äì72). This was the beginning of the use of Old Icelandic as a key feature in the Icelandic national awakening. Eggert wrote the first orthographical dictionary (R√©ttritab√≥k Eggerts √ìlafssonar) in which he proposed orthographic and phonetic rules. The influence of the book was considerable, and √ìlafur Olavius, originator of the Hrappseyjarprentsmi√∞ja, the first privately owned printing shop in Iceland, followed Eggert's rules to a significant extent. Eleven years after Eggert's death, the ' (Icelandic Art-Learning Society) was founded in Copenhagen with J√≥n Eir√≠ksson, administrative director at the Danish Ministry of Finance, as its president. The society published annual writings from 1781 to 1796, which dealt with practical subjects like trade and business, but also with varied scientific topics about which little had been read until then. This brought along a flood of new Icelandic terminology, generated from purely Icelandic lexical stock. In Denmark, the rise of Romanticism brought with it a greater interest in Norse mythology. This opened the eyes of Icelanders with regard to their cultural importance and increased their self-confidence. The Danish linguist Rasmus Rask (1787‚Äì1832) learnt Icelandic in his youth and it became his favorite language. He compiled the first real Icelandic grammar, which was a huge step forward in comparison with earlier attempts. He refused to accept the differences between Old and Modern Icelandic and was afraid that a too great difference between the two would decrease the interest in the land and its culture. This attitude promoted language archaisation. On Rask's initiative the Icelandic Literary Society, ', was founded. Its goal was \\"to preserve the Icelandic language and literature and therewith the culture and the honour of the land\\". An important publication was ' (1821‚Äì27), which contains much new genuine Icelandic terminology. It was an opportunity to demonstrate the validity of Rasmus Rask's vision that the Icelandic language had, more than most languages, an \\"endless neologistic generating capability\\". During the 19th century, the linguistic purism movement is inextricably connected with the magazine Fj√∂lnir (published from 1835 to 1839 and from 1844 to 1847). The magazine was published in Copenhagen by four young Icelanders: Konr√°√∞ G√≠slason, J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, Brynj√≥lfur P√©tursson and T√≥mas S√¶mundsson. The most important of these four was J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, who also translated literary work of Heine and Ossian. His translation of a textbook on astronomy (', 1842) became exemplary for later translations of scientific literature. Many of the neologisms he coined have become an integral part of present-day Icelandic terminology: ' (gravity), ' (tropics), ' (telescope), ' (parallel). (1808‚Äì91), professor in Old Scandinavian languages at the University of Copenhagen, published the first Danish‚ÄìIcelandic dictionary in 1851. =20th century onwards= When sovereignty was achieved in 1918, government regulation of language matters began. Initially, as with some other preservation attempts noted above, the focus was on orthography, but regulation of language matters grew steadily and became more formalised. Early in the 20th century, the third element in Icelandic preservation, ordinary speakers, especially those in modernising sectors, also began to contribute to language preservation efforts. For instance, in 1918 the Association of Engineers (') began a systematic approach to neologisms. In 1951, a Dictionary Committee of the University of Iceland (') began publishing lists of new words, marking the beginning of formal government sponsorship of neologisms. In 1965, a ministerial decree of the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (') established the ' (Icelandic Language Committee) to \\"guide government agencies and the general public in matters of language on a scholarly basis\\". But this group only had three members and simply could not keep up with the task it was given, even after the addition of two more members in 1980. To remedy this situation, in 1984 the Althing passed legislation which ratified the five person membership and also established a permanently functioning secretariat, the ' (Icelandic Language Institute). The Council was enlarged to 15 members in 1990, appointed by and from a number of sectors. Thus, the Council paralleled its counterparts elsewhere in Scandinavia. Day-to-day operations are the province of the Institute. Occupying a suite of offices on , a street near the University, and previously the site of the American Embassy's cultural center, the Institute today is headed by Ari P√°ll Kristinsson and has only four employees who give advice on language and usage matters to public authorities and the broadcasting service (') and answer questions from the general population. In September 2006, the Institute was merged into the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies. Purpose The Icelandic language is a basic element of the national identity of the Icelanders.Colloquial Icelandic, Daisy J. Neijmann, 2001, Routledge The main focus of linguistic purism in Icelandic is to maintain the structure of the language (for instance as a declined language compared to some other West European Indo-European languages, such as English and French), and to develop its vocabulary, so that the language can be used to speak about any topic‚Äîno matter how technical‚Äîwhich, in turn, contributes to keeping the language up- to-date.Icelandic: at once ancient and modern Creation of new words Organisations and individuals in many specialist areas together with the Icelandic Language Institute propose and use new technical lexis, which diversifies the Icelandic lexicon as a whole. When introducing words for new or modern concepts, it is common to revitalise old words that have fallen into disuse but have a similar meaning or are in the same semantic field. For example, the word ', an old word for \\"long thread\\", was brought back with a new meaning: \\"telephone\\". Alternatively, new compound words such as ' (\\"meteorology\\") can be formed from old words (in this case ' \\"weather\\", and ' \\"science\\"). Thus speakers of Icelandic can easily deconstruct many words to find their etymologies; indeed compound words are very frequent in the Icelandic language. This system also makes it easier for new words to fit in with existing Icelandic grammatical rules: the gender and declension of the compound word can easily be extracted from its derivatives, as can pronunciation. In recent years, the government has promoted an interest in technology, including efforts to produce Icelandic language software and other computer interfaces. Another new combination used instead of an international foreign word is skri√∞dreki (literally \\"crawling dragon\\" ) for \\"army tank\\". Loanwords However intensive the linguistic purification effort, loanwords are still entering the language. Some of these loanwords have been adapted and moulded to fit in with Icelandic grammatical rules, including inflection and pronunciation. For example, the word ' (\\"a car\\") comes from the word \\"automobile\\" via the Danish shortened version '. Sapir and Zuckermann (2008) demonstrate how Icelandic \\"camouflages\\" many English words by means of phono- semantic matching.Sapir, Yair and Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2008), \\"Icelandic: Phonosemantic Matching\\", in Judith Rosenhouse and Rotem Kowner (eds), Globally Speaking: Motives for Adopting English Vocabulary in Other Languages, Clevedon-Buffalo-Toronto: Multilingual Matters, pp. 19-43 (Chapter 2). For example, the Icelandic-looking word ', meaning \\"AIDS\\", is a phonosemantic match of the English acronym AIDS, using the existing Icelandic verb ' (\\"to destroy\\") and the Icelandic nominal suffix '.See pp. 28‚Äì29 of Sapir and Zuckermann (2008 above; compare , another phonosemantic match of AIDS, in this case in Modern Standard Chinese ‚Äî see p. 36 of the same article.In Icelandic, ' competes with another, wholly Icelandic word, '. The question is not settled yet. Similarly, the Icelandic word ' (\\"technology\\", \\"technique\\") derives from ' (\\"tool\\") combined with the nominal suffix ', but is a phonosemantic match of the Danish (or international) ' with the same meaning. This neologism was coined in 1912 by Dr from in the east of Iceland. It was little used until the 1940s, but has since become highly common, as a lexeme and as an element in new formations, such as ' (\\"electronics\\") literally meaning \\"electrical technics\\", ' (\\"technical\\") and ' (\\"technician\\").See pp. 37‚Äì38 of Sapir and Zuckermann (2008) above; compare '/' (lit. \\"of perfection, related to mastering and improving\\"), meaning \\"technical, technological\\", another phonosemantic match of the international word technical, in this case in Modern Arabic ‚Äî see p. 38 of the same article. Other phonosemantic matches discussed in the article are ', ' ‚Äì ', ', ' ‚Äì ' ‚Äì ', ' ‚Äì ', ', ' (image), ', ', ', ', ' ‚Äì ', ' (parrot), ' (radar device), ', ', ' ‚Äì ' ‚Äì ', ' ‚Äì ', ' and ' (virus). An example of adaptation of a foreign word is \\"Israeli\\" (same meaning as in English, as a noun), which in Icelandic has the plural ', formed analogously to native Icelandic words such as the poetic ' (\\"a man\\") and ' (\\"a bow\\"). Foreign language learning Linguistic purification does not imply limitations to or neglect of foreign language learning. Teaching of foreign languages in Iceland is heavily emphasized, and the learning of English and Danish (or another Scandinavian language) in school is compulsory. Danish was taught because Iceland was a dominion of Denmark until 1918 (with the same king until 1944); this study is still compulsory to maintain ties with Scandinavia. English is learned as the main international language, especially in view of the internationalization of the economy of Iceland with intensive trade and capital flows to and from the outside world. Students entering a gymnasium are also usually required to choose a third foreign language. Traditionally that was either German or French, but in recent years Spanish has also been offered in many gymnasia. Other languages are sometimes added as an option but usually as part of a language-heavy course of study at the cost of the natural sciences. Students who have lived in another Nordic country, or for whatever reason have some understanding of another Scandinavian language, can study that language instead of Danish. Ultrapurism A minor movement started by Jozef Braekmans of Lier, Belgium, around 1992 aimed at removing loan words from the modern Icelandic language and creating new terms for all historical loan words. It was named \\"High Icelandic\\" or \\"Hyper-Icelandic\\" (' or ').A 2003 section about High Icelandic on the Icelandic news programme '√çsland √≠ dag' (Iceland today) 2004 article about High Icelandic in Birtingur, the local paper of Akranes. 2007 article about High Icelandic Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ Article about Braekmans neologistic work in DV (edition: January 30, 1999) The movement has not gained traction.

Favoring evidence In research published in 2000 in the Journal of Neurophysiology, researchers described a series of objective and subjective experiments in which subjects were played music, sometimes containing high-frequency components (HFCs) above 25 kHz and sometimes not. The subjects could not consciously tell the difference, but when played music with the HFCs they showed differences measured in two ways: * EEG monitoring of their brain activity showed statistically significant enhancement in alpha-wave activity * The subjects preferred the music with the HFCs No effect was detected on listeners in the study when only the ultrasonic (frequencies higher than 24 kHz) portion of the test material was played for test subjects; the demonstrated effect was only present when comparing full- bandwidth to bandwidth-limited material. It is a common understanding in psychoacoustics that the ear cannot respond to sounds at such high frequency via an air-conduction pathway, so one question that this research raised was: does the hypersonic effect occur via the \\"ordinary\\" route of sound travelling through the air passage in the ear, or in some other way? A peer-reviewed study in 2006 seemed to confirm the second of these options, by testing the different effect of HFCs when presented via loudspeakers or via headphones ‚Äî the hypersonic effect did not occur when the HFCs were presented via headphones.T.

The role of biological system other than auditory air-conduction in the emergence of the hypersonic effect. Brain Research, 1073:339‚Äì347, February 2006. The 2006 study also investigated the comfortable listening level (CLL) of music with and without HFCs, an alternative way of measuring subject response to the sound. The CLL for the music with HFCs was higher than that for the music without HFCs - this provides a quantitative way to demonstrate general listener preference for the music with HFCs. Contrary evidence There are contradictions in Oohashi's results. * No effect was detected on listeners in the Oohashi study when only the ultrasonic (frequencies higher than 24 kHz) portion of the test material was played for test subjects. The demonstrated effect was only present when comparing full-bandwidth to bandwidth-limited material. * Bandwidth-limited material was more highly regarded by test subjects when full-bandwidth material was played immediately prior. Researches from NHK laboratory have attempted carefully but unsuccessfully to reproduce Oohashi's results. 480 man-hours of listening tests conducted at the London AES convention in 1980 by Laurie Finchman of KEF concluded that subjects could not distinguish a 20 kHz band limited version of a test signal from the original played back on equipment capable of reproducing sound up to 40 kHz. System non-linearities (present to varying degrees in all audio reproduction electronics, loudspeakers, etc.) are known to produce lower-frequency intermodulation products when the system is stimulated with high frequency signals. It is suggested that this mechanism could produce signals in the audible range that allow listeners to distinguish the signals. Artifacts like this are a common problem with PC-based hearing self-tests, for instance. In September 2007, two members of the Boston Audio Society and the Audio Engineering Society published their study in which about half of the 554 double-blind ABX test listening trials made by 60 respondents showed the correct identification of high-resolution or CD-standard sampling rate. The results were no better than flipping a coin, producing 274 correct identifications (49.5% success), and it would have required at least 301 correct identifications given 554 trials (a modest 54.3% success rate) to exceed a 95% statistical confidence of audible difference, which will happen about once in twenty such tests by chance alone. Counter-contrary evidence Criticism of Oohashi's studies has been directed primarily at the conclusions regarding listener's preferences the test material; there has been little criticism aimed at the physiological aspect of the studies. Studies cited as contrary evidence did not address the physiological brain response to high-frequency audio, only the subject's conscious response to it. Further investigation of the observed physiological response appears to show that the ear alone does not produce the extra brain waves, but when the body is exposed to high-frequency sound it gives some brain stimulus.Oohashi T, Kawai N, Nishina E, Honda M, Yagi R, Nakamura S, Morimoto M, Maekawa T, Yonekura Y, Shibasaki H. ‚ÄòThe role of biological system other than auditory air-conduction in the emergence of the hypersonic effect‚Äô.

The Point is on the mouth of the Inner Lakes namely Killinure Lough, Coosan Lough and Ballykeeran Lough. It is roughly 0.2 km from Coosan Point (by line of sight), which is the opposite side of the narrow waterway forming the mouth of the Inner Lakes. However to circumnavigate the Inner Lakes by roadway is a trip of almost 15 km (approx). Etymology The name Killinure derives from the Irish for the 'Church of the Yew Tree'. Facilities Killinure Point has a private marina with 100 berths, full services including a 25-ton travel hoist and boat hire Locaboat Holidays (Locaboat Holidays) and maintenance & repair facilities (LoughRee Marine Services). The marina has been awarded the Blue Flag every year since 2003. History The land at Killinure Point was the property of the local Waterston (or Waterstown) House landlord, originally granted in the Cromwellian era eventually changed into private hands in the late 19th century. Transport Killinure Point is a natural point for crossing the water to reduce the distance greatly on the journey into Athlone town (being approx. 5 km from Coosan Point) for people from Killinure and surrounding areas, before the invention of motorised vehicles. There was a ferry service at Killinure Point operating for many years which ended only after a tragedy during the 19th century in which several people were drowned.

The latter name was also the name of a hero of ancient Thebes. The hero of the Athenians Echetlus emerged in the narrative tradition current in ancient Athens after the Battle of Marathon. His description was similar to Bouzyges, who is often depicted bearded, nude and holding a plough and a cattle prod. Some scholars note the close connection of these two with agriculture. Bouzyges was the hero considered the founder of agriculture and his name meant \\"yoker of oxen\\" while Echetlus' meant \\"he of the plough- handle\\". In the battle's account, a man, who resembled a rustic, appeared among the Athenians during the battle and slew many of the Persians with his plough. After the battle, he disappeared. When the Athenians searched for him, they could not find him anywhere. When they consulted the oracle, they were commanded to worship the hero Echetlaeus, that is the hero with the , or ploughshare.Pausanias 1.32.5 It was believed that he was part of the gods' intervention during the conflict, which also included the appearances of divine personages such as Athena and Herakles in the battlefield. Plan showing the major buildings of the Agora; the Stoa Poikile is number 20 This Echetlus was depicted in the painting which represented the Battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile (Painted Porch), erected during the 5th century BC and located in the Ancient Agora of Athens. The hero was clearly distinguishable in this painting among the combatants in the same manner other heroes who fought at Marathon such as Callimachus, the polemarch of Athens, and Miltiades were depicted. Echetlus' mythical status in the eyes of the Athenians can be demonstrated by his inclusion in this painting, which also included Athena, Heracles, and the Attic heroes such as Theseus. The Stoa Poikile was one of the most famous sites in ancient Athens, due to its display of war-related paintings and loot.

Eyb family coat of arms Albrecht von Eyb (August 24, 1420 ‚Äì July 24, 1475) was one of the earliest German humanists. Life Eyb was born in the Sommersdorf castle near Ansbach in Franconia. After preliminary studies at Erfurt, he went to Italy and devoted himself to humanistic study at the University of Pavia and University of Bologna. He returned to Germany in 1451, having in the meantime been appointed canon at Eichst√§tt and Bamberg. From 1452 to 1459 he was again a student at Bologna, winning the degree of doctor of canon and civil law. He was also honoured by an appointment as chamberlain to Pope Pius II. After his return to Germany he resided chiefly at Eichst√§tt. In 1462 he became archdeacon of W√ºrzburg, not, however, without encountering violent opposition from the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, who hated Eyb as a partisan of the Hohenzollern Margrave, Albrecht Achilles. Little is known of his last years. Works Albrecht von Eyb, Ob einem manne sey zunemen ein eelich weyb oder nit, Nuremberg 1472. Eyb's best known and most important work is his Eheb√ºchlein (Book on Marriage), in which he discusses the question whether a man should take a lawful wife or not. It was published in 1472. In 1460 he had written on the same theme in Latin \\"An viro sapienti uxor sit ducenda\\". The German work treats of the joys and sorrows of married life and general maxims of a moral or philosophical character are added. A decision is finally rendered in favour of the married state. The popularity of the book is attested by the fact that between 1472 and 1540 no less than twelve reprints were issued. Another work of Eyb is the Margarita poeticaImage of page (Nuremberg, 1472), a textbook of humanistic rhetoric, consisting of a collection of passages in prose and verse from Latin authors, to which are added specimens of humanistic eloquence. In 1474 Eyb finished his Spiegel der Sitten (Mirror of Morals), a lengthy work of ethical and moral content, probably based on some Latin original. The book did not meet with the favour shown to the Eheb√ºchlein and was not printed until 1511. Appended to it are German translations of two of Plautus's comedies, the Menaechmi and the Bacchides as well as of Ugolini Pisani's Philogenia. Eyb's writings have been edited by K.

The army was first formed in July 1941 with the Far Eastern Front. After spending most of World War II guarding the border in Primorsky Krai, the army fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, and was disbanded shortly after the end of the war. Reformed at Belogorsk when Sino- Soviet tensions rose in the late 1960s in the Far East, the army became part of the Eastern Military District in 2010. World War II The 35th Army was formed from the 18th Rifle Corps in July 1941, part of the Far Eastern Front. It included the 35th, 66th and 78th Rifle Divisions, the 109th Fortified Region and smaller artillery and infantry units. It defended the Soviet border in Primorsky Krai. 18th Rifle Corps commander Major General Vladimir Zaytsev became the army commander. On 1 May 1945 35th Army joined the Maritime Group of Forces. In June, Lieutenant General and Hero of the Soviet Union Nikanor Zakhvatayev became the army commander. Zaytsev was still a major general and became the army's deputy commander. The Maritime Group of Forces was transformed on 5 August 1945 to the 1st Far East Front. It had as part of its structure the 66th, 264th and 363rd Rifle Divisions, the 8th and 109th Fortified Regions, the 125th, 208th, and 209th Tank Brigades, and a number of artillery and other units.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 May 1945 With these forces the army participated in the Harbin-Kirin Offensive Operation during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. During the Harbin-Kirin Offensive, the army was tasked with attacking from positions southwest of Lesozavodsk towards Mishan. The army was to defeat elements of the Kwantung Army on the left bank of the Songacha River and capture the Hutou Fortified Area. Parts of the army were assigned to defend the right bank of the Ussuri and Songacha Rivers, as well as defending railways and roads in the Guberovo and Spassk-Dalny areas. At the beginning of the offensive, the army crossed the Ussuri and Songacha Rivers using transports of the Amur Flotilla and captured Hulin. It captured Mishan on 12 August and by the end of the next day had captured Dunan. The army then captured Kentey-Alin and Boli on 16 August. The army cut off the Kwangtung Army's line of retreat at Mudanjiang. By 19 August, the army was in the Linkou County. The army was then involved in disarming surrendering Japanese soldiers. On 1 October 1945, the army became part of the Primorsky Military District and was disbanded within a month. = Commanders = * Major General Vladimir Zaytsev (June 1941 - June 1945); * Lieutenant General Nikanor Zakhvatayev (June-September 1945).

It was an international co-production between the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Switzerland, Italy and France. Plot At Adanggaman's court, Ossei makes friends with a healer/seer, who was captured as a boy from his village/people by Adanggaman's empire. He heals some wounds that Ossei gained when travelling to Adanggaman, and reveals through his fortune-telling abilities that the future of all in the empire would be bleak for a long time, subject to slavery and oppression. The healer sees his daughter at the court (Naka), who doesn't acknowledge him initially, but recalls her childhood with him guiding her as his only daughter. The seer protests to King Adanngaman, who in turn for his perceived insolence, orders him and Ossei to be sold as slaves. The healer dies whilst in captivity, overcome by disbelief, grief and abandonment. In the end, Ossei leaves Naka, after the two escape, become close friends, and form a household. He goes travelling, to forge a new life, but is captured by soldiers of Adangamaan's court and thus prepped for sale into slavery. He is sold to Europeans, who transport him to the Americas via the Middle Passage, and is renamed John Stanford by a wealthy plantation owner. He dies at age 70, having five children with a slave woman. King Adangaaman is captured by his aides whilst drunk from rum, and in turn sold to Europeans. He becomes a slave in St. Louis, and is a cook to Europeans there, being given the name Walter Brown. He dies in 1698 from tuberculosis. Cast * Rasmane Ouedraogo ...

Kuomintang officials ordered the city be set on fire in 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War to keep its wealth removed from the Japanese. The result of this fire made Changsha one of the most damaged cities during World War II, alongside Stalingrad, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Dresden and others. Background On October 25, 1938, the city of Wuhan fell to the Empire of Japan. Soon after, a great number of refugees and injured soldiers, in addition to government institutions and factories, were relocated to Changsha. This caused a population boom in the city, and the number of residents jumped from 300,000 to more than 500,000. Though the city had prepared for this type of scenario for a long time, due to the limited transport capacity of Changsha, it still could not hold this amount of goods and people. On November 8, the Imperial Japanese Army entered northern Hunan. On the 11th, Yueyang fell. Soon, Chinese and Japanese armies faced off along the Xinqiang River just outside Changsha. The situation in the city became increasingly tense. False intelligence contended that Imperial Japanese forces would attack Changsha from the East. Chiang had already given a speech in Changsha about burning the city if it ever fell risked being captured. Because of a lack of confidence in holding the city, Chiang Kai-shek suggested that the city should be burned to the ground, so that Japan would gain nothing even if it chose to forcefully enter it. On November 10 (some say the 12th), the chairman of the Hunan government, Zhang Zhizhong, passed Chiang's idea to his subordinates in a meeting. An arson team was immediately organized. The team was dispatched to every corner of the city and was ordered to set the fire once a signal fire was set off on the top of Tianxin Building in the southwest of Changsha. Events At around 2 o'clock in the morning of November 13, 1938, there was a fire in a military hospital just outside the South Gate (to this day, it remains a mystery whether the fire was a signal or an accident). The arson team took it as a signal and started to set the fire at 2 o'clock in the morning. The burning lasted for five days, also destroying several 2,500-year-old historical antiques. City residents tried their best to escape, resulting in a severe boat accident at a river ford on the Xiang River. Damage More than 30,000 people lost their lives during the fire. Over 90%, or 56,000, of the city's buildings were burned. The fire also disabled commercial trading, academic institutions and government organizations throughout the city. The fire cost a total economic loss of $1 billion, which accounted for 43% of the total output of the city. Government institutions that were destroyed include the provincial government headquarter, buildings housing the bureaus of civil affairs, construction, police, army mobilizations, security, telegraph, telephone, post as well as the courts, Kuomintang branches, chamber of commerce, central news agency, central radio station and several newspaper offices. More than 31 schools, including Hunan University, were also burned down. Banks destroyed include the Bank of Hunan, Bank of Shanghai, Jiaotong Bank and Bank of China. More than 40 factories were burned. The one that suffered the most was the First Textiles Factory of Hunan. The damage to this factory include $270,000 loss due to burned workshops; $960,000 to raw materials; $600,000 to machinery. Of the city's 190 rice mills and storage buildings, only 12 survived the fire. More than $2 million, or about 80% of the total, were lost in the silk industry. Forty Hunan embroidery factories were completely destroyed. Except for the Xiangya Hospital, every hospital in Changsha was burned to ground. Future Chinese leaders such as Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying were also present in the city during the fire. A verbal description of the fire was written by Guo Moruo, who also happened to be in Changsha during the fire. Aftermath The alarming bell of the fire In Chinese, the character for 'wen' in the term 'Wenxi Fire' refers to the telegraph abbreviation code for the day of the month, whereas 'xi' (meaning 'night') refers to the time of the fire. On November 18, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the executions of three accused in the case. Zhang Zhizhong, the chairman of the Hunan government, also subsequently resigned. On November 19, on the ruins of Changsha, food markets returned. By that time, there were 3 people selling meat and 2 selling vegetables. The Bell Tower and the Xiangya Hospital survived the fire. Chiang's fear proved wrong. The city repulsed three separate attacks against Japanese in 1939, 1941 and 1942. The city did not fall until 1944 to the Japanese in the fourth battle of Changsha although by that time the city no longer held strategic importance. In July 2005, the first memorial commemorating the event in Changsha, a memorial wall on an old lamp company site, was built. The memorial wall is located on the bank of the Xiang River. In the same year, there was also erected a huge alarm clock carving as a tribute to the fire. Lost history Before the fire, Changsha was one of China's few major cities that had not moved its site in 2,000 years. The fire, however, annihilated all the cultural accumulations that the city retained since the Spring and Autumn period.

The story ties in with Mrs. Finley's popular Elsie Dinsmore series, Mildred being a second-cousin of Elsie. The story is set in the United States of America between the 1830s and 1860s. Mildred is the eldest child of Stuart and Marcia Keith (n√©e Stanhope), and has several younger siblings: Rupert, Zillah, Ada, Eva (who died at age five, before the first book begins), Cyril, Don, Fan and Annis. She is in her teens when the series opens, and by the end her own children are in their teens and twenties. List of Books The books, in order of publication, are: #Mildred Keith (1876) #Mildred at Roselands (1880) #Mildred and Elsie (1881) #Mildred's Married life, and a winter with Elsie Dinsmore (1882) #Mildred at Home: with something about her relatives and friends (1884) #Mildred's Boys and Girls (1886) #Mildred's New Daughter (1894) A Life of Faith The series was reissued 2001-2003 as Millie Keith: A Life of Faith, an adaption for modern readers by Kersten Hamilton.A Life of Faith Books, discussion material, dolls and other premiums. The original plot is approximately followed for the first few books, but the final two in particular have completely new story lines. #Millie's Unsettled Season #Millie's Courageous Days #Millie's Remarkable Journey #Millie's Faithful Heart #Millie's Steadfast Love #Millie's Grand Adventure #Millie's Reluctant Sacrifice #Millie's Fiery Trial Plot Mildred Keith is the oldest child in the Keith family, who move from Lansdale, Ohio to the frontier town of Pleasant Plains, Indiana. The family faces various challenges settling into their new home, including an exceptionally bad malaria season. Mildred does not contract malaria, but wears herself out nursing her family. In hopes of improving her health, she goes to spend a year with her relatives, the Dinsmore family, on their Southern plantation, Roselands. During this time she accompanies her uncle, Arthur Dinsmore, Sr. on a trip to Viamede plantation to bring his little granddaughter Elsie to live at Roselands. Mildred also meets and falls in love with Charlie Landreth, but rejects his proposal of marriage on the grounds that as a Christian she cannot marry someone who is an unbeliever. She returns to the North, but continues to correspond with Mr. Landreth for a time and remains hopeful that he will someday become a Christian and they will be able to marry. Back in Pleasant Plains, Mildred puts all her heart into serving her family and neighbors. She receives the gift of a piano, and begins giving lessons to many local young ladies, partly as a source of income. Mildred's sister Zillah marries Wallace Ormsby, a young man whom their father has taken as a partner in his law firm, and who previously wanted to marry Mildred herself. The Keiths receive a visit from Elsie Dinsmore and her father, recently reunited. After years of waiting and hoping, but hearing nothing of her love, Mildred is rewarded when Charlie Landreth arrives unexpectedly. He has become a Christian, and so they marry immediately. Charlie quickly becomes a much loved member of the family, and, as a doctor, of the whole community. Before long Mildred and Charlie welcome their first child, a son named Percy. While he is in his infancy, the Landreths, along with Mildred's sister Annis, travel south to spend a delightful winter with Elsie and her family, which now includes her stepmother, Rose, and baby brother, Horace, Jr. A considerable amount of this part of the story focuses on Elsie alone, with no connection to Mildred. In the following years the Landreth family grows to include Marcia, Stuart and Fan. Zillah and Wallace also have children: Stuart and Ada. Fan Keith dies after a brief illness. Ada Keith marries Frank Osborne and they go to China as missionaries. Cyril goes to college and then marries Lucy. Rupert and Don travel to California to look for gold, and also to give them both a much needed change of scene. On their journey, Rupert is captured by Indians and presumed dead, but three years later he arrives home, along with his young wife, Juanita, a Spanish Mexican who was also held captive by the Indians. Don also returns, having found a small quantity of gold. He marries Flora Weston, a relative of Charlie's who had come to live with the Landreths for a time for the sake of her health. The Keith clan support abolition, and Mildred and Charlie provide a home and work for a family of runaway slaves. However, the family are recaptured by their owner and taken back to a life of slavery. When the Civil War breaks out all the Keiths do whatever they can to support the cause of the Union. Rupert, Wallace, Cyril and Don enlist in the army, but Charlie is persuaded to stay home, since as a doctor he is indispensable to the community. Before the war is over, Percy Landreth and Stuart Ormsby also go to fight. All members of the family return alive, though some are in broken health and have terrible experiences to recount. The final book has been criticised for not being about Mildred at all. It follows the story of four orphaned siblings, Ethel, Blanche, Harry and Nannette Eldon, who are sent to live with a cruel curate before being taken in by their kind uncles. Ethel is determined to support herself and her siblings so that they can live together in their own home and not be beholden to anyone. She works extremely hard and is successful in starting her own business and putting a roof over the heads of her beloved brother and sisters. Nanette dies of an illness in the flower of her girlhood, and is much missed by her family. Through their friendship with the family of Don Keith, Ethel and Blanche meet Percy Landreth and Stuart Ormsby on their return from the war. There is a mutual attraction and the two sisters become brides of the cousins, Ethel becoming Mildred's daughter-in- law.

The model for which changed the face of the music industry today. Early years As a child, Indiana's mother taught dance and her father worked in the aluminium industry. Her musical introductions stemmed from a rather rigid religious upbringing, because of this there are obvious gospel influences in her music today. Indiana suffered from a strong speech impediment in her youth. She underwent years of speech therapy where her therapist would ask her to write poems at home for her to practice singing to help overcome this condition. Indiana claims that her therapist encouraged her to become involved in music and is responsible for her development as a songwriter and an artist. This is where her love of songwriting began and developed. As a youngster, she taught herself to play her grandmother's old upright piano by ear. Between the ages of 12‚Äì16, she wrote and recorded hundreds of songs on a Panasonic tape-deck with a friend. The Sunday Herald quotes Indiana saying, \\"I was five when I wrote my first song, about my cat, Herbert, who was hit by a train\\". At university, Indiana studied music and physiotherapy. In 1991, she won an all- American title and National Dance Association dance championship in Dallas, Texas. Career Stages The roots and beginnings of Indiana's professional career began in 1994 when she moved to southern France and lived there for 12 years (amongst other countries such as Germany, Finland and England). During her time in France, she worked in various bands exploring progressive rock, jazz, and dance music. She recorded several studio demos at Marilyn Studios, Cagnes-sur-Mer over a period of three years revealing the songwriter's deeper retreat into her music exploring jazz and soul music and penning a number of songs. In 2003, she joined a progressive rock band and the musical influences turned to a more aggressive tone mixed with both alternative and gospel influences. In 2004, she was invited to appear on the track Tonight from Kool and the Gang's album, The Hits Reloaded, other artists appearing on that album include Angie Stone, Beverley Knight, Lisa Stansfield, Big Brovaz, Jamiroquai, Tony Hadley. In 2005, she formed a Scottish-based independent record label called Gr8pop with her later-to-become husband Ian Morrow. Ingenious Venture Capital Trust (Avatar, Life of Pi) and Scottish Enterprise supported the project alongside the Gr8pop investors. Her debut album, Woman at Work, was released to the UK in April 2007. The diversity of her music has been explained as an artistic well or \\"stew\\": \\"It's like a stew that has been cooking for a long while: well blended and tasty. Ms. Gregg has achieved a rare feat in the world of music outside of jazz: she has created something organic. And it didn't happen overnight.\\" In 2005 two of her songs, \\"Sweet Things\\" and \\"For Life\\", made it to the top finalists in the Pop category (56 finalists out of the 4000 songs entered) of The UK Songwriting Contest. These two songs were later also released on her 2007 album titled Woman at Work. In 2005, Indiana also did a supporting tour with Wet Wet Wet. Five additional songs by Gregg made the semi-finalist category in the same year: \\"Something like me\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"How Many Tears\\", \\"Love is Blind\\", and \\"Oh Me Oh My\\" all of which were also included on her debut album \\"Woman At Work\\". In 2005, the demo album \\"Something like me\\" had a limited release on the independent label Onestone Music. Later that year, Onestone Music did a deal with Scottish label Gr8pop Ltd.

Videos of her home gigs were posted to YouTube, Myspace, MSN and various other websites with a message about the free competition details. Winners for the series were announced on Myspace and subsequently, UKgigs TV began filming the new series in May 2007. Subsequently, videos of the home gigs were streamed on the front pages of Bebo and over the UK gigs and theatre networks. The Home concerts first appeared in the press when the Express wrote about a surprise concert she performed for a fan's fianc√©e home in 2005 after he saw her live in Exeter supporting Wet Wet Wet. Indiana Gregg announced home concerts in the fall of 2005 which took place primarily in October. In December 2005, she embarked on Starbucks coffee house tour in every major UK city playing intimate acoustic sets in the coffee houses throughout 2006 whilst recording her debut album in the same year. In February and March 2007, she played a UK support tour with Lemar. Indiana, 35 married Ian Morrow, 50 during a 22-date arena and theatre tour with Lemar on March 22, 2007, in Gretna Green's Famous Blacksmith's following her concert at the SECC in Glasgow. Immediately following the Lemar tour, in April 2007 she began a third \\"House Gigs\\" tour which led to UKgigs.tv taking interest in filming the home concerts. The first filmed home concert took place in her own Glasgow home on May 21. On May 23, she played a concert in Finchley North London for the Ovarian Cancer Support group. On May 25, she played a home concert for young fashion designer Hannah Marshall in Colchester. Subsequent gigs were scheduled and filmed across the UK in Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester, Glasgow, and Edinburgh the week beginning June 10. Scotland's Daily Record featured the Indiana Gregg Home gigs on June 12 along with a contest for Father's Day where contestants could win a home concert for their father by texting or phoning The Daily Record in Scotland. On Wednesday, June 13, The Daily Mirror ran a feature on the front page of the \\"Your Life\\" section about Indiana Gregg's house gigs featuring a home concert she did in Clare O'Hagan's front room in support of Ovarian Cancer. The general awareness at this early stage of her career led to performances in festivals in the UK in summer 2007. Legal threats against The Pirate Bay On July 22, 2008, Indiana Gregg, instigated a series of e-mails with ThePirateBay.org concerning a perceived copyright violation. Indiana then wrote a lengthy article on the subject of respecting artists' copyrights internationally.

Although unconfirmed strong rumors state that the title of the album was inspired by John L. O'Connor. Also considered but not used was \\"Shakebox\\". Background In the pre-recording stage of the album, the band had the same lineup as for their previous album in 1985 (Robert Palmer, Andy Taylor, John Taylor and Tony Thompson), and all four musicians worked on the writing and arranging of the songs. However, John Taylor was going through a divorce at the time, as well as entering drug rehab, and pulled out before the album was recorded. Instead Bernard Edwards, the producer, played all bass parts on Living In Fear, and took over as the group's official fourth member. John Taylor still receives writing and arranging credits on the finished album, but does not play on it, and is not listed as a group member. Unfortunately, Edwards died of pneumonia in Japan before the album was released; the album is dedicated to his memory. These two events did not help the album and it was not a commercial success, with only one single, \\"She Can Rock It\\", being released. The band, now officially a trio, toured in support of the album in 1996, with Guy Pratt (bass) and Luke Morley of Thunder (additional guitar) along as session musicians. The set-list contained a mix of Palmer, Chic, old and new Power Station songs.

It is inclined to the line of sight from the Earth at an angle of 47¬∞ along a position angle of 25¬∞. Structure HST-image The morphological classification of NGC 5364 in the De Vaucouleurs system is SA(rs)bc pec, which indicates it has an incomplete ring structure (rs) in the inner part of the galaxy with moderate to loosely wound arms (bc) and has a peculiar aspect (pec). In particular, the appearance of the spiral arms is amorphous and asymmetrical compared to other galaxies with a similar classification. A companion galaxy, NGC 5363, is located to the north of NGC 5364 and their gravitational interaction may be influencing the peculiar morphology of the latter. The mid-infrared emission in the nucleus appears weak compared to the spiral arms, suggesting a low rate of star formation in the core region. The inner ring of this galaxy spans a diameter of and is located slightly off center with the northern side showing a stronger emission in the hydrogen alpha band compared to the southern half. Multiple H II regions lie along the spiral arms, tracing out their extent. Each of the two main arms wrap all the way around the galaxy, although they display patchiness along much of their length.

Design Animation of the kinematic It shared with its predecessor the unusual design feature of having its internal workings (crankshaft, connecting-rods, etc.) rotating in a clockwise direction as seen from \\"nose-on\\", within the engine, and the crankcase and propeller (still fastened to the crankcase, as is usual for rotary engines) rotating in the \\"accepted\\" anti-clockwise direction. Power was rated at 120 kW (160 hp). The advantages of the engine were increased propeller efficiency through the reduction gearing effect of having the engine effectively running at 1,800 rpm for only 900 rpm of the airscrew, and excellent high-altitude performance due to the high compression ratio achieved. A bonus was the counter-rotating masses tended to cancel out the gyroscopic forces of the engine. This was achieved by using bevel-gears housed in the rear of the crankcase. This \\"contra-rotary\\" action also caused the point of ignition in the rotary action of the cylinders to itself slowly rotate in the direction of the crankshaft's rotation as the engine ran, as shown in the animation. For a normal rotary engine that had its crankshaft fastened to the airframe, the point of ignition always stayed in the same place in the cylinders' rotative action as they spun with the crankcase. Production problems at the Siemens works, and poor quality lubricating oil, gave the Sh.III engines a life expectancy of only seven to ten hours before pistons began to seize. The license-built Rhemag versions of the Sh.III did not have such problems, so the Siemens-made engines were gradually withdrawn from service.

The name originates from the Celtic Trisma, meaning \\"brushwood\\" or \\"fallen leaves\\".According to Eilert Ekwall, Professor of English at Lund University and author of numerous books on English place- names. It became Trisme for about four hundred years, and then in the 16th century Tryssame or Trysham. Its pub, the Cridford Inn was opened in 1985 by converting part of the old farm house and a joining barn.The pub/inn that purports to be the oldest in England is \\"Ye Olde Fighting Cocks\\" in St Albans. The original was built in 795 AD. however, the title is disputed because it was completely rebuilt in 1495 and in a different location. It was quoted in \\"The Which Guide to Country Pubs\\" dated March 1988 that the main site of the now, Cridford Inn, dates back to 825 AD - well before Alfred the Great and was originally inhabited by the early Britons/Celts. However, King Athelstan of the English notably expelled \\"that filthy race\\" (the Britons) from Exeter and the surrounding area, as far as Cornwall, in 927 AD. The building was presumably remodelled in 1081, as a small cobbled area in which was set a crude mosaic, made of dolerite and quartz, bearing the initials HJ and the year 1081 was discovered during renovations in 1988. This mosaic is preserved and displayed under glass in the inn's restaurant. The Cridford had also previously served as a nunnery and a farm. In 1086 it is understood to be one of the nine small-holdings mentioned in the ‚ÄúDomesday Book‚Äù, and by then belonged to the Abbey of Buckfast in the Manor of Trusham. During the early 13th to 15th Centuries, the building itself was a farmhouse and the stained glass mullion window in the bar is from this period and is possibly the earliest surviving example of a Medieval domestic window in England. It is also believed that The Cridford Inn is home to two ghosts,; one is said to be a nun from the very early history of the property and a second is a Cavalier from Trusham's conflict with Ashton, a nearby village, in the Civil war of 1642-46. The church of St Michael, is an ancient building of stone in the early English and Perpendicular styles with traces of Norman work.Oakford Archaeology on behalf of Trusham PCCC. Report No. 14-02. Project No. 1113. June 2014. The church was thoroughly restored in 1865, when the stained east window and a smaller one were inserted as memorials to the Rev. William Edward Brendon, who died in 1864. There is also a memorial to John Stooke which mentions a charity he set up for the church and the poor of nearby Bovey Tracey. The story, first recorded in 1709, goes that in 1646 an officer in the Royalist army was gambling at Bovey when he was cornered by Roundheads. Before he was slain, he threw his bag of winnings to a servant, who, (before he was also slain) threw them over a hedge, where they were found by Stooke, then a humble farmer's boy. Stooke's fortune was founded on his lucky find. Bovey's altar fund still receives a small annual sum from the charity. Trusham was the ancestral home of the Causley family, whose descendants include the poet Charles Causley and the folk singer Jim Causley.Causley's poem Trusham is an account of a return he made to the village in his later years: a poignant reflection on one's family roots, what it is to be distant from those, and the legacies we leave behind us. Jim Causley's setting of this poem‚Äîamongst a number of other poems by his distant relation‚Äîis a modern song-setting, and is available on the album Cyprus Well. A later poem, The Prodigal Son, recounts a further visit by Causley to his ancestral village, linking once again the local geography, history and landscape with the First World War and his own family memories. In 2007, Trusham held the first Charles Causley festival in conjunction with the Charles Causley Society of Launceston. There is a plaque in the village to celebrate Causley's life and the Charles Causley Society hold regular events in Trusham such as Causley readings and poems set to music, hog roasts and barn dancing. The now disused and privately owned Trusham railway station was part of the Teign Valley Line. Although the school closed in November 1948, its Victorian building is now the Village Hall. The Doomsday survey of 1086 recorded a settlement of 23 households, (4 villagers. 9 smallholders. 10 slaves). Eight hundred years later, the 1881 Census shows a very small growth, with 41 households and a population of 177; however, in Kelly‚Äôs 1901 Directory of Devonshire, the population had fallen to 165 and by 2001, whilst the number of households had increased to 60, the population had fallen further to 144. Trusham is on the western side of the 250m high Haldon Hills, roughly 90m above the river Teign, which forms the Dartmoor National Park boundary and is just over half a mile away. The village is accessed via minor roads which are predominately single track with passing places. The A38 passes within 2 miles at Chudleigh. The centre of the village has the O S grid reference SX 854 821 and for sat nav users the postcode is TQ13 0NW.

Beginning with the appointment of Tokugawa Yorifusa by his father, Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu, in 1608, the Mito branch of the Tokugawa clan controlled the domain until the abolition of the han system in 1871. During the Edo period, Mito represented the center of nativism largely as a result of the Mitogaku, an influential school of Japanese thought, which advanced the political philosophy of sonn≈ç j≈çi (\\"revere the emperor, expel the barbarians\\") that had become a popular sentiment after 1854. Mito's sponsorship of the Dai Nihon-shi (A History of Great Japan) established the domain's tradition of intellectualism. Later, Mito scholars and their ideology influenced many of the revolutionaries involved in the Meiji Restoration. Edo period Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu appointed his eleventh son, Tokugawa Yorifusa, as daimy≈ç in 1608.

Along with the Tokugawa branches in Kii and Owari, the Mito branch represented one of three Tokugawa houses known as the gosanke.History of Mito Although the Mito branch held less land and wealth than either of the other two branches, they maintained considerable influence throughout the Edo period. The domain's promiximity to the de facto capital in Edo was a contributing factor to this power as well as the fact that many people unofficially considered the Mito daimy≈ç to be \\"vice-sh≈çgun\\".Koschmann, 2 Tokugawa Mitsukuni, the third son of Tokugawa Yorifusa, became the second daimy≈ç of Mito in 1661. Mitsukuni further established Mito's status as a respected han by sponsoring the Dai Nihon-shi in 1657.Koschmann, 2 The endeavor would launch Mito's reputation as a center for intellectual thought. Mito School The Mito School (Mitogaku) was an influential school of Japanese thought which advocated isolationism, nativism, and reverence of the emperor. The origins of this Neo-Confucianist movement date to Mitsukuni's decision to establish a historiographical organization known as the Sh≈çk≈çkan in 1657. Mitsukuni recruited educated scholars to the Sh≈çk≈çkan to study the history and philosophy of Japan.Koschmann, 34 Mitsukuni initiated the creation of the Dai Nihon-shi by the scholars in order to compile a history of Japan which would focus on the imperial line.Harootunian, 61 Each chapter of the \\"Annals\\" in the Dai Nihon-shi concentrated on the rule of a specific emperor.Koschmann, 35 The project took more than two hundred and fifty years to finish, and it was officially published in 1906. While scholars were compiling the Dai Nihon-shi, the Mito domain experienced agricultural and economic problems. Beginning as early as 1688, financial ruin plagued Mito and discontent grew in the domain. In addition to the financial issues, famines and natural disasters were common occurrences. In 1709, dissatisfied peasants staged the largest rebellion in the history of the domain.Koschmann, 29 An increasing number of discontent citizens in Mito embraced the works of the early Mito scholars for their reverence of the emperor and their anti-foreign ideology. These works inspired waves of nationalism and loyalty to the imperial family during the 17th century. During these disorderly years, the Mito scholarship grew into a renowned school of thought in Japan. Under Mitsukuni's leadership, the Dai Nihon-shi significantly expanded to seventy- three chapters of the \\"Annals\\" and one hundred and seventy chapters of \\"Biographies\\" by the time of his death in 1700.Koschmann, 36 In 1720, the Mito scholars finished the \\"Annals\\" and \\"Biographies\\" and offered them to the bakufu. These events signalled the end of the early Mito school. For the next seven decades, the Sh≈çk≈çkan made very little progress with the Dai Nihon-shi without the guidance of Mitsukuni. in 1786, Tachihara Suiken took over leadership of the Sh≈çk≈çkan and resumed work on the compilation.Koschmann, 40 Fujita Y≈´koku became the head of the institute after Tachihara, and he pushed for more focus on the history of that period. During the late 18th century, two factions within the Sh≈çk≈çkan emerged. Fujita and the other opponents of Tachihara called for the removal of Asaka Tanpaku's \\"Appraisals\\" as well as the changing of the name Dai Nihon-shito \\"Nihon\\" or \\"Yamato\\". The struggle between the two factions eventually led to the house arrest of Fujita in 1797.Koschmann, 42 By 1807, Fujita was once again in power and Tachihara had left the institute. As Mito thought developed during the 19th century, the scholars began to emphasize anti-Western sentiment and the importance of the emperor in Japanese society. In particular, Mito scholars embraced the political slogan \\"sonn≈ç j≈çi\\" which means \\"Revere the Emperor and Expel the Barbarians\\". The scholar Aizawa Seishisai was the first advocate of this philosophy in Japan. In 1825, he wrote New Proposals, which presented his ideas about the need to protect Japan from the Western 'barbarians'. He promoted nativism and opposition to Western force, trade, and belief systems. He was particularly a fierce opponent of Christianity, which in his view undermined Japanese values.Hane, 67 Seishisai likewise advocated support of the emperor as a method of confronting the Western threat from abroad.Hane, 66 In the work, Seishisai also advanced the idea of kokutai (\\"national essence\\") which combined Confucian morals, Shinto myths, and other philosophies. According to Seishisai, the Japanese imperial family were direct descendants of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, so Japan was supposed to establish the proper standard for other nations to emulate. New Proposals served as an inspiration for Japanese nationalists throughout the 19th century leading up to the Meiji Restoration-1869. Mito thought stressed other ideas concerning the role of morality in Tokugawa Japan. Fujita, a prominent scholar, argued that Japanese civilization would end as a result of internal problems rather than external threats. Other writers of the late Mito school such as Fujita Toko and Seishisai also agreed that lack of moral leadership would weaken Japan from within and expose the country to the invasion of Westerners. Many of the Mito scholars worried about economic collapse, and Fujita especially recognized that many financial troubles in Mito were present throughout Japan. Basing his argument on Neo-Confucianism, Fujita reasoned that the emperor grants power to the sh≈çgun to confront domestic and foreign dangers. Fujita and the other Mito scholars decided that the shogunate had not upheld its duty to preserve the defense or economic prosperity of Japan.Harootunian, 33 Fujita suggested that the bakufu should push for reforms, and the daimy≈çs should implement the reforms. Fujita's ideas represented radical challenges to the bakufu system because he was arguing that the bakufu had failed to address important issues.Harootunian, 75 Fujita concluded that the shogunate had caused the domains to become economically and militarily weak. Tokugawa Nariaki and decline of the Shogunate Tokugawa Nariaki became the daimy≈ç of Mito in 1829, and he developed into an important figure in the nationalist movement in Japan during the 1850s and 1860s. Nariaki was one of the most radical defenders of Japan's seclusion from the West.Duus, 66 Starting in 1830, Nariaki vocally supported the ideas of the Mito school by championing sonn≈ç j≈çi and demanding that the shogunate honor the emperor by fulfilling its duties. Traditionally the term Sh≈çgun means \\"Barbarian exterminating Lord\\"(this term goes back to the Heian Era, if not before then). Westerners had been termed \\"barbarians\\" by the Japanese since their arrival in the 16th century. The first Tokugawa Sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, expelled all foreign powers from Japan and closed it off from the rest of the world. The Dutch were allowed one trading port at Nagasaki which was under strict regulation. Aside from this one small Dutch trading port, Japan remained closed off until 1854 when the shogunate signed a treaty allowing the \\"barbarians\\" access to the country of Japan for the purpose of trade. Of course it would be the duty of the Sh≈çgun to expel the \\"barbarians\\" from the country on behalf of the emperor. Nariaki believed that Japan's inability to confront foreign and domestic problems was due to the shogunate's mismanagement and selfishness. In his mind, the shogunate had failed to protect the country and instead had focused on the interests of the bakufu. He stated that the sh≈çgun should strengthen Japan's defenses and initiate necessary reforms in order to create a strong, prosperous Japan. Ultimately, Nariaki's determination and criticism of the shogunate caused him to become popular among segments of the population.Lamberti, 98 While Nariaki was very critical of the shogunate, he still acknowledged that the emperor delegated power to the sh≈çgun. Nariaki only wanted the shogunate to change its policies, and he did not openly support the overthrow of the bakufu.Sakata, 38 He believed that the political philosophy of sonn≈ç j≈çi would benefit Japan, the shogunate, the emperor, and the people. Along with many Mito scholars, Nariaki grew increasingly concerned with the monetary problems in Mito. In Nariaki's view, Japan was experiencing a financial crisis as samurai and peasants suffered under the economic conditions. Drawing on his Confucian beliefs, Nariaki believed that Japan needed a revival of morality in order to combat weakness. He feared that the country may be plunged into chaos if famine or Western imperialism threatened the nation. In response, he called for the shogunate to rebuild the military and economy of Japan (leading to Fukoku ky≈çhei) and for the sh≈çgun to provide guidance. The policies of the shogunate, however, continued to provide a barrier to reform in the domains. A few years later in 1836, a nationwide famine occurred, and uprisings spread across Japan as Nariaki had predicted.Sakata, 39 In 1840, the Opium War began between China and Britain, and Nariaki's predictions about Western interference also appeared to be a legitimate concern. After the events of the 1830s, the shogunate agreed with Nariaki's calls for reform. Despite this agreement, however, the shogunate forced Nariaki into early retirement. This action angered Nariaki's supporters in Mito as well as other daimy≈çs who agreed with Nariaki's beliefs.Sakata, 40 Later, R≈çj≈´ Abe Masahiro brought Nariaki out of retirement to be an adviser on foreign policy because he respected Nariaki's experience and views. Additionally, Nariaki's warnings about Western involvement in Japanese affairs also led Abe to conclude that Nariaki was knowledgeable about the issue. Throughout the 1840s, the Western nations applied increasing pressure on Japan to open its market to Western goods. Western pressure on Japan culminated in 1853, with the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry and the Black Ships, which presented a significant challenge to Japanese isolationism. Perry demanded the opening of Japanese ports for trade with the United States. Abe sought a consensus from the daimy≈çs on how to solve the Western problem. The daimy≈çs failed to reach a consensus on either fighting the United States or agreeing to trade, so Abe had no other option but to agree to the United States' demands in the Convention of Kanagawa. The inability of the shogunate to defend Japan from the West immediately undermined the people's confidence in the bakufu. Consequently, Abe resigned after the event, and Hotta Masayoshi replaced him. In 1858, Hotta met with Emperor K≈çmei and submitted the Harris Treaty, which allowed for Westerners to trade in Japan and granted them extraterritoriality. The emperor refused to support the treaty, and the anti-foreign movement in Mito and other domains saw the event as an opportunity to unite behind the emperor. Hotta's failure to obtain the emperor's support further reinforced the Mito loyalist's belief that they had to revere the emperor and confront the 'barbarian' West. The death of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iesada in 1858 led to a power struggle over the succession of the sh≈çgun. At the same time, various factions were debating the foreign policy issue, and the stability of the Tokugawa shogunate was compromised. There were two potential sh≈çgun, and one of them was Hitotsubashi Keiki, Nariaki's son. To solve the problem, the fudai daimy≈çs put Ii Naosuke in charge as great councilor (Tair≈ç) of the shogunate.Sakata, 42 Ii decided to punish supporters of Nariaki in order to re-establish the power of the shogunate. While Ii was temporarily successful in maintaining order, his purge of Nariaki supporters in the domains and the court, the Ansei Purge, drove young Mito radicals to assassinate him in 1860 (Sakuradamon Incident).Sakata, 43 In response to the assassination, the shogunate pacified the radicals by changing shogunal policies in the Bunky≈´ Reforms and naming Hitotsubashi Keiki as guardian of the sh≈çgun. Meiji Restoration Throughout the decades leading up to the Meiji Restoration, the Mito daimy≈ç as well as the Mito scholars undermined the bakufu through their calls for reform and their direct action. Tokugawa Nariaki repeatedly criticized the shogunate for their moral decay and inability to protect Japan from financial ruin or foreign invasion. The Mito school of thought likewise provided a nationalist, pro-royal ideology which influenced many of the leading anti-bakufu revolutionaries.Koschmann, 3 While the Mito scholars never actually called for the overthrow of the bakufu, their emphasis on internal and external threats to Japan impacted the political views of the revolutionaries.Kolshmann, 3 The Mito school of thought had a profound impact on many individuals because the Mito domain had a tradition of intellectualism which lent legitimacy to the anti-foreign views of the scholars. During the 1840s, Nariaki's support of these views allowed for an entire generation to grow up with these ideas. Maki Izumi, a leading revolutionary, admitted to being strongly affected by Mito beliefs. The Mitogaku played a major role in inspiring the anti-bakufu elements in Japan to unite and lead the Meiji Restoration. Mito radicals initiated many of the violent acts which led to the overthrow of the bakufu as well. Starting with the assassination of Ii Naosuke, nationalist terrorism spread in Japan.Duus, 71 In Mito, anti-foreign loyalists staged a rebellion, which involved the son of Fujita Toko. The bakufu and domain military forces joined together in order to crush the uprising, and the loyalist movement temporarily lost momentum. In 1864, the \\"Tengu insurrection\\" occurred in which armed Mito rebels confronted the bakufu in battle. The Tengu band, led by Fujita Koshir≈ç, included thousands of troops from Mito who defeated the troops of several other domains.\\"Conflict\\", 86 Later, a major battle occurred where a thousand of the rebels surrendered with the promise of mercy from the conservatives.\\"Conflict\\", 87 Ironically, the opposition was led by Hitotsubashi Keiki. The conservatives, however, lied and executed the leaders of the insurrection. The Tengu insurrection was an important event because it represented the growing discontent with the bakufu in the years immediately leading up to the Meiji Restoration. Mito forces were involved in many of the early uprisings before the successful Restoration. While Mito did not have a major role in the fighting like Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´, the Mito ideology did however influence the revolutionaries in Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´ to fight for the emperor.  List of daimy≈çs  The hereditary daimy≈çs were heads of the clan and head of the domain. * Takeda Clan, 1602‚Äì1603 (150,000 koku) * Tokugawa Clan, 1603‚Äì1869 (200,000 koku)Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph.

The party was a splinter group of Pauline Hanson‚Äôs One Nation (PHON). It was a socially conservative populist party on the right of the political spectrum and its policies were similar to that of the original One Nation party, advocating reduced immigration levels, an end to Australia‚Äôs policy of multiculturalism and an end to what it perceives to be overly favourable treatment of Australian indigenous Aboriginal population. The party arose as a result of internal divisions within PHON in October 2000 after Pauline Hanson expelled David Oldfield, co-founder of PHON and the sole representative of that party in the NSW State Parliament. At the 2000 NSW State Conference Hanson accused Oldfield of abusing his authority, usurping power and setting up alternative political parties under his control. His expulsion created even more instability in a party which was constantly embroiled in scandal and internal strife and the party saw a split in its NSW division. As a result, One Nation NSW was formed in 2001. The new party took advantage of electoral party registration laws to register itself as political party under the ‚ÄòOne Nation‚Äô name with the NSW electoral commission, and achieved registration in April, 2002. The effect of this was that the original PHON party was now unable to gain registration for NSW elections, and therefore any candidates which that party chose to represent them at state elections could not use the party name. Consequently, PHON could only contest Federal elections in NSW under the 'One Nation' banner, whilst the Oldfield group could present itself as 'One Nation' only at state elections. One Nation NSW encountered some internal ruptures in 2002-2003 during the preselection process for the March 2003 NSW election. Brian Burston, (a former National Director of PHON) had been preselected by a party conference in December 2002 for 1st place on the party ticket, for the election to the Upper House, the Legislative Council (LC). Oldfield however, had intended that his wife Lisa Oldfield, secure this position. He therefore summoned a second meeting of party members in January 2003, which saw a reversal of the December decision to give Burston the top spot on the ticket, in favour of Lisa Oldfield. Burston and his supporters filed legal action, and the court upheld the initial party decision of December, which gave Burston the leading position on the ticket. At the March election, One Nation NSW achieved only 1.5% of the primary vote, compared to 6.3% for PHON in the previous 1999 election that saw Oldfield elected. This result was substantially below the 4.55% election quota, and consequently Burston failed to get elected. Apart from the internal feuding which affected the party‚Äôs performance, was the fact that Pauline Hanson also ran in the election as a grouped independent, with support from what was left of PHON, and this fractured the One Nation vote. Hanson polled slightly better than Burston‚Äôs group, achieving 1.9%, and narrowly missed gaining the last LC spot. After the 2003 election, One Nation NSW kept a very low profile. The party did not maintain a website and drew very little media attention. Consequently, many Australian political commentators weren't even aware that two separate One Nation parties continued to operate in NSW at this time. Oldfield resigned from the party in December 2004, to serve the remainder of his term as an independent. His term expired in March 2007. One Nation NSW met all the necessary registration criteria to achieve registration for the March 2007 NSW election. However, the party decided not to contest that election, and was deregistered shortly after the election. The party was disbanded shortly afterwards.

Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy, lyrics by Harburg, and music by Sammy Fain. Synopsis and background The allegorical tale is set in fictional Capsulanti, USA, site of the headquarters for B.G. Bigelow, Incorporated, the largest toy corporation in the world. Puppet designer Sylvester has created laughing doll Flahooley and is about to unveil it as the company's big Christmas release to the board of directors. The meeting is interrupted by an Arabian delegation. Their country has run out of oil, the magic lamp upon which they rely is broken, and they hope someone can repair it so genie Abou Ben Atom, who keeps things running smoothly, will reappear and help them in their time of need. Bigelow, enamored with Princess Najla, agrees and assigns Sylvester to the project. Sylvester's hopes of success are crushed when a rival company produces their own doll at a lower price. By rubbing the lamp with Flahooley's hand, he summons the genie, hoping to become wealthy enough to marry his model Sandy, wishes for every child to have a Flahooley doll. Unfortunately the genie, unclear on the concept of capitalism, begins giving away thousands of dolls, causing warehouses to collapse and children to carry them off for free. Before long a full-fledged witch-hunt is on for him in an effort to put an end to his misguided generosity. The mob's leader Elsa Bullinger urges citizens to destroy every doll they find. This destructive behavior begins to kill Abou, until Sandy is able to save one doll and fix it again, reviving the genie. The lamp, however, has been captured by Elsa. Abou decides not to return to the lamp, but to become a real-life Santa Claus and gives his blessing to Sylvester and Sandy, urging everyone to believe in what Flahooley represents. Harburg had successfully blended politics with fantasy in Finian's Rainbow four years earlier, but his bitterness at his 1950 Hollywood blacklisting, which prompted him to write Flahooley, permeated the project. During its evolution he conceded to some adjustments - originally the doll, instead of laughing, yelled \\"Dirty Red!\\" when turned upside down - but his convoluted plot still included too many thinly veiled references to Joseph McCarthy and his followers, and his harsh parody of the ongoing rabid anti-Communist sentiment that prompted so many witch hunts was not softened by the inclusion of a genie and singing puppets. It did not help that associate producer/director Harburg saw no need to edit writer Harburg's overstated political views. Production The Broadway production was directed by Harburg and Saidy, choreographed by Helen Tamiris, and orchestrated by Ted Royal. It opened on May 14, 1951 at the Broadhurst Theatre, where it closed on June 15, 1951 after 40 performances. The cast included Jerome Courtland as Sylvester, Ernest Truex as Bigelow, Barbara Cook (in her Broadway debut) as Sandy, Irwin Corey as Abou Ben Atom, and Yma Sumac as Princess Najla, with Louis Nye, Nehemiah Persoff, and Ted Thurston in supporting roles.

An original cast recording was released by Capitol Records. Revival productions In 1998, a production of Flahooley (the first in New York since its original brief run) was mounted at the Theatre At St. Clement's. Adapted and directed by Alisa Roost with choreography and directorial contributions by Al Joyal, and orchestration and musical direction by Peter Jones this 1998 revival production had some participation from the heirs of the original creative team.Ehrens, Christine (September 10, 1998). \\"Flop Puppet Musical 'Flahooley' Revived in NYC\\", Playbill.

Following the original book, the doll exclaimed \\"Dirty Red!\\" instead of laughing, went to sleep when you fed it phenobarbital, woke up when you fed it benzedrine (a drug also referenced in Finian's Rainbow) and had the stated purpose of teaching children how to be good Americans.

Certain releases from the Johnson City Sessions‚Äîespecially Clarence Ashley's \\"The Coo- coo Bird\\" and The Bentley Boys' \\"Down On Penny's Farm\\"‚Äîare considered by music scholars as important recordings of early country music that influenced a whole generation of revivalist folk musicians of the 1950s and 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Doc Watson. Background The auditions were part of a search for native Appalachian-Blue Ridge Mountains musical talent. Walker was a pioneer, as was Ralph Peer of Victor Records, in the art of remote recording, which was deemed more effective than bringing musicians to New York City or larger northern cities to record. They thought the unsophisticated amateurs would perform more comfortably in their accustomed surroundings.\\"Old-Time Music Heritage\\" , Johnson's Depot =First Auditions= On Saturday October 13, 1928, Walker auditioned musicians, with recording sessions scheduled for the following week at makeshift studios at the Brading- Marshall Lumber Company in Johnson City. Amateur musicians brought their fiddles, banjos, guitars and voices to Johnson City to display their talents for Walker. Participants included the Shell Creek Quartet, the Grant Brothers, the Roane County Ramblers, Renus Rich and Charles Bradshaw, Clarence Greene, the Wise Brothers, Ira Yates, Uncle Nick Decker, the Proximity String Quartet, Hardin and Grindstaff, the Greensboro Boys Quartet, Richard Harold, Charlie Bowman and His Brothers, the Bowman Sisters, Bill and Belle Reed, the Reed Children, the Reed Family, the Hodges Brothers, the Hodges Quartet, Bailey Briscoe, Robert Hoke and Vernal Vest, McVay and Johnson, Earl Shirkey and Roy Harper (Roy Harvey), George Roark, the Ed Helton Singers, the Garland Brothers and Grindstaff, Dewey Golden and His Kentucky Buzzards, the Holiness Singers, Frank Shelton and the McCartt Brothers/Patterson. =Second Auditions= Returning to Johnson City in October 1929, Walker auditioned the following in the second group: Blalock and Yates, Jack Jackson, George Wade and Grancom Braswell, the Roane County Ramblers, Wyatt and Brandon, Roy Harvey and Leonard Copeland, the Spindale Quartet, the Queen Trio, Earl Shirkey and Roy Harper (Roy Harvey), the Moatsville String Ticklers, the Weaver Brothers, Byrd Moore and His Hot Shots, the Bateman Sacred Quartet, Fred Richards, Clarence Ashley, the Bentley Boys, Charlie Bowman and His Brothers, Fran Trappe, Eph Woodie and the Henpecked Husbands, Ira and Eugene Yates, and Ellis Williams. Recordings Popular recordings, such as \\"Roll on Buddy\\" (now a bluegrass standard) and \\"Moonshiner and His Money\\" by Charlie Bowman and His Brothers, along with \\"Johnson City Blues\\" by Clarence Greene, were made from the Johnson City Sessions. Clarence \\"Tom\\" Ashley's clawhammer banjo classic recording, \\"Coo Coo Bird\\", was a highlight of the 1929 Johnson City sessions. According to the North Carolina musician Walter Davis, he and Clarence Greene learned the art of blues guitar from the legendary performer Blind Lemon Jefferson, who played on the streets in Johnson City during the early 1920s.Wayne Erbsen, \\"Walter Davis: Fist and Skull Banjo,\\" Bluegrass Unlimited: March 1981, 22-26 =Other States= In addition to the Johnson City sessions, Frank Buckley Walker (Oct. 24, 1889 - Oct. 15, 1963) scheduled recording sessions in Atlanta (1925 ‚Äì 1932), New Orleans (1925-1927), Memphis (1928), and Dallas (1927-1929) to search out musical talent throughout the southern United States. Walker recounted to Mike Seeger once during an interview: > We would build up the recording sessions in advance ‚Äì getting the word > around that at a certain time of year we were going to be there, and these > people would show up from 800 or 900 miles away.

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, the company deals with the consequences of an offending watermark that appeared on several reams of paper. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) holds a poorly attended press conference, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) head to a high school that printed their prom invitations on the paper to apologize, and Creed frames an employee at the paper mill to keep his job. The episode was written by Justin Spitzer and Brent Forrester, and was directed by Randall Einhorn, the series director of photography. The cast found the scene in which Jim impersonates Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to be hilarious and had trouble keeping straight faces, forcing multiple takes. The episode first aired in the United States on April 26, 2007 on NBC, during sweeps week. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by an estimated 7.56 million viewers, earning a ratings share of 3.9/11 among adults. It garnered generally positive critical reception, particularly regarding Jim and Dwight's impressions of each other. Synopsis In the cold open, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) shows up at work imitating Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) by wearing large glasses, a short sleeved shirt and hair split on his forehead and pokes fun at Dwight. The Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin is thrown into damage control mode when reams of paper with an obscene watermark depicting a cartoon duck and mouse (which Michael Scott (Steve Carell) believes to be Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse respectively, though they do not resemble either) having sex are shipped to customers. Michael holds an emergency meeting in which he rebukes Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton)‚Äîthe branch's quality assurance director‚Äîfor failing to catch the error, tells Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) to train the accountants to handle customer support calls, and sends Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to a school that used the affected paper to print prom invitations. At the school, Andy is horrified to discover that his girlfriend is a student there, and is despondent throughout the visit. On the drive back, Jim cheers him up by initiating an a capella performance of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\". To save his job, Creed calls the paper mill and, with careful queries, learns that a Debbie Brown was out with the flu for one day in the week the watermark went out. He frames Debbie by telling Dwight she failed to meet with him and gave a different excuse for her absence. After Debbie is fired, Creed passes a farewell card around the office and pockets the money collected. Michael stages an apology press conference, attended by just one local news reporter, where he presents Barbara Allen (Lisa Darr), an angry customer, with a novelty check for free paper. She instead demands Michael's resignation, but he refuses and angrily ejects her from the office. Now facing further damage control, Michael makes an \\"apology video\\" in which he threatens to issue paper with a watermark bearing \\"the f word\\" if he is forced to resign. In the ending, Dwight shows up to the office imitating Jim, but Jim is merely impressed with the accuracy of the impersonation. Production Randall Einhorn earned his second directional credit of the series for this episode. \\"Product Recall\\" was written by staff writer Justin Spitzer and consulting producer Brent Forrester. It was the second Office episode to be directed by Randall Einhorn, a former director of Survivor who also worked as the series' director of photography. In early 2007, series co-creator Greg Daniels explained to an audience at Paleyfest that Einhorn's direction had become \\"a character in the show because [he] has an enormous amount of judgment/leeway about where he's looking. And often [what] adds a tremendous amount of comedy is the choosing to look over there and see what that person thinks and back and forth. He's definitely a hidden character on the show.\\" In an April 2007 blog post for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery, who plays Meredith Palmer, called Jim's impression of Dwight \\"one of the funniest scenes that I have ever witnessed.\\" She recalled that Krasinski and Wilson enjoyed filming the scene, and that the whole cast was laughing during it, necessitating many takes. The scene was first intended for the season's twenty-second episode, \\"Women's Appreciation\\", before it was moved to \\"Product Recall\\" due to time constraints. The third season DVD contains several scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the episode. These include Kelly annoyingly answering calls with the same response, Dwight contacting CNN, Kelly training the accountants, Creed admitting that he faked his own death for tax reasons, Michael explaining his apology to angry business owner Barbara Allen, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Kelly arguing, Jim talking to a high school student, and more scenes of Michael filming his apology video. Cultural references When imitating Dwight, Jim says \\"Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica,\\" the last term being a reference to the re-imagined science fiction television series. Later, while driving Andy begins a rendition of \\"Drift Away\\", and Jim sings \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" to cheer him up. Kelly and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) have a conversation pretending to be Bridget Jones and the Crocodile Hunter, respectively. Michael worries that Newsweek and CNN will pick up the cartoon scandal story from The Scranton Times. Reception \\"Product Recall\\" first aired in the United States on April 26, 2007 during the month's sweeps week. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by an estimated 7.56 million viewers. It earned a ratings share of 3.9/11 among adults, meaning that it was seen by 3.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. For its timeslot, the episode finished in second place among adults behind Survivor: Fiji and in first place among men aged 18‚Äì34. Among adults, The Office finished in nineteenth place for the week. Alt URL IGN's Brian Zoromski rated \\"Product Recall\\" with 7.5 out of 10, an indication of a \\"good\\" episode. He thought it held \\"a hit-and-miss mix of laugh-out-loud moments and scenes that didn't work quite as well,\\" but praised the obscene cartoon premise for being \\"hilarious\\". Zoromski also criticized the episode for being unrealistic, as Michael dealt with the problem rather than Corporate. He selected Creed and Jim for particular praise, especially liking Jim's Dwight impression. Like Zoromski, Abby West of Entertainment Weekly critiqued the episode for not involving Corporate, complaining \\"How could such a public-relations nightmare not lead to a visit or a phone call from Jan?\\" West did however praise Jim and Dwight's impressions of each other as \\"perfect\\" bookendings. Writing for AOL TV, Jay Black called \\"Product Recall\\" \\"wonderful\\" and highlighted the Jim-Dwight impersonations and Andy's discomfort upon discovering his girlfriend was a high school student. Black did however criticize Michael's press conference as \\"over-the-top in an annoying way\\" and Creed's actions as \\"way over the line\\" and \\"despicable\\".

He played for the New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants from 1925 to 1936. A switch hitter who threw right-handed, he was listed at and . Although he primarily played as a shortstop, Koenig was utilized at second base and third base as well. Koenig played minor league baseball for four different teams until May 1925, when he signed for the New York Yankees. After making his debut in September 1925 and spending five seasons with the Yankees, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers, where he spent the next two seasons. He subsequently joined the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds via trades in 1932 and 1934, respectively, and was finally traded to the New York Giants, with whom he played his last game on September 27, 1936. Koenig is most famous for being the last surviving member of the Murderers' Row. Early life Koenig was born on July 19, 1904 in San Francisco. His father, Charles Koenig, and paternal grandfather William were both bricklayers, with the latter having immigrated from Germany to the United States. His mother Stella was of Swiss descent. Koenig had two brothers and a sister, and, during his childhood, he first met and played baseball with fellow San Franciscan and future teammate Tony Lazzeri. He attended Lowell High School in his hometown, but dropped out at the age of 16 in order to pursue a career in baseball. His high school eventually bestowed upon him his diploma in 1988. Koenig, who was 83 at the time, described the honor as a complete surprise. ' Professional career =Minor leagues= Koenig first started playing organized baseball on the Moose Jaw Millers team in the Western Canada League. It was here that he was first spotted by Bob Connery, a scout who worked for the New York Yankees organization. After the league collapsed in the middle of the season, he proceeded to play for the St. Paul Saints, a minor league baseball team that competed in the American Association. He spent nearly the next four seasons with the team; during this time, he had brief sojourns in Jamestown and the Des Moines Boosters in order to garner more playing experience. Koenig returned to St. Paul in and though he spent the entire season with the team, he played just 68 games for them. At the end of the season, the Saints advanced to the Little World Series, where they faced the International League's Baltimore Orioles. Having had limited playing time, it was in Game 5 where he finally got the chance to prove himself. Danny Boone, St. Paul's starting shortstop, injured his ankle during batting practice. Although the rules at the time stipulated that the Saints could temporarily utilize a player from another American Association team to replace Boone, the Orioles objected and the National Association president ruled that Koenig constituted an ample substitute for Boone. He proved to be exactly that when he scored the Saints' only run via a home run. He finished the Little World Series with a .429 batting average and 2 home runs, including one hit off Lefty Grove. His stellar performance in the series resulted in at least seven MLB teams seeking to acquire him in the offseason. However, he stayed with the Saints for the first part of the season before he was traded on May 29 to the New York Yankees in exchange for Fred Hofmann, Oscar Roettger, $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) and a player to be named later (Ernie Johnson). =New York Yankees (1925‚Äì1930)= Koenig made his major league debut for the Yankees on September 8, 1925, at the age of 21, entering the game as a defensive substitute for shortstop Pee-Wee Wanninger in a 5‚Äì4 win against the Boston Red Sox. During his rookie season the following year, he posted a batting average of .271 and struck out just 37 times in 617 at bats, a statistic which his manager Miller Huggins looked highly upon. Defensively, he committed the most errors among all fielders in the American League and most errors by a shortstop with 52. Nonetheless, he had the AL's third highest range factor at shortstop of 4.99 and made a league-leading 470 putouts. In the postseason, the Yankees advanced to the 1926 World Series, where they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. In the crucial Game 7, Koenig made an error when attempting to field a double play opportunity in the fourth inning. This eventually led to the Cardinals scoring‚Äîwhat turned out to be‚Äîthe winning run in a 3‚Äì2 victory. Koenig was subsequently criticized by fans for being responsible for Yankees losing the game and, ultimately, the series. Koenig was penciled into the two-hole spot in the Yankees' Opening Day lineup, with Earle Combs batting in front of him at leadoff and Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel and Tony Lazzeri batting behind him. This lineup, which was utilized in that order throughout the majority of the season, was given the nickname \\"Murderers' Row\\". Many sports analysts, baseball writers and fans consider the 1927 team the greatest baseball team of all time. Although he was dismissive of the role he played, Koenig contributed to the team's success as he batted .285 and amassed 150 hits, 11 triples, 99 runs scored and 62 runs batted in. However, he once again led the league in errors with 47, but compensated for this by recording the highest range factor at shortstop (5.61) and third most assists at shortstop (423). He was also part of history when, after hitting a triple, he was the only Yankee player on base when Babe Ruth hit his milestone 60th home run, setting a new single-season record. The Yankees advanced to the World Series that year, where they swept the Pittsburgh Pirates. Koenig performed impressively throughout the series, batting a team-leading .500 and committed no errors in 24 total chances. =Career statistics= In 1162 games over 12 seasons, Koenig posted a .279 batting average (1190-for-4271) with 572 runs, 195 doubles, 49 triples, 28 home runs, 446 RBI, 31 stolen bases, 222 bases on balls, .316 on-base percentage and .367 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .933 fielding percentage playing primarily at shortstop, third and second base. In 20 World Series games, he batted .237 (18-for-76) with 9 runs, 3 doubles, 1 triple and 5 RBI. Personal life In June 1928, Koenig got engaged to Katherine Tremaine, whom he married at the end of that year's baseball season. Together, they had one daughter, Gail, who was born in 1930. He later remarried Doris Bailey, who died in 1979. He appeared as himself in The Pride of the Yankees, an Academy Award-winning movie released in 1942 that pays tribute to his fellow Yankees teammate Lou Gehrig. ' After his baseball career ended, he settled back in his hometown and took up several jobs, namely owning gas stations and working as a brewer. Beginning in 1982, Koenig's health began to deteriorate. In addition to the lung cancer that had developed, he also suffered from gout, poor eyesight and back pain that necessitated the use of a cane. Because of these ailments, he moved to Orland, California in 1986 in order to live with his daughter and her family. He died of cancer on April 22, 1993 in Willows, California at the age of 88 and was cremated. He had outlived his two wives and was survived by his daughter, five grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving member of the 1927 New York Yankees starting lineup, nicknamed \\"Murderers' Row\\".

The two strands have different masses due to different proportions of heavier nucleotides. While this difference is not known to have any functional significance, it can be used in the laboratory to segregate the strands of denatured DNA, and hence to analyze the strands separately. Adenine and guanine (purines) are heavier than cytosine and thymine (pyrimidines) due to their extra ring. Because a purine always pairs with a pyrimidine, any excess of purines in one strand will occur with a corresponding excess of pyrimidines in the other strand and vice versa. Statistically, there is more likely to be such an imbalance than an exact 50/50 ratio. In addition, bias may arise due to differentials in the amount of protein-coding sequence on each strand, as codons do not all occur with equal frequency.

Russell. It was shot in Los Angeles, California. Leonard Jackson appeared as John Henry Brooks. He was cast in Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple fifteen years later. Tagline: \\"You've been coffy- tized, blacula-rized and super-flied - but now you're gonna be glorified, unified and filled-with-pride... when you see Five on the Black Hand Side.\\" Plot During the weekend of her daughter's wedding, Mrs. Gladys Ann Brooks, a meek wife (played by Clarice Taylor) and her three children‚ÄîGideon Brooks (Glynn Turman), Booker T. Washington-Brooks (D'Urville Martin), and Gail Brooks (Bonnie Banfield)‚Äîfinally decide to stand up to their overbearing husband and father Mr. John Henry Brooks Jr. (Leonard Jackson) who displays retrogressive behavior. Mrs. Brooks is tired of everybody treating her \\"like an old couch\\" and decides to leave her husband if he does not change his abusive behavior. Mr. Brooks controls every moment of his wife's life. Unlike his children, he considers himself \\"American\\" not \\"African\\". He does not agree with the fact that his daughter Gail is having an African themed wedding. His younger son Gideon does not talk to him and refuses to stay in the same room with his father. Gideon camps on the roof, instead, where he practices martial arts (by that time an important element of the Black Power movement). Mrs. Brooks joins her son on the roof in a civil rights movement after invading her husband's barbershop, where women are not allowed, where she hands Mr. Brooks a list of demands. She, for example, requires him to call her by her first name \\"Gladys\\", while Mr. Brooks insists on calling her Mrs. Brooks. Mr. Brooks finally changes his behavior and all the family members gather at Gail's and her new husband Marvin's \\"African\\" wedding. In pop culture The relationship between the parents in this movie was parodied in a skit of the same name on the comedy series In Living Color. The film went into limited release in theaters, but helped launch the careers of Glynn Turman and Ja'net DuBois: he did films and TV, landing mostly African-American characters, leading to the role of Bradford Taylor on the TV Show A Different World and she became famous as Willona on the TV hit Good Times. Background Five on the Black Hand side was originally a play written by Charlie L. Russell. It was Russell's first Off-Broadway play, which was produced by American Place Theatre and directed by Barbara Ann Teer. Since the opening in 1969, the play was performed 62 times. Russell was working as a play doctor (revised plays before production) at a theatre when he came up with the idea of Five on the Black Hand Side. First, Russell only worked out a draft, but had to finish the script when he met Luther James, a member of the Harlem Writers Guild. As Russell said himself, he wanted to \\"mix comedy and the political thing\\", as the 1960s and 1970s were an era full of political changes. He got inspired by women's liberation movement that was happening at City College. Originally, the play was named Gladys, after Mrs. Brooks' character as a reference to the Women's liberation movement. It took Russell about six months to rewrite the play into the movie script, the film was then released in 1973. Like in the plays, the character of Mrs. Brooks was again played by Clarice Taylor. Russell knew her from The Negro Ensemble Company. As he said, \\"She created the part. She is a wonderful woman, great actress, great person. I really got to know her more when we did the movie.\\" Race Five on the Black Hand Side is a Blaxploitation movie. Its main theme is liberation. As a new-style black comedy, it was the part of the Black Power movement. Charlie L. Russell grew up in West Monroe, Louisiana, in 1930s, where he witnessed many cases of racism. Together with his younger brother Bill Russell, a Boston Celtics star, he experienced \\"harassment from local police, one of whom once ordered their mother to go home and remove the 'white woman' dress she was wearing, and threats from local businessmen, including a frightening moment at a gas station when the white owner held a shotgun to their father's face because he was going to leave rather than 'wait his turn' while one white customer after another was helped before him.\\" Russell then decided to write for an African American audience and address black community problems. In an interview in 1973, he stated: \\"Yeah, I do, I write for a particular audience. I write primarily for black people, for a black audience. I write for, what I consider to be the workers, the masses of black people. I'm talking about, like, clerks, I'm talking about bus drivers, you know, working people. (...) There's a definite difference between what we call a black play and a white play and it all comes from the premise you start with, the premise of what reality is... I start from the premise that black people are oppressed in America... A black play must deal with this oppression in some way. In Five on the Black Hand Side I tried to do two things, and that was raise the level of consciousness and to unify black people.\\" In the movie, there is a generational gap depicted between Mr. Brooks and his children. Gideon, Gail, and Booker T. fight for African-American civil rights. They identify themselves as Africans. Gideon sings African songs in the shower and wants the family to move to Africa, Booker T. hates his \\"slave\\" name and likes to be introduced by an Arabic name \\"Sharif\\", and Gail is about to have an African wedding. Each one of them wears an afro and does not want to be a part of the system. Preston, a young barber, is also on their side and calls Mr. Brooks a ‚Äúmuseum negro‚Äù for his conservative opinions. The movie is about the women‚Äôs liberation movement and the civil rights movement going hand in hand. Joining the civil right movement alongside with her children and admitting her African roots give Mrs. Brooks strength to stand up to her husband. Despite this, her daughter Gail in the end of the movie enters into an unequal marriage, in which her husband is the head of the family. Women's liberation movement Following the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the 1970s is known for women's liberation movement. Black women, though, had a hard time being recognized as freedom fighters in both women's liberation movement and Black Power movement. The so called second wave feminists, according to Shelly Eversley and Michelle Habell-Pall√°n, fought to shape new standards \\"for thinking about gender, sexism, racism, sexuality, reproductive rights, religion, labor, colonialism, technology, art, music, and the environment\\". In the 1970s African-American women also started to gain a louder voice in Black Power movement, which originally advised them to stay in the role of a mother and support black manhood. In the beginning of the movie Five on the Black Hand Side, Mrs. Brooks does not seem to be able to stand up to her husband. When Mr. Brooks comes to the kitchen in the morning, she hands him a coffee right away while he does not even look at her. Mr. Brooks controls every second of Mrs. Brooks' life, saying controlling women is an art, and he even brags about it in his barbershop. He also blames his wife for not raising their children properly. Showing how Black Power movement and women's liberation movement go hand in hand, recognizing her African roots gives Mrs. Brooks strength to stand up to her husband. With an afro and dressed like an \\"African queen\\", she invades her husband's barbershop, where women are not allowed, and hands him her list of demands yelling: \\"In the name of peace, self-determination and liberation, I demand that you sign mine list of demands. And they are non-negotiable!\\" Mrs. Brooks then joins her younger son in a civil rights movement waiting for her husband to accept the list of demands, otherwise she is determined to leave him. The symbol of a barbershop Like in many other movies about the black community, a barbershop is a very important place for African-American men in Five on the Black Hand Side. Women are not allowed here. The barbershop is a symbol of John Henry's success: with his own business he supports his own family. In an article \\"The Barbershop in Black Literature\\", Trudier Harris elaborates about the importance of the barbershops by saying that it is black men's second home, where they meet and talk, and the audience is always welcoming and friendly. Harris cited Joseph A. Pierce who stated that most of the barbershops look the same: \\"Joseph A. Pierce concludes of the 404 barbershops in 12 cities he studied that they fall in the fifty-three percent of black businesses that are located in secondary business areas‚Äî'Negro business centers almost without exception are located in these areas and are usually surrounded by large concentrations of Negro populations.' Two barber chairs are a standard feature in the usually rectangular room (small, 15 or 20 feet by 30 or 40 feet). Several straightback chairs or benches are placed along the walls for customers and noncustomers.\\" Opening hours of the barbershop are usually flexible due to the owner's and customer's needs. When the shop is closed without a notice, the customers are very understanding. Men can sit in on a bench for free, not standing in the way of the business. The barber welcomes the company when there are no customers. Due to Harris, \\"The barbershop allows for escape and retreat. (...) Barbershops in black literature also serve as public forums and information centers. They provide a setting for the discussion of political, social, and moral issues as well as the exchange of information.\\" Charlie L. Russell described the barbershop in Five on the Black Hand Side as a \\"Typical Harlem barbershop. There are two barber chairs, a jukebox, and several chairs for customers to sit in while they wait. There is a dryer, and a chair and a sink in the rear where facials are performed. There is also a closet in the rear of the shop. Pictures of famous theater and sports personalities hang on the walls.\\" Mrs. Brooks then invades this place so sacred to her husband Mr. Brooks and screams in his face, \\"In the name of peace, self-determination and liberation, I demand that you sign mine list of demands. And they are non-negotiable.\\" As Harris wrote, \\"if the wife can invade this domain, and come out unharmed, she has a chance of changing John Henry's attitudes at home\\". Reception After the movie's premier, A. H. Weiler wrote in The New York Times that Five on the Black Hand Side \\"is amiable but realistic in attempting only to solve a few problems for a middle- class black family. But by tickling the funny bone, Charlie L. Russell's adaptation of his Off Broadway play is a good deal more effective than most of the militant and violent so-called black films that are getting redundant.\\" Weiler continues, \\"Mr. Russell's script may be a basically lightweight affair, but he writes with an affection and keen perception that make his people and the issues, couched either in jive talk or straight dialogue, three dimensional and pertinent. Credit for the giggles and truths is also due Oscar Williams, who directed with professional feeling for pace and comedy.\\" Charlie L. Russell received several prizes for the screenplay. In 1975, he received NAACP Image Award for Best Film Script. In 1973, the Institute of International Education provided him with a grant to study African rituals and ceremonies in Nigeria for a period of three months. He also received a Rockefeller Playwright's Grant in 1975.

It is an underwater wildlife series which takes viewers into a 2,000 mile adventure across the Pacific with a team of natural history filmmakers and deep water marine biologists. A 30-strong team took part in the expedition, to search for new species in the remote and unexplored areas. Micronesia has some of the deepest ocean trenches on the planet, with sheer walls often a few hundred metres from the islands‚Äô shores.

Description The Weejasperaspids are known from median dorsal plates with distinctive, blade-like crests in the median- posterior portion, and ossified eye capsules. Evolutionary relationships The main reasons why the weejasperaspids are not considered to be closely related to other non-acanthothoracid placoderms, as opposed to the palaeacanthaspids, are that their skull anatomies and plate histologies are generalized, and do not bear any similarities to any specific non- acanthothoracid group, and that the patterns of ornamentation on their dermal plates are unique to this family. The placoderm Brindabellaspis stensioi was once regarded as a weejasperaspid because of the similarities between its dermal plates to the other weejasperaspids. Even before it was split off into its own order, it stood out from the others because of its long, pointed snout. French paleontologist Phillipe Janvier placed B. stensioi in its own order, Brindabellaspida, because of how the internal anatomy of the braincase resembled more like those of osteostracans or galeaspids than those of other placoderms.

The theater is located at 10 Chengdu Road. History Built in 1908 during Japanese rule and designed by Japanese architect Kondo Juro, the Red Theater was originally a market building, with its ground floor serving as a department store. From 1945 onwards, the building was used as a theater, housing a troupe performing Peking Opera. The theater's many functions throughout the years signify Taiwan's sociopolitical hybridization. It was renovated due to a fire in the 2000s. From 2007 onwards, the Red Theater has been managed by the Taipei Culture Foundation, which uses the theater as a platform to promote the Cultural and Creative industries and revive the Ximending's community. The Red House was listed as a Class III Historical Site in 1997. In 2016 the area was subject to an arson attack.http://www.newnownext.com/taipei-gay-neighborhood- fire/09/2016/http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/fire-causes-serious-damage-in- taipeis-gay-village/#gs.hmLBKoY  Architecture  The Red House's unique architectural style is characterized by blended Western and Meiji era Japanese architectural patterns. The style of the building can be attributed to its architect's education, as Kondo Juro attended the Tokyo Imperial University, where he became cognizant of Western architectural styles. The Red House consists of an octagonal building, known as the Octagon Building, a Cruciform building and the adjacent square. In 2015, the Cruciform Building was renovated to restore Taiwan's first marketplace and grocery bazaar. The building is home to the Creative Boutique which provides local labels with aesthetic retail spaces. In 2016, the Octagon Building underwent the largest- scale renovation in the last 100 years. Today The Riverside Live House Corporation Ltd. took control of the horizontal section of the main Cruciform Building in September 2008. It hosts concerts by students and musicians from Thursday throughout the weekend. The building was converted into a theater in 2007, and has since become a popular part of the gay scene in the neighborhood. It is the site of the annual gay New Year‚Äôs Eve countdown and the Taipei Pride and the Mr. Gay World Taiwan pageant.http://www.newnownext.com/taipei-gay-neighborhood-fire/09/2016/ It was the venue of the Wikimania 2007 Party, which included a short film festival. In 2017, the main lantern of the Taiwan Lantern Festival was displayed on the square of the Red House, attracting numerous international visitors. Amenities The ground floor houses a small cafe and a display on the history of the building, as well as several independent shops. The second- floor theater hosts regular live performances.

This includes charitable organizations, which are generally classified under 501(c)3 in the IRS Tax Code, professional societies, guilds and trade associations, which are classified under 501(c)6, and homeowner associations, which are classified under 501(c)4. There are other classification types, but these are the primary ones. The activities allowed by the IRS vary for each type of association. For example, trade associations are allowed to do political lobbying, but charitable organizations are not. There are nuances to both of these, but the idea is to ensure that each type of organization has guidelines for its activities which match the purpose and mission of the nonprofit. There are other differences, as well, which can be learned through research on the American Society of Association Executives (asaecenter.org) or other association-focused resources. Here is the summary published by the IRS for the 501(c)3 classification: To be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual. In addition, it may not be an action organization, i.e., it may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates. Organizations described in section 501(c)(3) are commonly referred to as charitable organizations. Organizations described in section 501(c)(3), other than testing for public safety organizations, are eligible to receive tax- deductible contributions in accordance with Code section 170. The organization must not be organized or operated for the benefit of private interests, and no part of a section 501(c)(3) organization's net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. If the organization engages in an excess benefit transaction with a person having substantial influence over the organization, an excise tax may be imposed on the person and any organization managers agreeing to the transaction. Section 501(c)(3) organizations are restricted in how much political and legislative (lobbying) activities they may conduct. For a detailed discussion, see Political and Lobbying Activities. For more information about lobbying activities by charities, see the article Lobbying Issues; for more information about political activities of charities, see the FY-2002 CPE topic Election Year Issues. https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable- organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations 501(c)4 - Homeowners Associations and Related Similar Nonprofits Real estate developers often choose to maximize residential construction to clusters of residences within real property parcels. Many people purchase their residence within an association for reasons such as location along beaches and other areas, amenities, uniformity of appearance and other particular benefits or reasons. Associations are registered by the developer of the community as a not-for- profit corporation, which form of corporation is also governed by particular statutes. The legal forms of residential associations include homeowner associations, condominium associations, cooperative associations and mobile home associations. Thus, state laws are enacted to address specific types of associations applicable to the type of communities and relationships between the governing association and its constituents. Florida law In Florida there are statutes under Ch. 718, The Condominium Act, Ch. 719, regarding Co- Operative ownership, Ch. 720, governing Homeowner Associations, and Ch. 721, controlling laws for Mobile Homes. The laws for such associations continually evolve to address important legal and socioeconomic matters.\\"2007: Problems Still Unsolved\\", Legal Beat, Fall 2006, by Eric M. Glazer, Esq. Deed restrictions apply to purchasers of residential interests within such communities pursuant to a recorded Declaration, By-Laws, Covenants and Restrictions and/or Rules and Regulations for the particular community. Associations and all owners therein are subject to state statutes enacted for the particular form of community. Thus, compliance with such restrictions is mandatory and will be enforce by an applicable court of law and/or arbitration unless such restrictions are declared to be invalid or otherwise illegal. Associations are also required to comply with applicable laws concerning structural and other components of the condominium or other applicable building to help ensure the safety of owners.40 Year Recertification, Legal Beat, Fall 2007, by Andrew C. Demos, Esq. Once the developer arrives at a certain percentage of sales or permanent leasing of units within the association, the developer is statutorily required to transfer control of the association to owners other than the developer including control of a majority of the board of directors and delivery of financial records, all association records and all association property. E.g., Fla. Stat. sec. 718.301(1). Particular laws apply to financial requirements, construction defects and other matters concerning the developer of associations with applicable deadlines and various statutes of limitations. E.g., Fla. Stat. sec. 718.301(4)(c)(90-day deadline following turnover of control for the developer of a condominium to pay for and provide an independent audit of the financial records); e.g., Fla. Stat. sec. 718.203(developer warranties). Even a conversion of an older building to condominium can subject the developer to providing warranties to its owners. E.g., 718.618(6). Thus, following the transition of the association from the developer to unit owners other than the developer, the board of directors has the exceedingly important task of timely evaluating same through expert and legal advice. There is a growing trend for developers to choose to construct or convert buildings to non-residential commercial offices.Commercial Real Estate Developers Go Condo, Articles Tree, Joe Hanoa, September 25, 2006 One of the reasons for this growth in popularity is that the residential market is cooling with slower sales, high levels of investment ownership and high levels of supply.

It was founded in 1990 by Kuo Pao Kun. The Substation is centrally located in the city's civic district and was the first building under the National Arts Council's \\"Arts Housing Scheme\\". It officially opened on 16 September 1990. The Substation is a non-profit organisation and registered Institution of Public Character in Singapore, which relies on financial and in-kind support from the general public, commercial organisations and government ministries to cover the costs of operating and developing arts & educational programmes. The Substation is committed to nurturing 'local voices' in Singapore arts and culture, and supporting diversity and depth in the arts. It also functions as a multi- cultural arts space with a commitment to raising awareness of Singapore's cultural memories. The Substation presents a wide range of artists and programmes, from traditionally-trained dancers to local rock bands; established visual artists to young poets; publications to international short film festivals; experimental theatre to seminal conferences on Singapore arts and culture. Over the years, The Substation has worked with some of Singapore's most critically acclaimed artists, writers and intellectuals. The Substation also supports proposals and ideas by younger and emerging artists. The Board is chaired by Chew Kheng Chuan. Mission The Substation's mission is to support research and innovation in the arts by nurturing and challenging Singapore artists, providing an open space for artistic experimentation, promoting interaction between diverse artists and audiences, facilitating critical dialogue in the arts and fostering regional and international arts networks. As an arts space The Substation aims to be approachable, versatile and open to all kinds of arts and cultural practices; yet at the same time challenge artists. The Substation has always had a preference for work that takes risks and explores and aims to support research and innovation in the arts and to bring different artistic perspectives together in critical dialogue. The Substation is committed to supporting depth and diversity in local arts practices through developing long-term relationships, and engaging in intense curatorial and artistic dialogue with artists. History The site of The Substation, as its name suggests, was previously a power sub-station. The building dates from 1926. In 1950 the Public Utilities Board added a garden to house outdoor equipment. The sub-station ended its operations in the late 1970s and the building was left vacant. Throughout the 1980s, there was a consistent and unprecedented increase in government investment in the arts, an emergence of many art activities and capacities initiated by artists and art groups and a dramatic increase of global interest in the arts from Asia and Southeast Asia. Against such a backdrop, the Ministry of Community Development (which then included the arts and culture portfolio) explored ways to develop arts and culture in Singapore in the 1990s. In 1986, dramatist Kuo Pao Kun and Practice Performing Arts sent in a proposal for the conversion of the disused building to an arts center. It was accepted. Also in 1986, the building, together with the adjacent Tao Nan School (now the Peranakan Museum) and the shophouses along Armenian Street (now used by National Heritage Board), were earmarked for conservation under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Civic and Cultural Master Plan. In 1989, the MCD officially invited Practice Performing Arts Centre Ltd to manage The Substation and put up funding of $1.07m for the building's renovation. In June 1990, the interior fittings and equipment installation works were undertaken, and The Substation officially opened on 16 September 1990. In the first five years of The Substation's history, under the visionary artistic direction of founder Kuo Pao Kun, The Substation was a pioneer arts space in Singapore and was a site for experimentation of all the art forms, especially since there were so few spaces for the arts in that period, let alone spaces for the more experimental arts. Any of the artists who worked with The Substation in the early days were attempting things that were unprecedented in the history of modern arts and culture in Singapore. Even as a venue, The Substation had a significance back then that has since been superseded: then, up-and-coming groups like The Necessary Stage (TNS), one of the most prominent arts groups in Singapore today, staged their plays at The Substation‚Äôs Guinness Theatre or in the Garden. The Substation‚Äôs founding coincided with a burst of activity in Singapore such as the emergence of professional theatre companies, new writing in theatre, and a new generation of visual artists inspired by new practices and ideas promoted by artists and groups such as The Artists Village (TAV). The first multi- disciplinary, thematic events were held at The Substation. This included The Tree Celebration, which featured installations, mime performances, theatre performances, readings, and Pao Kun's \\"Memories\\" seasons, which explored tradition and heritage from a personal point of view, through art. The \\"Memories\\" seasons developed into The Substation's annual festival SeptFest which was notable for the seminal arts conferences that brought together artists, critics, cultural commentators, civil society activists, and the public. The Substation was part of a trend in the Singapore arts scene when \\"new\\" things were emerging. From the beginning, The Substation received critical acclaim because it gave instrumental support to independent artists and arts groups like Zai Kuning and Theatre Ox, opening up a space for such practices.The first arts conference held at The Substation in 1993, \\"Art vs Art\\" brought together many of Singapore's important artists, academics, critics and arts administrators; members of the public were also key participants in this weekend event. The feeling among those who participated was that this bringing together of such diverse people to discuss the arts and the place of the arts in Singapore society was something new, and that it was a special moment in local arts history. Under The Substation's second artistic director T. Sasitharan, The Substation entered a more mature phase as an institution as it started the process of institution-building, as its management and financial systems were consolidated, and as the arts scene became more professional and government investment in arts and culture increased. Programs at The Substation were streamlined, international and regional networks expanded, and artists encouraged to develop rigour in their practices and approaches to art. Platforms started under Pao Kun's leadership ‚Äì Dance Space, Music Space, Raw Theatre ‚Äì developed into important showcases for new artistic work in Singapore, through artist commissions. The Moving Images film programme was set up in 1997 with the aim of nurturing Singapore ‚Äì and later, South East Asian ‚Äì filmmakers and growing a regional film community. During this period, The Substation continued its support for independent artists by setting up an artist-in-residence programme in line with its original mission to persevering and supporting the development of independent artists into their maturity. However, The Substation faced considerable difficulty in supplying financial resources for the resident artists' stipends because what most funding bodies and corporate sponsors wanted to support was a final product not the process of experimentation that was a great part of The Substation's focus. In line with an increasing global interest in \\"Asian\\" contemporary arts, The Substation continues to be crucial for Singapore arts and culture. It functions as an incubator of new artistic work, artistic practices, and artists and as a gathering point for the arts community the public. The Substation continues to be a place where young artists and arts groups can have their start and as a space for critical discussion that allows for experimentation. The next challenge for The Substation is to educate a new, young generation about The Substation and the value of maintaining this open space for diverse voices, languages, opinions, and artistic practices in Singapore. :\\"Pao Kun once said that 'ideally, The Substation should be anything anyone wants it to be: open and flexible enough to do things his or her own way‚Äô. This is an alarming statement that seems to invite chaos! But it also represents an image of The Substation as a civic space, and recognises that civic spaces can be messy. In rule-driven, results- oriented Singapore, The Substation reminds us that we have more than just material needs. The ideal of The Substation ‚Äî as a public, open space as well as an experimental, contemporary arts centre ‚Äî is the energy that drives this place. Above all, The Substation is about an ideal of freedom and civic expression, it is egalitarian but also insists on the intrinsic value of the artistic spirit and individualism‚Ä¶‚Äù ::Audrey Wong, Artistic Co-director of The Substation (2000‚Äì2009) :‚ÄúUnless artists are capable of grappling with the full and unmitigated force of the complications of history, the dilemmas of modernity, the complexities of life as it is lived collectively by men, women and children, they will never be capable of making great art ‚Ä¶ There can be no great art, no living culture, without great lives, at least lives lived not just expansively but also more deeply.‚Äù ::T. Sasitharan, Artistic Director of The Substation (1995‚Äì2000) Location The Substation is located on 45 Armenian Street, Singapore, in the heart of the civic district. Its nearest MRT stations are City Hall, Bras Basah and Clarke Quay stations. The site of The Substation was a previously power sub-station until the 1970s. The building dates from 1926. Facilities The Substation's venues include a black box theatre, a gallery, a dance studio, Random Room and two multi- function classrooms. =Box office= The Substation Box Office is located at the ground floor foyer of The Substation. Aside from being the official ticketing office for The Substation's events and Gatecrash's sole bricks & mortar ticketing outlet, it also acts as a reception front and collateral centre providing information to visitors. The Box Office also serves as the registration desk for courses held at The Substation. A collection of books, postcards and T-shirts are also available for purchase from the Box Office. =Theatre= The Substation Theatre is a flexible black-box performance space. It has a seating capacity for 120 people, with 108 retractable seats, and can accommodate 200 people standing comfortably. It hosts both high- profile, and small independent arts events, ranging from the Singapore Short Film Awards to gigs by local musicians, and performances by numerous local and international performing artists. =Gallery= The Substation Gallery measures 113 square metres and can comfortably hold 100 people for a standing reception. It displays contemporary visual, performance and sound art. =Dance Studio= The Substation's Dance Studio is 135 square metres (13.5m x 10.5m and has a maximum capacity of 40 people and is used for rehearsals, small performances and classes like Yoga, Capoeira, Aikido and Contemporary Dance. =Classrooms= The Substation has two classrooms on the second floor. Each classroom is 30 square meters (6m x 6m) and can comfortably accommodate 20 seated people. They are suitable for meetings, classes, talks, and intimate performances. =Garden= In the early 1990s, many young musicians started out by playing in The Substation Garden. The Garden was a haven for local bands, especially indie, rock and metal bands whose brand of \\"loud\\" music was not always appreciated by the mainstream back then. The first 24-Hour Round the Clock at The Sub Music Festival was held on 31 Dec 1990 in the Garden and the Substation's \\"countdown gigs\\" have gone down in the annals of local music as legendary events. The Garden was also home to a wide range of performances. Among the notable ones were Pao Kun's The Tree Celebration and The Silly Little Girl and The Funny Old Tree. Other memorable \\"outdoor\\" plays staged include \\"The Mahabharata Part I: The Game of Dice\\", presented in 1995 by William Teo and his company Asia-in-Theatre Research Centre. The Necessary Stage (\\"Blue Remembered Hills\\"), Priyalatha Arun (\\"Marudhy\\"), Khairuddin Hori/ Naga Naga (\\"Wailol\\"), and World-in-Theatre (\\"Ramayana, The Royal Hunt of the Sun\\") also staged productions in the Garden. Today, many groups prefer to use The Substation Theatre rather the Garden for various reasons, including not having to worry about the possibility of rain. The Substation Garden is now used by Timbre Bar and Bistro. Programmes The Substation hosts and co- hosts a large number of programmes, courses and events in its premises. The Substation holds events that are designed, curated and presented by The Substation or other organisations without any curatorial or artistic assistance from The Substation. The latter type of events may qualify for rental subsidies, as part of The Substation's mission to support the arts. This section highlights some of The Substation's core programmes. =Moving Images= The Substation's Moving Images is Singapore's first year-round programme dedicated exclusively to independent and short films. Established in 1997, Moving Images is known for its diverse and innovative programming focusing on experimental films, shorts, and documentaries, nurturing local and Asian filmmakers and connecting them internationally by giving them learning opportunities, exposure and dialogue with peers. The Singapore Short Film Awards and the Experimental Film Forum were first hosted in 2010, while the Singapore Indie Doc Fest and First Take were first launched in 2004. =Open call // Visual, performance and sound art= The Substation Open Call was first initiated in 2008 as a visual arts platform to support and realise strong artistic, critical and rigorous visual arts proposals. Open Call serves as a platform for showcasing the work of emerging artists in the local contemporary art scene and for identifying and supporting the work of promising artistic talents. In 2010, Open Call expanded to include an incubation programme for performance art. The Substation introduced a sound art component in 2011. =Music= The Substation started to develop its music programming in 2010. The Tribal Gathering music programme was initiated with the series Tribal Gathering of Tongue Tasters, hosted monthly in alternate quarters, which brings together sound, visual and performance art. The first Tribal Gathering of Jaw Benders, an annual music festival, was held at the end of 2011. =Literary art= Literary Art at The Substation has included events which debate and discuss novels, plays, and art criticism. The Substation's Love Letters postcard project was initiated in 2009, and is ongoing. It brings together a large number of writers of different ethnic, sexual and linguistic backgrounds to write poems around the theme of love, loss and longing. The Substation has also commissioned and published a number of publications, including works of fiction. The latest novel, Several Islands, was published in 2011. =Associate artist research programme= The Substation's Associate Artist Research Programme (AARP) is a two-year residency programme where selected art practitioners are provided with curatorial, financial, administrative and operational support to develop individual interdisciplinary art research and practice at The Substation. The programme replaces the previous Associate Artist Scheme first initiated in early 2002, an in-house artist-incubation programme that included Tan Pin Pin, Royston Tan, Zai Kuning and George Chua as Associate Artists. The Associate Artist Research Programme aims to support and promote critical and sustainable research, development and discourse in contemporary art and interdisciplinary practice in Singapore. For the inaugural cycle (2011‚Äì2013), The Substation has invited Bani Haykal, Grace Tan (kwodrent), Ming Poon, and vertical submarine to be The Substation's Associate Artists. Throughout the two-year residency, each artist will present performances-lectures, workshops, exhibitions and performances during different stages of the research. The programme is supported by The National Arts Council of SIngapore and the Lee Foundation. =SeptFest= The Substation celebrates its anniversary annually on 16 September. The SeptFest arts festival was created as a month-long celebration of performance, visual, sound, filmic and literary art. Traditionally, the Open Call events are staged during this period, and are often accompanied by specially commissioned events, conferences, seminars, exhibitions and parties. =Learn*= Learn* consists of four individual public education and arts appreciation programmes available to Primary and Secondary schools. The programmes aim to instill and nurture critical thinking and creativity in young minds. The four programmes ‚Äì Contemporary Theatre and Performance, Contemporary Visual Arts, Journey Towards Contemporary Art: Learning and Understanding, and Urban Artology ‚Äì Reassessing Street Art ‚Äì were specifically designed to expose and instill a greater awareness of the history, development and artistic techniques of contemporary art forms, while emphasising local artists and art practices. Courses and workshops The Substation also holds a wide variety of courses and workshops on its premises. Queer activities The Substation has been at the forefront of queer-rights activities since the early 1990s. People Like Us (abbreviation: P.L.U.) was a pioneering gay-activist group that began as a small discussion group in 1993. Its main objective was to build a sense of gay-consciousness in Singapore and the group held monthly forums and meetings at The Substation on Sundays. Many who came to the forum half-expected to be arrested, as individuals from the Internal Security Department and the police had questioned the group‚Äôs organisers and attendees about the nature of the meetings. After a gestation of three years, the book People Like Us: Sexual Minorities in Singapore (ed. Joseph Lo and Huang Guoqin; Select Publishing) was launched by P.L.U. at Select Books in March 2003, featuring papers presented at two closed-door forums that Joseph Lo organised in 1999 at The Substation. The book also contained essays contributed by others on diverse topics, such as the representation of homosexuality in theatre, gay interracial relationships, and Christianity. The 1990s was a tense time for gay-activism in Singapore, and The Substation played an important part in its development through the work of P.L.U.. Since then, The Substation has also helped to host the yearly Short Circuit queer film-screening, featuring works by gay filmmakers from Singapore. Held once every year since 2007, the most recent segment of Short Circuit took place on 6 Jan 2012 at The Substation Theatre, organised by filmmakers He Shuming and Boo Junfeng. The event was completely sold out.

He came to Upper Egypt, and was a witness to the persecution of Christians at that time. He presented himself to Arianus, the governor of Ansena, as a Christian. The governor tortured AbƒÅm≈´n through a variety of methods, including blows, nails in the body, iron combs, and stringing him up. Thereafter, Arianus sent AbƒÅm≈´n to Alexandria. There, AbƒÅm≈´n's example inspired a number of other Christians to accept martyrdom. One of the others who was inspired by AbƒÅm≈´n's example was a girl named Theophila. She criticized the governor and his allies, specifically including criticism of their idolatry. For this, she was cast into the fire. The fire did not harm her, however, so she was subsequently beheaded. AbƒÅm≈´n himself had his limbs cut off and was beheaded.  Church of Saint Abam≈´n  The church of Saint Abam≈´n, while bearing his name, may not necessarily be devoted to AbƒÅm≈´n of Tarn≈´t. There was another martyr of similar description who bore the same first name, and because the church only mentions a Christian name, it cannot be sure whether the church was dedicated to AbƒÅm≈´n of Tarn≈´t or AbƒÅm≈´n of Tukh, who was also mentioned in the Synaxarion of Mikhail of Atrib. There is yet another Abamun, included in Les Martyrs d'√âgypte by Hippolyte Delehaye, who seems to be this individual, as he was stated to have been martyred in Alexandria.

Although, in Hellenistic and later accounts, the Delphic monster slain by Apollo is usually said to be the male serpent Python, in the earliest known account of this story, the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (6th century BC), the god kills a nameless she-serpent (drakaina), subsequently called Delphyne.Hymn to Apollo (3) 300-306, 349-374; Ogden 2013a, pp. 40 ff.; Ogden 2013b, p. 41; Hard, p. 145; Gantz, p. 88; Fontenrose, pp. 13-14; p. 94. For the monster called \\"Delphyne\\" see for example: Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 2.705-707; Callimachus fragment 116 (364) Mair; Apollodorus, 1.6.3; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 13.28. The earliest occurrence, in the literary record, of the male drak≈çn Python is found in a fragment of Simonides (c. 500 BC), although possibly earlier iconographic evidence exists for a male Delphic dragon, see Ogden 2013a, p. 43. The Homeric Hymn describes the serpentess as \\"the bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth, to men themselves and to their thin-shanked sheep; for she was a very bloody plague\\",Hymn to Apollo (3) 300-304. and says that \\"whosoever met the dragoness, the day of doom would sweep him away\\".Hymn to Apollo (3) 356. According to the Hymn, she was the foster mother of the snaky monster Typhon, who was given to the dragoness, \\"an evil to an evil\\" (Œ∫Œ±Œ∫·ø∑ Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œåŒΩ), by his mother Hera.Hymn to Apollo (3) 305-355; Fontenrose, p. 14. According to the Hymn, Zeus' wife Hera, angry at her husband for giving birth to Athena by himself, gave birth by herself, to Typhon. In most accounts however Typhon was the offspring of Gaia and Tartarus, e.g. Hesiod,Theogony 820-822\\\\. Apollodorus, 1.6.3, and Hyginus, Fabulae Preface. Typhon was to eventually battle Zeus, for supremacy of the cosmos.Hesiod, Theogony 836-838. The Hymn goes on to describe how, while building his oracular temple at Delphi, Apollo encountered the she-serpent near a \\"sweet flowing spring\\".Hymn to Apollo (3) 285-300. Apollo shot the dragoness with an arrow from his bow,Hymn to Apollo (3) 300-304, 357. and the monster: : \\"rent with bitter pangs, lay drawing great gasps for breath and rolling about that place. An awful noise swelled up unspeakable as she writhed continually this way and that amid the wood: and so she left her life, breathing it forth in blood.\\"Hymn to Apollo (3) 358-362. Apollonius of Rhodes (early 3rd century BC), says that Apollo \\"slew with his bow the monster Delphyne\\", \\"beneath the rocky ridge of Parnassus\\", and that the victory was cheered by the \\"Corycian nymphs\\", who were associated with the Corycian cave on the slopes of Parnassus above Delphi.Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 2.705-707; Fontenrose, pp. 78. For the nymphs associated with the cave, see Aeschylus, Eumenides 22. Plutarch (c. 46 AD ‚Äì 120 AD), refers to the monster who \\"fought with Apollo for the oracle at Delphi\\" as female,Plutarch, Moralia 988A (XII pp. 504-507). and says that although it was recorded that at one time the oracle at Delphi was made \\"desolate and unapproachable\\" by a dragoness, in fact, \\"it was the desolation that attracted the creature rather than that the creature caused the desolation.\\"Plutarch, Moralia 414A (V pp. 372, 373). Ogden 2013a, p. 42 with n. 95, notes that \\"It is not clear how this should be integrated with Plutarch's discussions of Python elsewhere.\\" Delphyne also appears in Apollodorus' account (1st or 2nd century AD) of Typhon's battle with Zeus,Apollodorus, 1.6.3. where she is called both a \\"she- dragon\\" (drakaina) and a \\"half-bestial maiden\\".Ogden 2013a, p. 44; Fontenrose, p. 95. According to Apollodorus, Typhon managed to cut away Zeus' sinews from his body. Typhon then hid the severed tendons in the Corycian cave in Cilicia (a different cave than the one above Delphi), and set the dragoness Delphyne, to guard over them.Ogden, 2013a, p. 42; Hard, p. 84; Fontenrose, p. 94. The (2nd-century AD?) geographical poet Dionysius Periegetes mentions a coil of the serpent Delphyne leaning against Apollo's sacrificial tripod.Ogden 2013a, p. 178; Fontenrose, p. 15 n. 4 (which adds the caveat \\"if the text is right\\"). Delphyne shares several similarities with Typhon's mate, the monstrous Echidna.Fontenrose, pp. 94-97 argues that Echidna and Delphyne (along with Ceto and possibly Scylla) were different names for the same creature. Like Apollodorus' Delphyne, Echidna was half-maid and half-snake,Hesiod, Theogony 295-305; Ogden 2013a, p. 44; Fontenrose, p. 95. and both were a \\"plague\\" (œÄ·øÜŒºŒ±) to men.Hymn to Apollo (3) 304: œÄ·øÜŒºŒ±; Hesiod, Theogony 329: œÄ·øÜŒº·æΩ. Both were also intimately connected to Typhon, and associated with the Corycian cave.Fontenrose, pp. 408-409\\\\. Ogden 2103b, p. 23, speculates that in Apollodorus' account \\"we might imagine\\" that Delphyne was, like Echidna, Typhon's consort, and that the connection of Delphyne's name with \\"womb\\" might imply that, like Echidna, she was also a \\"prolific progenitrix of dragons\\". The name Delphyne means \\"womb\\" (Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜœçœÇ),Ogden 2013a, p. 44; Liddell and Scott, Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜœçœÇ. and probably arose by back-formation from Delphi.Ogden 2013a pp. 154-155\\\\. Lane Fox, p. 288, says that the name \\"Delphyne is unique in Greek myths but it can be given a Hittite derivation.\\" Other related forms of the name: Delphyna (female) and Delphynes (male), were, apparently, also used for the Delphian dragon.Ogden 2013a, p. 42 with n. 97; Hard, pp. 145; 620 n. 9; Fontenrose, pp. 14-15 n. 4. For example, according to the 7th-century chronicler John of Antioch, some said the Pythian Games were held in honor of the male serpent Delphynes, while others said the heroine (h√™r√¥is) Delphyne.Ogden 2013a, pp. 179; Fontenrose, p. 15 n. 4. According to Ogden 2013a, p. 187, this perhaps reflected a tradition which turned the dragoness into a women.

It is based on the 1939 novel Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household and is set just prior to the Second World War. Lang had fled Germany into exile in 1933 and this was the first of his four anti-Nazi films, which include Ministry of Fear, Hangmen Also Die!, and Cloak and Dagger. It was Roddy McDowall's first Hollywood film. He had been evacuated from London following the Blitz.The Observer, The New Review section, Philip French's Classic DVD p.26, 6 February 2011 Man Hunt was one of many movies released in 1941 that were considered so pro-British that they influenced the American public (when the U.S. was officially neutral) towards being more inclined to the British point of view in World War II.One World, Big Screen: Hollywood, the Allies, and World War II By M. Todd Bennett pg. 81 The story was filmed again under its original title, Rogue Male, as a BBC TV movie starring Peter O'Toole in 1976. Plot On July 29, 1939, renowned British big game hunter Captain Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon) slips through the forest undetected near the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's residence near Berchtesgaden. Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild. After being beaten, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a \\"sporting stalk\\", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half- believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of \\"questions being asked in high places\\" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat. The phrase gives Quive-Smith the idea to have Thorndike thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident. Thorndike survives when his knapsack gets caught in a tree, breaking his fall. He eludes his pursuers and reaches a port. He steals a rowboat, but is forced to abandon it hastily when a patrol boat comes near. He swims to a Danish ship about to sail for London. Vaner (Roddy McDowall), the British cabin boy, helps Thorndike hide. The Germans find Thorndike's coat and passport aboard the rowboat and search the nearby ship. Though they find nothing, they place agent Mr. Jones (John Carradine) on board using Thorndike's passport to continue looking after the ship departs. Jones is met by German agents in London. Thorndike, mistakenly believing he is safe, casually debarks and is spotted. He manages to hide in the apartment of Jerry Stokes (Joan Bennett), a young woman. Jerry lends him money so he can reach his brother. When Lord Risborough tells his brother that the British government, continuing its pre-war policy of appeasement, would have to extradite him if he were found, Thorndike decides to hide in Africa. Jerry tries to refuse a large reward, leading Lady Risborough (Heather Thatcher) to assume that it is payment for other services, but Thorndike insists. He also buys her a new hatpin, as she had lost hers when they first met. She chooses a cheap chromium arrow and insists Thorndike present it to her. Thorndike likens it to her, saying both are \\"straight and shiny\\". By this point, Jerry is in love. Quive-Smith arrives in London to join the hunt. When Thorndike calls on his solicitor, Saul Farnsworthy (Holmes Herbert), the Nazis are once again on his trail. Chased into a London Underground station, Thorndike struggles with Jones, who is killed when he is thrown onto an electrified rail. Thorndike tells Jerry to have Lord Risborough send him a letter in three weeks time care of Lyme Regis Post Office. Thorndike hides in a cave. However, when he decides to pick up the letter, the postmistress (Eily Malyon) seems alarmed and sends a girl on an errand. Thorndike grabs the letter and beats a hasty retreat. Back at his cave, he finds the letter is from Quive-Smith, who has followed him to his lair. Quive-Smith seals the only entrance and passes Thorndike the confession and a pen through an air hole, threatening to leave him trapped inside. Quive-Smith also slides in Jerry's beret with the arrow pin, informing Thorndike that she was thrown out a window to her death when she would not betray him. They only tracked him down through the address he had written down for her. Badgered by the Nazi, Thorndike finally admits that he subconsciously intended to assassinate Hitler after all. He then agrees to sign the confession. Quive-Smith unblocks the entrance, but waits to shoot him as he crawls out. Thorndike has other plans; he uses his belt, a slat from his bed, and a stick to fabricate a bow, using Jerry's pin as the tip of a makeshift arrow, and shoots the German through the air hole. When Thorndike emerges, Quive-Smith wounds him before dying. By the time Thorndike recovers, the war has started. Thorndike joins the R.A.F. as a Bomber Command crewman. On a mission over Germany, Thorndike parachutes out with his hunting rifle.

Joseph Breen was alarmed by the script when he read it in 1941, calling it a \\"hate film.\\"p.58 Glancey, H. Mark When Hollywood Loved Britain 1999 Manchester University Press Breen felt in the Isolationist atmosphere of 1941 America, the film showed all Germans as evil, unlike other films showing both good non- Nazi Germans as well as evil National Socialists. Breen insisted that the Germans could not be characterised as so brutal; the office would pass the film only if it would \\"indicate\\" brutality rather than show it. Therefore, it did not show Thorndike's torture but left it in the mind of the audience. Darryl F. Zanuck was also worried about Lang's anti-Nazi enthusiasm and banned him from the editing room. However, Lang and his associate Gene Fowler, Jr. secretly edited the film without Zanuck's approval.p.97 Kalat, David The Strange Case of Dr. Mabuse: A Study of the Twelve Films and Five Novels 2005 McFarland Isolationists and Nazi sympathizers took issue with the film, along with films such as That Hamilton Woman and Errol Flynn's The Sea Hawk, they described the movies as \\"pro-English propaganda\\" meant to change American public opinion about going to war against Hitler's Germany.One World, Big Screen: Hollywood, the Allies, and World War II By M. Todd Bennett The film features an instrumental version of \\"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\\" by Eric Maschwitz, Manning Sherwin, and Jack Strachey as a recurring romantic theme. The score features a recurring theme for the Nazis which oddly resembles John Williams' \\"Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)\\" composed by the film's musical director Alfred Newman.

Discovered in 1983 by Keith Burridge and colleagues, talin is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein that is found in high concentrations in focal adhesions. It is capable of linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly by interacting with vinculin and Œ±-actinin. Also, talin-1 drives extravasation mechanism through engineered human microvasculature in microfluidic systems. Talin-1 is involved in each part of extravasation affecting adhesion, trans-endothelial migration and the invasion stages. Integrin receptors are involved in the attachment of adherent cells to the extracellular matrix and of lymphocytes to other cells. In these situations, talin codistributes with concentrations of integrins in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, in vitro binding studies suggest that integrins bind to talin, although with low affinity. Talin also binds with high affinity to vinculin, another cytoskeletal protein concentrated at points of cell adhesion. Finally, talin is a substrate for the calcium-ion activated protease, calpain II, which is also concentrated at points of cell‚Äìsubstratum contact. Talin is a mechanosensitive protein. Its mechanical vulnerability and cellular position bridging integrin receptors and the actin cytoskeleton make it a fundamental protein in mechanotransduction. Mechanical stretching of talin promotes vinculin binding.  Protein domains  Talin consists of a large C-terminal rod domain that contains bundles of alpha helices and an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain with three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3. The F3 subdomain of the FERM domain contains the highest affinity integrin- binding site for integrin Œ≤ tails and is sufficient to activate integrins. =Middle domain=  Structure  Talin also has a middle domain, which has a structure consisting of five alpha helices that fold into a bundle. It contains a vinculin binding site (VBS) composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning five turns of helix four.  Function  Activation of the VBS leads to the recruitment of vinculin to form a complex with the integrins which aids stable cell adhesion. Formation of the complex between VBS and vinculin requires prior unfolding of this middle domain: once released from the talin hydrophobic core, the VBS helix is then available to induce the 'bundle conversion' conformational change within the vinculin head domain thereby displacing the intramolecular interaction with the vinculin tail, allowing vinculin to bind actin. Talin carries mechanical force (of 7-10 piconewton) during cell adhesion. It also allows cells to measure extracellular rigidity, since cells in which talin is prevented from forming mechanical linkages can no longer distinguish whether they are on a soft or rigid surface. The actin binding site2 is shown to be the major site for sensing the extracellular matrix rigidity. Recently Kumar et al combined cellular electron cryo-tomography with FRET based tension measurements and find that the regions of high talin tension within focal adhesion have highly aligned and linear underlying filamentous actin structures while regions of low talin tension have less well-aligned actin filaments. =Vinculin binding site=  Function  Vinculin binding sites are protein domains predominantly found in talin and talin-like molecules, enabling binding of vinculin to talin, stabilising integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions. Talin, in turn, links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton.  Structure  The consensus sequence for vinculin binding sites is LxxAAxxVAxxVxxLIxxA, with a secondary structure prediction of four amphipathic helices. The hydrophobic residues that define the VBS are themselves 'masked' and are buried in the core of a series of helical bundles that make up the talin rod.  Activation of the integrin Œ±IIbŒ≤3  Model of talin-induced integrin activation A structure‚Äìfunction analysis reported recently provides a cogent structural model (see top right) to explain talin-dependent integrin activation in three steps: # The talin F3 domain (surface representation; colored by charge), freed from its autoinhibitory interactions in the full-length protein, becomes available for binding to the integrin. #F3 engages the membrane-distal part of the Œ≤3-integrin tail (in red), which becomes ordered, but the Œ±‚ÄìŒ≤ integrin interactions that hold the integrin in the low-affinity conformation remain intact. # In a subsequent step, F3 engages the membrane-proximal portion of the Œ≤3 tail while maintaining its membrane‚Äìdistal interactions.

It is located on the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S. state of Georgia and is within the borders of Chatham County of that state. The island and its surrounding marshlands are part of the Wassaw National Wildlife Refuge, which has a total area of of marsh, mudflats, and tidal creeks, including approximately of undeveloped beaches. The land mass is 76 percent salt marshes and 24 percent beaches, dunes, and maritime forest. The refuge is a part of the Savannah Coastal Refuges Complex. The United States government owns most of the island. Loggerhead sea turtles nest on the beaches in late spring and early summer, and turtlers can camp at the turtlers' cabin at the Federal Dock (refuge headquarters office), and then go to the beach at night to observe the turtles. Aside from this, the Federal Dock is usually only used when natural disasters occur on the island and assistance is necessary. The island is accessible only by chartered or private boat. Most visitors arriving by private boat anchor their boats to the north or south beaches or in Wassaw Creek, near the boat dock for the refuge headquarters office. The public is encouraged to use twenty miles (32 km) of dirt trails for hiking or bicycling. History Human activity and impact on Wassaw has been minimal. Native Americans apparently used the island for hunting fish, fowl, reptiles, and shellfish. Indian artifacts dating to A.D. 500-600 have been found on the island. For most of the 19th century the island was occupied by Anthony Odingsell, an African American planter, who inherited Little Wassaw Island from his former master and probable father, Charles Odingsell. Anthony Odingsell was the wealthiest free person of color in Georgia for many years. During the Civil War the island was occupied first by Confederate troops and then Union troops. Then in 1866, George Parsons, a wealthy businessman, purchased the island with the intent of making it a holiday retreat for family and friends. Although his attempts to populate the island with hogs, pheasants, turkey and quail failed, he did end up building a home in the center of the island along with approximately of interior roads. In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, a fort was built into the dunes on the north end of the island as part of the Endicott system of coastal forts. Over time, high tides, wind, and rain have eroded away the dunes, and the fort made of oyster tabby, poured concrete, and North Georgia granite continues to deteriorate from its already dilapidated condition. In 1969, the Parsons family, in an effort to keep the island from being developed, conveyed the island to the Nature Conservancy of Georgia. Today, the island is a national wildlife refuge managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Caretta Research Project, which focuses on learning more about the endangered loggerhead sea turtles, is conducted on the island by volunteers. Wassaw National Wildlife Refuge Designated a Natural Landmark in 1975 The wildlife refuge, established in 1969, is located at , approximately southeast of Savannah and at its closest point is southeast of popular Skidaway Island separated by marsh and tidal creeks. The refuge is bordered by the Wilmington River and Wassaw Sound to the north and the Vernon River and Ossabaw Sound to the south and encompasses the barrier island, two smaller islands known collectively as Little Wassaw Island, and a few hammocks. Fishing, collecting shells and wildlife, biking, and camping are illegal on the beach of the island. Fort Morgan At the northern end of the Wassaw Beach, facing the ocean, are the ruins of Fort Morgan from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, built in 1898 by Second Lieutenant Henry Sims Morgan of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The fort is made from cement and granite gravel, with small clam shells embedded in the walls. The ruins are slowly deteriorating as tidal forces and shifting sands have caused sections to crumble under their own weight. The tidal action of the beach leaves much of the ruins exposed some years and other years much of it appears to have been buried under several feet of sand. Sometimes the corroded remains of the bolts which held the two 4.7-inch rapid fire cannon mounts are clearly visible in their circular pattern located on either side of the main bunker. These two cannons were intended to defend Savannah against a possible approach by the Spanish via the Wilmington River. The fort was the largest single fortification built specifically for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and was constructed by civilians under the guidance of the US Army Corps of Engineers. As the ruins are a prominent feature easily visible from other coastal islands to the north, the top of the bunker has an official USGS Survey marker embedded in the concrete roof. Since Hurricane Irma in 2017 the surrounding beach has eroded, leaving the structure approximately 40 yards off of the beach at low tide. Airplane crash According to the NTSB report, At 9:30 on July 4, 1980 a mosquito control Beach C18S tail number N35MS twin-engine airplane on a flight from Johns Island, South Carolina with a destination of Kings Bay, Georgia, crashed on the south end of the island killing both pilot and copilot.

It attains lengths greater than one metre (>39 inches) and weighs up to 20 kg (44 pounds). In the Gulf of Alaska, shortraker rockfish are sampled annually during longline surveys and are most abundant between depths of . The Shortraker rockfish lifespan is thought to average about 120 years, the second-longest of all varieties of rockfish to the rougheye rockfish, estimated at 140 years. This makes rockfish some of the world's oldest living fish. Commercial harvesting in the Gulf of Alaska began in the early 1960s when foreign trawl fleets were targeting more abundant species.Sebastes spp In recent years, high catch rates indicate that the domestic trawl fleet targets this species; shortraker rockfish comprised 14.9% of the species composition of slope rockfish harvested in 1990, although trawl survey data indicates they comprised only 2.5% of the biomass. In 1991, catch limits were established for shortraker rockfish to prevent overharvesting of this species in the Gulf of Alaska. Catch limits are based on biomass estimates derived from bottom trawl catch rates. These biomass estimates are questionable, however, because the catch efficiency of bottom trawls on shortrakers is unknown. Fishermen report that shortrakers school off-bottom and above rugged habitat in steep-slope areas where bottom trawls cannot sample effectively.Encyclopedia.com (Heifetz report archived at Wayback Machine) Record specimens Fish age is estimated by counting growth rings in its earbone, known as an otilith, similar to tree age dating. However, the method is only accurate in temperate regions, where variances between warm and cool season growth rates create distinct ring borders. In both tropical and arctic waters it becomes very difficult to distinguish such annual variations. However, as shortraker rockfish caught off Sitka are regarded as coming from waters along the boundary of temperate and arctic regions annual growth rings can be slightly discernible. The record for oldest shortraker rockfish is 175 years, established by a 32.5\\" specimen. In 2007, fishermen caught a specimen that was estimated to be between 90 and 115 years old.

As it was common with the early Christian churches, this was built over an ancient Greek temple dedicated to the worship of a goddess, possibly Athena or Demeter. When King Otto I, King of the Kingdom of Greece, brought the Bavarian architect Leo von Klenze to draw the new city plan of Athens, the church was considered for demolition and it was the King of Bavaria, Ludwig I who objected the decision and saved the church.The church of Kapnikarea in Athens: Remarks on its history, typology and form by Nikolaos Gkioles  Architecture  It appears that the Kapnikarea church may have originally been the katholikon of a monastery.

However, after his father was found a lunatic in December 1529, Sir Thomas Burgh, was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Burgh, of Gainsborough in the County of Lincoln. He had already succeeded his father as de jure fifth Baron Strabolgi and seventh Baron Cobham, an honour he inherited from his mother, although he was never summoned to Parliament in this title or confirmed in it.Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, page 587. He was knighted in 1513 and served as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1518 and 1524. Sir Thomas's country seat was at Gainsborough Old Hall. He was an over-bearing father, given to violent rages, who ruled with an iron hand, requiring absolute obedience. Some time after 1529, he had his daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Owen, thrown out of the household and her children with his younger son Thomas Burgh were declared bastards. Sir Thomas's own children lived in fear of their father.Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of the Reign of Henry VIII. Sir Thomas was opinionated on matters of religion and was a passionate supporter of the new reformed religion which was being introduced to England. Burgh had an ambitious reform-minded chaplain with whom he discussed his opinions in the matter of religion. When his chaplain went to London to find a new patron in Thomas Cromwell, Burgh wrote asking that he be returned immediately.Willen (1989) 148-152 In May 1533, at the celebrations for the coronation of Anne Boleyn, Borough was severely rebuked for \\"ripping Queen Catherine of Aragon's [coat of] arms off her barge and for seizing the barge\\". Having been appointed as Boleyn's lord chamberlain, Borough maintained a high profile and rode in her barge as she was received at the Tower on her coronation day. Appearing in the procession he wore a surcoat and mantle of white cloth of tissue and ermine as he held the middle of Anne Boleyn's coronation train.Eric Ives, The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn (Wiley- Blackwell, 2004) p. 212 It was thought until recently that Thomas's father Edward Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh, had married Catherine Parr in 1529, but the 2nd Baron died in August 1528.Linda Porter, Katherine, the Queen (Macmillan, 2010) Through the recent research of contemporaneous documents, including the will of Catherine's mother, by the biographers Susan E. James, Linda Porter, David Starkey, and Alison Weir, it has been established that she married the 2nd Baron's grandson, who shared his grandfather's first name.David Starkey. Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII. HarperCollins, 2004. pg 697.Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Family: A Complete Genealogy (London: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 154 Sir Edward Borough was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Borough. In the will of Maud Parr dated May 1529, she mentioned Sir Thomas, father of Edward, saying I am indebted to Sir Thomas Borough, knight, for the marriage of my daughter. At the time of his son's marriage, Thomas was thirty-five, which would have made Edward around Catherine's age. Sir Edward was in his twenties and may have been in poor health. He served as a feoffee for Thomas Kiddell and as a justice of the peace. According to Susan James and Linda Porter, Sir Edward Borough died in the spring of 1533, never holding the title of Lord Borough.James, Susan E., Kateryn Parr: The Making of a Queen (Aldershot, England: Ashgate Publishing Ltd. 1999), pp 60-63 Other sources state before April 1533. Marriage and issue Burgh married twice; firstly in 1496, Agnes Tyrwhitt, a daughter of Sir William Tyrwhitt, with whom he had at least twelve children. He married secondly Alice London but had no further issue. Burgh died in February 1550 and was succeeded in the barony by his third son, William. His second wife, Alice, died in 1559.

Kim Jones began his career in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s as a performance artist, and became primarily known for his alter ego, Mudman‚Äîa shaman-like itinerant caked in mud and other organic substances who appeared on city streets, subways, galleries, and museums wearing a cumbersome lattice structure of sticks on his back. In the 1980s Jones moved to New York, where his work (including performance, sculpture, drawings, and writing) has continued to address the themes of war, healing, and destruction. Early life Jones was born in San Bernardino, California. As a child he was diagnosed with Perthes, a Polio-like illness that confined him to a wheelchair and leg braces from ages seven to ten. Thirteen years later he served for a year as a Marine in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1968. Jones received his BFA from the California Institute of Arts (1971) and MFA from the Otis Art Institute (1973) at a time when the Southern California performance and conceptual art movements were garnering international recognition. Influenced by alternative lifestyles and non-Western religious practices and cultures, Jones, along with peers such as Chris Burden, Suzanne Lacy, Paul McCarthy, and Barbara T. Smith, enacted body-based performances that commented on a wide range of topical issues, including the war, violence against women, civil rights, and sexual liberation. Mud Man Jones's stick and foam rubber sculptures‚Äîtightly bound in what would become his signature materials of nylon, rope, and electrical tape‚Äîgrew larger in scale and ultimately merged with his body, transforming Jones into the walking sculpture Mudman. Caked in mud and other organic substances, Mudman first appeared in what became known as the \\"Wilshire Boulevard Walk\\" on January 28, 1976, on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, sponsored by Carp. He continued to appear in urban areas and galleries wearing a sculptural headdress and burdened by a lattice structure of sticks on his back, presenting a formidable sight that has invited comparisons to the homeless, camouflaged soldiers, peasants, or any number of mystic figures found in religions worldwide. Art historian Marcia Tucker described Mudman as \\"a shamanistic figure, performing solitary, primitive rituals in a time and place not his own, but belonging to other cultures and other lands. He is a catalyst, suggesting mythological beings (half man, half beast), the stuff of legends and fairy tales, the visionary dimension of human endeavor.\\"Tucker, Marcia. Kim Jones. Exhibition brochure. New York: New Museum of Contemporary Art, 1986. Rat Piece Kim Jones's most controversial performance was \\"Rat Piece\\", which took place in 1976 at California State University in Los Angeles. During this notorious onstage piece, Jones (as Mudman) unveiled a wire cage holding three live rats, which he doused with lighter fluid and set on fire. This controversial performance led to the gallery director's dismissal and a court case for the artist.Knight, Christopher. Los Angeles Times, March 30, 2007. Exhibitions Jones's work has been featured in significant group exhibitions, including the 52nd International Art Exhibition at the Venice Biennial (2007), Disparities & Deformations: Our Grotesque, Site Santa Fe (2004); Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object at the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (1998); and Mapping at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1994).

In some cases, daroghas were in charge of factories. Descendants of daroghas continue to apply this title before or after their names. Two prominent examples include Darogha Ubbas Alli and Mohra Darogha. The women assigned to the administration of the imperial harem were also given the title of darogha. The position was appointed by the emperor himself, and marked a great honor for the woman and her family.

De Frouville murdered his estranged wife, Andrea De Frouville, n√©e Andrea Marie Wolstrup in Denmark, on April 4, 1883, and then shot and killed himself. She had legally separated from him the previous November because of his heavy drinking and abuse of her. Early life and education Frederic De Frouville was born about 1850U.S. Federal Census, 1880, Washington, D.C. (National Archives, Film No. T9-0124, p. 97C in Virginia., Washington Evening Star, 4 April 1883, at \\"Andrea De Frouville\\", Congressional Cemetery Obituary Archive, accessed 27 August 2013 His father was Frederick De Frouville, a French national who had emigrated to the United States in the 1840s and became a citizen in 1848, and his mother was Orsena Bestor of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. He also had a sister. By his maternal aunt Maria L. Bestor's marriage, the younger Frederic was a nephew of Aaron Van Camp. The dentist served as a spy in Washington, DC for the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. Career De Frouville worked for a time in New Orleans at the United States custom house. He returned to Washington, DC about 1873 and worked in various capacities in the capital. In 1877, at the time of his marriage, he worked in the Signal Corps, but was dismissed because of his repeated episodes of heavy drinking (described as \\"dissipation\\" in articles of the time). He later entered the Coastal Survey (today's Coast Guard). Due to his drinking, he was dismissed from this job as well. Marriage and family On September 12, 1877, in Baltimore, De Frouville married Andrea Marie Wolstrup, an immigrant from Denmark who had come to Washington, DC in 1871. She left a sister and half- brother behind., The Evening Star, 7 April 1883, accessed 28 August 2013 Her friends had recommended against her marriage to De Frouville because they considered him too wild and reckless. Wolstrup, recognized as an \\"excellent linguist,\\" was then working as a translator in the Dead Letter office of the US Post Office. She had been aided in finding work by Col. Charles C. Sheats, then the US Consul to Elsinore, Denmark, whom she had met on the ship to the United States. (In 1872 he was elected to Congress as a Republican Party representative from Alabama.) After her marriage, Andrea De Frouville continued to work at the Post Office under her maiden name. She resigned after becoming pregnant, but the child died soon after birth. Andrea De Frouville obtained a separation from her husband in November 1882 and started divorce proceedings because of his heavy drinking and abuse of her. Their marriage had been troubled for some time, and she had first consulted a lawyer about a separation in 1879 due to her husband's abuse., Evening Star, 5 April 1883, at \\"Andrea De Frouville\\"], Congressional Cemetery Obituary Archive, accessed 27 August 2013 After the separation, she gained a clerkship as a translator in the Department of Agriculture due to the recommendation of Senator Benjamin Harvey Hill. Friends warned her of De Frouville's threats against her in the weeks before her death, and her attorney advised her to have him arrested. Background At the time of the murder/suicide, Andrea De Frouville, a skilled linguist, worked as a translator in the US Department of Agriculture. She had gained the job in 1882 by the recommendation of the Senator Benjamin Harvey Hill of Georgia, who died later that year. An inquest determined that Andrea De Frouville was giving German lessons to an 18-year-old neighbor, George W. Buckingham, when her estranged husband entered her residence. The youth testified that Mrs. De Frouville asked him to get the police and he escaped out the back door. Her husband shot her in the head, killing her, and then shot himself with the same revolver before Buckingham could return with police.

The fish has a distinctive yellowish- orange color, grows to a size of about long and , and is believed to have a lifespan of 12 to 20 years. Biologists have known of the fish since the 1950s or 1960s, but the large diversity of aquatic species in Alabama prevented formal identification until 1991.  Protected status controversy  The Alabama sturgeon was first proposed for protected status in the early 1990s, although by then the fish was already so rare its survival was uncertain. The sturgeon's protection was opposed by a variety of industries located along Alabama's rivers for the feared economic impact. The opponents' main arguments were that it was already extinct or that it was not a distinct species. In response to this opposition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ceased efforts to place the fish on the Endangered Species List. Then Ray Vaughan, an environmental lawyer in Montgomery, Alabama, sued the Service and, in 2000, won, requiring Fish and Wildlife to list the fish for protection.  Recent efforts  In 1993, state and federal biologists began a program to help save the Alabama sturgeon through a captive breeding program. Unfortunately, only six fish have been captured since then, all male. The last fish held in captivity died in 2002. The most recent specimen was captured in April 2007. After determining the fish was a male, sperm were collected, a small tracking device implanted, and it was released once it had fully healed. It was hoped that the tagged fish would lead to others of its species, but in a year of tracking to date, this has not happened. In May 2008, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed designating of the Alabama River and of the lower portion of its tributary, the Cahaba River, as critical habitat for the fish. Although the rivers are dammed at multiple locations, management of the river flows is expected to continue unchanged. In July 2009, fish researchers lost contact with the only known live Alabama Sturgeon. The fish had been given an electronic tracking device in hopes that the fish would lead them to other members of the species, but the device stopped working. In August 2013, the Fish and Wildlife Service released the \\"Recovery Plan for the Alabama Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi)\\". It includes a plan to establish a captive stock that can produce fingerlings to be released back into the wild and to improve the habitat in the Alabama River through operational changes at Claiborne and Millers Ferry Lock and Dams. Studies from 2014 and 2015 indicated that despite the very few sightings over the last decade, the species is still extant. This is due to numerous traces of recent Alabama sturgeon DNA (environmental DNA) found in water samples gathered from the river.

The third Baronet was also Member of Parliament for Newtown. He died in 1683, and was succeeded by his grandson, who died in turn unmarried in 1691. The latter's younger brother, the fifth Baronet, was a Member of Parliament for Essex. He died childless in 1715 and the baronetcy went to a son of the younger son of the third Baronet. The seventh Baronet sat for Newtown for 48 years. Since his marriage was without children, he was succeeded by his younger brother. The latter's son, the ninth Baronet, was also a Member of Parliament for Newtown. He died childless in 1818, and his younger brother became the next baronet. After the death of the tenth Baronet in 1832, the baronetcy became extinct. The Barrington Baronetcy, of the City of Limerick, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 20 September 1831, for Joseph Barrington. His grandson, the third Baronet died childless in 1872, and was succeeded by his younger brother. Since the latter's grandson, the sixth Baronet had only two daughters, the next baronet became his younger brother. The seventh Baronet died unmarried. As of 2014, the title, is held by his kinsman, the eighth Baronet, who succeeded in 2003. The family seat was Glenstal Abbey, near Murroe, County Limerick.

It is pan-tropical and classified in the Parkerioideae subfamily of the family Pteridaceae. Description Ceratopteris cornuta in detail Erect aquatic or subaquatic ferns of moderate size. Rhizome short, fleshy, horizontal and ascending to erect, loosely rooted in the mud or +/- floating, radial, dictyostelic with numerous meristeles and medullary strands, young parts bearing thin, ovate, +/- cordate, clathrate scales. Fronds stipitate, the stipes fleshy, with numerous longitudinal air canals, abaxially rounded and ribbed, adaxially flattened, vascular bundles in a peripheral ring, one with each rib and several to the adaxial side, and several smaller medullary strands; lamina dimorphic, sterile fronds +/- spreading, 2 - 3-pinnatifid with broad membranous lobes, venation reticulate without included free veinlets, often with proliferous buds in the axils; fertile fronds erect, longer, narrower and more divided than the sterile, the lobes strongly recurved to completely cover the adiaxial surface, venation longitudinal, branching at the bases of the lobes. Sporangia solititary, scattered along the veins, exindusiate but protected by the continuous reflexed margin of the lamina, large, short-stalked, annulus broad, irregular, of 30 - 70 thickened cells, or lacking, containing 16 to 32 spores. Spores large, trilete, ribbed with irregular long meshes. Ceratopteris in Australian National Herbarium Distribution A widespread genus of four to six species inhabit the humid tropics. Ceratopteris is also important in the study of pteridophytes because it is a commonly used model organism for use in genomic studies, due to the ease and rapidity with which it can be grown in laboratories, as well as well characterized phenotypes. Patented strains of this plant have been developed. Economic use Ceratopteris is a fairly popular aquarium plant, often sold under the name \\"water sprite.\\" It may be grown as an emersed but natant (floating) plant, or as an immersed plant rooted in the substrate. Under the right conditions the plants will grow fully emersed erect leaves,but it is currently unknown as to whether it can be grown in a houseplant style soil substrate or whether the roots must remain immersed. The most common species in use in aquaria are C. thalictroides, C. pteridoides, and C.cornuta\\". Plants of this genus have also been used for food, as a green, with the common name \\"water lettuce.\\" However, it is now known that these ferns are also carcinogenic if ingested. Higher classification Ceratopteris was long placed in the monogeneric family Parkeriaceae, thought to be unique because of its aquatic adaptations. However, recent genetic analysis has shown it to be clearly allied with Acrostichum, within the Pteridaceae. Species At one time, some authorities recognized only one species; now some authorities recognize only four species. However, recent work by Masuyama and Watano has suggested that C. thalictroides actually consists of four cryptic species (thalictroides, froesii, gaudichaudii, oblongibloba). *Ceratopteris cornuta (P.

The show follows the lives of Ann and David Darrell, originally from Essex, who decided to renovate an old chateau in Slovakia and turn it into a luxury boutique hotel. As well as looking at the problems the couple faced in finding, renovating and running the hotel, it also deals with their relationship. Chaos at the Chateau is a prime-time continuation of the series A Place in Slovakia, which followed the couple's attempts to find a suitable chateau. The show has been described as a \\"real life Fawlty Towers\\", with incompetent hoteliers ‚Äì a vulgar bossy wife and tetchy henpecked husband ‚Äì aided and abetted in their comedy escapades by clueless staff. Controversy surrounded David Darrell when it was revealed, following the transmission of the programme, that he was being pursued for ¬£950,000 for alleged fraudulent practices that occurred during his time as an Insolvency Practitioner. He was removed from the Register of Insolvency Practitioners in 2003 because of concerns regarding work that he had invoiced for, but allegedly not carried out. In March 2008, the Darrells put their Slovak chateau on the market for ‚Ç¨3,000,000. The main characters are: *Ann Darrell (Owner) *David Darrell (Owner) *Thierry (Hotel Manager) *Marek (Waiter) Reality or spoof? The show is presented in fly-on-the-wall documentary style. Appearing on the talk show Richard & Judy, Ann Darrell stated that \\"It's all real\\" and held her head in embarrassment at some of the events. However, debate exists about how much of the show is staged for the cameras, due to the apparently implausible events that take place, and the perception that the characters are acting (albeit playing exaggerated versions of themselves), plus various technical aspects of the production, such as camera positioning. Some suggest that the show is loosely based on real events but re-shot in an exaggerated manner to provide higher comedy value. It should be mentioned however that filming takes place over a long period of time, and thus events from several weeks are combined into a single episode, making it so eventful (and therefore unrealistic). In addition, the earlier series about the couple, A Place in Slovakia, also contained many comedic elements, and there were no suggestions that this was scripted. Episode One: \\"Finding Chateau Salgovce\\" ‚Äì 22 March 2007 The first episode was based around Ann and David trying to find a suitable chateau to buy and renovate, and their problems with the Slovak estate agents. Episode Two: \\"Renovating Chateau Salgovce\\" ‚Äì 29 March 2007 This episode was based around the couple's efforts to appoint a hotel manager. They finally appointed Frenchman Thierry. Episode Three: \\"Welcoming guests\\" ‚Äì 5 April 2007 In the third episode the couple receive a visit from a hotel inspector. David is forced to take the guests to a nearby winemaker and hide the staff as the couple do not have official approval to open the hotel. I'm in this episode (An (ex-friend of theirs posing as a potential guest) - They're all made-up situations that didn't really happen. Episode Four: \\"Pork Night\\" ‚Äì 12 April 2007 As the chateau has so far had only a few guests, David decides to try to make money another way by holding a \\"Pork Night\\" for the locals. Thierry is not happy and tries to change the Pork Night menu, leading to a huge argument with David, after which Theirry walks out. Despite supporting her husband at first, after Pork Night Ann decides that Thierry was right and talks him into returning to the hotel. Episode Five: \\"Thierry's Friends\\" ‚Äì 19 April 2007 The chef is off sick and Thierry has to cook for the guests. Thierry has arranged for his friends, three gay couples, to stay at the chateau. Ann loves playing hostess, but David is less thrilled when he discovers that Ann has upgraded one couple to stay in David and Ann's own bedroom. Thierry is very upset that Ann has not helped in the kitchen and that he has not seen his friends, and he begins sulking. Ann puts Thierry in his place. Guests: Gerhard Pruegger, Martin Hoetzeneder, Andrew Ingram Episode Six: \\"Muck Spreading\\" ‚Äì 26 April 2007 Things should have been looking up for the chateau when the couple hold their first business conference. However, Ann and David's problems continue when they discover that one of the staff has been taking alcohol and other items from the bedrooms. Further problems arise when some of their patio furniture is stolen. Ann threatens that they could all be fired. They also have problems with the local farmer who is using a road on Ann and David's land as a short cut while muck spreading. The most devastating news comes when Ann and David find out that both of their puppies have been killed. Episode Seven: \\"The Investors\\" ‚Äì 4 May 2007 In the final episode Ann and David meet a wealthy Slovak couple with the aim of persuading them to invest in the chateau so that they could develop the vast land around it. However the couple surprise Ann and David by offering to buy the chateau instead. Much to the staff's relief the couple turn down the offer. At the end of the episode Ann and David renew their wedding vows at the chateau.

He is said to have been visited by the archangel Michael, who told AbƒÅm≈´n that he would be martyred at Ansena. Abamun traveled to Ansena, There he was tortured by the governor Eukhious by a variety of means, including the rack, fire, red-hot irons, flogging, flaying, and the furnace) before he was finally beheaded. He is also said to have worked a number of miracles. After his execution, another Christian, Julius of Aqfahs, wrapped the body in cloths and had it carried back to his homeland, Toukh. Vagaries of translation have led some to believe that Mikhail went on to imply that AbƒÅm≈´n's body had been taken there immediately, although other translators have made it clear that the intended meaning was more likely that the body was moved from Toukh sometime in the thirteenth century. Veneration Abu al-Makarim records that in the thirteenth century there was a church dedicated to Abam≈´n (note the spelling difference) at El-Bahnasa. He went on to say that he himself was not sure whether the church was dedicated to AbƒÅm≈´n of ·π¨oukh or his namesake AbƒÅm≈´n of Tarn≈´t. The evidence available makes it seem more likely that it was named after AbƒÅm≈´n of ·π¨oukh, for several reasons. One is that Julius of Aqfahs personally took care of this martyr's body, but not the other's. Another is that Mikhail specifically mentions that this AbƒÅm≈´n was at the time of his writing in the Said, which indicates that there was a cult extant at the time venerating this AbƒÅm≈´n, but not the other. Lastly, there is the existing reference to this individual working a number of miracles, with no such reference made to any miracle by the other Abamun. References * Atiya, Aziz S.

Bimodules over A are essentially the same as modules over the enveloping algebra of A, so in particular A and M can be considered as Ae-modules. defined the Hochschild homology and cohomology group of A with coefficients in M in terms of the Tor functor and Ext functor by : HH_n(A,M) = \\\\operatorname{Tor}_n^{A^e}(A, M) : HH^n(A,M) = \\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_{A^e}(A, M) =Hochschild complex= Let k be a ring, A an associative k-algebra that is a projective k-module, and M an A-bimodule. We will write A^{\\\\otimes n} for the n-fold tensor product of A over k. The chain complex that gives rise to Hochschild homology is given by : C_n(A,M) := M \\\\otimes A^{\\\\otimes n} with boundary operator d_i defined by :\\\\begin{align} d_0(m\\\\otimes a_1 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n) &= ma_1 \\\\otimes a_2 \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n  d_i(m\\\\otimes a_1 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n) &= m\\\\otimes a_1 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_i a_{i+1} \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n  d_n(m\\\\otimes a_1 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n) &= a_n m\\\\otimes a_1 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_{n-1} \\\\end{align} where a_i is in A for all 1\\\\le i\\\\le n and m\\\\in M. If we let : b=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i d_i, then b \\\\circ b =0, so (C_n(A,M),b) is a chain complex called the Hochschild complex, and its homology is the Hochschild homology of A with coefficients in M. =Remark= The maps d_i are face maps making the family of modules (C_n(A,M),b) a simplicial object in the category of k-modules, i.e., a functor Œîo ‚Üí k-mod, where Œî is the simplex category and k-mod is the category of k-modules. Here Œîo is the opposite category of Œî. The degeneracy maps are defined by :s_i(a_0 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n) = a_0 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_i \\\\otimes 1 \\\\otimes a_{i+1} \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n. Hochschild homology is the homology of this simplicial module. Hochschild homology of functors The simplicial circle S^1 is a simplicial object in the category \\\\operatorname{Fin}_* of finite pointed sets, i.e., a functor \\\\Delta^o \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Fin}_*. Thus, if F is a functor F\\\\colon \\\\operatorname{Fin} \\\\to k-\\\\mathrm{mod}, we get a simplicial module by composing F with S^1. : \\\\Delta^o \\\\overset{S^1}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\operatorname{Fin}_* \\\\overset{F}{\\\\longrightarrow} k\\\\text{-mod}. The homology of this simplicial module is the Hochschild homology of the functor F. The above definition of Hochschild homology of commutative algebras is the special case where F is the Loday functor. =Loday functor= A skeleton for the category of finite pointed sets is given by the objects : n_+ = \\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}, where 0 is the basepoint, and the morphisms are the basepoint preserving set maps. Let A be a commutative k-algebra and M be a symmetric A-bimodule. The Loday functor L(A,M) is given on objects in \\\\operatorname{Fin}_* by : n_+ \\\\mapsto M \\\\otimes A^{\\\\otimes n}. A morphism :f:m_+ \\\\to n_+ is sent to the morphism f_* given by : f_*(a_0 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n) = b_0 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes b_m where :\\\\forall j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, \\\\ldots, n \\\\\\\\}: \\\\qquad b_j = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\prod_{i \\\\in f^{-1}(j)} a_i & f^{-1}(j) eq \\\\emptyset 1 & f^{-1}(j) =\\\\emptyset\\\\end{cases} =Another description of Hochschild homology of algebras= The Hochschild homology of a commutative algebra A with coefficients in a symmetric A-bimodule M is the homology associated to the composition :\\\\Delta^o \\\\overset{S^1}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\operatorname{Fin}_* \\\\overset{\\\\mathcal{L}(A,M)}{\\\\longrightarrow} k\\\\text{-mod}, and this definition agrees with the one above. Topological Hochschild homology The above construction of the Hochschild complex can be adapted to more general situations, namely by replacing the category of (complexes of) k-modules by an ‚àû-category (equipped with a tensor product) C, and A by an associative algebra in this category. Applying this to the category C = Sp of spectra, and A being the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane spectrum associated to an ordinary ring R yields topological Hochschild homology, denoted THH(R). The (non-topological) Hochschild homology introduced above can be reinterpreted along these lines, by taking for C the derived category of \\\\Z-modules (as an ‚àû-category). Replacing tensor products over the sphere spectrum by tensor products over \\\\Z (or the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane-spectrum H\\\\Z) leads to a natural comparison map THH(R) \\\\to HH(R). It induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups in degrees 0, 1, and 2. In general, however, they are different, and THH tends to yield simpler groups than HH. For example, :THH(\\\\mathbb{F}_p) = \\\\mathbb{F}_p[x], :HH(\\\\mathbb{F}_p) = \\\\mathbb{F}_p\\\\langle x \\\\rangle is the polynomial ring (with x in degree 2), compared to the ring of divided powers in one variable. showed that the Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta function of a smooth proper variety over \\\\mathbb{F}_p can be expressed using regularized determinants involving topological Hochschild homology.

Certain ordinances may also be created at a more local level. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the principal federal law. The SDWA authorizes the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create and enforce regulations to achieve the SDWA goals. Federal requirements The Safe Drinking Water Act is the principal federal law governing public water systems.United States. Safe Drinking Water Act. ; ; et seq. Approved 1974-12-16. These systems provide drinking water through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections, or serve an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year. As of 2017 there are over 151,000 public water systems. * Approximately 52,000 Community Water Systems serve the majority of the U.S. population * Approximately 85,000 systems are non-transient, non-community water systems (such as schools, factories, office buildings, and hospitals that operate their own systems) * Approximately 18,000 systems are transient, non-community water systems (such as rural gas stations or campgrounds). Eight percent of the Community Water Systems‚Äîlarge municipal water systems‚Äîprovide water to 82 percent of the US population. The SDWA authorized the EPA to promulgate regulations regarding water supply. The major regulations are in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations: 40 CFR Parts 141, 142, and 143. Parts 141, 142, and 143 regulate primary contaminants, implementation by states, and secondary contaminants. Primary contaminants are those with health impacts. State implementation allows states to be the primary regulators of the water supplies (rather than EPA) provided they meet certain requirements. Secondary contaminants generally cause aesthetic problems and are not directly harmful. The SDWA also contains provisions that require water supplies to develop emergency plans, water supply operators to be licensed, and watersheds to be protected. The Act does not cover private wells. =National Primary Drinking Water Regulations= Types of water systems Part 141 regulates public water systems based on size (population served) and type of water consumers. Larger water systems and water systems serving year-round residents (cities) have more requirements than smaller water systems or those serving different people each day (e.g., a shopping mall). In 2009, public water systems on commercial airlines were included.EPA. \\"National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Drinking Water Regulations for Aircraft Public Water Systems.\\" Final rule. Federal Register, , 2009-10-19. Control of contaminants The drinking water standards are organized into six classes of contaminants: Microorganisms, Disinfectants, Disinfection Byproducts, Inorganic Chemicals, Organic Chemicals and Radionuclides. The standards specify either Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) or Treatment Techniques (enforceable procedures). The most recent major standard-setting rules include: * Ground Water Rule (2006)EPA. \\"National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Ground Water Rule.\\" , 2006-11-08. * Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (2006) for control of Cryptosporidium and other pathogens.EPA (2006-01-05). \\"National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule.\\" * Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule (2006)EPA. \\"National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule.\\" , 2006-01-04. * Lead and Copper Rule (last revised 2007).EPA (2007-10-10). \\"National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for Lead and Copper: Short-Term Regulatory Revisions and Clarifications.\\" Federal Register, Monitoring and reporting Testing is required to determine compliance with maximum contaminant levels. The regulations specify when and how samples are to be taken and analyzed. For example: * The Information Collection Rule required large public water systems to collect samples in the late 1990s to provide data for designing new regulations or revising regulations related to pathogen contamination in surface water and disinfection byproduct production. * The Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rules require certain water systems to test for contaminants which do not yet have drinking water limits. The resulting information is used to prioritize the regulation of new contaminants. Section 141.40 includes the latest list of proposed contaminants.EPA. \\"Monitoring requirements for unregulated contaminants.\\" . In 2012, the third set of contaminants (UCMR3) replaced the previous set (UCMR2). The regulations specify who must be notified and the manner of the notification. One such provision is Subpart O, Consumer Confidence Reports. These reports are a summary of the water supplies sources and water quality testing results. The reports must be sent to all customers annually.EPA. \\"Subpart O‚ÄîConsumer Confidence Reports.\\" et seq. Subpart Q regulates how violations must be reported.EPA. \\"Subpart Q‚ÄîPublic Notification of Drinking Water Violations.\\" et seq. =National Primary Drinking Water Regulations implementation= EPA issued the implementation regulations in Part 142 pursuant to the Public Health Service Act and the SDWA. Oversight of public water systems is managed by \\"primacy\\" agencies, which are either state government agencies, Indian tribes or EPA regional offices. All state and territories, except Wyoming and the District of Columbia, have received primacy approval from EPA, to supervise the PWS in their respective jurisdictions.EPA (2004). \\"Understanding the Safe Drinking Water Act.\\" Fact sheet. Document no. EPA 816-F-04-030. Generally, a primacy agency must incorporate the requirements of the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations in its own regulations. States may be more stringent, but not less stringent, than the federal rules. Federal funding is available to primacy agencies that implement or enforce some or all of the federal requirements. =National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations= The relatively short Secondary Regulations at Part 143 provide guidance for aesthetic characteristics, including taste, color, and odor, but do not actually regulate public water systems. \\"The regulations are not Federally enforceable but are intended as guidelines for the States.\\"EPA. \\"National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations: Purpose.\\" Although not federally enforceable, some states regulate the secondary contaminants. The guidelines include recommendations for maximum concentrations for 15 contaminants, when to sample, and how to analyze the samples. Some contaminants in the Secondary Regulations are also regulated in the Primary Regulations. This generally occurs when a contaminant is a nuisance at a low level, but toxic at a higher concentration. =Compliance= Municipalities throughout the United States, from the largest cities to the smallest towns, sometimes fail to meet EPA standards. The EPA may fine the jurisdiction responsible for the violation, but this does not always motivate the municipality to take corrective action. In such cases, non-compliance with EPA may continue for many months or years after the initial violation. This could result from the fact that the city simply doesn't have the financial resources necessary to replace aging water pipes or upgrade their purification equipment. In rare cases, the source water used by the municipality could be so polluted that water purification processes can't do an adequate job. This can occur when a town is downstream from a large sewage treatment plant or large-scale agricultural operations. Citizens who live in such places‚Äîespecially young children, the elderly, or people of any age with autoimmune deficiencies‚Äîmay suffer serious health complications as a long-term result of drinking water from their own taps. State requirements Some state and local governments have issued rules to protect users of private wells. =California= Timeline of existing federal water and state drinking water quality regulations: *National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NIPDWR) **Promulgated 1975-1981 **Contained 7 contaminants **Targeted: trihalomethanes, arsenic, and radionuclides **Established 22 drinking water standards *Phase 1 standards **Promulgated 1987 **Contained 8 contaminants **Targeted: VOCs *Phase 2 standards **Promulgated 1991 **Contained 36 contaminants **Targeted: VOCs, SOCs, and IOCs *Phase 5 standards **Promulgated 1992 **Contained 23 contaminants **Targeted: VOCs, SOCs, and IOCs *Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) **Promulgated 1989 **Contained 5 contaminants **Targeted: Microbiological and Turbidity *Stage 1 Disinfectant/Disinfection By-product(D/DBP) Rule **Promulgated 1998 **Contained 14 contaminants **Targeted: DBPs and precursors *Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR) **Promulgated 1998 **Contained 2 contaminants **Targeted: Microbiological and Turbidity *Radionuclide Rule **Promulgated 2000 **Contained 4 contaminants **Targeted: Radionuclides *Arsenic Rule **Promulgated 2001 **Contained 1 contaminant **Targeted: Arsenic *Filter Backwash Recycling Rule **Promulgated 2001 **Contained - **Targeted: Microbiological and Turbidity =New Jersey= New Jersey enacted its own Safe Drinking Water Act in 1977.State of New Jersey.

The Department of Environmental ProtectionNew Jersey Department of Environmental Protection: Division of Water Supply and Geoscience administers the NJSDWA and its related regulations in the state administrative code. =New York= Regulations Public Health Law Section 225 gives the public health council authority to create and modify the State Sanitary Code. Part 5 of the New York State Sanitary Code (10NYCRR5) regulates water supply. Public water supply regulation in New York predates the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act by decades. As in California, New York has over the years, in accordance with 40CFR142, modified its sanitary code to implement the rules in the federal code. Occasionally, the Public Health Law is also amended to regulate water supply, e.g. Article 11 of the NY Public Health Law. The Environmental Conservation Code6NYCRR601 Water Supply Permits regulates the sources and districting of water supply. Other laws that govern the operation of water supply, such as the Transportation Corporation Law, Town Law, and the Public Service Law, affect water quality indirectly. Organization The New York State Department of HealthNew York State Department of Health has primacy for most of the water supply regulation compliance determination and enforcement in New York. The department sets general policy and oversees the local units, which may be district offices, regional offices, or county health departments, who oversee the public water systems. =Ohio= In 2014, algae produced toxins that appear as a product of farmland fertilizers' runoff, became a pressing issue in several Ohio cities.

It has its headquarters at 99 Duncan Mill Road in Toronto.  History  The Ontario Association of Real Estate Boards (later renamed the Ontario Real Estate Association) was founded in 1922 to organize real estate activities on a province-wide basis. In 1930, the Ontario government brought into law the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act. The government of Ontario codified and regulated the real estate broker occupation. A new law was enacted, under the supervision of the Ontario Securities Commission, called an Act for Registration of Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen. Bill 150 was introduced into the Legislature on March 21, 1930, by Mr. Ferguson, and Royal Assent was given on April 30, 1930. The Act was amended in 1940 and again in 1949, but there were still no academic qualifications required, and no formal training in the real estate business was required. The Ontario Association started an educational program in four different locations in the province in 1954.Revised Statutes and Regulations of Ontario (1949), Real Estate Business and Brokers Act, Queens Printer, Toronto. Finally, in 1959, individuals had to pass a short examination on their knowledge of the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act. By 1975, the Ontario Association was successful in convincing the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations in Ontario (which by that time was responsible for supervising the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act) that mandatory education, for registration of all registrants in the province, be elevated to 150 hours of study, with an examination that had to be passed with a 75% pass mark. There were also new Broker courses introduced, along with a new Certificate Program, which had to be passed with the same 75% mark, to qualify for registration as a Broker. An articling program was launched in 1988, which required all new registrants to complete and pass three more forty-hour courses within their first two years of registration. If they failed to do that, they would not have their registrations renewed until these requirements were satisfied. The Ontario Real Estate Association and the provincial government signed an agreement in 1997, which granted the right to self-management.Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, and Regulations of Ontario (2002). The Real Estate Council of Ontario was established in 1997 to administer the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, on behalf of the provincial government.

There are several leagues in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina, although many of the Virginia leagues have become feeders for Virginia High School League Scholastic Bowl competition, or play the VHSL format instead of the ACE format. (The Scholastic Bowl format allows districts to keep playing their old formats during the regular season.) ACE teams also exist throughout Arkansas, though the game follows a slightly different format. Most quizbowl formats feature teams of three to five players from each school, competing on questions that span the realm on human knowledge. There are rarely pre-assigned reading lists, or limitations on subject matter. Informal limits, based on what students might reasonably be taught, or have learned in outside reading, do exist, and some competitions will restrict the amount of popular culture in each match. The ACE format requires each school to field five teams of four players each. The five teams compete in four subject areas -- Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and English -- and a fifth team plays in an All-Around competition. No student can play on two subject-area teams, although he/she can play on a subject-area team and the All-Around team. The wide variety of students (a school needs at least 16 players to compete) that can play in the ACE format makes it popular with administrators. An ACE competition usually has two schools, and consists of the five teams from each school competing one at a time. The subject-area competitions usually have questions from subject areas that are determined before the season begins. For Math, Science, and Social Studies this is usually fairly open-ended: * Math questions are usually written in the areas of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and sometimes calculus. * Science questions are usually written in the areas of biology, chemistry, physics, earth science, and sometimes computer science. * Social Studies questions are usually written in the areas of US history, World history, Geography, and civics. English questions are usually written from a pre-assigned reading list. The list usually consists of a number of novels, short stories, plays, and poems, and questions are about details from those works. All-Around questions are from the four subject areas (again, using the reading list for English questions.) Usually, fine arts, philosophy, religion, and current events questions are included in the All-Around competition, but popular culture and sports are specifically excluded.

It is in the village of Wind Point, Wisconsin, on Lighthouse Road, next to the Shoop Park golf course. The lighthouse stands tall. One of the oldest and tallest active lighthouses on the Great Lakes, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  History  Racine harbor had its first lighthouse in 1837, but that light was not visible to ships approaching from the north, blocked by Racine Point, three a half miles to the north. As a result, the Lighthouse Board recommended in 1870 the building of a lighthouse on Wind Point itself. Congress appropriated the money in 1877 and the lighthouse entered service in 1880. Wind Point Lighthouse was designed by Orlando Metcalfe Poe, a former Brigadier General in the Civil War. The lighthouse was constructed in 1880. It was lit for the first time on November 15, 1880. The beacon was originally powered by a three-wicked kerosene lamp, magnified by a third-order Fresnel lens. The light was electrified in 1924, and replaced a DCB-24R airport beacon in 1964. The DCB-24R failed in 2007, and was replaced by a VRB-25 lens. A signal house (horns removed, resonators still in place) remains on the grounds as well as a garage, two storage buildings, and an oil house. The Village of Wind Point has maintained the lighthouse and grounds since 1964, and uses the old keepers' quarters as a village hall and police headquarters. The park and lighthouse were transferred from the U.S. coast guard to the Village of Wind Point in 1997, with the requirement that it be maintained as an historical landmark. The lighthouse is open to tour on certain dates. In the summer of 2007, the lighthouse tower underwent a US$210,000 restoration, during which windows and doors were replaced, brickwork repointed, and the tower repainted. The shipwreck site of the Kate Kelly is located east of the lighthouse.

Early years Born sometime between 1908 and 1912; he was always unsure of his date of birth; in Grodno, then Imperial Russia, Dayan Fisher was the seventh of fourteen children born to the professional fundraiser of the Grodno yeshiva. He claimed to have shared a bench in the Grodno Cheder with Meyer Lansky. It is no exaggeration to state that Dayan Fisher studied under the most illustrious institutions and figures of his generation. He was a pupil of the renowned Rabbi Shimon Shkop in Grodno yeshiva, as well as Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz in Kamenetz yeshiva. Dayan Fisher went to Radin yeshiva in his late teens, serving the world-famous Chofez Chaim as carer and personal assistant and was one of a select group who prayed daily in his house. He also studied in Bia≈Çystok yeshiva and under Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski of Vilna. In 1930 Dayan Fisher went to Mir yeshiva, staying for six years. Rabbinical career Dayan Fisher was appointed Rabbi of a small shul in Warsaw in 1936, where he rapidly acquired a name as an impressive speaker in the \\"Litvishe\\" (Lithuanian Jewish) style. He married Sarah Miriam Wloski of ≈Åom≈ºa in June 1937, whose father worked as a Shochet in England, following her to England the same year through the rescue efforts of Rabbi Dr Solomon Schonfeld. Dayan Fisher thus escaped the impending Holocaust, yet his entire family was wiped out except for a younger brother who escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto and joined the partisans. When Rabbi Fisher arrived in England, the Federation of Synagogues, with some 68 affiliated synagogues, was the largest synagogal body in the United Kingdom, serving some 50,000 souls. He became Rabbi of the Alie Street Federation synagogue in London's East End in 1939. In 1940, he took over as Rabbi of Yavne synagogue in Hackney, which he led until 1970. In 1966, Dayan Fisher formed the Federation Beis Din, which he built up into a significant and respected force. As a result of his numerous communal activities and in recognition of his phenomenal Talmudic scholarship, Dayan Fisher became the \\"Rav Rashi\\" of the Federation of Synagogues in 1969 following Rabbi Dr Eliezer Kirzner. Upon his retirement in 1980, he retained the post with the addition of the appellation \\"emeritus\\". Dayan Fisher moved with his wife to Edgware in the 1970s, where they became well-known and popular figures. His wife's death in 1987 was a severe blow, yet he continued to speak and teach for the next decade and a half, well into his 90s. Serving as the Chairman of the Federation of Synagogues Rabbinate for many years, Dayan Fisher's relationship with Federation lay leaders was not always happy. He felt that he and his rabbinic colleagues were often mistreated and undervalued by their constituents, who didn‚Äôt recognise the tremendous talent and knowledge of their Rabbis. Although unbending in his firm old-world Orthodoxy, he was always courteous to those with different views and practices. An ardent religious supporter of Israel, he was a senior figure in UK Mizrachi for many years, and visited Israel often. Dayan Fisher died on January 7, 2004 in London, survived by two daughters, three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. One son-in-law is Elkan Levy, ex-president of the United Synagogue. Scholarship and intellect Dayan Fisher was an intellectually brilliant figure, possessing a photographic memory and an encyclopaedic knowledge of the Talmud and other Rabbinic texts. He knew the 7000 pages of the Talmud by heart, word for word, and could provide the page, line and exact wording for any Talmudic reference instantly. He was also an inspiring orator, erudite, humorous, thought provoking and possessing great wit. In later life, Dayan Fisher remarked that in retrospect, he was not 'cut out' for the Rabbinate, but rather as a teacher, scholar and educator. He liked nothing better than teaching and learning Talmud. In a eulogy, Dayan Fisher was described by Dayan Lichtenstein, current head of the Federation Beth Dinhttps://www.federation.org.uk/beis-din/, as a great Talmudic scholar. \\"He studied the Torah every time as if he were learning it for the first time... The Torah not only brought him his great status but also gave him his youthfulness\\". Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks said in tribute, \\"Dayan Michoel Fisher was one of the great links between Anglo-Jewry and the world of Lithuanian Jewish piety\\". Dayan Fisher published Ateres Mordechai, a commentary to Pirkei Avos in London in 1953.

Ober, proprietor, 1871 Louis Ober was born in 1837 in the French department of Alsace. At age fourteen Ober moved to New York, working as a barber, book seller and importing and exporting goods between the United States and France. Ober lived and worked in New Jersey, Cincinnati, and Philadelphia, before settling in Boston. Ober was employed at the restaurant then owned and operated by Blanc. While in Blanc's employ, Ober became familiar with French food, fine wine and furnishings. By 1875, Ober had acquired ownership and applied to the city for expansion of the restaurant to 3-4 Winter Place. Financing was provided by Eben Jordan, a co-founder of the Jordan Marsh Company. The restaurant reopened as Ober's Restaurant Parisien. Over the next 20 years the restaurant was expanded and became furnished with increasingly luxurious imported materials typical of the Gilded Age, including Honduran mahogany, French furniture, Italian and French sculpture and paintings, English silver and Bohemian crystal lighting. Until 1970 the restaurant was open to males only. By the late twentieth century, Locke-Ober - though still possessing most of its original grand trappings - had lost much of its popularity.Locke-Ober owner David Ray explains his decision to close Boston restaurateur Lydia Shire, with investor Paul Licari, leased the space in 2001 and began a painstaking restoration of the main and private dining rooms on the third floor, adding two more contemporary rooms. Jacky Robert was executive chef until 2003. Nonetheless, the restaurant closed in 2012, with reports that the owners planned to sell the building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The location is now occupied by Yvonne's. The restaurant was the setting of the opening scene in Robert B.

The detective, Kate Fansler, is taken there by the lawyer, John Cunningham, at which she presents to him her solution to the mystery. Cunningham claims Fansler only likes the restaurant because it used not to admit women; she denies this, saying she is attracted by the creamed spinach and the waiters who tended to be 'deaf and placating'. It was also the restaurant that Professor Lambeau took Robin Williams' character, Sean, to in an attempt to convince him to work with the main protagonist in Good Will Hunting.

By this point of the story, the future reincarnations Aor Teek and Nip Fung are no longer relevant to the story, and were written out before the first issue of this second story arc. =Part III= Deals with a time skip hundreds of years into the future, where cyborgs and clones are the main attractions of the story.

Biography  Edward Levy-Lawson was born Edward Levy, in London, on 28 December 1833, the son of Joseph Moses Levy and his wife Esther (n√©e Cohen). In December 1875 his name was legally changed to Levy-Lawson. He was educated at University College School in Hampstead, London. His father had acquired the Daily Telegraph ‚Äì known as The Daily Telegraph and Courier ‚Äì in 1855, only months after its founding. Levy- Lawson was editor and in control of the paper long before his father's death in 1888. From 1885, he was managing proprietor and sole controller of his renamed Daily Telegraph and became even more influential than his father on Fleet Street. In 1875, he assumed by royal licence the surname of Lawson in addition to and after that of Levy. He bought the Hall Barn estate in 1880. He was created a Baronet, of Hall Barn in the County of Buckingham, in 1892, and in 1903 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Burnham, of Hall Barn in the Parish of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham. In 1886, he was appointed High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire. Personal life Levy-Lawson's family was Jewish. He married Harriette Georgiana Webster, daughter of Benjamin Nottingham Webster, at Parish Church, Kennington, Kent, in 1862. They had three children together, Harry (later Viscount Burnham), William and Edith. Lady Burnham died in 1897. Since being given lordship, Lord Burnham's love of pheasant shooting resulted in him enjoying a close relationship with King Edward VII, his son, King George V, and his son King Edward VIII, with King George paying yearly visits to him at his home, the 4,000 acre estate Hall Barn.Rose, Kenneth (1983), King George V, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson pp. 39‚Äì40 On 18 December 1913, it was recorded by the Prince of Wales himself ‚Äì later King Edward VIII ‚Äì that he and his father King George had \\"shot over a thousand pheasants in six hours ‚Äì about one bird every 20 seconds\\". Altogether, 3,937 pheasants were killed.

RET loss of function mutations are associated with the development of Hirschsprung's disease, while gain of function mutations are associated with the development of various types of human cancer, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasias type 2A and 2B, pheochromocytoma and parathyroid hyperplasia. Structure RET is an abbreviation for \\"rearranged during transfection\\", as the DNA sequence of this gene was originally found to be rearranged within a 3T3 fibroblast cell line following its transfection with DNA taken from human lymphoma cells. The human gene RET is localized to chromosome 10 (10q11.2) and contains 21 exons. The natural alternative splicing of the RET gene results in the production of 3 different isoforms of the protein RET. RET51, RET43 and RET9 contain 51, 43 and 9 amino acids in their C-terminal tail respectively. The biological roles of isoforms RET51 and RET9 are the most well studied in-vivo as these are the most common isoforms in which RET occurs. Common to each isoform is a domain structure. Each protein is divided into three domains: an N-terminal extracellular domain with four cadherin-like repeats and a cysteine-rich region, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, which is split by an insertion of 27 amino acids. Within the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, there are 16 tyrosines (Tyrs) in RET9 and 18 in RET51. Tyr1090 and Tyr1096 are present only in the RET51 isoform. The extracellular domain of RET contains nine N-glycosylation sites. The fully glycosylated RET protein is reported to have a molecular weight of 170 kDa although it is not clear to which isoform this molecular weight relates. Kinase activation RET is the receptor for GDNF-family ligands (GFLs). In order to activate RET, GFLs first need to form a complex with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored co-receptor. The co-receptors themselves are classified as members of the GDNF receptor-Œ± (GFRŒ±) protein family. Different members of the GFRŒ± family (GFRŒ±1, GFRŒ±2, GFRŒ±3, GFRŒ±4) exhibit a specific binding activity for a specific GFLs. Upon GFL-GFRŒ± complex formation, the complex then brings together two molecules of RET, triggering trans-autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the tyrosine kinase domain of each RET molecule. Tyr900 and Tyr905 within the activation loop (A-loop) of the kinase domain have been shown to be autophosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation of Tyr905 stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase, which, in turn, results in the autophosphorylation of other tyrosine residues mainly located in the C-terminal tail region of the molecule. crystal structure 2IVT400px The structure shown to the left was taken from the protein data bank code 2IVT. The structure is that of a dimer formed between two protein molecules each spanning amino acids 703-1012 of the RET molecule, covering RETs intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. One protein molecule, molecule A is shown in yellow and the other, molecule B in grey. The activation loop is coloured purple and selected tyrosine residues in green. Part of the activation loop from molecule B is absent. Phosphorylation of Tyr981 and the additional tyrosines Tyr1015, Tyr1062 and Tyr1096, not covered by the above structure, have been shown to be important to the initiation of intracellular signal transduction processes. Role of RET signalling during development Mice deficient in GDNF, GFRŒ±1 or the RET protein itself exhibit severe defects in kidney and enteric nervous system development. This implicates RET signal transduction as key to the development of normal kidneys and the enteric nervous system. Clinical relevance Activating point mutations in RET can give rise to the hereditary cancer syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). There are three subtypes based on clinical presentation: MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). There is a high degree of correlation between the position of the point mutation and the phenotype of the disease. Chromosomal rearrangements that generate a fusion gene, resulting in the juxtaposition of the C-terminal region of the RET protein with an N-terminal portion of another protein, can also lead to constitutive activation of the RET kinase. These types of rearrangements are primarily associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) where they represent 10-20% of cases, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) where they represent 2% of cases. Several fusion partners have been described in the literature, and the most common ones across both cancer types include KIF5B, CCDC6 and NCOA4. While older multikinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib or vandetanib showed modest efficacy in targeting RET-driven malignancies, newer selective inhibitors (such as selpercatinib and pralsetinib) have shown significant activity in both mutations and fusions. The results of the LIBRETTO-001 trial studying selpercatinib showed a progression-free survival of 17.5 months in previously treated RET-positive NSCLC, and 22 months for RET-positive thyroid cancers, which prompted an FDA approval for both these indications in May 2020. Several other selective RET inhibitors are under development, including TPX-0046, a macrocyclic inhibitor of RET and Src intended to inhibit mutations providing resistance to current inhibitors. Disease database The RET gene variant database at the University of Utah, identifies (as of November 2014) 166 mutations that are implicated in MEN2.

Character creation Actress Lesley Crawford was part of the first Hollyoaks: On the Pull campaign to find new young actors and actresses to appear in the show. Crawford originally auditioned in Belfast, she was put through to the final round at the Liverpool auditions where she won the role. The other three chosen were Marcus Patric, Andrew Somerville and Elize du Toit. She had three months in which to prepare for filming. In 2002, Lesley quit the series to pursue her lifelong ambition of becoming a midwife. Character development Laura was often shown on-screen doing outlandish things such as stealing and having no guilty conscience afterwards. Laura also had psychotic tendencies, of which Crawford theorized: \\"I think she's been alone for a lot of her life and she's scared of that. I play it as if there's a mental disorder there.\\" Storylines Laura arrived in Tony Hutchinson‚Äôs (Nick Pickard) student house and soon found herself fending off Tony‚Äôs advances. Laura struggled to finance her first year of college, reaching such desperate measures that she stole the cloakroom money from The Loft. She soon had a fit of conscience and owned up to what she had done. Laura then became friends with Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn), but then she began to develop an unhealthy obsession with Mandy‚Äôs life, which reached its peak when she started dating Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy). After the relationship fizzled out, Laura continued to drive a wedge between Mandy and Luke, and seemed to enjoy the problems Mandy had when Mandy's brother Lewis Richardson (Ben Hull) committed suicide. After Mandy and her mother Helen became estranged, Laura filled the gap and enjoyed being part of the Cunningham family. As Laura continued to control Mandy, Laura's brother Brendan arrived in the village and started calling her Kerry, but Laura refused to recognise him. Laura wanted to get away from Hollyoaks and decided to go Cape Town and take Mandy with her. However, when Mandy felt suspicious and rejected Laura, Laura reacted by hitting her on the head with a glass bottle. Laura continued to taunt Mandy as she locked Mandy and herself in Mandy‚Äôs flat until Tony arrived with Becca Hayton (Ali Bastian), Max Cunningham (Matt Littler), Adam Morgan (David Brown), and Brendan to rescue Mandy and get some help for Laura. It turned out that Laura‚Äôs real name was Kerry, and Laura was taken from her best friend‚Äôs name who had died at the age of 11. Kerry was still recovering from that, and since then, Kerry found Mandy as a replacement to Laura and had more feeling for Mandy than a friend and had tried to keep Mandy to herself.

The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment. Etymology The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of submersion applied to representation, fiction or simulation. Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a \\"visitor\\" (Maurice Benayoun) or \\"immersant\\" (Char Davies)'s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment; used for describing partial or complete suspension of disbelief, enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.  Types  According to Ernest W. Adams, immersion can be separated into three main categories: * Tactical immersion: Tactical immersion is experienced when performing tactile operations that involve skill. Players feel \\"in the zone\\" while perfecting actions that result in success. * Strategic immersion: Strategic immersion is more cerebral, and is associated with mental challenge. Chess players experience strategic immersion when choosing a correct solution among a broad array of possibilities. * Narrative immersion: Narrative immersion occurs when players become invested in a story, and is similar to what is experienced while reading a book or watching a movie. Staffan Bj√∂rk and Jussi Holopainen, in Patterns In Game Design, divide immersion into similar categories, but call them sensory-motoric immersion, cognitive immersion and emotional immersion, respectively. In addition to these, they add a new category: spatial immersion, which occurs when a player feels the simulated world is perceptually convincing. The player feels that he or she is really \\"there\\" and that a simulated world looks and feels \\"real\\".  Presence  10.000 moving cities, Marc Lee, Telepresence-Based Installation Presence, a term derived from the shortening of the original \\"telepresence\\", is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology. It is defined as a person's subjective sensation of being there in a scene depicted by a medium, usually virtual in nature. Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high-fidelity virtual environment; however, the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well. It is the subjective perception, although generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence. Virtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world, a form of spatial immersion called Presence. According to Oculus VR, the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low-latency and precise tracking of movements. Michael Abrash gave a talk on VR at Steam Dev Days in 2014.Abrash M. (2014). What VR could, should, and almost certainly will be within two years According to the VR research team at Valve, all of the following are needed to establish presence. * A wide field of view (80 degrees or better) * Adequate resolution (1080p or better) * Low pixel persistence (3 ms or less) * A high enough refresh rate (>60 Hz, 95 Hz is enough but less may be adequate) * Global display where all pixels are illuminated simultaneously (rolling display may work with eye tracking.) * Optics (at most two lenses per eye with trade-offs, ideal optics not practical using current technology) * Optical calibration * Rock-solid tracking ‚Äì translation with millimeter accuracy or better, orientation with quarter degree accuracy or better, and volume of 1.5 meter or more on a side * Low latency (20 ms motion to last photon, 25 ms may be good enough)  Immersive virtual reality  A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) system Immersive virtual reality is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as virtual reality art projects, for the most part.Joseph Nechvatal, Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing. 2009, pp. 367-368 It consists of immersion in an artificial environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in everyday life. = Direct interaction of the nervous system = The most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the virtual reality in the nervous system directly. In functionalism/conventional biology we interact with everyday life through the nervous system. Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses. It gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation. It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated nerve impulses, the system would receive the CNS outputs (natural nerve impulses) and process them allowing the user to interact with the virtual reality. Natural impulses between the body and central nervous system would need to be prevented. This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring, whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world, which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain. A feedback system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed. Considering how much information would be required for such a system, it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology. = Requirements = ;Understanding of the nervous system A comprehensive understanding of which nerve impulses correspond to which sensations, and which motor impulses correspond to which muscle contractions will be required. This will allow the correct sensations in the user, and actions in the virtual reality to occur. The Blue Brain Project is the current, most promising research with the idea of understanding how the brain works by building very large scale computer models. ;Ability to manipulate CNS The central nervous system would obviously need to be manipulated. Whilst non-invasive devices using radiation have been postulated, invasive cybernetic implants are likely to become available sooner and be more accurate. Molecular nanotechnology is likely to provide the degree of precision required and could allow the implant to be built inside the body rather than be inserted by an operation. ;Computer hardware/software to process inputs/outputs A very powerful computer would be necessary for processing virtual reality complex enough to be nearly indistinguishable from everyday life and interacting with central nervous system fast enough.  Immersive digital environments  Cosmopolis (2005), Maurice Benayoun's Giant Virtual Reality Interactive Installation An immersive digital environment is an artificial, interactive, computer-created scene or \\"world\\" within which a user can immerse themselves.Joseph Nechvatal, Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing. 2009, pp. 48-60 Immersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with virtual reality, but without the implication that actual \\"reality\\" is being simulated. An immersive digital environment could be a model of reality, but it could also be a complete fantasy user interface or abstraction, as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it. The definition of immersion is wide and variable, but here it is assumed to mean simply that the user feels like they are part of the simulated \\"universe\\". The success with which an immersive digital environment can actually immerse the user is dependent on many factors such as believable 3D computer graphics, surround sound, interactive user- input and other factors such as simplicity, functionality and potential for enjoyment. New technologies are currently under development which claim to bring realistic environmental effects to the players' environment ‚Äì effects like wind, seat vibration and ambient lighting. = Perception = To create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) must perceive the digital environment to be physically real. Immersive technology can perceptually fool the senses through: * Panoramic 3D displays (visual) * Surround sound acoustics (auditory) * Haptics and force feedback (tactile) * Smell replication (olfactory) * Taste replication (gustation) = Interaction = Once the senses reach a sufficient belief that the digital environment is real (it is interaction and involvement which can never be real), the user must then be able to interact with the environment in a natural, intuitive manner. Various immersive technologies such as gestural controls, motion tracking, and computer vision respond to the user's actions and movements. Brain control interfaces (BCI) respond to the user's brainwave activity. = Examples and applications = Training and rehearsal simulations run the gamut from part task procedural training (often buttonology, for example: which button do you push to deploy a refueling boom) through situational simulation (such as crisis response or convoy driver training) to full motion simulations which train pilots or soldiers and law enforcement in scenarios that are too dangerous to train in actual equipment using live ordinance. Video games from simple arcade to massively multiplayer online game and training programs such as flight and driving simulators. Entertainment environments such as motion simulators that immerse the riders/players in a virtual digital environment enhanced by motion, visual and aural cues. Reality simulators, such as one of the Virunga Mountains in Rwanda that takes you on a trip through the jungle to meet a tribe of mountain gorillas.pulseworks.com Or training versions such as one which simulates taking a ride through human arteries and the heart to witness the buildup of plaque and thus learn about cholesterol and health. In parallel with scientist, artists like Knowbotic Research, Donna Cox, Rebecca Allen, Robbie Cooper, Maurice Benayoun, Char Davies, and Jeffrey Shaw use the potential of immersive virtual reality to create physiologic or symbolic experiences and situations. Other examples of immersion technology include physical environment / immersive space with surrounding digital projections and sound such as the CAVE, and the use of virtual reality headsets for viewing movies, with head-tracking and computer control of the image presented, so that the viewer appears to be inside the scene. The next generation is VIRTSIM, which achieves total immersion through motion capture and wireless head mounted displays for teams of up to thirteen immersants enabling natural movement through space and interaction in both the virtual and physical space simultaneously.  Use in medical care  New fields of studies linked to immersive virtual reality emerge every day. Researchers see a great potential in virtual reality tests serving as complementary interview methods in psychiatric care. Immersive virtual reality have in studies also been used as an educational tool in which the visualization of psychotic states have been used to get increased understanding of patients with similar symptoms.http://www.life-slc.org/docs/Bailenson_etal-immersiveVR.pdf New treatment methods are available for schizophrenia and other newly developed research areas where immersive virtual reality is expected to achieve melioration is in education of surgical procedures, rehabilitation program from injuries and surgeries and reduction of phantom limb pain.  Applications in the built environment  In the domain of architectural design and building science, immersive virtual environments are adopted to facilitate architects and building engineers to enhance the design process through assimilating their sense of scale, depth, and spatial awareness. Such platforms integrate the use of virtual reality models and mixed reality technologies in various functions of building science research, construction operations, personnel training, end-user surveys, performance simulations and building information modeling visualization. Head-mounted displays (with both 3 degrees of freedom and 6 degrees of freedom systems) and CAVE platforms are used for spatial visualization and building information modeling (BIM) navigations for different design and evaluation purposes. Clients, architects and building owners use derived applications from game engines to navigate 1:1 scale BIM models, allowing a virtual walkthrough experience of future buildings. For such use cases, the performance improvement of space navigation between virtual reality headsets and 2D desktop screens has been investigated in various studies, with some suggesting significant improvement in virtual reality headsets while others indicate no significant difference. Architects and building engineers can also use immersive design tools to model various building elements in virtual reality CAD interfaces, and apply property modifications to building information modeling (BIM) files through such environments. In the building construction phase, immersive environments are used to improve site preparations, on site communication and collaboration of team members, safety and logistics. For training of construction workers, virtual environments have shown to be highly effective in skill transfer with studies showing similar performance results to training in real environments. Moreover, virtual platforms are also used in the operation phase of buildings to interact and visualize data with Internet of Things (IoT) devices available in buildings, process improvement and also resource management. Occupant and end-user studies are performed through immersive environments. Virtual immersive platforms engage future occupants in the building design process by providing a sense of presence to users with integrating pre-construction mock- ups and BIM models for the evaluation of alternative design options in the building model in a timely and cost efficient manner. Studies conducting human experiments have shown users perform similarly in daily office activities (object identification, reading speed and comprehension) within immersive virtual environments and benchmarked physical environments. In the field of lighting, virtual reality headsets have been used investigate the influence of fa√ßade patterns on the perceptual impressions and satisfaction of a simulated daylit space. Moreover, artificial lighting studies have implemented immersive virtual environments to evaluate end-users lighting preferences of simulated virtual scenes with the controlling of the blinds and artificial lights in the virtual environment. For structural engineering and analysis, immersive environments enable the user to focus on structural investigations without getting too distracted to operate and navigate the simulation tool. Virtual and augmented reality applications have been designed for finite element analysis of shell structures. Using stylus and data gloves as input devices, the user can create, modify mesh, and specify boundary conditions. For a simple geometry, real-time color-coded results are obtained by changing loads on the model. Studies have used artificial neural networks (ANN) or approximation methods to achieve real-time interaction for the complex geometry, and to simulate its impact via haptic gloves. Large scale structures and bridge simulation have also been achieved in immersive virtual environments. The user can move the loads acting on the bridge, and finite element analysis results are updated immediately using an approximate module.  Detrimental effects  Simulation sickness, or simulator sickness, is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games (Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness). Motion sickness due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films. In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are three-dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.So, R.H.Y. and Lo, W.T.

It first took place on June 17, 1999. It was created by a consortium of Downtown Indianapolis hospitality, civic and business interests as a way to spotlight Indianapolis' rich jazz heritage through an annual event. The hope was to have a tourist weekend event that was arts-related, as opposed to the many sporting events held each year in Indianapolis, the Indianapolis 500, the Brickyard 400 as well the occasional NCAA championship or Super Bowl. A planning committee was formed by these business interests, which brought on an event planning company and a full-time director of booking and operations to plan and manage the event. It was determined that the event would be a multi-day, multi-venue festival, culminating in a multi-stage outdoor event called the Bank One Jazz & Roots Fair at White River State Park in Downtown Indianapolis. A $2 million budget was used to stage the event, which included artists such as B.B. King, Isaac Hayes, Chaka Khan, Sonny Rollins, Los Lobos, Robert Cray, Branford Marsalis, George Benson, Chris Isaak and Freddie Hubbard. A spotlight on local jazz legends was called Indiana Avenue Revisited, including Slide Hampton, David Baker, Buddy Montgomery and Jimmy Coe. The second festival included performances by Al Green, Ray Charles, Dave Brubeck, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, Jonny Lang, Shemekia Copeland, The Yellowjackets, Cassandra Wilson, and B√©la Fleck and the Flecktones. The festival did have to cancel the first night due to an unseasonable downpour, and heavy rains off and on throughout the weekend caused a $750,000 budget shortfall and the organization accumulated a large amount of debt as a result. Afterward the consortium continued to manage the festival for a few years until the American Pianists Association took over operations in the early 2000s. Again, after several years, the American Pianists Association stopped running the festival and the naming rights were bought by J. Allan Hall and Rob Dixon (who are also both involved in the Indianapolis record label Owl Studios) and David Allee, owner of the Jazz Kitchen. The new ownership decided to reinvent the Indy Jazz Fest as a non- profit organization and began formulating and implementing educational outreach initiatives throughout Indianapolis Public Schools. Children from all walks of life have been exposed to jazz and other musical genres because of Indy Jazz Fest's work in the community. The Jazz Fest was traditionally held on Father's Day weekend, but starting in 2009, the Festival moved to the last week of September.

A subdistrict of the Uptown/Carrollton area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Palmetto Street to the north, Cambronne, Edinburgh, Forshey, Fig and Leonidas Streets to the east, Earhart Boulevard to the south and the Jefferson Parish boundary to the west. Conrad playground, the Cuccia-Byrnes playground and Larry Gilbert baseball stadium are located in Hollygrove. The Hollygrove Market and Farm is also located in Hollygrove. Notable people, including rapper Lil Wayne, have grown up in the neighborhood. History Hollygrove was once a piece of the McCarty plantation, grew out of the town of Carrollton, a suburb outside of New Orleans. Before the 1920s, when development began, Hollygrove was a low- lying swamp land, essentially untouched and unoccupied. Drainage systems installed in the 1920s allowed for housing to be built, although these systems never proved effective. In the 1960s, drainage methods were reworked to be more reliable, allowing for more housing to be developed. Even before effective drainage was implemented, Hollygrove grew drastically, the effects of which are still visible today. The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center that, pre-Katrina, nearly fifty percent of Hollygrove‚Äôs houses were built before 1949. Similarly, before Katrina, over half of the homes in Hollygrove were owner-occupied. When Hurricane Katrina breached the levees of New Orleans, Hollygrove began to flood, taking in water. Persevering, Hollygrove‚Äôs community has returned with great strength ‚Äì the Louisiana State University survey on contractor fraud reported that Hollygrove/Gert Town‚Äôs recovery of residence was high; on a scale from 1 (lowest recovery of residence) to 11 (highest), Hollygrove and Gert Town were placed at a 9. The neighborhood is home to generations of families, creating a strong sense of place and community. Rebuilding Together is proud to partner with the Trinity Christian Community, based in Hollygrove, in order to build a relationship with the neighborhood and facilitate its growth. Geography Hollygrove is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of , of which is land and (0.0%) of which is water. =Adjacent neighborhoods= * Lakewood (north) * Dixon (northeast) =Boundaries= The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center defines the boundaries of Hollygrove as highway I-10 to the north, Carrollton Avenue to the east, South Claiborne Avenue to the south, and Monticello Avenue to the west. The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of Hollygrove as these streets: Palmetto Street, Cambronne Street, Edinburgh Street, Forshey Street, Fig Street Leonidas Street, South Claiborne Avenue and the Monticello Canal. The Neighborhood defines its boundaries as S. Carrolltonn, S. Claiborne, Monticello (@the canal, Orleans/Jefferson Parish line) and Airline Highway. Earhart Blvd. runs through the neighborhood. Crime Since the 1970s Hollygrove has been associated with drug dealers and has been known to have a very high homicide rate. Shortly after Crack Cocaine hit the streets, NOPD waged war with drug dealers that dominated Hollygrove and the Gert Town area. By the 1980s and 1990s, gunfire was a constant fact of Hollygrove life. The overall crime rate in Hollygrove is 136% higher than the national average. For every 100,000 people, there are 19.15 daily crimes that occur in Hollygrove. The number of total year over year crimes in New Orleans has increased by 12%. In 2017 NOPD installed ten security surveillance cameras throughout the neighborhood to prevent crime. Residents say they feel a little safer after the new security cameras are installed.

CD4+ T cells (mature T-helper cells) play an important role in modulating immune responses to pathogens and tumor cells, and are important in orchestrating overall immune responses. Immunosurveillance and immunoediting This discovery furthered the development of a previously hypothesized theory, the immunosurveillance theory. The immunosurveillance theory suggests that the immune system routinely patrols the cells of the body, and, upon recognition of a cell, or group of cells, that has become cancerous, it will attempt to destroy them, thus preventing the growth of some tumors. (Burnet, 1970) More recent evidence has suggested that immunosurveillance is only part of a larger role the immune system plays in fighting cancer. Remodeling of this theory has led to the progression of the immunoediting theory, in which there are 3 phases, Elimination, Equilibrium and Escape. =Elimination phase= As mentioned, the elimination phase is synonymous with the classic immunosurveillance theory. In 2001, it was shown that mice deficient in RAG-2 (Recombinase Activator Gene 2) were far less capable of preventing MCA induced tumours than were wild type mice. (Shankaran et al., 2001, Bui and Schreiber, 2007) RAG proteins are necessary for the recombination events necessary to produce TCRs and Igs, and as such RAG-2 deficient mice are incapable of producing functional T, B or NK cells. RAG-2 deficient mice were chosen over other methods of inducting immunodeficiency (such as SCID mice) as an absence of these proteins does not affect DNA repair mechanisms, which becomes important when dealing with cancer, as DNA repair problems can lead to cancers themselves. This experiment provides clear evidence that the immune system does, in fact, play a role in eradication of tumor cells. Further knock out experiments showed important roles of Œ±Œ≤ T cells, Œ≥Œ¥ T cells and NK cells in tumour immunity (Girardi et al. 2001, Smyth et al., 2001) Another experiment involving IFN-Œ≥‚àí/‚àí (Interferon Œ≥) showed that these mice are more likely to develop certain types of cancers as well, and suggests a role of CD4+ T cells in tumor immunity, which produce large amounts of IFN-Œ≥ (Street et al., 2002) Perforin deficient mice were also shown to have a reduced ability to ward off MCA induced cancers, suggesting an important role of CD8+ T cells. (Street et al. 2001) Perforin is a protein produced by CD8+ T cells, which plays a central role in the cytotoxic killing mechanisms by providing entry of degradative granzymes into an infected cell. (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005) Finally, the innate immune system has also been associated with immunosurveillance (Dunn et al., 2004). =Equilibrium phase= The equilibrium phase of the immunoediting theory is characterized by the continued existence of the tumour, but little growth. Due to the extremely high rate of mutation of cancer cells, it is probable that many will escape the elimination phase, and progress into the equilibrium phase. There is currently little evidence to support the existence of an equilibrium phase, aside from the observation that cancers have been shown to lie dormant, i.e. to go into remission, in a person's body for years before re-emerging again in the final escape phase. It has been noted that tumors that persist in the equilibrium phase show reduced immunogenicity when compared to tumors which have been grown in immunodeficient mice (Shankaran et al., 2001) Three possible outcomes for tumors managing to evade the immune system, and reach the equilibrium phase have been proposed: 1) eventual elimination by the immune system 2) a prolonged or indefinite period of dormancy, or 3) progression into the final escape phase. =Escape phase= As the name implies, the escape phase is characterized by a reduced immunogenicity of the cancer cells, their subsequent evasion of the immune system and their ability to be clinically detected. A number of theories have been proposed to explain this phase of the theory. Cancer cells, through mutation, may actually have mutations in some of the proteins involved in antigen presentation, and as such, evade an immune response. (Dunn et al., 2004) Tumor cells may, through mutations, often begin producing large quantities of inhibitory cytokines IL-10, or transforming growth factor Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) (Khong and Restifo, 2002) thereby suppressing the immune system, allowing for large-scale proliferation (Salazar-Onfray et al., 2007). Also, it has been observed that some cancer patients exhibit higher than normal levels of CD4+/CD25+ T cells, a subset of T cells often called regulatory T cells, for their known immunosuppressive actions. These T cells produce high levels of IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤, thereby suppressing the immune system and allowing for evasion by the tumor (Shimizu et al., 1999). Tumour antigens Tumour antigens are those expressed by tumor cells, and recognizable as being different from self cells. Most currently classified tumor antigens are endogenously synthesized, and as such are presented on MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells. Such antigens include products of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, mutants of other cellular genes, products of genes that are normally silenced, over-expressed gene products, products of oncogenic viruses, oncofetal antigens (proteins normally expressed only during development of the fetus) glycolipids and glycoproteins. Detailed explanations of these tumor antigens can be found in Abbas and Lichtman, 2005. MHC class II restricted antigens currently remain somewhat obscure. Development of new techniques has been successful in identifying some of these antigens, however, additional research is required. (Wang, 2003) Antitumour immunity Historically, much more attention and funding has been devoted to the role of CD8+ T cells in antitumor immunity, rather than to CD4+ T cells. This can be attributed to a number of things; CD4+ T cells respond only to presentation of antigens by MHC class II, however, most cells express only MHC class I; second, CD8+ T cells, upon being presented with antigen by MHC class I, can directly kill the cancerous cell, through mechanisms which will not be discussed in this article, but which have been well categorized; (See Abbas and Lichtman, 2005) finally, there is simply a more widespread understanding and knowledge of MHC class I tumor antigens, while MHC class II antigens remain somewhat obscure.(Pardol and Toplain, 1998). It was believed that CD4+ T cells were not involved directly in antitumour immunity, but rather functioned simply in the priming of CD8+ T cells, through activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and increased antigen presentation on MHC class I, as well as secretion of excitatory cytokines such as IL-2 (Pardol and Toplain, 1998, Kalams and Walker, 1998, Wang 2001). Controversial role in antitumor immunity The role of CD4+ T cells in antitumor immunity is controversial. It was suggested that CD4+ T cells can have a direct role in antitumor immunity through direct recognition of tumor antigens presented on the surface of tumor cells in association with MHC class II molecules. Of note, results from recent reports suggest that direct recognition of tumors from tumor-antigen specific CD4+ T cells might not be always beneficial. For example, it was recently shown that CD4+ T cells primarily produce TNF after recognition of tumor-antigens in melanoma. TNF may in turn increase local immunosuppression and impair the effector functions of CD8 T cells (Donia M. et al., 2015).Donia M. et al., Cancer Res 2015 available at http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/75/18/3747 Th1 and Th2 CD4+T cells The same series of experiments, examining the role of CD4+ cells, showed that high levels of IL-4 and IFNŒ≥ were present at the site of the tumor, following vaccination, and subsequent tumour challenge. (Hung, 1998) IL-4 is the predominant cytokine produced by Th2 cells, while IFNŒ≥ is the predominant Th1 cytokine. Earlier work has shown that these two cytokines inhibit the production of each other by inhibiting differentiation down the opposite Th pathway, in normal microbial infections (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005), yet here they were seen at nearly equal levels. Even more interesting was the fact that both these cytokines were required for maximal tumor immunity, and that mice deficient in either showed greatly reduced antitumor immunity. IFN-Œ≥ null mice showed virtually no immunity, while IL-4 null mice showed a 50% reduction when compared to immunised wild type mice. The reduction of immunity in IL-4 deficient mice, has been attributed to a decrease in eosinophil production. In mice deficient in IL-5, the cytokine responsible for differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into eosinophils, less eosinophils are seen at the site of tumour challenge, which is to be expected. (Hung, 1998) These mice also show reduced antitumor immunity, suggesting that IL-4 deficient mice, which would produce less IL-5, and subsequently have reduced eosinophil levels, elicit their effect through eosinophils.  Th-1 activity in tumor immunity  Th1 cells are one of the two main Th cell polarizations first identified. Th1 differentiation is IL-12 dependent, and IFN-Œ≥ is the signature cytokine of cells of a Th1 lineage. Th1 cell anti-tumor activity is complex and includes many mechanisms. Th1 cells are indirectly responsible for activating tumor-suppressing CTLs by activating the antigen-presenting cells which then present antigen to and activate the CTL. IFN-Œ≥ produced by Th1 cells activates macrophages, increasing phagocytosis of pathogen and tumor cells. Activated macrophages produce IL-12, and since IL-12 promotes Th1 cell differentiation, this forms a tumor- suppressing feedback loop. Th1 and NK cells both contribute to killing of tumor cells via the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway. NK cells produce IFN-Œ≥ and are also activated by IL-12, creating another tumor- suppressing feedback loop.  Th-2 activity in tumor immunity  Th2 cells are the other Th cell polarization initially defined. Th2 differentiation is dependent on the presence of IL-4 and the absence of IL-12, and signature cytokines of Th2 cells include IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Th2 mediated anti-tumor activity primarily involves recruitment of eosinophils to the tumor environment via IL-4 and IL-13. Anti-tumor eosinophil activity includes attraction of tumor-specific CTLs, activation of macrophages, and vascularization of the tumor stroma. However, Th2 polarization as quantified by IL-5 production has been associated with tumor proliferation, complicating the role of Th2 cells in tumor immunity.  Th-17 activity in tumor immunity  Th17 are a recently identified subset of Th cells that are primarily involved in promoting inflammatory responses. Th17 differentiation is induced by TGF-Œ≤ and IL-6, and signature cytokines of Th17 cells include IL-17A and IL-17F. The mechanisms of Th17 cell activity in the tumor microenvironment are not well understood. Th17 cells can orchestrate chronic inflammatory responses, which tend to promote tumor growth and survival. In addition, some tumors have been shown to express high levels of IL-6 & TGF-Œ≤, which would reinforce a Th17 polarization, creating a tumor-promoting feedback loop. Th17 cells have also been found to have the capacity to differentiate into IFN-Œ≥ secreting cells, thus suppressing tumor growth via IFN-Œ≥-related pathways.  Treg activity in tumor immunity  Regulatory Th cells (Tregs) are another recently defined subset of Th cells. Their main functions involve maintaining self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. Treg differentiation is induced by expression of FoxP3 transcription factor, and Tregs secrete a variety of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-Œ≤. Tregs are detrimental to anti- tumor immune responses, as the secretion of TGF-Œ≤ and other suppressive cytokines dampens immunity from CTLs, Th cells and APCs. IFN-Œ≥ A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the role of IFN-Œ≥ in antitumor immunity. In conjuncture with TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factors), IFN-Œ≥ can have direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells (Franzen et al., 1986) Increased MHC expression, as a direct result of increased IFN-Œ≥ secretion, may result in increased presentation to T cells. (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005) It has also been shown to be involved in the expression of iNOS as well as ROIs. iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) is an enzyme responsible for the production of NO, an important molecule used by macrophages to kill infected cells. (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005) A decrease in the levels of iNOS, (as seen through immunohistochemical staining) has been observed in IFNŒ≥‚àí/‚àí mice although levels of macrophages at the site of tumor challenge are similar to wild type mice. INOS ‚àí/‚àí mice also show decreased immunity, indicating a direct role of CD4+-stimulated iNOS production in protection against tumours. (Hung et al., 1998) Similar results have been seen in knockout mice deficient in gp91phox, a protein involved in the production ROIs (Reactive Oxygen Intermediates) which are also an important weapon utilized by macrophages to elicit cell death. In 2000, Qin and Blankenstein, showed that IFNŒ≥ production was necessary for CD4+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. A series of experiments showed that it was essential for nonhematopoietic cells at the site of challenge, to express functional IFNŒ≥ receptors. Further experiments showed that IFN-Œ≥ was responsible for inhibition of tumor induced angiogenesis and could prevent tumor growth through this method. (Qin and Blankenstein, 2000) MHC class II and immunotherapy Many of the aforementioned mechanisms by which CD4+ cells play a role in tumor immunity are dependent on phagocytosis of tumors by APCs and subsequent presentation on MHC class II. It is rare that tumor cells will express sufficient MHC class II to directly activate a CD4+ T cell. As such, at least two approaches have been investigated to enhance the activation of CD4+ T cells. The simplest approach involves upregulation of adhesion molecules, thus extending the presentation of antigens by APC (reference?). (Chamuleau et al., 2006) A second approach involves increasing the expression of MHC class II in tumor cells. This technique has not been used in vivo, but rather involves injection of tumor cells which have been transfected to express MHC class II molecules, in addition to suppression of the invariant chain (Ii, see below) through antisense technology. (Qiu, 1999) Mice vaccinated with irradiated strains of these cells show a greater immune response to subsequent challenge by the same tumor, without the upregulation of MHC class II, then do mice vaccinated with irradiated, but otherwise unaltered tumor cells. These findings signify a promising area of future research in the development of cancer vaccines. MHC class I and class II pathways The down regulation of the invariant chain (Ii) becomes important when considering the two pathways by which antigens are presented by cells. Most recognized tumor antigens are endogenously produced, altered gene products of mutated cells. These antigens, however, are normally only presented by MHC class I molecules, to CD8+ T cells, and not expressed on the cell surface bound to MHC class II molecules, which is required for presentation to CD4+ T cells. Research has shown that the two pathways by which antigens are presented cross over in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, in which MHC class I, MHC class II and endogenously synthesized antigenic proteins are all present. These antigen proteins are prevented from binding to MHC class II molecules by a protein known as the invariant chain or Ii, which, in a normal cell, remains bound to the MHC class II molecule until leaving the ER. Down regulation of this Ii, using antisense technology, has yielded promising results in allowing MHC class I tumor antigens to be expressed on MHC class II molecules at the cell surface (Qui, 1999). Upregulation of MHC class II Due to the extremely polymorphic nature of MHC class II molecules, simple transfection of these proteins does not provide a practical method for use as a cancer vaccine. (Chamuleau et al., 2006) Alternately, two other methods have been examined to upregulate the expression of these proteins on MHC class II‚àí cells. The first is treatment with IFNŒ≥, which can lead to increased MHC class II expression. (Trincheiri and Perussia, 1985, Fransen L, 1986) A second, more effective approach involves targeting the genes responsible for the synthesis of these proteins, the CIITA or class II transcription activator. Selective gene targeting of CIITA has been used ex vivo to allow MHC class II‚àí cells to become MHC class II+ (Xu, et al. 2000). upregulation of CIITA also causes an increased expression of Ii, and as such, must be used in conjunction with the antisense techniques referred to earlier (Qui, 1999). In some forms of cancer, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the cells may already be MHC class II+, but because of mutation, express low levels on their surface. It is believed that low levels are seen as a direct result of methylation of the CIITA promoter genes (Morimoto et al., 2004, Chamuleau et al., 2006) and that demethylation of these promoters may restore MHC class II expression (Chamuleau et al., 2006).

In 1898 Democratic political czar Martin M. Lomasney hoped to capture a seat in the state's legislature, the General Court of Massachusetts. Lomasney held considerable power in the city for nearly 50 years. The story goes that the drink was created to honor his election, and the city's Ward 8 which historically delivered him a winning margin. In 1915 the Santa Clara Company registered \\"Ward 8\\" as a trademark with the United States Patent Office claiming use since November 1912 and published a notice that they would prosecute any infringement. During prohibition the Daily Boston Globe reported that the drink was believed to have originated at the \\"old\\" and abandoned Quincy House. Competing, but unfounded myths abound in print and on the Internet. One story reports that it originated in New York in an area known for political corruption, another that the cocktail is a traditional drink of the Scots Guards. Ingredients and preparation Notice from the Santa Clara Company. The Boston Globe, 1914. Like the story of its creation, there are several variations of the Ward 8 cocktail. Various recipes call for blended whiskey, bourbon, rye and even single malt scotch. Some recipes call for lemon juice, lime juice, no juice, grenadine, sour mix and gomme syrup. The Santa Clara Company trademark described their product as \\"Compounds of Whisky, Grenadine-Syrup, Rock-Candy Syrup, and Lime-Juice.\\" Following the end of prohibition, Locke-Ober reopened its bar using this recipe: *2 ounces rye whiskey *1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice *1/2 ounce fresh orange juice *1 teaspoon grenadine *Maraschino cherry (optional) Shake the rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice and grenadine with ice; then strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a maraschino cherry, if desired. Originally the drink was decorated with a small paper Massachusetts flag.

Park The park's are heavily wooded with coast redwoods, coast live oaks, and pines. Many of the trees were originally planted by Miller himself. The Oakland Hills location provides panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay area. The park features include miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails, an off-leash dog area, an amphitheater, and picnicking. Amphitheater Joaquin Miller Park contains the 2,000-seat Woodminster Amphitheater and Cascade, an outdoor amphitheater regularly used to stage both amateur and professional musicals and plays. For many years the Oakland Recreation Department put on popular productions of musical comedies there, three per summer, using mostly amateur performers. Starting in 1967, production of the summer musicals was taken over by the current management. The Cascade is the amphitheater's waterfall feature built in 1941 and dedicated to California writers, still with flowing water. It was designed by Howard Gilkey, who also designed the Cleveland Cascade at Lake Merritt (now dry).

The geometric Langlands correspondence relates algebraic geometry and representation theory. History In mathematics, the classical Langlands correspondence is a collection of results and conjectures relating number theory and representation theory. Formulated by Robert Langlands in the late 1960s, the Langlands correspondence is related to important conjectures in number theory such as the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture, which includes Fermat's last theorem as a special case.Frenkel 2007, p. 3 Establishing the Langlands correspondence in the number theoretic context has proven extremely difficult. As a result, some mathematicians have posed the geometric Langlands correspondence.

Chris Ekstedt started the band to have a resource to let out some nervous energy. The name \\"decepticans\\" was taken from a French slang for liars. \\"We changed the name because so many people wanted to not spell it correctly and I was tired of being related to the fucking TV cartoon, also the old name was when we were kids. One Way Down's more mature and I don't feel like an idiot with the name\\" - said Chris Ekstedt. They have shared the stage with bands such as L.A. Guns, Gilby Clarke, Taken, Snapcase, Stretch Armstrong and Social Distortion. Most recently they completed their first European tour with Wanker Records (the German Record Label) and Al Cheapo (punk band from Germany) Between 1998 and 2002 and under the guise of Decepticans, there was a drop off in activity from the band. Not a lot of interest lead to many changes in the band. Randomly, while doing work for Buddyhead Records, Paul Kostabi contacted Chris Ekstedt to see if there was a band that would fit on a \\"B Side\\" of a band he is working with, The Willowz. Mr. Kostabi fell in love with One Way Down's music and signed him to his label Artmonkey Records After enlisting the help of Producer Paul Kostabi (The Ramones, The Willowz, The Shewolves, Youth Gone Mad), One Way Down immediately began re-recording and re-mastering Decepticans album \\"No Holding Back\\" into what has become a popular CD called \\"Scheisse\\" with new cover tracks of \\"I Am A Patriot\\" by Steve Van Zandt, \\"Redemption Song\\" by Bob Marley and \\"Indifference\\" by Pearl Jam. Recorded in the Summer of 2005, One Way Down recorded four more tracks for a split CD with Al Cheapo for the European tour called \\"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik‚Äù.

Character names are listed in Western order, with the given names preceding the surnames.  Nadesico crewmembers  ; : : Born on Mars and orphaned after his parents died in an apparent military coup, Akito's dream to become a cook stemmed from the quality of the raw food available. Though he has a nanomachine controller enabling him to pilot machinery, he refused to become a military pilot; his first time in an Aestevalis, a humanoid combat robot, was an accident, though he quickly showed capable piloting skill. Due to the lack of pilots on the Nadesico, Akito was officially made one for the duration of the tour of duty. A fan of the anime Gekiganger, his devotion to the series is rekindled by fellow pilot Gai Daigoji. Akito is romantically adored by nearly all the girls aboard the Nadesico, especially the ship's captain Yurika Misumaru, who he later proposes to and marries. ; : : Yurika is the beautiful but ditzy captain of the Nadesico and childhood friend of Akito Tenkawa. Though he considers her crazy, Yurika has romantic feelings for him, and the two later get married. Yurika is shown to be very scatterbrained at times, misinterpreting comments made by others as words of inspiration and devotion, and forgetting or twisting events from her and Akito's childhood. Nonetheless, she is a very capable captain, and a constant source of cheerfulness and inspiration for the rest of the crew. ; : : The \\"Electronic Fairy\\", she keeps the ship's computer (Omoikane) running and slowly bonds with it, asking it numerous questions about society and human interaction. Ruri is depicted as the youngest member of staff on board the Nadesico, the space battleship that the series revolves around. Despite this, she is often portrayed as being more intelligent than the rest of crew, and seen as something of a \\"child prodigy\\". Ruri is often shown disparaging the inane antics of her older co-workers, usually by use of her catchphrase . According to her backstory, Ruri has a special affinity with computers due to genetic engineering, something that also affects her attitude towards others. She is occasionally referred to as \\"Ruriruri\\" by fellow bridge crewman Minato and Aestivalis pilot Hikaru. :According to Keiji Gotoh, the movie version of Ruri was the easiest character he ever designed, her concept \\"popping into his head right away\\". Dan Kanemitsu, the English translator for Martian Successor Nadesico, notes that Ruri's phrase of \\"baka bakka\\" was one of the hardest lines in the show to translate from its original Japanese form. The character of Ruri was unexpectedly a favourite, and became popular among fans as a depiction of the moe ideal. Because of Ruri's quiet, serious character and dead-pan expressions, she is often compared to Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Hiroki Azuma believes Ruri to be directly influenced by Rei.Azuma, Hiroki. (2009) Otaku: Japan's Database Animals. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press pp. 48-52 : Manga - Ruri is full captain of the Nadesico. She seems not much different but she is given almost all the attention rather than just half. The mirror copy of her is the same and acts completely the same along with the fact that she is also captain of her ship. Both Ruris seem to also have an internal problem and cough up blood when under extreme stress. ; Gai Daigoji : : Born Jiro Yamada (an average name, similar to John Doe or John Smith in English), he insisted that Gai Daigoji was \\"the name that belongs to (his) soul\\", and angrily asserted his \\"true\\" name whenever someone used the \\"other\\" one. A rabid Gekiganger otaku, he was an official pilot and arrived three days ahead of schedule when he learned they would be piloting actual robots like in the anime. Fueled by his devotion to the show, Gai had a fierce intensity in and out of battle, and was angry and resentful towards Akito for being the first one to engage the enemy, stealing \\"(his) destiny\\", even though he had a broken leg and was unable to fight. The two were soon able to bond over Gekiganger, although Gai couldn't understand why Akito would rather be \\"a dumb cook\\" than a robot pilot. Although it was Gai's wish to die heroically in battle like one of the characters, he was unceremoniously shot and killed during an escape of prisoners held aboard the Nadesico; Akito took his death very hard, and devoted himself to Gai and the ideals of Gekiganger. In the Super Robot Wars series of video games, the player can save Gai by fulfilling certain conditions, and in Super Robot Wars W, he lives as part of the game's default story, to the point of even having a game exclusive timeskip transition for both him and his Aestevalis Custom so as to fit him into the Nadesico movie's plot. ; Megumi Reinard : : Megumi Reinard is a former voice actress who did work for anime and animated commercials. She is recruited by Nergal to be the communications officer aboard the Nadesico. Megumi has no love for war and killing in general. This is why she has a lot in common with Akito Tenkawa, who only wants to be a cook, not a pilot/soldier. She is also Yurika Misumaru's main competition for Akito's affection, though she is not really worried since the captain is oblivious to just about everything. Megumi is the first to officially be classified as Akito's girlfriend, beginning around episode 4. ; Jun Aoi : : The first officer of the Nadesico, Jun has no small infatuation for Yurika, leaving a position in the Earth's military to join her crew and \\"look out for her\\". She is clueless of how he feels and considers him her \\"best friend\\", though the rest of the crew realize his feelings. A common running gag is Jun's misunderstanding of Yurika's special efforts, such as preparing food--he believes it is for him, but it always ends up being for Akito, with him being passed by. He has crush on Yurika. ; Inez Fressange : : Developed the Nadesicos Phase Transition system for Nergal on Mars before it was invaded; when the ship returned to the planet, she came aboard, stating that the surviving colonists refused to leave, believing the ship would soon be destroyed; however, an attack immediately afterwards forced the grounded Nadesico to raise its shields, crushing the underground colonists and leaving her the only survivor. She hosts the \\"Naze Nani Nadesico\\" segment as a technical consultant along with Ruri and Yurika in an attempt to teach the crew about the ship's workings, as a way of atoning for what happened. Her name comes from real-life French model In√®s de La Fressange's name. ; Ryoko Subaru : : Aestivalis pilot and, she escaped from the L2 space colony when it was destroyed by the Jovians, salvaging four Aestevalis suits and fellow pilot Izumi Maki. The most fiery and combative of the three, but a surprise attack from the enemy left her terrified and crying out for help from Akito; this was noted and would be mercilessly brought up by Izumi and Hikaru many times, to her great embarrassment. Over time, she began to accept her feelings for Akito, but for the most part refrained from public displays of affection. ; Izumi Maki : : Aestivalis pilot, brought in a storage container from the L2 colony by Ryoko. Quiet and reserved, though an incurable punster, cracking up at her own jokes. In the later episodes she reveals she had two fiancees, both of whom died. One of disease, one of an accident. ; Hikaru Amano : : Aestivalis pilot and rabid Gekigangar III fangirl, she was ejected from the L2 colony in a capsule which crashed into the Nadesico; making her way through the air ducts, she was directly over Akito's room as he was watching a tragic episode of Gekiganger. Moved to tears, her wailing could be heard through the overhead vent, right before she fell out of it and onto him. She is a rabid Gekigangar III fan and one day wants to publish her own manga about the series with herself as the lead female, and two of the male leads in a sh≈çnen-ai relationship. During Martian Successor Nadesico: The Prince of Darkness it is shown that Hikaru becomes an actual manga artist, but is overstressed due to her profession. ; Nagare Akatsuki : : Nagare came into the picture after the Nadesico escaped from Mars; a skilled Aestivalis pilot, Nagare rescued Akito during battle as the latter was in a state of panic and unable to move. He was soon assigned to the Nadesico, bringing along Erina Won, who he had a mysterious relationship with. Nagare disparaged Akito for his devotion to the simplistic ideals of Gekiganger and the fact that he hates Japanese Anime altogether, but the two were still able to get along well enough. ; Minato Haruka : : The main helmswoman for the Nadesico. She gave up her job as the secretary for a large company's president so she could join the Nadesico crew. Her reason being that it sounded much more interesting. She has a mixed-up relationship with Goat Hoary. She helps Tsukomo and falls in love with him after a fight with Goat that ended their relationship. ; Erina Kinjo Won : : Erina joins the Nadesico at the same time as Nagare and proves to be just as irritating to the other characters. Her official post is co-helmswoman, but she ends up pushing orders onto everyone around and even the captain. She has a great fascination with Akito because of his boson jumping abilities and constantly confronts him to become an experiment guinea pig. In episode 22, she seems to cry when Akito leaves which may hint at her feelings for him also. ; Mr. Prospector : : Mr. Prospector's real name is never revealed, but he seems to not only be some sort of Nergal accountant, but the recruitment officer for the Nadesico. He is most known for agonizing over the loss of expensive equipment. ; Seiya Uribatake : : Ace mechanic Seiya joins the Nadesico to get away from his wife and child, at the same time chasing around various young women. Most noticeable among them is Hikaru, who he almost has a relationship with. ; Goat Hoary : : A serious man of few words, Goat seems to be the crew's guardian. He also has a relationship with Minato Haruka for a time. He is very big and very strong, capable of carrying Megumi and Ruri, one on each arm, and is a skilled marksman. ; Howmei : : Head chef on the Nadesico, Howmei is responsible for making sure everything gets cooked correctly, even if it involves teaching Akito about the variety of spices and flavourings available on Earth. Given the very nature of the Nadesicos mission... and the fact that some of them might not live to see another day, Howmei want to make sure that every meal the crew eats is as good as they want... because it may be their last meal. ; Howmei Girls : : A group of girls who are Howmei's main cooking crew. They are often seen together either cooking or singing. In the movie they went to work at an amusement park. They are Sayuri Terasaki, the tallest one who wears her black hair in a ponytail. Junko Mizuhara, she has short blue hair. Mikako Satou, the shortest one who wears her brunette hair in two low buns. Harumi Tanaka, she has red hair worn in two braids. Eri Uemura, she has brown hair tied in a ponytail. ; Itsuki Kazama : : Itsuki came on as a replacement pilot when Akito left the ship with Megumi during the Christmas return of the Nadesico to Earth. She is known as a great team player and an excellent pilot, but was killed in her first battle with the team. During production, she was unnamed, so she was referred to in- series as \\"Newbie\\" and \\"Seelie\\" (by Ryoko both times). She was originally named Sayuri Terasaki, but this name was retconned by her appearance as one of the lead characters in the Blank of Three Years video game. ; Aqua Crimson : : The rich daughter of the Crimson family, Aqua appears briefly for one episode, as an analogue to Aquamarine: a character from Gekiganger III. Much like her namesake, she initially appears as a caring, beautiful, and respectful teen, only to later be shown as somewhat of a psycho, wanting to die along with Akito. She believes that by doing so, she will escape from her rich and boring lifestyle, and become a tragic heroine. Aqua also seems to be a remarkable cook, though it is implied that she always includes in her food a powerful paralyzing drug, making this point somewhat moot.  Jovians  ; Tsukumo Shiratori : : Tsukumo is a commander of the Superior Jovian Male Forces and a mecha pilot. He is similar in appearance and personality to Gai Daigoji, and ultimately dies in the same way. In the video game Super Robot Wars W for the Nintendo DS, he survives his assassination after Gai, with whom he had developed a comrade-in-arms relationship with, took a bullet meant for him. During the six-month time period between the halves of the story, he marries Minato, ends up helping Kaname Chidori and her friends deal with the \\"Poniman\\" incident when things get far out of hand (in one version of the mission, he makes things worse, getting into a battle with Sousuke Sagara, another character voiced by Tomokazu), and participates in the events of the Prince of Darkness storyline. ; Yukina Shiratori : : Yukina is Tsukumo's younger sister, and is horrified to find out that her older brother has fallen in love with an earth woman (Minato). She promptly leaves for the Nadesico to assassinate the woman in question, but after meeting her, she realizes Minato is a very nice woman and understands why her brother fell in love with her. When her brother is murdered, Minato becomes her only family. Within the next few years, Minato becomes like a mother to Yukina.

From about the middle of the seventh century all controversy between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date of Easter ceased, as both churches were now using identical tables.

Bede‚Äôs Easter cycle contains lunar cycles (of 19 years) as well as solar cycles (of 28 years), and therefore it has a period of 532 years.

He was born in Washington D.C. and graduated from Hopkins School and Phillips Academy, Andover, where he studied under Alexander Theroux before attending Stanford University, where he was the editor of the Stanford Chaparral and wrote his first novel, Platitudes in a creative writing class taught by Gilbert Sorrentino. He is an associate professor in the Graduate School of the Arts at Columbia University. Novels and memoirs His first novel, Platitudes, was published in 1988 and reissued by Northeastern University Press in 2003, along with his 1989 essay \\"The New Black Aesthetic\\". Platitudes follows the story of Earle, a black, private high-school student in New York City. The novel itself wrestles with many concepts outlines in \\"The New Black Aesthetic,\\" namely the existence of the cultural mulatto. Earle, as a second generation middle-class, black nerd, embodies this identity‚Äîon his visit to Harlem he feels entirely out of place. Alongside this narrative is the story of Dorothy, a black, private high-school student who does live in Harlem and yet can navigate easily in her largely white social circles. The novel makes extensive use of structure. Largely a metafictional work, Ellis moves between a more post-modern, deconstructed style and a more traditional, black female style through the voices of fictional authors Wellington and Ishee Ayam. Ellis' exaggerated representations of each style is humorous, essentially complicating the hegemonic artistic voice of the Black Arts Movement. As a black nerd, Earle complicates traditional ideas of black masculinity. He occupies a place as an intellectual outsider, excluded from the mainstream, and yet the nerd identity is hyper-white. This idea of how blackness can be diverse and differ from typical ideas blackness accurately depict what the NBA is trying to say. He is also the author of the novels Home Repairs (1993) and Right Here, Right Now (1999), which received an American Book Award. His latest book is Bedtime Stories: Adventures in the Land of Single-Fatherhood (2008), a memoir of his life as a single father of two. Film His work for the screen includes the Peabody Award-winning and Emmy- nominated The Tuskegee Airmen, and Good Fences, starring Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg, which was shortlisted for the PEN award for Best Teleplay of the year, and was nominated for a Black Reel award. In 1994, he co-wrote The Inkwell under the pen name Tom Ricostronza. Essays His essays have appeared in The New York Times, Playboy, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and GQ, among other places. He is a regular blogger on The Huffington Post and lives in Manhattan, where he is an associate professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Film. Plays His work for the theater includes the plays Fly and Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing and most recently Holy Mackerel. \\"Holy Mackerel\\" by Trey Ellis had its first live staged reading in 2016. The play follows the evolution of The Amos ‚ÄòN' Andy Show which ran from the late 1920s to the late 1950s and was a household favorite. Before it became a television show, it was America‚Äôs most listened to radio show. During the time, it was voiced by white actors, and many people criticized the show for the way it was ‚Äúvilified as modern-day Uncle Toms for wanting the same opportunities for success that their white counterparts took for granted.‚Äù However Amos ‚Äòn Andy also ‚Äúintroduc[ed] America to a range of black people who included doctors and lawyers, and depicted the black family at a time when no one else was doing so.‚Äù When the show transitioned to television, they hired black actors. While it continued to disappoint some viewers, many people (black and white) tuned in every week to watch the show. But after only 2 seasons, the show was cancelled due to boycotting led by Walter White, head of the NAACP. In 2016, Trey Ellis, author of ‚ÄúThe New Black Aesthetic‚Äù, staged a reading of his new play, \\"Holy Mackerel\\" which follows the rise and fall of The Amos 'N‚Äô Andy Show. In Ellis‚Äô own words, \\"When I discovered that everything I thought I knew about Amos 'N' Andy was wrong, that it was one of TV's first ever sitcoms and the all-black cast were some of the most brilliant comedians to ever walk the earth, I knew I had to bring their story back to life,‚Äù said Ellis. ‚Äú'Holy Mackerel!', the phrase the show invented, is a comedy about the tragedy of what happened to them.‚Äù In this way, Ellis is, himself, exemplifying notions of the New Black Aesthetic or the constant redefining of blackness both as it stands today as well as re- examining old works through new lenses. The New Black Aesthetic Ellis is also known for the small piece he wrote titled \\"New Black Aesthetic\\" (NBA) which describes the change in the overall image of \\"blackness\\" that has emerged in our society in the past few decades. In this essay, Ellis argues that there is a more broad way to characterize middle class blacks today, and with this new characterization comes a new aesthetic movement. The NBA represents, in Ellis' mind, a new stage in cultural interaction for black Americans. He does not deny that there are many aspects of American society that still work against the interests of black Americans, but the emergence of the NBA opens up an aesthetic realm that was, until recently, closed to blacks in America. It signals an opening of socially acceptable aesthetic possibilities for blacks beyond \\"Africa and jazz.\\" Now, for example, black students go to colleges to be art majors rather than always pursuing a law degree or going to medical school upon graduating because their parents have given them the means to do so. In this short piece, Ellis includes interviews from black filmmaker, Spike Lee, as well as the black band, Fishbone. He uses these as examples of thriving hybrids, or people who don‚Äôt leave behind their culture to be successful. Ellis' novel Platitudes takes advantage of the NBA in order to represent some of the new aesthetic possibilities available to blacks in America. He also talks about the concept of the \\"cultural mulatto,\\" or someone who can relate to multiple cultures the same way a multiracial person can relate to their different heritages. He refers to Whitney Houston and Lionel Richie as \\"neutered mutations\\" that chose to conform and commercialize their once soulful style just so they could maximize their profits by appealing to multiple cultures. =Cultural mulatto= The phrase, coined by Ellis in his essay \\"The New Black Aesthetic,\\" (NBA) refers to a black individual who possesses the ability to thrive and successfully exist in a white society while simultaneously maintaining all facets of his or her complex cultural identity. Ellis signifies two types of cultural mulattoes: \\"thriving hybrids\\" and \\"neutered mutants\\". The thriving hybrid has transcended the stereotypes associated with blackness and predicates their identity on their individuality as opposed to their blackness. They recognize the position that society has placed on them because of their race, but they don't let it inhibit their growth. Ellis writes: \\"Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world.\\" Ellis appropriates the somewhat offensive term mulatto in his creation of rhetoric to describe this contemporary black locus as a means to challenge prevalent notions of multiracial; or in this case, \\"culturally multiracial\\", black people falling subject to the fate of the tragic mulatto, or \\"neutered mutant\\". The tragic mulatto is an individual who, while struggling to fit into white culture, alienates him or herself from black culture. \\"Today's cultural mulattoes echo those 'tragic mulattoes' critic Sterling Brown wrote about in the Thirties only when they too forget they are wholly black.\\"Ellis, Trey (2003). Platitudes and 'The New Black Aesthetic'. Boston: Northeastern University Press. While prevalent as a stereotypical figure in 19th- and 20th-century American literature, the tragic mulattoes need not exist in postmodern society. The NBA, as characterized by Ellis, allows space for the cultural mulatto to perform a self-defined, authentic form of identity that does not rely on the self-deluding practice of negating his or her blackness. Relatedly, the cultural mulatto need not perform a \\"superblackness\\" to overcompensate for \\"acting white\\" or to gain cultural credibility from the black community. On the converse Ellis also defines the \\"neutered mutation,\\" a cultural mulatto who tries hard to please both worlds and ends up pleasing neither. Cultural mulattoes exist in great numbers and, fueled by the ideology of the NBA, space for hybridity is opened and, subsequently, feelings of dislocation in a strictly dichotomous society are collectively obliterated. Through their skills that allow successful navigation in both the white and black social spheres, the cultural mulattoes that typify the NBA are using their access to higher education and various breeds of dominant cultural capital to make \\"atypically black\\" art and earn respect devoid of essentialist racial categorizations. =Contemporary Examples= As B.D. Ashe points out, we are still currently in this era of the New Black Aesthetic, or what he calls the ‚ÄúPost-soul Aesthetic‚Äù. According to him, ‚ÄúThere has been no fundamental, sociocultural paradigm shift akin to the civil rights movement to alter the post-soul aesthetic focus‚Äù or to thrust black Americans into a new way of being and existing.Ashe, B. D. (2007). Theorizing the Post-Soul Aesthetic: An Introduction. African American Review, 41(4), 609-623. As it is, there are a number of modern examples that emphasize the NBA's persistence through the contemporary moment. Some current examples of this would be television shows like Donald Glover‚Äôs Atlanta (TV series) or Issa Rae‚Äôs Insecure (TV series). As characters Issa and ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù also (Donald Glover) display their ability to navigate white spaces to varying degrees and embody the idea of the ‚Äúcultural mulatto‚Äù. For Issa, this is a common occurrence at her workplace with her boss and white coworkers. For Earn, this is best established in the episode Juneteenth in which, while at a Juneteenth celebration attended by mostly white people, he and his girlfriend play along with the expectations of the attendees to an almost ludicrous degree. Throughout most of the party, the white people that Earn and his girlfriend interact with are oblivious to their game. Even further than television, there are examples of artists who exemplify the New Black Aesthetic through mediums such as music. One vocal artist who embodies this idea that blackness can and does exist in a multi-faceted way is Janelle Monae. Specifically, in her album Dirty Computer, Monae gives a voice to the kind of blackness that she embodies as a queer black woman. Janelle Monae doesn't cater to a specific black or white audience, but an audience that can relate to the experiences she speaks of in her music. While many of the songs on Dirty Computer speak of the challenges black people face in America, Monae focuses on these issues in a way that empowers people like herself. She uses her music to empower black queer women when these voices have been historically ignored. Dirty Computer truly is a work that encapsulates Eliss's image of the New Black Aesthetic by being a compilation of intersecting black identities that reflect Janelle Monae's existence as a thriving hybrid. Monae expresses this identity clearly in her album, as well as through her personal style and her refusal to conform to anyone‚Äôs idea of what she should and shouldn‚Äôt be. This solidifies her place as a trendsetter, rule breaker, and cultural mulatto. Platitudes Platitudes is a 1988 metafiction. It tells the tale of competing African- American fictional characters, Dewayne and Isshee, as they struggle to define blackness using two cultural mulatto characters. This novel provides examples of what Ellis describes as New Black Aesthetic in his 1989 essay of the same title. =Plot summary= Trey Ellis is most famous for his first work of metafiction called Platitudes. The metafictional component of Platitudes helps the reader explore the New Black Aesthetic by portraying one story in which the two fictional authors, Dewayne and Isshee, embody two different ideas and perspectives on how black should be expressed and another story of two characters‚Äô struggle to fit into the white world as a ‚Äúcultural mulatto‚Äù. In Platitudes, the story begins with an experimental Black writer by the name of Dewayne Wellington. He is trying to figure out how to write his novel. He scoffs at the mainstream image of \\"authentic blackness\\" by creating the character Earle, a chubby teenage New Yorker who only thinks about sex (that he is not having) and academics. This is a departure from the stereotypical young black male who is assumed to only care about girls/sex, basketball, and hip hop music. He is in all sense what Ellis calls the cultural mulatto. Earle is a black 16-year-old who lives and attends school in the wealthy neighborhoods of the Upper West Side, Manhattan. While Earle is phenotypically black, he is quite assimilated into white culture. While most of his surroundings and relationships are with white people, Earle is also portrayed as a nerd which is often regarded as having ‚Äúwhite‚Äù attributes as well as being someone who is intelligent, lacks social skills, and has a hyper-focus on a particular field, in Earle's case that is computer programming. However, Earle tries to explore his black roots when he visits the diner in Harlem where he meets Dorothy for the first time. Dorothy is the attractive female character Dewayne creates. She attends the private St. Rita's School for Girls in Manhattan. Although she lives in inner-city, Harlem, she socializes and attends school on the primarily white side of the city. Dorothy is a part of the popular crowd at school and wants to live the wealthy lifestyle despite her background. Dorothy is considered a \\"cultural mulatto\\" because she is someone who is able to thrive in the white world while still embracing her racial identity. She is comfortable among her white friends and even has some power and status among them, but she is also aware of her black identity and how she differs from her them. After asking for advice on how to write his novel, Dewayne encounters Isshee Ayam, an African American feminist writer. She ridicules his works and attempts to \\"correct\\" his mistakes by creating her own renditions of the story with more feminist elements. She changes the setting of the story to rural Lowndes County, Georgia as well as most of the characters' traits. As the story goes on, Wellington compromises some of his original ideas to accommodate some of Ayam's preferences. The two narratives of Dewayne and Isshee begin to align as the authors‚Äô writing styles and stories reflect each other's styles and beliefs. By altering the story in accordance to both of the authors‚Äô writing styles and beliefs of how the black characters should be portrayed, Ellis expresses the concept that there is no one black identity that can be defined. Instead, blackness should be defined separately in the case of each person's life through their interactions with the culture and his or her experiences. Along with the aligning of the two stories, a relationship buds between Dewayne Wellington and Isshee Ayam. All in all, a majority of the events that happen in the story of Earle and Dorothy are an indirect reflection of the dynamics of Dewayne Wellington's relationship with Isshee Ayam. In the end, as Earle and Dorothy reconnect and consummate their relationship, Isshee and Dewayne do as well when Isshee visits Dewayne in the last chapter of the novel. Ellis uses Isshee's and Dewayne's novel and of two characters who provide examples of the cultural mulatto to portray the \\"new black aesthetic\\" and the absence of a single black identity. = Analysis = In Platitudes, Ellis depicts the tension between two African-American authors, Isshee and Dewayne, as they debate on the proper portrayal of Black characters. Isshee objects to Dewayne's portrayal of Black women, claiming he presented them in an ‚Äúatavistic‚Äù sense, overtly sexualized by Earle, a protagonist in their stories (15).Ellis, Trey (1988). Platitudes. Boston: Northeastern University Press, In opposition to Dewayne's story, Isshee recreates his characters as strong, intelligent female characters reinforcing the stereotype of the ‚ÄúStrong Black Woman‚Äù. Isshee transforms Earle's doting, White mother into a Mammy figure that she calls ‚ÄúSister Pride‚Äù (41). And she endows Dorothy, the other protagonist in their stories, the beautiful, hyper sexualized teen into a girl with ‚Äúkeen intellect‚Äù(42). Isshee develops Dorothy into ‚Äúthe first black female J.D.-M.D.-Ph.D. in the history of the land‚Äù (42, 43). Through this conflict, Ellis demonstrates the tension that exists in the literary sphere with the transformation of soul literature, Ishee's narrative to post-soul literature, Dewayne's narrative. Isshee recreates the narrative to an ‚ÄúAfro-American glory-stor[y]‚Äù while Dewayne gives a modern, sensual take on middle-class African-Americans (19). Isshee's failure to represent other forms of blackness within her literature represents the theme of respectability that existed within the soul era that Dewayne does away with, resembling New Black Aesthetic and Post-Soul Aesthetic. In Dewayne's narrative of Earle and Dorothy, both belong to the class of the Black post-bourgeoisie. Earle is the son of a working-class white mother. His existence is the product of the civil rights movement which sanctioned the ability for him to live unpunished within the white world of Downtown Harlem. While Dorothy, is a resident of urban Uptown Harlem and the daughter of a restaurateur. She comes from humble beginnings, but she shares the same privileges as Earle able to transverse both white and black worlds and still fit in. Their integration in both worlds indicates their ability to participate socially and culturally as members of both space. Earle and Dorothy are cultural mulattoes, a term coined by Ellis in his essay ‚ÄúThe New Black Aesthetic‚Äù (NBA). However, Earle and Dorothy are different types of cultural mulattoes. Earle is a neutered mutation, another neologism created by Ellis, mainly ‚Äúwhite-cultured‚Äù he is able to fit into the white society, downtown Harlem, but he is unable to blend with ease in uptown Harlem, the black world. His inability to blend with the black world is demonstrated by the double consciousness he experiences while in a restaurant in uptown Harlem. He perceives himself through the eyes of others thinking ‚ÄúStop fooling around and just look mean so they won‚Äôt know you‚Äôre not from uptown‚Äù (23). His counterpart, Dorothy is a thriving hybrid, another neologism by Ellis, she is capable of blending into the landscapes of both worlds, yet she is still self- conscious of her presence in both spaces. She views Earle and herself as commuters between the two worlds and contemplates the loneliness they share that comes from being interlopers between the two worlds (147). As a part of Ellis' NBA (also related to Mark Anthony Neal's concept of the post-soul aesthetic),Neal, Mark Anthony. \\"You Remind Me of Something.\\" Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic. New York: Routledge, 2002. 1-22. Print. Earle represents a sort of new black male whose narrative is free to explore his non-archetypically \\"black\\" conflicts. This NBA tenet is repeatedly evident in the presentation of Earle's relationship to masculinity and the stereotype of black hypermasculinity throughout the novel. Traditionally race and gender intersected in black men to create a hypermasculine archetype; however, Earle is an NBA black male who struggles with understanding and asserting such masculinity in key moments. For example, when Dorothy's boyfriend (hypermasculine LeVon) usurps him as her potential love interest, his response was not aggressive, or even particularly assertive: \\"I can‚Äôt believe it. She‚Äôs not only got a boyfriend but he‚Äôs Gigantor the Thunder Tyrant. I should‚Äôve known. She‚Äôs too beautiful for you fatso, why can‚Äôt you just settle for a tubby acnehead with halitosis who hates you.\\" (141). The self-deprecation of his physical size and shape relative to LeVon's indicated Earle's internalization of his failure in hypermasculinity. Earle's problematized relationship to masculinity is an example of black literature speaking to the experiences of black people who don‚Äôt resonate with hypermasculinity‚Äîa prime illustration of Ellis‚Äô NBA democratization of the black authenticity. This process serves to create a discourse in which black people with non-standard black experiences represented in the NBA and PSA are allowed and encouraged to explore their discomfort with blackness as Earle does. = Genre = Platitudes is a realistic metafiction, a story within a story. The story of Isshee and Dewayne's correspondence frames the bildungsroman, coming-of-age, narratives about Earle and Dorothy. The novel falls under the genre of New Black Aesthetic, art produced by the post- bourgeoisie Black that portrays cultural hybridity and escapes the boundaries of civil rights literature and their themes of respectability. = Structure = Like most postmodern literature, the structure of this novel is discontinuous. Ellis maintains the aleatory disconnection by constantly changing the style of the novel; he shifts from dialogue to stream of consciousness to a third-person omniscient point of view. Ellis breaks the normal flow of extended prose not by default of this being a metafiction but because he writes the novel in an epistolary format. The novel is a bricolage of letters, menus, exams, songs and other documents. = Themes = One theme of the novel is the question of how to represent blackness. This theme is portrayed in the novel through the conflict between Dewayne and Ishee. The two characters argue on how they think black people should be represented in their works. While Dewayne's style is postmodern and depicts atypical forms of blackness, Ishee's style is more traditional and characters are like those found in many works of African American literature. An example of this is found in a comparison of Earle's mother in Dewayne's version of the story vs. in Ishee's. The disparity in how the two authors choose to represent the black matriarch echoes the differences in style between different schools of black thinkers present in the time the book was written. Even in what they serve to their children, these two mothers depict the differences in representation that the two authors espouse. Through the conclusion reached between the two characters, Ellis seems to suggest that a synthesis of these two styles should be worked toward. It is only when Dewayne and Ishee reconcile their differences and give in to their feelings for one another that the conclusion of the story they are writing can be reached. Far from the postmodern beating out the traditional, or the experimental taking a back seat to the realist, the honest black experience of the time can only be told through a combination of the two approaches. In the narratives of Dewayne and Ishee several stereotypes of Black literature are explored, both common and unexpected. Here are a few: * The Black geek, Earle in Dewayne's narrative. He is technologically skilled and has ambitions of an undergraduate education at Caltech or M.I.T.. * The Black masculine figure, Levon, Dorothy's athletic boyfriend in Dewayne's narrative. He is described as the ‚Äúhumongous black‚Äù football player ‚Äúwho looks like he could rip out a door‚Äù (140). * The Jezebel figure, the portrayal of females as lascivious, promiscuous, and hypersexual. Dewayne's mother, Dorothy, and Julie and Isshee's Darcelle are portrayed as Jezebels. * The mammy figure in Isshee's story, Earle's Black mother, ‚ÄúSister Pride‚Äù. She is a desexualized, self-sacrificing, religious, strong Black woman. * The absent Black fathers appear in both Isshee's and Dewayne's stories, Earle and Dorothy are always fatherless. The theme of representation is shown in the ways Earle chooses to align himself within the different communities of Uptown and Downtown. In Downtown Harlem, Earle is friends with other geeks and nerds and this nerdom, is a marker of whiteness. In Uptown Harlem, Earle aligns himself with Black Politics by assisting with the campaign of a Black politician.

The sixteenth installment in the Tony Hawk's series, the game is the first traditional entry in the main series since 2007's Proving Ground and the first Pro Skater since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, as the series had been put on hold following a lack of critical and commercial success with later games. The game was released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 29, 2015, while the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were released on December 15, 2015. As the licensing deal between Tony Hawk and Activision was set to expire by the end of 2015, the game was hastily developed within a few months and released unfinished. As a result, the game was a critical and commercial failure upon release, and was panned heavily by critics, with criticism centering on its graphics, bugs and glitches, controls, and lack of design, although slight praise fell toward the game's soundtrack. It became Robomodo's final game, as the company went out of business in August 2016. To date, it is the most recent original console title in the series, and the last major console entry as a whole until Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, a remaster of the first two games, was released in 2020. Gameplay Like most other games in the series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 oriented its gameplay to classic arcade games. The goal of most modes of the game is to achieve a high score or collect certain objects. As with previous Pro Skater games, the game does not feature a story. To score, the player has to successfully perform and combine aerials, flips, grinds, lips, and manuals, with successful executions adding to the player's score. The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, performing tricks on specific landmarks on the map, and the number of times the tricks have been used. Successful tricks also add to the player's special meter, which, once full, allows for the execution of special tricks which are worth a great deal more than normal tricks. Bails (falling off the skateboard due to poor landing) cause no points to be awarded for the attempted trick and reset the special bar to empty. The controls of the game deviate to a degree from previous entries, omitting features such as branching, flatland tricks, the ability to get off the board, climb, slow time, or drive vehicles. Entirely new controls include the ability to stomp to the ground mid-air to reach certain rails or destroy objects. Also, each level features a unique power-up, such as a double jump, gigantism, or a burning or electric skateboard. Levels in the game are all-new to the series, although the vast majority is derivative of popular levels featured in earlier entries. In total, Pro Skater 5 features 10 levels, albeit only seven were available at launch. Furthermore, the game features the ability to create custom skate parks, as was the case with most previous entries. The game does not feature the option to create an individual skater, however; all skaters available can be modified by exchanging their head, torso, or legs. Returning to the series are Tony Hawk, his son Riley, Chris Cole, Andrew Reynolds, David Gonzalez, and Nyjah Huston, while Aaron \\"Jaws\\" Homoki, Lizzie Armanto, Leticia Bufoni, and Ishod Wair make their video game debut. Rapper Lil Wayne serves as the celebrity skater for the entry, while fellow rapper Tyler, the Creator and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were added with a post-release patch. Development On November 7, 2014, Hawk confirmed that a Pro Skater console sequel was in the works. Updated news came from Hawk's appearance at Sony's CES conference in January 2015, where the skater stated that a new game was \\"much further along than he anticipated\\" and would be coming to the PlayStation 4 console at some point during 2015. To point out its return to the series' roots and heyday, it was named Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. In an interview with GameSpot at E3 2015, Hawk stated that Robomodo had consulted with some former Neversoft employees to ensure that the gameplay felt like the original Pro Skater titles. Because the licensing deal between Activision and Tony Hawk was set to expire by the end of 2015, the game was hastily developed within a few months and released unfinished with little promotion. The game was so rushed to release that it was unplayable without an 8GB day one patch, with only the tutorial and park creator being accessible. Essentially, the patch was what contained the full game. After initial footage received negative feedback by fans and commentators alike for its outdated graphics, Robomodo made a departure from the attempted realistic look to a cel-shaded style two months prior to the game's release. Even though Activision marketed this as a conscious stylistic decision unrelated to the feedback and solely owing to allow a consistent frame rate, the results did not save the game from being bashed by critics upon release in September 2015. Reception Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was panned heavily by critics upon release. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 38/100 based on 17 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version received 32/100 based on 43 reviews. It has the fourth-lowest average score of any PlayStation 4 title and the fifth-lowest average score of any Xbox One title. Developer Robomodo was shut down soon after releasing the game. Most critics noted that the graphics were inferior even to the games released on the PlayStation 2, while the gameplay barely resembled previous releases and the fact that the game was rendered almost unplayable by numerous bugs. Furthermore, the simplistic, bland environments and missions, as well as the complete absence of NPCs were noted, while some critics pointed out that better levels could have been designed with the Create-a-Park feature of previous games, whereas most levels were simply inferior copies of levels from the original games. It was named the \\"Worst Video Game of 2015\\" by Entertainment Weekly. Edge even went so far to call Pro Skater 5 \\"an insult to its history, to its licensed skaters and sponsors, to modern hardware, and to anyone who plays it.\\" Marty Silva of IGN awarded it a score of 3.5 out of 10, saying \\"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5s rare moments of nostalgic joy are drowned out by its abundance of faults.\\" He was critical of the newly adjusted control scheme, especially the new stomp function that was using the same button as grind, thus interfering with combos more often than not. Also, the sheer abundance of bugs and framerate drops rendered the game unplayable, especially online. Furthermore, he found the levels to be inferior copies of levels from previous games, thus \\"lack[ing] any sort of charm or identity.\\" Lastly, he characterized the challenges in the level as a chore, as they were extremely repetitive, bland, and questioned the decision of making them unskippable even when the objective was completed. Peter Brown of GameSpot gave the game a 3/10, saying that the game was \\"riddled with technical glitches and design missteps, making it a huge step back for the series\\", naming his article \\"cheap skate.\\" Like Silva, he criticized the level design, as he deemed the levels to be small, ugly, boring, and lacking clever combo elements found in earlier entries of the series. He too was critical of the new stomping mechanic, while finding the online gameplay to be hindrance, as it not only slowed down the framerate, but also required constant connection to a server, which failed more often than not and could only be solved by disconnecting the console from the internet. Unlike Silva, he noted the soundtrack as a positive aspect of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb gave the game 1 out of 5 stars and opened his review with the phrase \\"don't play this game.\\" As for the levels, he noted that they felt \\"about a half-step up from the levels you can create with the game's in-game editor. They have no character and feel slapped together, like someone was in a hurry\\", referencing the short development time. He was especially critical of the Rooftop level, naming it \\"the worst level this franchise has ever produced.\\" He went into detail criticizing the new trick system, especially the changed mechanics of double and triple flips, absence of branching and flatland tricks, and the new special meter, which essentially boiled down to attaining a higher multiplier. All in all, he found the level and controls to lack flow. He also called the game out for its inability to skip tasks once completed and the abundance of different loading screens and loading time when starting an objective. He concluded his review, stating: \\"Don't waste your time. You deserve better. Tony Hawk deserves better. Hell, even guest skater Lil Wayne deserves better.\\" Notes References Category:2015 video games Category:Activision games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Pro Skater 5 Category:Skateboarding video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games developed in Romania Category:Video game sequels Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5"},{"id":"10500370","text":"Alexander Alexandrovich Bashilov () (August 31, 1777 in Hlukhiv - December 31, 1847 in Moscow) was a Russian general officer of Napoleonic Wars period, later engaged in urban planning of Moscow and its suburbs. Military career Alexander Bashilov, commissioned on graduation from the Page Corps, joined the elite Preobrazhensky regiment in January 1798. An aide to Paul I of Russia, he quickly rose to the rank of colonel in October 1800. In February 1802 he was stripped of his court titles for \\"indecent behaviour in a theatre\\" and transferred to a second-rate infantry regiment. He retired in November 1803 but returned to active service as a commanding officer of Tambov regiment in 1806. Bashilov was involved in four campaigns: * 1807 - Regimental commander against the French during War of the Fourth Coalition * 1809 - Brigade commander in Galician and Bulgarian campaign against the Turks during Russo- Turkish War (1806‚Äì1812), notably the siege of Pazardzhik. Promoted to General Major in June 1810 * 1812 - Brigade commander against the French during French invasion of Russia. Assigned to Alexander Tormasov's Observation Army, was engaged in defensive action at Kobryn and Gorodechna (July 31, 1812), earning Order of St. George, fourth class for the latter. * 1813 - Siege of Toru≈Ñ. Bashilov, wounded, retired from the Army in May, 1813 for health reasons. Urban planner In 1825, Bashilov returned to state service in the office of Governor of Moscow; during Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829) he also had a temporary assignment in Army logistics.

Bashilov joined the city administration at the time when Moscow was still recovering from the destruction of Fire of 1812. He is remembered for planting the park around Petrovsky Palace (then a distant north-western suburb) and planning the regular city grid along Petersburg Highway (present-day Leningradsky Prospekt) and north from the Palace (present-day Savyolovsky District). This grid mostly survives to day, including Bashilovskaya and Novaya Bashilovka streets. Bashilov owned a house on Petersburg Highway and rented it to the operators of the famous Yar restaurant; the highway soon became an upper-class recreation area, while the Bashilovka outskirts remained a working-class area. Bashilov and his son Alexander (1807‚Äì1854) were buried at lot 14 of Vagankovo Cemetery. Bashilov wrote a book of memoirs about reign of Paul I, printed in posthumously in 1871.

FIFA 2002 is the ninth game in the FIFA series. Power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the \\"Rest of World\\" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies. Many of the international teams in the game are not licensed (some of them down to the players' names like the Netherlands), as well as smaller countries such as Barbados, who were only given numbers as player names. To date, this was the last FIFA edition (not counting the World Cup versions) to feature the Japanese national team, since Japan Football Association would go on to concede exclusive rights to Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series. Also, this was the final FIFA edition to feature the Israel Premier League and its teams. France and Arsenal star Thierry Henry is featured as the cover star.

Sometimes, by accident or design, a standard ratio image is presented in the central portion of a letterbox picture (or vice versa), resulting in a black border all around. It is generally disliked because it wastes much screen space and reduces the resolution of the original image. It can occur when a 16:9 film is set to 4:3 (letterbox), but then shown on a 16:9 TV or other output device. It can also occur in the opposite direction (4:3 to 16:9 to 4:3). Few films have been released with this aspect ratio--one example is The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, which had numerous scenes with Steve & Terri Irwin using widescreen pillar boxing.  Deliberate windowboxing  thumb On rare occasion, a picture will be windowboxed on purpose. During the opening, documentary-style sequence of Rent on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases, the picture is windowboxed to suggest an older camera meant to present at a 4:3 aspect ratio; as the movie transitions from that segment, it then expands horizontally from a windowboxed 4:3 to a letterboxed 2.39:1 aspect ratio. Another example is in the movie Brother Bear. On the theatrical and Widescreen DVD release, the beginning of the film is windowboxed until Kenai, the main character, becomes a bear. This is to show that his world- view, and his perspective on nature, has widened. A form of windowboxing is also occasionally encountered in 3D film; by containing the reference plane in a box smaller than the actual screen, the filmmaker can increase the stereoscopic effect of objects coming out of the plane and toward the viewer by having them extend outside the windowbox. Windowboxing has also been used in the instance of transferring films with the academy ratio of 1.37:1 to video, as evidenced in recent DVD releases of older films shot in this standard. This is to compensate for the overscan on many 4:3 TVs, which cuts off part of all four sides of the image. Windowboxing ensures that either more or all of the image is visible on these TVs; in a best case scenario the TV overscan cuts off nothing but the windowbox borders. It originally was used only for the credit sequences in 4:3 films, where the text could extend out to the very edges of the image, but it was gradually adopted to be used throughout the film. Critics often argue that windowboxing of this ratio is unnecessary due to the image loss caused by overscan being negligible. Moreover, for those who watch such films on computer monitors or newer TVs, both of which have little to no overscan, the black borders around all four sides of the image are visible, effectively shrinking the image on those displays. Windowboxing on video also reduces the total amount of resolution the image effectively uses, but defenders of the process argue that the lost resolution is negligible. Defenders also argue that the prevalence of credit sequences being windowboxed on recent DVDs suggests a natural progression towards the full presentation being windowboxed, just as widescreen presentations progressed. However, letterboxing never ensured that the TV displaying it was showing the full image, just that it was present in the signal, while anamorphic enhancement on DVDs was designed to maximize the resolution used by widescreen films on the format, again with no compensation for overscan. Defenders further argue that the traditional method of cropping 1.37:1 aspect ratio films to fill the 4:3 (1.33:1) ratio of standard definition video causes visual information, however negligible, to be permanently lost from the film. However, critics point out that this situation can be remedied by letterboxing the 1.37:1 image instead of windowboxing, while windowboxed images are often still in a 4:3 aspect ratio, meaning the lost image information was not restored by the process. Furthermore, DVD video has slightly more horizontal resolution than analogue video, giving it an effective aspect ratio of 1.38:1 which allows for a nearly full-screen 1.37:1 image to be stored without cropping, although whether this extra image information can be properly displayed depends on the equipment used. Ultimately, the use of 4:3 windowboxing on video is dependent on whether or not the issue of overscan is better solved via hardware (through the use of newer equipment, to the detriment of those with older displays) or via software (through the use of windowboxing, to the detriment of those with newer displays). At the time before widescreen televisions became popular, most video game consoles until the seventh generation were windowboxed when shown on a widescreen display. The windowboxing was done so that overscanning would be prevented when playing a game on a 4:3 television unit, and so that no on-screen information would be cut off. Some widescreen televisions have a horizontal stretch feature that stretches the image with minimal vertical cropping, compared to the vertical amount that normal zoom feature would crop off, but it causes far more distortion rather than normally zooming in on all four sides of the image.

It was converted to the Game Boy Color in 2001. The game was considered a spiritual successor to Tecmo arcade game Silkworm, which The Sales Curve had previously converted to home computer formats in 1989. The game's heritage is evident from the game design whereby one player pilots a helicopter, and the other an armoured Jeep. SWIV is not an official sequel, as noted by ex-Sales Curve producer Dan Marchant: \\"SWIV wasn't really a sequel to Silkworm, but it was certainly inspired by it and several other shoot-'em-ups that we had played and loved.\\"Bevan, Mike (2008). \\"The Making of SWIV\\", Retro Gamer (58): 40-43. In the game's Amiga manual, however, it was explained that \\"SWIV\\" was both an acronym for \\"Special Weapons Interdiction Vehicle\\" and also short for \\"Silkworm IV\\" (even though there was not a Silkworm II or III).  Gameplay  SWIV is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which plays in a typical fashion to other games in its genre. The player chooses between using either a helicopter or a jeep at the beginning of the game and then plays in their chosen vehicles through scrolling levels, shooting at oncoming enemies. If two players are present, both vehicles will be used at once. Certain enemies when shot drop shield power-ups which can be either picked up to afford temporarily invincibility or detonated to destroy all enemies onscreen.

BID means 'British Inter Departmental'. These systems or equipment types were generally used by more than one single governmental agency or department. The authority for BID's was the Communications- Electronics Security Group (CESG) who were part of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). The BID/150 speech encryption key generator is a single channel device for use with the British Army C42 and C45 Larkspur radio system. This was the first Combat Net secure speech system whose key was set through the use of punch cards within the device. Examples of the BID/150 are on display at the Royal Signals Museum, Blandford Forum. It was first used operationally by the 15th Signal Regiment during the Aden crisis in the late 1960s and was widely used from battalion level up to corps headquarters. It remained in use until the early 1980s. In secure mode the analogue speech signal is digitized, then encrypted by combination with the digital key generated by the BID/150; the digital stream is then fed to the transmitter, to pulse modulate the carrier. On receive, the sequence is reversed. Good radio performance was needed for reliable secure working. To this end, vehicles carrying the C42-DM-BID/150 system were issued with a 27-foot mast and an elevated antenna. The set carried a 'Goodman Box', to check signal strengths and antenna performance. The operator had searching set-up and performance drills to be strictly followed.

Ty Page was a leader in the skateboarding scene during \\"the golden era\\" of skateboarding in the early 1970s. He is best known for creating a freestyle trick called the Ty Hop, which nowadays is known as the \\"shove-it.\\" Family life Ty Page grew up in Hermosa Beach, California, a frisbee throw away from the breakwater. Ty's sister, Kim, described the family's ‚Äúendless summer‚Äù life: ‚ÄúMy dad was a huge surfer so we grew up on boards. Sometimes when the surf was good he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòDon't go to school today. I'll write you a note and we'll go surfing.‚Äô I really believed there was no life east of the Pacific Coast Highway.‚ÄùPhillips, Steve. The Park Record, ‚ÄúOne laugh at a time, Kim Page tickles people's funny spot,‚Äù March 3, 2007. Every summer the family lived in a camper at San Onofre Surf Club, just south of San Clemente.

The Sun, ‚ÄúRiordan finds new prot√©g√©,‚Äù October 9th, 1984. Ty began surfing at age 3 and won the national title in 1972. He was only 15 years old when he won second place at the U.S. Surfing Championships at Huntington Beach. Ty, along with fellow Makaha skateboarder Rusty Henderson, were also members of the Wave Trek Surf Team during the early 1970s.Gabrielson, Bruce, History of Wave Trek Ty and his brother, Greg, both were active in aquatics at Redondo Union High School and both worked as lifeguards at the San Clemente beach.Krikorian, Greg. The Daily Breeze, ‚ÄúSkateboard artists talk safety on whirlwind tour,‚Äù May 31, 1976. When the Redondo breakwater was good, some say it was one of the best surfing locations in the South Bay. Ty and Greg were both avid surfers and displayed true talent when the breakwater was over eight feet.Purpus, Mike. Easy Reader, ‚ÄúSkate Town,‚Äù July 14, 2005. Innovation Ty was given a skateboard at the age of 4 by Greg when he received 3 boards one Christmas. Ty later said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a surfer, and I guess I like skateboarding so much because it‚Äôs very close to surfing. Surfing is harder than skateboarding, though. Every wave is different, and you have to start out fresh on each wave. With skateboarding, a hard surface is a hard surface. Once you get your balance on solid ground, you can go from there.‚ÄùZagoriski, Edward J. Read Magazine, ‚ÄúSkateboarding is back for fast fun and frolic on wheels,‚Äù March 31, 1976. At first, he skated basic surf style, attempting anything that he and Bruce Logan made up. He began bank riding in 1969 and almost all of his freestyle maneuvers were original tricks.Bolster, Warren. SkateBoarder, ‚ÄúSkateBoarder Interview: Ty Page,‚Äù September 1977. After the introduction of the urethane wheel in 1972, Ty saw real potential in the sport as a career, so he focused primarily on skateboarding.Wild World of Skateboarding, ‚Äú‚ÄôMr. Incredible‚Äô Ty Page talks about what it takes to be one of the world‚Äôs top ten skateboarders,‚Äù February 1978. He entered his first skateboarding competition in 1973 at the first Del Mar nationals. He says he was really nervous and couldn't eat for days before the competition. However, in 1975, he was a contest veteran and placed second in the junior men's freestyle division. It was at this competition that the Z-Boys debuted on the skating circuit. This competition was highlighted in \\"Lords of Dogtown\\" in which Hollywood rewrote history according to Stacy Peralta‚Äôs 2001 film about Santa Monica‚Äôs ‚ÄúDogtown and Z-Boys.‚Äù The movie suggested that Ty tried to change his skate style from freestyle to a more surf style, similar to the Z-Boys; however, Ty and Bruce Logan had been skating surf style with kick- turns and round-house slides as far back as 1964, before the Z-Boys began skating. Ty took first place at the Santa Barbara Skateboard Championships with long nose wheelies, headstands, and 360s. He continued to push limits and went on to win many national competitions. He said, ‚ÄúOne thing I‚Äôm into is I don‚Äôt like to do anything that‚Äôs easy. In all the tricks that I do, I don‚Äôt do anything that‚Äôs easy. It‚Äôs just boring; it‚Äôs not a challenge. I‚Äôm just into the challenge of things.‚Äù \\"Mr. Incredible\\" Ty was always attempting new stunts and going bigger and faster each time. He would make up 4 new tricks per show. He is credited with inventing over 50 new moves, including the Ty Slide, Ty Hop, Half-Hop, Pay Hop, Daffy (also called a Yeah Right Manual), Head Spinner (also called 360 Headstand), Foot Spin, Foot-Spin 360, Toe Spin, Toe-Spin 360, and almost every backwards footwork maneuver. Unity Surfskate in Hermosa Beach made the first skateboard push by sponsoring Ty Page and putting out a popular, wooden kick-tail skateboard called the Ty Stix. The second generation Makaha team of Ty Page, Bruce Logan, Rusty Henderson, Mike Purpus, and Torger Johnson was put together to promote the invention that changed skateboarding forever ‚Äì the kicktail and double kicktail boards.Makaha website, www.makahaskateboards.com. Some say the Makaha team was the best skateboarding team ever assembled. Mike Purpus said, \\"The reason the Z-Boys got more recognition was because they were loud and obnoxious, while the Makaha Team just skated great and went on quietly winning contests.\\" Ty later signed with California Free Former, the world's largest skateboard manufacturer.Hunt, Dave. Easy Reader, ‚ÄúBones are on the board with wheels,‚Äù September 22, 1977. \\"Mr. Incredible,\\" as he was known, placed first in dozens of major skateboarding competitions and has been the holder of numerous surfing and skateboarding titles. He was known not only as a freestyler, but also as a capable skateracer, bowl rider, pool rider, and as a giant and straight slalom skater. Ty's multi-faceted, rapid-fire technique and footwork were nothing short of incredible. After trying many times to photograph his footwork, SkateBoarder magazine was forced to purchase a new $3,000 high-speed camera to catch him on film to publish in the August and September 1977 issues. He appeared on the cover of many national and international magazines and was frequently featured in skateboarding magazines and journals as well as Newsweek and Sports Illustrated. In addition, his line of skateboards was revolutionary in performance. The Ty Page Professional Skateboards were designed by Ty himself to be different from all other boards. The boards and Ty Page Black Gold wheels were heavily promoted by Blammo Gum and California Free Formers in every major newspaper in the country. The Big Time At the age of 17, Ty signed with Bill Riordan, an international sports promoter. In just a few years, Ty was earning over $100,000 a year on the skateboarding circuit. In the 1970s, skateboarding was the fastest growing sport in the country as evidenced by the 40 million skateboards sold and the multimillion- dollar support industry of protective gear and equipment that emerged.McMillian, Penelope. Los Angeles Times. ‚ÄúTop Skateboarders Spin Their Slicks,‚Äù October 16, 1977. Of the 200 professional skateboarders, only a few had that kind of success; he was a true superstar. In addition to prize money from competitions, Ty had major endorsement deals. Ty was paid $1 for every Ty Page Professional Skateboard that was sold, and he was paid for appearances, commercials, movie appearances, and to test new model boards. By the time he was 19 years old, he had an oceanfront apartment and a new Alfa Romeo Spider.Gustkey, Earl. Los Angeles Times, ‚ÄúSkateboarding May Be Kids‚Äô Stuff, But it Pays,‚Äù July 10, 1977. In 1976, Ty performed in New York, and his exhibition attracted the kind of media coverage usually reserved for Muhammad Ali. Ty starred in several commercials, including Sunny Delight, Wendy's, and MG cars, and appeared in several movies. Ty was a U.S. Goodwill Ambassador and traveled around the world performing in exhibitions and safety demonstrations. In 1977, he was awarded the key to the city of New Orleans by the mayor. He was huge in Japan and went there two or three times, and he was also famous in Europe, especially Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. After two spectacular tours through Germany, Ty was featured as the centerfold in the November/December 1977 German issue of Skateboard, the first U.S. skater to be so honored. In March 1978, the California Free Former team was featured in Cal Jam 2, skating to Aerosmith, Heart, Ted Nugent and others. Ty skated to the Latin rhythms of ‚ÄúBlack Magic Woman‚Äù as Carlos Santana performed on stage. The show set a new record for the largest audience in the history of skateboarding ‚Äì an estimated 300,000 ‚Äì and was aired nationally on ABC. Ty's half-pipe skating was highlighted on the cover of Wild World of Skateboarding Magazine in July 1978.Du Pre, Peter. Wild World of Skateboarding, ‚ÄúA Rock Music and Skateboarding Extravaganza!‚Äù July 1978. The Legend Ty Page was a leader in the 1970s skateboard world. He was a true professional with a genuine interest in promoting the sport in a positive manner. He performed at safety demonstrations and consistently recommended the use of safety equipment and emphasized not riding in the streets regardless of traffic. He brought integrity to the sport and upheld an image that was good for skateboarding. In 1998, he was inducted into the Thrasher Skateboard Hall of Fame. On May 13, 2016, Ty Page was inducted into the IASC Skateboarding Hall of Fame. In 2015 Ty Page announced that he had brain cancer, an astrocytoma of a frontal lobe. He underwent chemotherapy and radiation, as well as alternative therapies. He died June 1, 2017.Obituary: http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/parkrecord/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid;=185738738 He lived with his wife and three sons in Park City, Utah.

Indian businessman Vijay Mallya bought the yacht in 2006 for an undisclosed purchase price. Legal issues Docked in the harbor of Valletta, Malta During 2017, Mallya was suspected of financial crimes, which included non-payment of ship expenses and crew salaries. As Indian Empress was moored in Valletta, Malta at the time, the yacht was held there under court order, and then auctioned by the courts on June 28, 2018. The winning bid of ‚Ç¨43.5 million was made by Maltese company Credityacht Ltd, on behalf of an unnamed Iranian client. They subsequently had seven days to deposit the funds, but failed to meet that deadline. Credityacht Ltd. then requested a 15-day extension to make the payment. The union for maritime workers, Nautilus International representing the up to 40 crew members who were owed collectively a reported ‚Ç¨1 million- plus in unpaid salaries, accepted the request, but several other creditors declined. The Maltese court then set a new date to re-auction the yacht after the first purchased attempt defaulted. The second auction was to be held on September 19, 2018.

Originally a US Army General Hospital during the Second World War, it became an NHS hospital in 1951. History The 67th General Hospital was authorised on 3 March 1941, during the Second World War, and activated 1 September 1942 as an American Army Hospital and occupied by the U.S. Army Medical Corps. After the war, it continued in use as a Ministry of Pensions Hospital and only became a General Hospital within the National Health Service in 1951. Early royal visits included those by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1959 and by Princess Anne in 1970, when she opened the Intensive Therapy Unit. Following an operation on his foot in 1977, Somerset cricketer Ian Botham mistakenly walked into a children's ward at Musgrove Park. He gives this as his inspiration for raising millions of pounds for leukaemia charities. During the great snow of February 1978, the helicopter became a familiar sight, bringing a patient with a head injury, transporting mothers in labour and supplying smaller hospitals. This was followed by the Taunton train fire of July 1978, which also affected staff and patients. The first major development of the hospital, the Queen's Building, which provides accident and emergency, orthopedics, endoscopy and ophthalmics as well as therapy services, was opened by Elizabeth II in 1987. The Duchess Building, which provides medical and care of the elderly, outpatients, oral surgery and orthodontics, dermatology, diagnostic imaging, pharmacy and paramedical support, was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester in 1995. In October 2006, a new multi-storey car park was opened, provided under a 25-year public-private partnership (PPP). The Cedars car park was built with 736 spaces, operated by Dutch company Q-Park. A new cardiac extension to the hospital was built at this time, providing primary angioplasty facilities. On 1 December 2007, Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust became a Foundation Trust. As a Foundation Trust, the hospital was given greater freedoms over its finances and the 5,200 people who have registered as members were given a greater role to play in the future direction of the hospital. The Beacon Centre for cancer services opened in May 2009. Between February and May 2010, a new helipad was constructed directly outside the accident and emergency department reducing patient transfer times. In 2014, the Jubilee Building, which replaced part of the old building was completed. In 2020, the building of a new maternity building and surgical centre was announced. Services Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance on the helipad at Musgrove Park Hospital Musgrove Park serves a population of 340,000 - primarily living in the area served by NHS South West. Each year 41,000 patients are admitted as emergencies; 9,000 patients are admitted for elective surgery; 34,000 are seen for day case surgery; 315,500 outpatient appointments are held; 75,000 attend Accident and Emergency, 3,400 babies are born in the Maternity Department and 235,000 diagnostics tests are carried out. The hospital has 640 beds as well as 16 operating theatres. Musgrove Park is also home to an Intensive Care and High Dependency Unit, an Acute Medical Unit, a fully equipped Diagnostic Imaging department and a specialised Children‚Äôs Department including a Paediatric High Dependency Bay. The trust also provides Neonatal Intensive Care for all of Somerset. The trust employs about 4,000 staff. Musgrove Park has a Community Radio station housed on its campus, Apple FM, presented and run by volunteers. The station is broadcast on 97.3MHz FM throughout Taunton Deane and beyond and to all patients and staff on the internal bedside entertainment units. Television In 2007, the accident and emergency department of Musgrove Hospital was the subject of a TV fly-on-the-wall series known as Emergency: Medics.

Only a year after their founding, Vamps performed its first international tour, ten dates in the United States, and in 2010 they went on their first world tour. Originally signed to Hyde's own record label Vamprose, every release the band has had to date has reached the top ten on the Oricon music chart. In 2013, the group changed labels to Universal Music Group's Delicious Deli Records and produced their worldwide debut release. After several tours and collaborations with Western acts, Vamps worked with outside producers and songwriters for the first time on the 2017 album Underworld before temporarily ceasing all activities at the end of that year.  History  =2008‚Äì2011= Vamps was formed by Hyde (L'Arc-en-Ciel) and K.A.Z (Oblivion Dust) in 2008. They had been working together on Hyde's solo work since 2003. After years of collaboration, the two finally decided to form their own band and agreed that there was no better way to announce Vamps than getting out in front of the fans right away. Their first material was the single \\"Love Addict\\", released on July 2, 2008. Their first nationwide tour, Vamps Live 2008, kicked off at Zepp Tokyo. The band, having only released one single, played mostly songs from Hyde's solo career. Between August 1 and October 28, they played 46 shows at the Zepp live houses throughout Japan. The band played 6 to 10 shows at each venue and every single show was sold out. Vamps' second single \\"I Gotta Kick Start Now\\" was released on March 13, 2009, and was followed by \\"Evanescent\\" on May 13. Hyde performing with Vamps in New York City, October 9, 2010 In July 2009, Vamps went on their Vamps Live 2009 U.S.A. Tour. The tour covered 10 cities in the United States from July 11 - August 1. Stopping in the following cities: New York, two Warped Tour 2009 shows (Hartford & Columbia), Baltimore, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Las Vegas, San Diego, and finishing off in Los Angeles. They had an additional finale US show in Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii on board the battleship USS Missouri on September 19. On June 10, 2009, they released their self-titled debut album, Vamps, followed by their fourth single \\"Sweet Dreams\\" on September 30. On January 31, 2010, the band was awarded the Billboard Japan Music Awards Rising International Artist award for their efforts and success with their tour in the US. After releasing the DVD of their US tour on March 17, they released the single \\"Devil Side\\" on May 12. Their sixth single \\"Angel Trip\\" was released on June 9, followed by their second album, Beast, on July 28, 2010. The band held a free concert in Roppongi Hills on July 30, which was also freely streamed live on several websites. Vamps embarked on their first world tour in the fall of 2010. Making stops in the following countries: Taiwan, United States, Spain, France, China and Chile. Their seventh single \\"Memories\\" was released on December 15, 2010 and contains the B-side \\"Get Up -Japanese Ver.-\\", which is an alternative version of \\"Get Up\\" that translates some of the English lyrics into Japanese. This recording of the song was used in the Bakuman. anime, which features a fictionalized version of Hyde that is voiced by the singer himself. On July 13, 2011, Vamps released their fourth DVD, Vamps Live 2010 World Tour Chile, which was recorded in Santiago on November 6, 2010 at the Caupolican Theatre. =2013‚Äì2017= Vamps at the Roseland Ballroom on December 8, 2013. In February 2013, Vamps announced they were changing record labels to Universal Music Group's Delicious Deli Records. The first release on the label was the home video Vamps Live 2012 on April 24, which was recorded at Zepp Namba in 2012. Vamps, who were recording in Los Angeles, performed at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards Japan on June 22, coming straight from the airport. This was the first performance of the songs from their double A-side single \\"Ahead/Replay\\", which was released on July 3, exactly one year and one day since their debut five years ago. The duo released the best-of album Sex Blood Rock n' Roll on September 25, which includes re-recordings of songs, all in English, and is also their first worldwide release. They supported the record with a world tour that took them to Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, London, and finished with shows in Los Angeles and New York where they were supported by Sid Wilson of Slipknot. Vamps headlined the U-Express Live 2014 event at the Saitama Super Arena on March 1, played their second show in London on March 28 and also performed at that year's Download Festival on June 14. Following the two singles \\"Get Away/The Jolly Roger\\" and \\"Vampire's Love\\", released on August 20 and October 8 respectively, the band produced their third studio album BloodSuckers on October 29, 2014. It was released in Europe on March 23, 2015 and in the US a day later. Vamps hosted the VampPark Fest at the Nippon Budokan on February 18 and 19, 2015. In addition to themselves, it included Sixx:A.M., Buckcherry, Sads, Nothing More, Gerard Way and Alexandros. Vamps took part in the Japan Night event held in Jakarta on April 4, alongside several other artists promoting Japanese music. Beginning on April 8, they were a support act for twelve stops on Sixx:A.M.'s North American tour. They also performed at two festivals in Florida, the Fort Rock Festival on April 25 and Welcome to Rockville the following day, their own headlining show at the Best Buy Theater on May 1, and at the Rock on the Range festival on May 15. Vamps returned to South America for four concerts in late September and early October, before being a support act for six shows on Apocalyptica's UK tour in November. They released a collaborative single with Apocalyptica titled \\"Sin in Justice\\" on November 20. The single \\"Inside of Me\\" produced by Howard Benson and featuring Chris Motionless was released on August 31, 2016. Its B-side, \\"Rise or Die\\", features Richard Z. Kruspe. The music video for \\"Calling\\" was released via Loudwire in April 2017. These three tracks and \\"Sin in Justice\\" were included on the album Underworld, released on April 26, 2017. Designed to appeal to American audiences, it marks the first time Vamps brought in a producer and co-writers on songs. In September, they opened for Danzig at three concerts in the Western US and headlined their own show at the Roxie Theater. On December 1, 2017, Vamps announced that they were temporarily ceasing all activities; \\"Our engines have overheated and we need some time to cool down.

Retrieved 18 May 2012. and No. 40 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Lyrics The lyrics describe a man who spends his days on a street corner, shouting at passersby. According to the radio show In the Studio with Redbeard (which spotlighted the making of the Abacab album), the song was composer Collins' first song about the homeless epidemic and society's reluctance to help the homeless or find a resolution. Near the end of the 1980s, Collins would revisit the theme of homelessness in \\"Another Day in Paradise\\". Music Backed by a simple drum machine beat, the song takes a musically dark tone. This song makes a prominent feature of the Roland CR-78 drum machine at the beginning, then switches to a drum set during the bridge while the drum machine continues to run in the background throughout the entire song. Music video The music video used to promote the song features Collins, Banks, and Rutherford, along with Daryl Stuermer and Chester Thompson playing on stage together, using different colours to illuminate the band. It was filmed during a performance at the Savoy Theatre in New York City, and uses the audio taken from this performance rather than the studio recording.

The game is played in a sequence of stages. At the beginning of each stage the game is in some state. The players select actions and each player receives a payoff that depends on the current state and the chosen actions. The game then moves to a new random state whose distribution depends on the previous state and the actions chosen by the players. The procedure is repeated at the new state and play continues for a finite or infinite number of stages. The total payoff to a player is often taken to be the discounted sum of the stage payoffs or the limit inferior of the averages of the stage payoffs. Stochastic games generalize Markov decision processes to multiple interacting decision makers, as well as strategic-form games to dynamic situations in which the environment changes in response to the players‚Äô choices. Two-player games Stochastic two-player games on directed graphs are widely used for modeling and analysis of discrete systems operating in an unknown (adversarial) environment. Possible configurations of a system and its environment are represented as vertices, and the transitions correspond to actions of the system, its environment, or \\"nature\\". A run of the system then corresponds to an infinite path in the graph. Thus, a system and its environment can be seen as two players with antagonistic objectives, where one player (the system) aims at maximizing the probability of \\"good\\" runs, while the other player (the environment) aims at the opposite. In many cases, there exists an equilibrium value of this probability, but optimal strategies for both players may not exist. We introduce basic concepts and algorithmic questions studied in this area, and we mention some long-standing open problems. Then, we mention selected recent results. Theory The ingredients of a stochastic game are: a finite set of players I; a state space M (either a finite set or a measurable space (M,{\\\\mathcal A})); for each player i\\\\in I, an action set S^i (either a finite set or a measurable space (S^i,{\\\\mathcal S}^i)); a transition probability P from M\\\\times S, where S=\\\\times_{i\\\\in I}S^i is the action profiles, to M, where P(A \\\\mid m, s) is the probability that the next state is in A given the current state m and the current action profile s; and a payoff function g from M\\\\times S to R^I, where the i-th coordinate of g, g^i, is the payoff to player i as a function of the state m and the action profile s. The game starts at some initial state m_1. At stage t, players first observe m_t, then simultaneously choose actions s^i_t\\\\in S^i, then observe the action profile s_t=(s^i_t)_i, and then nature selects m_{t+1} according to the probability P(\\\\cdot\\\\mid m_t,s_t). A play of the stochastic game, m_1,s_1,\\\\ldots,m_t,s_t,\\\\ldots, defines a stream of payoffs g_1,g_2,\\\\ldots, where g_t=g(m_t,s_t). The discounted game \\\\Gamma_\\\\lambda with discount factor \\\\lambda (0<\\\\lambda \\\\leq 1) is the game where the payoff to player i is \\\\lambda \\\\sum_{t=1}^{\\\\infty}(1-\\\\lambda)^{t-1}g^i_t. The n-stage game is the game where the payoff to player i is \\\\bar{g}^i_n:=\\\\frac1n\\\\sum_{t=1}^ng^i_t. The value v_n(m_1), respectively v_{\\\\lambda}(m_1), of a two-person zero-sum stochastic game \\\\Gamma_n, respectively \\\\Gamma_{\\\\lambda}, with finitely many states and actions exists, and Truman Bewley and Elon Kohlberg (1976) proved that v_n(m_1) converges to a limit as n goes to infinity and that v_{\\\\lambda}(m_1) converges to the same limit as \\\\lambda goes to 0. The \\"undiscounted\\" game \\\\Gamma_\\\\infty is the game where the payoff to player i is the \\"limit\\" of the averages of the stage payoffs. Some precautions are needed in defining the value of a two-person zero-sum \\\\Gamma_{\\\\infty} and in defining equilibrium payoffs of a non-zero-sum \\\\Gamma_{\\\\infty}. The uniform value v_{\\\\infty} of a two-person zero-sum stochastic game \\\\Gamma_\\\\infty exists if for every \\\\varepsilon>0 there is a positive integer N and a strategy pair \\\\sigma_{\\\\varepsilon} of player 1 and \\\\tau_{\\\\varepsilon} of player 2 such that for every \\\\sigma and \\\\tau and every n\\\\geq N the expectation of \\\\bar{g}^i_n with respect to the probability on plays defined by \\\\sigma_{\\\\varepsilon} and \\\\tau is at least v_{\\\\infty} -\\\\varepsilon , and the expectation of \\\\bar{g}^i_n with respect to the probability on plays defined by \\\\sigma and \\\\tau_{\\\\varepsilon} is at most v_{\\\\infty} +\\\\varepsilon . Jean-Fran√ßois Mertens and Abraham Neyman (1981) proved that every two-person zero-sum stochastic game with finitely many states and actions has a uniform value. If there is a finite number of players and the action sets and the set of states are finite, then a stochastic game with a finite number of stages always has a Nash equilibrium. The same is true for a game with infinitely many stages if the total payoff is the discounted sum. The non-zero-sum stochastic game \\\\Gamma_\\\\infty has a uniform equilibrium payoff v_{\\\\infty} if for every \\\\varepsilon>0 there is a positive integer N and a strategy profile \\\\sigma such that for every unilateral deviation by a player i, i.e., a strategy profile \\\\tau with \\\\sigma^j=\\\\tau^j for all j eq i, and every n\\\\geq N the expectation of \\\\bar{g}^i_n with respect to the probability on plays defined by \\\\sigma is at least v^i_{\\\\infty} -\\\\varepsilon , and the expectation of \\\\bar{g}^i_n with respect to the probability on plays defined by \\\\tau is at most v^i_{\\\\infty} +\\\\varepsilon . Nicolas Vieille has shown that all two-person stochastic games with finite state and action spaces have a uniform equilibrium payoff. The non-zero-sum stochastic game \\\\Gamma_\\\\infty has a limiting-average equilibrium payoff v_{\\\\infty} if for every \\\\varepsilon>0 there is a strategy profile \\\\sigma such that for every unilateral deviation by a player i, the expectation of the limit inferior of the averages of the stage payoffs with respect to the probability on plays defined by \\\\sigma is at least v^i_{\\\\infty} -\\\\varepsilon , and the expectation of the limit superior of the averages of the stage payoffs with respect to the probability on plays defined by \\\\tau is at most v^i_{\\\\infty} +\\\\varepsilon . Jean-Fran√ßois Mertens and Abraham Neyman (1981) proves that every two-person zero-sum stochastic game with finitely many states and actions has a limiting-average value, and Nicolas Vieille has shown that all two-person stochastic games with finite state and action spaces have a limiting-average equilibrium payoff. In particular, these results imply that these games have a value and an approximate equilibrium payoff, called the liminf-average (respectively, the limsup-average) equilibrium payoff, when the total payoff is the limit inferior (or the limit superior) of the averages of the stage payoffs. Whether every stochastic game with finitely many players, states, and actions, has a uniform equilibrium payoff, or a limiting-average equilibrium payoff, or even a liminf-average equilibrium payoff, is a challenging open question. A Markov perfect equilibrium is a refinement of the concept of sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium to stochastic games. Applications Stochastic games have applications in economics, evolutionary biology and computer networks.Constrained Stochastic Games in Wireless Networks by E.Altman, K.Avratchenkov, N.Bonneau, M.Debbah, R.El-Azouzi, D.S.Menasche They are generalizations of repeated games which correspond to the special case where there is only one state.

It was built in fields between Andreas and Bride. As was common practice, the station was named after the parish in which it was situated. History =Construction= When the Luftwaffe began to attack British cities under the cover of darkness in October 1940, the North West of England with its industrial centres and ports came within easy reach of German aircraft operating from occupied France. The first fighter squadron had arrived on the Isle of Man at nearby RAF Jurby in November 1940, and came under the control of the newly formed No. 9 Group RAF, Fighter Command. Group Control was positioned at RAF Barton Hall, near Preston, and its sectors covered Lancashire, Cheshire and Shropshire. Andreas was to be a separate sector with responsibility for the Irish Sea and its surrounds. The new wing of Ramsey Grammar School was commissioned as Control Centre for the sector and was hastily prepared before the arrival of the new fighters at Jurby. The Control Centre was linked to the three radar stations at Dalby, Scarlett and Bride. Andreas was chosen as the site of a fighter airfield because of its central location with regard to Liverpool, Belfast and Glasgow; it was in an excellent position to protect the vital shipping arriving at these ports. Finally, with the compensation payments agreed, work on the construction of RAF Andreas began in earnest by the end of June 1940. A total of of farmland was earmarked, coming from both Ballaghaue Farm and Braust Farm, and a small portion of land was acquired which stretched into the adjacent parish of Bride. St Andrew's Church, Andreas. The tower was reduced on the request of the Air Ministry as it was seen as a danger to operations from the base. By the spring of 1941 the airfield, to be built to the full specification of an operational fighter station, was beginning to take shape. The main NE/SW runway was long and wide and was obviously meant to take larger aircraft than fighters. From the perimeter track there was access to the flight dispersals area in which a total of 24 blast pens (or E pens) were built, half to provide protection for the fighters while larger ones were for twin-engined aircraft. Considerable thought had also gone into the airfield's defences, with the whole area being surrounded by roller concertina barbed wire, with gaps located at the main entrance and crash gates and by a tarmacadamed perimeter track over three miles in distance.Ramsey Courier, Friday, September 14, 1945; Page: 3 RAF Andreas was designed as a dispersed airfield with many components of the base located in the village of Andreas; so that the domestic side and living quarters were a considerable distance from the technical side. There was also a dance and entertainments hall in the village and a farm on the Station. In summer 1941 the first RAF personnel arrived at Andreas. These were mainly a flight of Royal Air Force Police, whose first duties were to guard the stores kept in the completed hangars. Also arriving at that time were MT drivers and soldiers of the Wiltshire Regiment, under the command of Major G.K. Wait MC, who arrived to man the airfield's defences, along with the first of many WAAFs who were to staff the administration offices and operations rooms. The station officially opened in August 1941, the first commanding officer of RAF Andreas being Group Captain J. Marson.Isle of Man Times. 14 September 1945. Fighter Command A Spitfire MkVb of 457 Squadron undergoing gun calibration at RAF Andreas. =457 Squadron= 457 Squadron badge.jpeg By October 1941, RAF Andreas was ready to receive the first of No. 457 Squadron RAAF (457 Sqn) Spitfires from RAF Jurby as a prelude to working up to operational efficiency. This work-up would take six months, however the transfer of 457 Sqn's ground crew and administrative staff brought welcome relief to the congestion at Jurby. During this work-up period the Air Ministry insisted that the height of Andreas church tower be reduced, as it was a hazard, and in line with the southern end of the main runway. The church tower was originally high, and the most striking feature of the island's northern plain, being visible throughout the parish. RAF Andreas had become fully operational in March 1942, but by now 457 Sqn was ready to move south to join No. 11 Group RAF (11 Grp) at RAF Redhill and to take part in air strikes over northern France. =452 Squadron= RAF312SqFollowing the departure of 457 Squadron, it was immediately replaced by No. 452 Squadron RAAF (452 Sqn), which had been formed in April 1941 and whose most celebrated pilot was the maverick Irishman, Paddy Finucane. Ground Crew and pilot with Spitfire at RAF Andreas In June 1942, 452 Sqn's tenure at Andreas came to an end when the squadron returned to Australia, sailing on 21 June, arriving in Melbourne on 13 August and re-assembled at RAAF Richmond, as No. 452 Squadron RAAF, on 6 September.https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/U59437 =93 Squadron= RAF312SqThe third fighter unit to occupy RAF Andreas was No. 93 Squadron RAF (93 Sqn) which had an entirely different background, previously having been involved in the development of night fighter tactics using Havocs equipped with radar and Turbinlite searchlights. 93 Sqn reformed at Andreas as an entirely new squadron equipped with Spitfire VBs as it worked up to operational efficiency. Considerable time was spent over the air-to-ground firing range along the Ayres coastline at Smeale, which had been constructed not long after the first fighters had arrived at RAF Jurby. When Andreas airfield was under construction, the coastline north of Smeale had been heavily mined as a precaution against an enemy landing. After four months, 93 Sqn was ready to move on to more direct action, and was ordered to relocate to Algiers ready for the North African landings as part of Operation Torch. Supermarine Walrus =275 Squadron= RAF312SqIn November 1941 RAF Andreas received a detachment from 275 Squadron (275 Sqn) which served as 9 Group's Air Sea Rescue Unit and which covered the Irish Sea. The Squadron had its administrative headquarters at RAF Valley, Anglesey, and the detachment's Walrus amphibian Mk.Is were often to be seen flying around the island. =772 Squadron (FAA)= Another strange but permanent resident at Andreas was a Vought-Sikorsky Chesapeake of the Fleet Air Arm. It belonged to 772 Squadron, Fleet Air Arm (772 Sqn), and was employed to provide simulated conditions for the Royal Navy's No. 1 Radar Training School which was situated on Douglas Head. The Chesapeake was replaced in October 1944, after crashing on Douglas Head, killing the pilot Sub Lieutenant R. S. Paton. An E-pen at RAF Andreas (2018). These were situated predominately on the eastern and northern side of the airfield and were designed to afford shelter from attack for aircraft and ground crew. Two aircraft could be accommodated within the pen. Today, this one houses a mobile phone mast. Operations At night the drone of bombers could be heard as they passed overhead on their way to Belfast. These were the nights when the fighters based at RAF Andreas and RAF Jurby were called into action. Airborne radar was still in its infancy, and there was little they could do except offer token resistance. Occasionally an enemy aircraft would be sighted and in the ensuing chase bombs would be jettisoned as the Heinkel or Dornier made a rapid escape. The air raid sirens of the Island sounded a total of 43 alerts ‚Äì 32 of them in 1942. Many were of a short duration, but on the nights of 20 and 21 December 1941, there were two alerts each lasting five hours when Liverpool and Manchester were being heavily attacked. The first enemy bomb to fall on the Isle of Man was on 18 September 1940, when high explosive bombs caused four large craters in the Dalby area ‚Äì without damage or injury. On the nights of 7, 15, and 16 April 1941, enemy bombers were again over the Island. On the first occasion the Island was illuminated with flares and incendiary bombs landed near Port Soderick. On the 15th a high explosive bomb landed close to Cronk Ruagh Sanatorium near Ramsey. Shrapnel landed on the entrance steps and windows were blown out. The following night more H.E. bombs fell at Scarlett narrowly missing the Radar Station. The following month considerable alarm was caused when bombs fell on the outskirts of Douglas. It was the night of 8/9 May, when clear conditions prevailed and when Dublin was mistakenly bombed. After 93 Sqn had exchanged the sands of the Ayres for the sands of North Africa, the station grew quiet and much of it was reduced to care and maintenance. There was little to do for 9 Group now that the emergencies which had brought it into being had largely passed. Nevertheless, RAF Andreas remained officially part of 9 Group until August 1944, Wing Commander Raynor being responsible for the signing and despatch of the operational orders which signalled the disbanding of the Group, and many of the 900 airmen and 400 WAAFs were posted out whilst new plans were awaited for the Station. One of the residents who did not leave was the detachment from 275 Squadron which would stay at the Station until the end of April, 1945. During the spring of 1943, a new role was found for the excellent facilities at Andreas, and preparations began to set up No.11 Air Gunnery School of Training Command. Training Command =No.11 Air Gunnery School= With the specialisation required in aircrew for the heavy bombers of Bomber Command, air gunners became a separate category. Each Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax required two or three gunners in its crew, so thousands would be required to meet the demands of the growing strategic offensive and to replace losses. Martinet in RAF service Vickers Wellington RAF Andreas was to play an important role in the training programme, and thus began the busiest period in the life of the Station. The Station's new commanding officer was Group Captain Mackay, who would remain at Andreas for the rest of the war period, and the station completely changed in character from that of a fighter station to that of a training establishment. Whilst at Andreas, the volunteer pupils selected for air gunners underwent an intensive ten-week course, before passing on to the operational training units of RAF Bomber Command. The course involved sighting; aircraft recognition; pyrotechnics; clay-pigeon and 25 yard range shoots; care and maintenance of .303 and .5 Browning machine guns and 20mm cannon; turret hydraulics, manipulation and operation, and the use of cine-camera guns. The training huts were equipped with the various types of turrets then in use, including Boulton Paul Types A and F, and Frazer Nash 121 which were installed in the Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster respectively. The first aircraft to arrive were 15 Avro Anson gunnery trainers. For more advanced experience, training was conducted on a succession of Vickers Wellingtons which were being withdrawn from the front-line squadrons of Bomber Command, and target towing duties were the responsibility of Bristol Mercury engined Miles Martinets. Firing took place in allotted zones over the sea on both sides of the Point of Ayre, care being taken not to interfere with the Jurby bombing ranges. Despite the continual flying programme over the congested north of the Island, accidents involving Andreas aircraft proved to be very rare, and only one documented incident resulted in the loss of a life. During 1944, Andreas, because of the length of its main runway, became an emergency landing ground for the Atlantic ferry route and was occasionally used by American aircraft such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The ending of the war in Europe in May 1945, saw no let up in the routine at Andreas with the prospect of a long campaign in the Pacific War. The detachment of Fleet Air Arm 772 Squadron, which had been responsible for operating the Chesapeakes, became 772B Squadron in May 1945 with the arrival of Boston 111s, Corsairs and de Havilland Mosquitoes. The purpose of the Bostons was to train gunners from the naval air station at Ronaldsway, and Fairey Barracudas were added to the scene as they brought in telegraphists to have air gunnery added to their training. However, this only lasted for a short period, as 772B was disbanded in September 1945 following the defeat of Japan. Units During the course of the operation of the station, the following units were at some time based at RAF Andreas: 10/41 to 03/42, 457 Sqn, with Supermarine Spitfire 03/42 to 06/42, 452 Sqn, with Supermarine Spitfire 06/42 to 09/42, 93 Sqn, with Supermarine Spitfire 11/41 to 04/44, 275 Sqn (detachment), with Supermarine Walrus and Blackburn Skua 04/45 to 05/45, 772 Sqn FAA (detachment), with Vought-Sikorsky Chesapeake 05/45 to 08/46, 772B Sqn FAA, with Corsairs and de Havilland Mosquitoes 05/43 to 09/46, No. 11 Air Gunnery School Post-war and closure By the ending of hostilities in 1945 over 3,000 air gunners had successfully completed the air gunnery course at RAF Andreas. In July 1946, the Douglas High School Flight of 506 Squadron Air Training Corps, spent a week's camp at Andreas.Isle of Man Examiner, 9 August 1946. The squadron, together with 440, had been set up in the early years of the war to encourage the interest of schoolboys in the Royal Air Force, many going on to train as aircrew. The cadets enjoyed daily flights in some of the Wellingtons at the station, taking advantage of what was now considerably quieter airspace over the north of the island, as well as south west Scotland and Cumberland. =At Home Day= As was common amongst RAF stations, Andreas staged an 'At Home Day' on Thursday May 9, 1946. A cricket match was held on the sports field and in addition a speed dash was conducted by Spitfires and Mosquitoes.Ramsey Courier. Friday, May 10, 1946; Page: 4 =Battle of Britain Day= The one and only opportunity the general public had of visiting Royal Air Force Andreas was on Battle of Britain Day, September 1946. It had already been announced that the station would close and that the Gunnery School would transfer to nearby Jurby. The Commanding Officer Group Captain Mackay and the rest of the station personnel made every effort to show what the work of the station involved.The Blackburn Skua was operated by No. 275 Air Sea Rescue Squadron, which had a detachment based at RAF Andreas from October 1941. On show were the link trainer, parachute packing by the WAAFs and parachute dinghies and equipment used by the Andreas Rescue Station, which had so often been called upon in emergencies. The following week the transfer of stores to RAF Jurby was completed, and the gates of Royal Air Force Andreas were finally closed. The Watch Office around 2012. Subsequent use =Civil aerodrome= Post- war the siting of a civilian aerodrome was a foremost consideration for the government of the Isle of Man, with Andreas at the time being generally regarded as the best aerodrome on the Island.Ramsey Courier. Friday, September 07, 1945; Page: 4 Situated on the northern plain, it was unffected by advection fog, as Ronaldsway Airport often is, particularly in summer, and the runways were considered superior to Ronaldsway. But Andreas was further from the capital,Douglas, than Ronaldsway was: 50 minutes drive compared to just 20 minutes. That was the main reason for the decision to continue to develop Ronaldsway Airport, and just as had been the case a decade earlier with Hall Caine Airport, the location of Andreas worked against it. The Watch Office undergoing restoration, June 2018. =Missile base= Following the 1957 Defence White Paper a further proposal for the use of Andreas airfield was to sell it back to the government of the United Kingdom in order for it to be developed into a Bristol Bloodhound Surface to Air Missile site for the RAF.Ramsey Courier. Friday, March 21, 1958; Page: 5 The proposal was not proceeded with. =Infrastructure purchase= After the station closed, the Isle of Man Government, through the Local Government Board, took steps to acquire three of the communal sites (the WAAF quarters, the hospital and sick quarters and a site in the centre of Andreas village) to convert them into family accommodation. This was badly needed to rehouse families living in condemned properties in Ramsey and to relieve the general housing shortage on the island as a consequence of the war. Every effort was made to convert the brick-built huts into acceptable two- and three-bedroom homes with electrically heated living rooms and kitchens. Each had a toilet installed, but bathrooms had to be shared. During 1947, a total of 81 families were accommodated as a temporary measure pending the construction of new housing estates. It was to be several years before such new housing was ready, and upon their completion, this temporary housing, by now badly affected by damp, was demolished. One structure to survive was the old gymnasium which still stands, and continues to provide the village of Andreas with a very useful parish hall.Mona's Herald, 17 December 1946. Meanwhile, negotiations between the Manx Government and the Air Ministry were proceeding as to the future of the airfield. Tynwald, the Isle of Man's Parliament, accepted an offer to purchase the whole of the airfield for the price originally paid in compensation to the land owners: ¬£23,750 in all.Isle of Man Examiner, 24 October 1947. No charge was made for the buildings, the Air Ministry agreeing to this as a gesture of appreciation to the government and people of the Isle of Man for their co-operation during the early years of the war. The airfield's runways were soon put to good use by the newly formed Andreas Racing Association for motorcycle racing. The Association's emblem is the Three Legs of Man, set against the \\"A\\" layout of the airfield's runways.The Green Final,19 April 1947. Military graves at St Andrews Church, Andreas The airfield was used on Saturday 25 June 1949, when two Sivewright Airways aircraft diverted there as they were unable to land at Ronaldsway due to advection fog. The 28 passengers were taken to Douglas by motor coach.Ramsey Courier, 01.07.1949, page 4. The view looking down Rwy 29 RAF Andreas (June 2018) =Current use= After a short time in the ownership of the Manx Government, the airfield was put up for sale as a complete entity, and was purchased by a Mr Morrey for the sum of ¬£33,000. The facility is still owned by the Morrey family, and many of its buildings still exist, being mostly used for storage. The local gliding club still uses the airfield, together with a small number of privately owned light aircraft with the RAF Station now known as Andreas Airfield. To this day, within easy view of the airfield, is the (still) stunted tower of the parish church of St. Andrew (in Manx Gaelic, Andrew translates to Andreas), a permanent legacy of Royal Air Force Station Andreas, and below which lie twenty-three military graves. Accidents Although not always involving aircraft based at the Isle of Man's air stations, there were some 200 air accidents on the Isle of Man during the course of the Second World War. The actual number of accidents is open to conjecture as those only involving the loss of life are recorded. For every fatal crash, it is estimated that at least two others occurred many of which would include serious injury, while in others, the pilot and crew would escape unscathed. =Sptifire P7917= Sergeant R.T. Brewin was injured in an incident which involved Spitfire P7917 belonging to No. 457 Sqn on November 5, 1941.https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16998331 =Spitfire P8380= On 1 December 1941 Spitfire MkII P8380, piloted by Flt Sgt Gifford was returning to Andreas after an operational sortie. Crossing the end of the runway at the time was one of the builder's foremen driving a lorry. One of the Spitfire's wheels hit the cab of the lorry, causing severe injuries to its occupant, who was killed instantly. =Spitfire P7529= During operations on 3 December 1941, Spitfire P7529 piloted by Pilot Officer Edwards was involved in an incident whilst landing at Andreas. The aircraft's starboard wheel struck an obstacle whilst landing causing it to overturn. Whilst the pilot was uninjured, the aircraft was badly damaged, resulting in the pilot's log book being endorsed with red ink. =Spitfire P7502= Flt Lt EdyThe third accident within the same week at the beginning of December 1941, was of Spitfire P7502, piloted by Flt Lt Allen Edy DFC, commander of B Flight. Flt Lt Edy had departed Andreas at 15:25hrs, however 15 minutes later his aircraft crashed at Vondy's Farm, 3 miles from the airfield. Flt Lt Edy had managed to bale out, however he might well have been struck by part of the aircraft, causing him to become stunned and thereby lose his life. * The engine of P7502 was recovered circa 1984 and is now on display at the Manx Aviation and Military Museum. =Spitfire P7905= Sergeant R.N.S. Stevens suffered an injury in an incident involving Spitfire MKIIa of No. 457 Squadron on December 31, 1941. The aircraft swung on landing, which resulted in the undercarriage digging in causing the aircraft to become invertedhttp://www.rafcommands.com/database/serials/details.php?uniq=P7905 =Spitfire BL351= Sgt Pilot R. GoodhewOn 8 May 1942, two of No. 452 Squadron's Spitfires were in collision over Andreas resulting in the death of Sergeant Pilot Reginald Goodhew. Sgt Goodhew, was flying Spitfire IIa (BL351)http://allspitfirepilots.org/pilots/1169 and was involved in practicing camera quarter attacks with another Spitfire (AB244), piloted by Pilot Officer William Ford. The two aircraft collided head on, Pilot Officer Ford's aircraft crashed between the runways at Andreas, whilst Pilot Sergeant Goodhew's came down at Farrant Ford Farm. Pilot Officer Ford managed to bale out and survived. Sergeant Pilot Goodhew is buried in Andreas. =Whitley BD417= On 23 August 1942, the most memorable and tragic incident of the life of RAF Andreas occurred. It was the day the station lost its Commanding Officer, Wing Commander Edward Knowles. Saturday night had seen the usual revelry in the Moosejaw Bar of the Officer's Mess, attended by the Wing Commander. Aged 33, and an experienced bomber pilot, he was considered a great \\"character\\" and reputedly knew how to make a party go with a swing, his prowess at the piano being put to good use. The morning after, Wing Commander Knowles was back in the mess for what was described as a \\"convivial luncheon\\" with friends including Major Wait. Relaxing after luncheon, news was received that an Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley had landed on the airfield, an unusual event which immediately aroused the interest of the C.O., who took his friends out onto the airfield to inspect the Whitley, which had called in to refuel before continuing on to a Coastal Command station in Scotland. The Whitley MkV, BD417 belonged to 296 Squadron. There was little else to do that summer's afternoon, and the Wing Commander decided to take the bomber up for a short flight. Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley. Objections from the Whitley pilot were overruled and the duty pilot of the day, Flying Officer A. B. Paton, was prevailed upon to join the C.O., his two friends, and Thelma Knowles, Wing Commander Knowles' wife. Four corporals from the nearby crash section found themselves joining the party and acting as ballast in the back of the aircraft. With engines started, the C.O. followed the perimeter track to the south end of the northeasterly facing runway. The Whitley slowly gathered speed but the end of the runway was reached before it became airborne. It was then seen to be in trouble as it tried to gain height in order to clear the Bride Hills looming ahead. This it failed to do, and it crashed heavily into a field of West Kimmeragh, bursting into flames, and sending up a pall of smoke which could be seen for miles around. The rescue services went into immediate action but nothing could be done to save the four in the nose section of the aircraft; they all had been killed instantly. The rear section of the fuselage broke open and the four corporals were seen staggering around dazed with shock. They were taken by ambulance to the station hospital, but one was transferred to the Military Hospital which had been established at the Majestic Hotel in Onchan. Sadly though, Corporal Henderson never recovered from his severe head wounds. An Air Ministry inquiry was ordered. The five who perished in the disaster on that Sunday afternoon lie buried together in Andreas Churchyard.

He was born in Perth but brought up, from the age of four, in Glasgow where his father was a Church of Scotland Minister. This clerical background extends to two uncles, both ministers who 'came out' in the disruption of 1843, both later serving terms as Moderator of the Free Church General Assembly. From Glasgow Academy Bonar graduated MA in Mental Philosophy from Glasgow University in 1874. He followed the same lengthy undergraduate career that Adam Smith pursued more than a century before gaining a Snell Exhibition to Balliol College Oxford from which he graduated with a first in 1877. A major early influence was the moral philosopher, Edward Caird: first as Professor at Glasgow and then as Master of Balliol. Together with his family background that influence helps explain Bonar's decision to spend the next three years teaching economics in the newly established University Extension Movement in the East End of London. In 1881 he began a career in the civil service only retiring (to live in Hampstead) from his final position, as Deputy Manager of the Ottawa branch of the Royal mint, in 1919 at the age of 67.

Normally, ending inventory is stated at historical cost. However, there are times when the original cost of the ending inventory is greater than the net realizable value, and thus the inventory has lost value. If the inventory has decreased in value below historical cost, then its carrying value is reduced and reported on the balance sheet. The criterion for reporting this is the current market value. Any loss resulting from the decline in the value of inventory is charged to \\"Cost of goods sold\\" (COGS) if non-material, or \\"Loss on the reduction of inventory to LCM\\" if material.  History  The lower of cost or market concept first became part of normal accounting practices in England during the nineteenth century. Lower of cost or market was considered fair because assets were valued on a going-concern basis, rather than the price at which the assets were purchased. During the nineteenth century, lower of cost or market was not common practice for valuation of factory inventory in the United States. The concept was not easy for the Academic Accountants to accept due to its lack of logic. Despite the criticism, lower of cost or market quickly caught on in practice and by the early twentieth century was described as the most commonly accepted method for inventory valuation according to the Report of the Special Committee on Co- operation with Stock Exchanges.Parker, R. H. (1965). Lower of Cost and Market in Britain and the United States: An Historical Survey. Abacus, 1(2), 156-172. Although it lacked accounting logic, lower of cost or market survived because of its conservative approach to valuation and because it addressed opposing principles of cost and value. Its conservatism allowed users to value the inventory at the price for which the inventory could be sold.  Challenges  Three possible values can represent the market value: the replacement cost of the inventory, the net realizable value (also known as the \\"ceiling\\"), and the \\"floor\\" (the difference between the net realizable value and the normal profit).Wampler, Bruce; Holt, Travis (January 2013).\\"Valuing Inventory at the Lower of Cost or Market.\\" CPA Journal. 83: 34‚Äì9. ISSN 0732-8435 In the lower of cost or market approach, companies must determine these three values and find the median of the values. The companies then compare the median value, which is called the designated market value, to the inventory cost that is recorded. The lower of these two values is subsequently reported on the balance sheet. Because the lower of cost or market approach requires companies to use three possible market values, the companies' financial statements can be difficult to compare.  Contemporary usage  The term \\"lower of cost or market\\" is now obsolete and is officially replaced by \\"lower of cost and net realizable value.\\" According to the FASB Accounting Standards Update, \\"An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\\" This FASB update makes usage consistent with the IFRS wording and removes the use of \\"or\\" in a context where \\"and\\" was always the correct one.FASB Accounting Standards Update, No. 2015-11, July 2015, p. 1. However, the update does not apply to all companies. Companies that use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) and average- cost methods of inventory valuation are required to implement the changes, whereas companies that use the LIFO (last-in, first-out) and retail inventory methods are not affected by the update.

He was appointed upon the invitation of Rabbi Samuel Belkin in 1944. He was also known as the \\"Suvalker Rav\\", due to his previous position as the Rabbi of the European town of Suvalk, which he maintained until its capture by the Nazis in 1940. Some of his lectures on the Talmud were later compiled and published as \\"Shiurei Rav Dovid Lifshitz\\". Early years Rabbi Lifshitz was born in Minsk, then Imperial Russia in 1906 to Yaakov Aryeh and Ittel Lifshitz. His paternal grandfather, Rav Shlomo Zalman Lifshitz, was a businessman in Grodno as well as a distinguished Talmudic scholar, who authored the Olas Shlomo. He attended cheder together with Avraham Rosenstein, where they learned Hebrew and Hebrew grammar from Avraham's father, who was the teacher. In 1919, his family moved to Grodno, where he was a foremost student of the famed Rabbi Shimon Shkop in the Sha'arei Torah yeshiva. He later studied in the Mir yeshiva, staying until 1932, receiving Semicha and becoming well known as an outstanding scholar. In 1933, he married Tzipporah Chava Yoselowitz, the daughter of the renowned rabbi of Suvalk, Rabbi Yosef Yoselowitz. Upon the death of his father-in-law in 1935, Rabbi Lifshitz became chief rabbi of the important city and its 27 congregations, where he developed a reputation as a warm and involved spiritual leader, concerned with all Jews. He remained in Suvalk until the Nazis captured the city in 1940. Relocation to America In 1941, Rabbi Lifshitz reached America along with his wife and daughter, and was appointed a rosh yeshiva of Beis Midrash LeTorah in Chicago. Rabbi Lifshitz was soon accorded immense stature among his fellow rabbis, his students and the rest of the Chicago community. His reputation as an outstanding rosh yeshiva spread throughout America and he received offers for several positions.

It was opened in 1939 on of land acquired by the Air Ministry in 1937, under the control of No. 29 Group, RAF. During the Second World War the station was used for training as No. 5 Armament Training Station, No. 5 Air Observer School, No. 5 Bombing & Gunnery School and the No. 5 Air Navigation & Bombing School. In addition RAF Jurby also played host to a variety of operational squadrons. RAF Jurby was originally a grass airfield but was later equipped with hard runways. Operationally it helped protect Belfast and Liverpool from German air raids, being strategically placed in order to offer fighter protection. During the 1950s and 60s the No. 1 Initial Training School (No. 1 ITS) subsequently replaced by the No. 1 Officer Cadet Training Unit (No. 1 OCTU) was based at RAF Jurby, jokingly referred to by the trainee cadets as \\"The Camp on Blood Island\\". Following the closure of the station in 1963, the airfield was used as a diversion for Ronaldsway Airport. To be able to accept Vickers Viscount turboprop airliners the main East/West runway was extended eastwards and bisected by the Ballamenagh Road (A14). To facilitate the use of the extended runway, barriers were placed across the road and the road was closed whilst the runway was in use. Construction As early as 1934 the flat northern plain of the Isle of Man had been identified as a suitable area for the construction of an airfield. This had been borne out by Sir Alan Cobham, who had pinpointed up to six suitable sites between Ballaugh and the Point of Ayre during a survey.Ramsey Courier Friday, 20 July 1934 This ideal location had led to a site at Close Lake, near the future RAF Jurby, being developed as Hall Caine Airport. As part of the RAF Expansion Scheme the Manx Government was approached by the Air Ministry in 1937 with a view to establishing an Aircraft Armament Training Camp for air crew in the sparsely populated Parish of Jurby. The site chosen consisted mainly of land which had belonged to the Ballamoar Estate, which contributed 307 acres to the total area. Despite local objections from approximately 60 farmers the proposal went ahead, with Tynwald, the Manx parliament, approving the Defence Bill put forward by the Island's Lieutenant Governor, William Leveson-Gower, 4th Earl Granville. Work on RAF Jurby began at the end of September 1938, the contractors being Gerrard & Sons of Manchester.Ramsey Courier. 30 September 1938 Large earth movers arrived and began levelling the area,Ramsey Courier. 30 September 1938 however there were serious concerns about the labour force to be used on the airfield, mainly regarding the importation of Irish labourers, there being insufficient local labour able to undertake the work. The construction of the station attracted crowds eager to see the developments of such an undertaking on the Isle of Man, particularly the sight of the plant machinery and the construction of the huts to be used for the housing of the workers, which were erected in early October. To level the land, gravel was taken from the Point of Ayre as well as spoil from the mines at Laxey and Foxdale. As it developed, RAF Jurby made an increasingly dramatic imposition on the surrounding rural landscape, its conspicuous features being visible across the northern part of the Island. By the beginning of 1939, in the region of 400 men were engaged with the construction of the station and work was progressing on the construction of huts and the underground services.Mona‚Äôs Herald. Tuesday 17 January 1939 Also at this time the contract for the electrical installation was awarded to the Doncaster Colliery Supply Co., Ltd.Ramsey Courier. Friday 27 January 1939 As the work continued, it was decided that additional land would be required. Tynwald approved the additional compulsory purchase of land in the area, this being undertaken by the Government Property Trustees. =Station design= The station consisted of one F Type hangar, two T2 types, four Bellman hangars and nineteen Blister hangars. There were also technical and domestic buildings. The remaining aerodrome buildings (for technical activities and accommodation) were built in a compact layout behind the hangars, in an arrangement replicated across all of the Expansion Period airfields: Technical Area, Station Offices, Officers' Mess, Sergeants' Mess and Airmen's' Quarters. Roads were arranged either parallel or perpendicular to the Ballamenagh Road (A14) with the Guardroom directly facing the main entrance. Admiral Sir Percy Noble C-in-C Western Approaches, takes the salute during his visit to RAF Jurby, June 11, 1942. On the north side of the Ballamenagh Road was the parade ground. Heating in the technical rooms and classrooms was provided by hot water from a central coal-fired boiler supplied by a towered cistern. The whole station was connected by a Tannoy public address system. =Station defence= The defence of the station was undertaken by 2778 Squadron RAF Regiment (2778 Sqn). The airfield was surrounded by 10 pillboxes (nine of which survive) and in addition there were seventeen trench air raid shelters to afford protection in the event of an attack. The shelters were brick constructed and covered with an earthen bank. They measured x the combined capacity of which could accommodate up to 800 personnel. On the eastern side of the airfield was situated the Bomb Store. The bombs were taken from there to the aircraft in order for them to carry out their practice missions which would involve them dropping the ordnance on the nearby target ranges, controlled by RAF Jurby Head. Due to its importance the Bomb Store was protected by four pillboxes as well as an earthen bank in order to afford protection from an explosion. A Vosper Thornycroft 68ft Rescue & Target Towing Launch which was a type used by the 1113 MCU at Holyhead =Boat Station= Part of the development of RAF Jurby saw the creation of an RAF boat station at Ramsey. Air Ministry officials visited Ramsey in September 1938 as final plans for the station were drawn up. The station comprised a slipway and a boathouse with accommodation for 30 personnel.Isle of Man Examiner, Friday 2 September 1938 Page: 9 Two plots of land were required for the construction of the slipway and boathouse, the land concerned being on North Shore Road.Ramsey Courier, Friday 21 April 1939 The purpose of the station was to provide boats for the towing of the targets to be used in the bombing ranges and also to provide protection for the ranges. With the coming of war and the expansion of operations this boat station would evolve, becoming an RAF Air Sea Rescue Station. Second World War Initially designated to be the No. 5 Armament Training Station, construction of RAF Jurby had been completed by the beginning of hostilities and officially opened on 18 September 1939 as No. 5 Air Observers School, which subsequently became the No. 5 Bombing and Gunnery School on 1 December. The station's Commanding Officer at this time was Wing Commander T. Ivens who was promoted to Group Captain in January 1940. From its opening RAF Jurby came under the control of Headquarters of 25 Group, RAF.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 6 May 1955; Page: 3 The Handley Page Heyford had been withdrawn from front line service by the outbreak of war, relegated to training stations. =No. 5 Bombing and Gunnery School= The role of the station as designated pre-war was to facilitate the training of bomber crews and referred to as an: Aircraft Armament Training Camp. The aircraft employed for the training were such as the Handley Page Heyford, which had started to be replaced in 1937 from the front line squadrons, having been deemed obsolete.Thetford 1957, p.246.Donald, David, ed. The Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. London: Aerospace Publishing, 1997. . Additional aircraft arrived, swelling the station's compliment, prominent amongst which was the Bristol Blenheim MkI. Air firing was practised on drogues towed behind single-engined aircraft specially adapted for the purpose. Westland Wallaces, Hawker Henleys and Fairey Battles were all used for this. As other aircraft types became obsolete regarding front line operations, so they too were transferred into the training role. Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys, released from operational squadrons, arrived at RAF Jurby in April 1940 joining the other aircraft types on the station. Some of the Whitleys had served with 166 Squadron, which had been disbanded in April and absorbed into No. 10 OTU at RAF Abingdon and from there a detachment went to RAF Jurby so as to gain further experience. The detachment was formed from \\"C Flight\\" No. 10 OTU, arriving at Jurby on 6 April. For this reason Leonard Cheshire arrived at RAF Jurby on 21 May 1940. Cheshire had trained on Avro Ansons and was undertaking conversion to Whitley bombers at No 10. OTU at Abingdon when the unit was transferred to Jurby. Following this Cheshire was posted to 102 Squadron. Another type which found a home at RAF Jurby was the Handley Page Hereford. These Napier Dagger engined aircraft had provided numerous problems with engine cooling which resulted in most of those built (by Short & Harland) being re-engined as Hampdens. The surviving Herefords served in training units only. Trainee observers approach Handley Page Hampdens of No. 5 Bombing and Gunnery School at RAF Jurby. There were a total of 28 Handley Page Herefords based at Jurby. As stated, the Napier Dagger engines of 1,000 h.p. were a constant source of trouble through overheating. Consequently, the Herefords had to have special treatment by being positioned close to the runway before engines were started up by the trolley acs, so they could take off for the bombing ranges with the minimum of delay. =Fighter Squadrons= Following the fall of France and the subsequent availability of bases in the Pas-de-Calais and low countries, the Luftwaffe undertook a strategic offensive against the industrialised regions of north-west England, Northern Ireland and central Scotland. Ideally situated to offer protection to these areas, RAF Jurby became home to five fighter squadrons for various periods between November 1940 and October 1941. The Jurby operation was subsequently augmented by the opening of a dedicated fighter station, RAF Andreas, in the autumn of 1941. At this time the fighter aircraft at both RAF Jurby and RAF Andreas came under the control of No. 9 Group RAF. Boulton Paul Defiant in the markings of No.307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron, as it would of appeared during the squadron's tenure at RAF Jurby 307 Squadron 307th Polish Night Fighter SquadronThe first fighter squadron at RAF Jurby was No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron (307 Sqn) which arrived from RAF Kirton- in-Lindsey on 7 November 1940. This night fighter unit operated the Boulton Paul Defiant in its assigned role with the squadron coding EW. Under the command of Squadron Leader Stanis≈Çaw Pietraszkiewicz the squadron completed its operational work-up at Jurby, becoming operational on 4 December 1940. By this time 307 Sqn was commanded by the maverick Squadron Leader, Stanis≈Çaw Grodzicki, and 307 Sqn made their first operational sortie on 8 December. The squadron also provided a detachment from Jurby in order to cover Cranage and from the beginning of 1941 an additional detachment was sent to RAF Squire's Gate so as to provide defensive cover to Liverpool and Manchester. This detachment was joined by the rest of 307 Sqn when they left Jurby on 23 January. During its time a RAF Jurby 307 Sqn also operated Miles Masters, which were used in a training role. 258 Squadron The first Hawker Hurricane Squadron to arrive at RAF Jurby was 258 Squadron (258 Sqn) which displayed the squadron code FH. The squadron had previously been based at RAF Acklington and took the place of 307 Sqn, arriving at Jurby in late January 1941. The tenure of 258 Sqn was brief, with the squadron leaving the station in April. 312 Squadron RAF312SqA second Hurricane squadron arrived to take the place of the departed 258 Sqn in April. Assigned the squadron code DU and manned mostly by Czechoslovak personnel, 312 Squadron (312 Sqn) had been based RAF Speke where it had been engaged defending the Port of Liverpool, after which it had a brief spell carrying out convoy patrols from RAF Valley before transferring to RAF Jurby. Whilst at Jurby the squadron undertook further convoy patrols over the Irish Sea and intensive low flying and firing practice over the Ayres. Like the previous residents 312 Sqn's time at Jurby was short-lived, moving south in May 1941, when it began escort missions from south-west England. 302 Squadron PSP Dywizjon 302The next fighter squadron resident at RAF Jurby was No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron (302 Sqn) taking up residence in May 1941 with the squadron designation WX. This was a battle-hardened squadron, having been formed in July 1940 from Polish airmen who had escaped the invasion of France. The squadron had seen action towards the end of the Battle of Britain whilst based at RAF Northolt. In addition to providing defence against the Luftwaffe's night offensive, 302 Sqn also undertook convoy patrols in the Irish Sea. In August 1941 302 Sqn vacated Jurby, moving to the south of England and re-equipping with Supermarine Spitfires. 457 Squadron 457 Squadron badge.jpegThe first Spitfires arrived at RAF Jurby in August 1941. They belonged to 457 Squadron (457 Sqn) coded BP. At the time of its formation the squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Peter Malam Brothers, both flight commanders and all members of the ground crew were British, but most pilots were Australian. The squadron's ground crew component had been formed at RAAF Station Williamtown in Australia on 10 June, and departed for England on 7 August; the same day 457 Sqn moved to RAF Jurby. Making full use of the training facilities, the squadron was also used as a clearing unit for pilots of No. 452 Squadron which at this time was operating in the south of England. In October 1941, 457 Sqn departed RAF Jurby to become the first squadron to reside at the newly opened RAF Andreas. =No. 5 Air Observer School= Following the findings of the Butt Report, citing a required improvement in the standards of navigation, RAF Jurby reverted to its former title of No. 5 Air Observer School in July 1941 with navigation, bomb aiming and air gunnery now forming part the station's remit. As part of the re-organisation Handley Page Hampdens arrived at Jurby as they were removed from front line operations, joining the Avro Ansons and the other training aircraft. Instructors were screened personnel who had completed a tour of operations on a front line bomber squadron. A student observer contemplates his 'office' in the nose of a Hampden before embarking on an early-morning flight at No. 5 Air Observers School, RAF Jurby, January 1942. By the beginning of 1943 the Hampdens had gone and were being replaced by Avro Anson trainers, a total of 60 being recorded in February. The station's compliment still included 6 Blenheim I's and 15 Blenheim IV's together with 10 Westland Lysanders. Further changes were being made to meet the demands of Bomber Command whose mainstay was now the Lancaster and Halifax which required seven crew members. The title 'Observer' disappeared to be replaced by more specialised categories\\\\- Navigator (N), Bomb Aimer (B) and Air Gunner (AG). At this time Bomber Command were also starting to benefit from advancements in radio navigation such as GEE and the ground mapping radar H2S. By 1944 the RAF Training Command was also receiving qualified Navigators, Bomb Aimers and Air Gunners from the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. This led to another re-organisation of the training undertaken at RAF Jurby which became known as the No. 5 Air Navigation and Bombing School from February 1944. Bristol Blenheim Mark IV, Z5969 'P3', taxys past other Blenheims and Handley Page Hampdens of No. 5 Air Observers School, in an early January morning at Jurby, Isle of Man Operation Millennium The appointment of Sir Arthur Harris as Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command saw the direction of the strategic operations against Germany altered, part of which was to be the undertaking of a 1,000 bomber raid. The target of the raid was to be Cologne, the raid being carried out on the night of 30‚Äì31 May 1942 and code named Operation Millennium. RAF Bomber Command front line strength at this time numbered approximately 400 aircraft, it therefore being obvious that were the raid to meet the required composition aircraft from other branches of the Royal Air Force would be required for the undertaking. Aircraft were taken from both 91 and 92 Groups, Bomber Command's own operational training units, with further aircraft sourced from RAF Flying Training Command. At Jurby five Hampdens were taken off training duties and made ready.Ramsey Courier, Friday, 14 September 1945; Page: 3 These were to be led by Wing Commander 'Jumbo' Edwards, an Oxford rowing blue, who was in charge of all flying operations at Jurby and who planned and flew all the routes used by the trainee navigators. Part of this readiness saw the yellow coloured undersides of the Hampdens required for training, being replaced by the matt black of Bomber Command. However, it was found that the rather worn-out Hampdens were not up to operational standards, being insufficiently equipped for night bombing operations and despite every effort by the crews during the waiting period, they, along with many other of the Training Command aircraft, were eventually scrubbed from the mission. RAF Jurby did however contribute five aircraft towards the first 1,000 bomber raid which was carried out against Essen two nights later.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 14 September 1945 p.1. =No. 5 Air Navigation and Bombing School= RAF Jurby was now responsible for the training of the type of navigator who would also have to be a bomb aimer in the medium bombers such as the Beaufighter and Mosquito.http://www.30squadron.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=165&Itemid;=40 With air gunnery no longer part of the curriculum the Blenheims and Lysanders departed making room for more Ansons which were to number over 80 at this time. The Ansons had been specially adapted for the navigation and bomb aiming training role with the 'glasshouse' turret removed. A desk was provided for the student navigator and a perspex panel in the nose was provided for the bomb aimer who lay in the prone position in front of the pilot. Each Anson was assigned to a specific flight; 'A' flight (bomb aiming) and 'B' and 'C' flights (navigation). Now in use was the advanced Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight which could self-adjust according to air and wind speeds fed into it. To operate correctly a minimum speed of 120 knots was required which, due to form drag, even on full throttle was difficult for the Anson to achieve with bomb doors open and external racks fitted. Bombs carried were 22 lb flash bombs, four of which were carried internally and four of which were carried externally on the bomb racks. For night work, an infra red target light was positioned on the Derbyhaven breakwater. Most of the bombing was done at various altitudes up to 6,000 feet, about the normal limit for the Anson.Hall, Alan W. and Eric Taylor. Avro Anson Marks I, III, IV & X. London: Almark Publishing Co. Ltd., 1972. . =No. 5 Air Navigation School= The renaming of the training facility made little difference to the training programme at RAF Jurby. The Empire Air Training Scheme had been wound up leaving home training stations such as Jurby. A Vickers Wellington, which formed part of No. 5 Air Navigation School at RAF Jurby. The ageing Ansons were gradually being replaced by Wellington Mk Xs which now formed a conversion unit for advanced bombing techniques, while the Ansons continued with the navigation work. The personnel compliment on the Station by this time was in the region of 2,500.Ramsey Courier. Friday 26 September 1947. P.2. With the ending of the war in the Pacific Theatre, the RAF began its post-war period of contraction, and on 17 September 1946, No. 5 Air Navigation School moved out and transferred to RAF Topcliffe in Yorkshire. During 1945, RAF Jurby received various visits from Lockheed Lodestars which were ferrying Norwegian collaborators to be held in internee encampments on the island.Island of Barbard Wire, Connery Chappell, Corgi Books, 1986. =No. 11 Air Gunnery School= The change of role at RAF Andreas from that of a fighter station to that of a training establishment saw the creation of No. 11 Air Gunnery School. Whilst at Andreas air gunners underwent an intensive ten-week course, before passing on to the operational training units of RAF Bomber Command. With the closure of RAF Andreas at the end of September 1946, No. 11 Air Gunnery School transferred to Jurby and the Station had a brief spell of further activity, but this in turn ceased with the disbandment of the school in October 1947. Post war Over 7,000 personnel had passed through the Station by the end of hostilities in 1945. By September 1947 the Station was under the command of Group Captain Edward Laine, however following the disbandment of No. 11 Air Gunnery School in October, the future of RAF Jurby became uncertain. One suggestion was that the Station would become a venue for ATC training. In 1948 various fixtures of the Station were sold off by tender, these included 9 Blister hangars and 20 Nissen huts. In the immediate post-war period the Station had also been used as a diversion aerodrome for Ronaldsway Airport ‚Äì much as had Hall Caine Airport before the war ‚Äì and this availability continued following the Station's placement on care and maintenance.Ramsey Courier Friday, 6 February 1948 Page: 3 Numerous diversions continued due to Ronaldsway's susceptibility to advection fog, however due to the down grading of the airfield facilities at Jurby approach options were limited and it afforded no ability for night operations.Ramsey Courier Friday, 26 November 1948 Page: 6 This use as a diversionary airport for Ronaldsway continued through 1949 and into the 1950s. An agreement was made with the Air Ministry to enable the use of the Station and ground staff from Ronaldsway would be transported to Jurby in order to support the operation. The Station saw limited use at the end of April 1948, when it was used for an exercise by No. 515 Light Anti Aircraft Regiment, (RA), (TA), which was carrying out a practice defence deployment of the aerodrome.Green FinalSaturday, 1 May 1948 Page: 2 The Station was also hosted a model aircraft rally, organised by the Manx Model Aircraft Club.Mona's HeraldTuesday, 27 July 1948 Page: 5 The RAF Air Sea Rescue Boat Station at Ramsey, part of the Royal Air Force Marine Branch, remained active with a composition of two rescue launches.Mona's Herald. Tuesday, 22 March 1955 Page: =No. 1 Initial Training School= In April 1950 a new role was found for RAF Jurby when the Station became home to No.1 Initial Training School with the Station forming part of 23 Group.Ramsey Courier Friday, 22 September 1950 Page: 3 No.1 Initial Training School had been formed in 1949 and both wings, under the command of Group Captain John Jefferson,Ramsey CourierFriday, 8 June 1951 Page: 5 subsequently moved to Jurby with Group Captain Jefferson assuming the role of Station Commander.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39243/supplement/3069/data.pdf All prospective RAF pilots and navigators, apart from those trained at RAF Cranwell for permanent commissions, underwent 18 months training broken down into three six-month periods. The first six months formed the preliminary training period prior to flying training, the second and third periods would see basic and applied flying introduced. Advertisement for an air display at RAF Jurby (1960) RAF Jurby was the first establishment of its kind, however its annual output of 1,600 cadet pilots and cadet navigators was soon found out to be insufficient for operational requirements and as a consequence other schools were formed. Under the training programme trainees spent 24 weeks at Jurby, and upon successful completion of the initial stage the prospective candidates would be promoted to the rank of acting pilot officer on probation, this probationary period continuing until the end of the flying training. Training at Jurby covered a wide range of subjects including drill, outdoor sport and leadership exercises. The technical syllabus would cover such subjects as meteorology, aerodynamics and radio operations both for communication and navigation. Whilst by this stage the Station was not a full- time operational flying station gliding was available to the cadets, this being carried out in two seat Sedbergh trainers. In addition Jurby had a communications flight which contained Chipmunks and Ansons. Initiative exercises would also take place in the mountains including survival training and mountain treks and there was also an assault course. During the summer months sailing and fishing would also be available. The Station underwent a period of upgrading in early 1951 when new structures for the accommodation and training of personnel were added. These additions comprised barrack rooms and lecture rooms and the conversion of the senior Cadet's Mess into a new Sergeant's Mess. On completion of the upgrade RAF Jurby could accommodate over 800 cadets.Ramsey CourierFriday, 17 August 1951 Page: 4 RAF Jurby produced its own station magazine entitled, \\"It's Yours.\\" The magazine featured articles and illustrations by Station personnel, and was also of interest to residents of the north of the Isle of Man as many of the articles referred to local issues. The price of the magazine was one shilling.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 27 July 1951; Page: 3 Following a reorganisation within the RAF, Jurby became part of 54 Group in May 1951.Ramsey Courier Friday, 20 April 1951 Page: 4 The Station continued as part of 54 Group until the Group's disbandment in 1953 after which RAF Jurby came under the umbrella of 21 Group. In August 1951 the Station received a visit from Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor who was accompanied by the Commander-in-Chief Flying Training Command, Sir Hugh Walmsley and the Air Officer Commanding 54 Group, Air Commodore Alan Betts.Mona's Herald. Tuesday, 7 August 1951; Page: 8 In the spring of 1953 it was announced that the No. 1 Initial Training School at RAF Jurby would close at the end of May of that year.Ramsey Courier. Friday, 17 April 1953; Page: 4 All traces of the operation were gone by early June, and RAF Jurby was placed on care and maintenance. Despite the Station being inactive, work continued on the construction of permanent married quarters on the site.Mona's Herald. Tuesday, 11 August 1953; Page: 5 The period of care and maintenance was short lived, and RAF Jurby became a training establishment for ground-based officers, NCOs and cadets attached to the RAF Regiment and other branches of the service. Following the departure of No. 1 Initial Training School, RAF Jurby was subsequently transferred from the Control of No. 54 Group to No. 21 Group, and later in the year to Headquarters No. 22 Group under whose control it was destined to become the No. 1 Officer Cadet Training Unit. Passing Out Parade of members of No.1 Officer Cadet Training Unit, January 1957. =No. 1 Officer Cadet Training Unit= The Royal Air Force Officer Cadet Training Unit which was established at RAF Jurby was an amalgamation of the Officer Cadet Training Units from RAF Millom and RAF Spitalgate. Initially intended to be under the command of Group Captain George Richmond the unit opened at Jurby on 10 September 1953.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, 29 August 1953; Section: Front page, Page: 1 RAF Jurby Mountain Rescue Team In common with numerous other Royal Air Force Stations, RAF Jurby formed its own Mountain Rescue Unit. The team was used to locate crashed aircraft, both civilian and military, and on occasion the team would be airlifted across to the mainland in order to assist in rescue operations. The mountain rescue team would also exhibit their equipment at the annual Families Day.Isle of Man Times Saturday, 13 September 1947. Page: 4 At Home Days One of the highlights of the year would be the annual \\"At Home Day\\" which would see the Station personnel display the varied aspects of Station life to the general public, the occasion usually being held in commemoration of the Battle of Britain. The 1951 \\"At Home Day\\" featured aerobatic displays by De Haviland Vampire and Gloster Meteor jets, a rocket- assisted take off by a Fairey Barracuda of the Fleet Air Arm, a bombing demonstration given by de Havilland Mosquitos and a fly past by Avro Lincolns and Boeing Washingtons of RAF Bomber Command. In addition pleasure flights were available to the general public, operated by Manx Air Charters. On the Technical Site there was a gymnastic display, a dinghy drill in the static water tank and an exhibition of the clothing and equipment of the RAF Jurby Mountain Rescue Team.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday, 14 September 1951; Page: 4 Incidents As with so many other RAF Stations, RAF Jurby was no stranger to accidents; the mountainous backbone of the Isle of Man was notorious for its blanket of mist, and to the inexperienced pilot this could easily lead to tragedy. RAF Jurby's position as being primarily a Training Station meant that the majority of pilots operating from the station were of low experience, and it is documented that in the three-year period to the end of 1942, there had been 31 aircraft involved in accidents, with the loss of 76 lives. The majority of these did involve aircraft from RAF Jurby, but the figures also include aircraft from other stations such as RAF Silloth and RAF Millom. The first fatal wartime accident on Manx soil occurred on 3 January 1940, when an aircraft on a training flight from RAF Upper Heyford crashed into Snaefell in bad visibility, killing all three crew members. By mid 1941, fatal accidents were averaging one a month, and often involved the loss of life of several crew members. The Air Sea Rescue launches were kept on constant standby at the bombing and gunnery ranges. Even so, by the end of 1942 thirty-one lives had been lost in seven ditchings. thumb The list below details several incidents either involving Jurby-based aircraft or aircraft from other bases which crashed at the airfield. * 13 January 1940 ‚Äì RAF Jurby lost its first aircraft when a Fairey Battle went down at Ballamooar Curraghs after stalling whilst attempting to release its drogue. The pilot was killed. * 27 March 1941 ‚Äì a fully armed Handley Page Hereford based at RAF Jurby, crashed onto Ballaragh farm house in Lonan. The Hereford was approaching the coast on a wet and foggy morning when it crashed into the roof of the farmhouse, three of the four crew members were killed. * 9 September 1941 ‚Äì on this day, two aircraft were lost over the Isle of Man. The first, a Blackburn Botha based at the Coastal Command training station at RAF Silloth, crashed into North Barrule with the loss of all five lives. In the second crash, Jurby lost three aircrew when a Handley Page Hereford crashed at Ballacreggan Farm, Bride. * 23 June 1942 ‚Äì two Jurby-based Blenheims collided over Knockaloe Farm, south of Peel. They were on gunnery practice and were criss-crossing behind the drogue being towed by a Lysander. The Blenheims crashed in pieces into the fields below, both crews of three being killed. * 26 June 1942 ‚Äì an Avro Anson crashed at Scout's Glen, Castleward, Douglas. The crew of six were killed. * 27 November 1944 ‚Äì a Vickers Wellington MkX, LP176, belonging to No. 85 Operational Training Unit RAF (85 OTU) based at RAF Husbands Bosworth was carrying out a training sortie over the Irish Sea when it suffered a failure of its port engine. The pilot, Flight Sergeant E. Richmond, elected to land the aircraft at Jurby however during the course of the landing it became apparent that the aircraft was destined to over run the runway. Consequently, Flt Sgt Richmond elected to raise the landing gear in order to arrest the momentum of the aircraft resulting in the aircraft sustaining damage. All five crew members escaped the incident unharmed and although the aircraft sustained damage to various components, the damage was classified as Cat B (denoting the damage as slight). * 20 May 1945 ‚Äì a Sunderland flying boat of No. 423 Squadron had taken off from Loch Neagh to search for surrendering U-boats. While still climbing, the aircraft entered thick cloud over the Mourne Mountains and came in contact with one of the summits. The hull was badly damaged and one of the engines caught fire. Unable to return to base, the aircraft headed for RAF Jurby. Instead of landing on the grass, the pilot elected to land the aircraft on the No. 2 runway, sending up showers of sparks as it ground to a halt. The crew were able to abandon the flying boat before it was destroyed by fire and the resulting massive explosion from the four depth charges on board. * 26 May 1959 ‚Äì Avro Anson VM322 was landing at RAF Jurby following a flight from RAF North Coates when the tire on the right main landing gear burst temporarily resulting in the aircraft becoming uncontrollable. The aircraft subsequently came to rest enabling the two crew members on board to escape the aircraft without injury. The aircraft was subsequently written off. The grave of Group Captain Francis Richard Worthington, St. Patrick's Church, Jurby =Avro Anson VM418= Arguably the most well-known crash concerning RAF Jurby occurred on Thursday 6 September 1953,Mona's Herald, Tuesday, 22 September 1953; Page: 6 and involved two Station Commanders; Group Captain Francis Worthington (RAF Jurby) and Group Captain George Richmond (RAF Millom).Ramsey Courier, Friday, 11 September 1953; Page: 2 Group Captain Worthington had flown to RAF Millom in the Jurby communications aircraft, Avro Anson T. Mk.20 VM418, in order to collect Group Captain Richmond who was due to succeed him as Station Commander as part of the Station's transition from No. 1 Initial Training School to No. 1 Officer Cadet Training Unit. The aircraft departed RAF Millom at 12:40hrs with the two Group Captains on board, together with another two passengers; Wing Commander Francis Fenton and Squadron Leader Roy Charter. The weather on the day was reported as misty, the conditions shrouding the mountainous spine of the Isle of Man, and when the Anson failed to arrive at Jurby at its allotted time of 13:15hrs a search and rescue operation was put into effect. The wreckage of the Anson was found on the slopes of Clagh Ouyr (1,808 ft) above the Black Hut on the Snaefell mountain road. All four occupants died as a result the impact. An RAF Court of Inquiry was held and the findings were that there was no mechanical or technical failure of the aircraft and that the accident was caused by a navigation error with no allocation of blame. An inquest was held at Ramsey which in turn recorded the same conclusion. The body of Group Captain Worthington was buried at St. Patrick's Church, Jurby. Freedoms Bestowed on Station During its existence, RAF Jurby received both the Freedom of Ramsey and the Freedom of Douglas. =Freedom of Ramsey= Saturday 29 April 1955, saw the Freedom of Ramsey bestowed on RAF Jurby. The town's Market Place was used as a parade ground for the occasion, with the Title Deed presented by the Chairman of Ramsey Commissioners to Group Captain Burnett, Officer Commanding RAF Jurby. The parade consisted of 300 airmen and 20 officers, with the Royal Air Force Ensign being flown from the flagstaff of Ramsey Town Hall. Among those in attendance was the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Ambrose Dundas Flux Dundas, the Lord Bishop of the Isle of Man and the Air Officer Commanding No. 22 Group, Air Vice Marshal James Fuller-Good. Music was provided by the No. 1 Regional Band of the RAF. =Freedom of Douglas= In August 1957 Royal Air Force Station Jurby received the Freedom of the Borough of Douglas. The event was marked by a parade along Douglas Promenade.Holiday News.

On conclusion they flew out from RAF Jurby on a Douglas Dakota of the King's Flight to RAF Northolt.Isle of Man Times. Saturday 7 July 1945. Military graves at Jurby Parish Church, Isle of Man Closure On Thursday 10 January 1963 an announcement was made that RAF Jurby was to close in the autumn of that year.Peel City Guardian, Saturday, 12 January 1963; Page: 2 The announcement was made by the Station's commanding officer who also stated that the Officer Cadet Training Unit would transfer to RAF Feltwell. It was also stated that of the 230 civilians employed at the base and that those who were 'established' (i.e. had been employed for more than three years) would be offered alternative employment within the government. Having been at the forefront of local life in many aspects, particularly that concerning sport, the news of the closure of RAF Jurby was met with widespread sadness on the Isle of Man.Green Final, Saturday, 7 September 1963; Page: 2Green Final, Saturday, 19 October 1963; Page: 6 RAF Jurby closed in September of that year. Post-RAF and Current use During the early 1970s the camp area of the airfield was used as a training camp for the Territorial Army. The airfield is in part still usable. Many of the airfield buildings on the northern side of the Ballamenagh Road were demolished in the mid to late 2000s and only the road and path layouts exist alongside foundations.road and path layouts maps.google.com One of the original wooden buildings that formed the officers mess survived until December 2009. Having been built in 1938 to last for just 10 years it was converted in the 1960s to a hotel, the Jurby Hotel. Plans were announced in 2009 to build a new health centre on the sitehttp://www.gov.im/transport/drainage/ViewNews.gov?page=lib/news/dhss/dhsstodelivernew.xml&menuid;=11570 and the Jurby Health and Community Centre opened in January 2012 Many of the original hangars can still be seen on the south side of the Ballamenagh Road though have been re-clad with more modern materials. This area received a ¬£2m government injection to fund a new main entrance with resurfaced roads in 2008 and is known as the Jurby Industrial Estate. Other buildings including the Control Tower and the increasingly rare timber buildings survive in various states of disrepair, some of which date back to 1939. The former Guard House has been developed into a cafe and restaurant. The work carried out to the building consisted of replacing the exterior to look like-for-like and replacing certain parts of the interior. Other buildings remain in use including the largest hangar which is home to lorry and large vehicle mechanics. The airfield had been used for an annual airshows until 2004. Since its inaugural event in 2009, the airfield has been home to the annual Jurby Festival of Speedhttp://www.vmcciom.org/manxrally.htm Jurby Festival of Speed which takes place on the middle Sunday of the Islands Classic TT (formerly Grand Prix) fortnight. Although not an airshow, the 2012 festival received a flypast from a Spitfire and a C-47 Dakota in 2013. The main events of the day are a bike rally and friendly races around the \\"course\\" which takes in sections of the runway, taxiway and perimeter track. Attendance to the site has reached 10,000 people. Motor Sports are able to make use of the airfield course all year round. The Visual Control Room, Jurby Airfield From 2007 to 2016, one of the re-clad RAF Bellman hangars was home to the facilities of Excalibur Almazhttp://www.excaliburalmaz.com/ Excalibur Almaz whose office base is in Douglas, the capital of the Isle of Man. The company bought two Soviet Spacecraft for temporary storage with the intention of launching passenger trips to space by 2013 (launching from a former CIS-state rather than the Isle of Man). The craft were imported into the Isle of Man in 2011, and then removed when Excalibur's lease expired in 2016. Their equipment was never launched and is to be converted into an educational exhibit. Another of the re-clad Bellman hangars (Hangar 230) has been home to the free-entry Jurby Transport Museumhttp://jtmiom.im/ Jurby Transport Museum since 2010. The museum is home to many buses and trams that have formed part of the islands public transport network for many years. In keeping with their aviation surroundings, there are the airship parts mentioned above, a Spitfire replica and a glider kept in pieces in the back storage yard. There is a business located on the airfield since 1972. Jurby Junk Jurby Junk was set up in 1972 in the old armoury on the airfield site. The business was later moved into two purpose built warehouse units with one half dedicated to books. The business has been since inception by Stella Pixton who is the daughter of Howard Pixton ‚Äì the first British winner of the Schneider Trophy Air race in 1914. =Manx Gliding Club= The Manx Gliding Club formed at Jurby Airfield in the early 1990s with a single Slinsby T.53. Gliding had initially taken place by the Royal Air Force at RAF Jurby during the 1950s flying Slingsby T.31's & T.21's. After the RAF left Jurby gliding on the island had discontinued. The club was renamed the Islanders Gliding Club joining the British Gliding Association in the 1990s. Additional funds were spent on winches, ground equipment, additional aircraft such as an Auster and a Ka2b. Due to high rents at Jurby the club soon moved on to a small airfield at Hall Caine and then to Andreas Airfield and thus regular flying activity ceased again at Jurby.Manx Gliding http://www.manxgliding.org/features/glidinghistory/ =Advanced Airship Corporation= In late 1982, a newly demerged airship company (Wren Skyships) relocated to Jurby airfield from Cardington in Bedfordshire. The firm began work on a new design, the Advanced Non-Rigid (ANR). Wren Skyships became the Advanced Airship Corporation (AAC) in 1988. Construction of the prototype ANR was commenced, but envelope problems delayed its completion, and AAC went into liquidation during the early 1990s recession. The prototype gondola prototype gondola was moved to a site in Shropshire after liquidation of AAC and now exists in a museum in the Netherlands. Some parts were stored for some time in a hangar on the airfield site and more recently re-located to the Manx Transport Museum which opened in Jurby in 2009. The large hangar built for the airship was removed and the base of the building is now home to a go-kart track. =Isle of Man Prison= The Isle of Man prison was re-located to Jurby Airfield in 2008 from a dilapidated Victorian building in Douglas. The prison is built within the airfield site with the entrance road cutting through the otherwise untouched western taxiway.

Elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were an element of literature from its beginning, though the idea of a distinct genre, in the modern sense, is less than two centuries old. The parallel article History of fantasy deals mainly with fantasy literature in the English language. The history of French fantasy is covered in greater detail under Fantastique. Ancient Near East The Epic of Gilgamesh was written over generations following the supposed reign of King Gilgamesh, and is seen as a mythologized version of his life. This figure is sometimes an influence and, more rarely, a figure in modern fantasy.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Gilgamesh\\", p 410 Some scholars believe The Epic of Gilgamesh, specifically the story of Noah and the flood. The magic part of fantasy is partly due to the Mesopotamian world: the use of \\"magical words\\" that have the power to command the spirits; to resort to a magical circle to defend the wizard against the spirits invoked; the use of mysterious symbols or seals to invoke spirits; the use of amulets that represent the image of the demon to exorcise it. South Asian The Vedic civilization situated around the Indus river valley has a long tradition of fantastical stories and characters, dating back to Vedic mythology. Several modern fantasy works such as RG Veda draw on the Rig-Veda as a source. Brahman folklore was an evolution of the earlier Vedic mythology and had many more fantastical stories and characters, particularly in the Indian epics, such as the Mahabharata by Vyasa, and the Ramayana by Valmiki, both of which were influential in Asia. The Panchatantra (Fables of Bidpai) was influential in Europe and the Middle East. It used various animal fables and magical tales to illustrate the central Indian principles of political science. Talking animals endowed with human qualities have now become a staple of modern fantasy.Richard Matthews (2002). Fantasy: The Liberation of Imagination, p. 8-10. Routledge. . The Baital Pachisi (Vikram and the Vampire) is a collection of various fantasy tales set within a frame story about an encounter between King VikramƒÅditya and a Vetala, an early mythical creature resembling a vampire. According to Richard Francis Burton and Isabel Burton, the Baital Pachisi \\"is the germ which culminated in the Arabian Nights, and which inspired the Golden Ass of Apuleius, Boccacio's Decamerone, the Pentamerone, and all that class of facetious fictitious literature.\\"Isabel Burton, Preface, in Richard Francis Burton (1870), Vikram and The Vampire. Greco-Roman alt=Circe Offering the Cup to Odysseus.jpg Heracles and Hydra Classical mythology is replete with fantastical stories and characters, the best known (and perhaps the most relevant to modern fantasy) being the works of Homer (Greek) and Virgil (Roman).John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Taproot texts\\", p 921 The contribution of the Greco-Roman world to fantasy is vast and includes: The hero's journey (also the figure of the chosen hero); magic gifts donated to win (including the ring of power as in the Gyges story contained in the Republic of Plato), prophecies (the oracle of Delphi), monsters and creatures (especially Dragons), magicians and witches with the use of magic. The philosophy of Plato has had great influence on the fantasy genre. In the Christian Platonic tradition, the reality of other worlds, and an overarching structure of great metaphysical and moral importance, has lent substance to the fantasy worlds of modern works.Stephen Prickett, Victorian Fantasy p 229 The world of magic is largely connected with the Roman Greek world. With Empedocles, the elements, they are often used in fantasy works as personifications of the forces of nature.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Elemental\\" p 313-4, Other than magic concerns include: the use of a mysterious tool endowed with special powers (the wand); the use of a rare magical herb; a divine figure that reveals the secret of the magical act. Myths especially important for fantasy include: The myth of Titans; the Gods of Olympus; Pan; Theseus, the hero who killed the Minotaur (with the labyrinth); Perseus, the hero who killed Medusa ( with the gift of magic objects and weapons); Heracles is probably the best known Greek hero; Achilles; the riddling Sphinx; Odysseus; Ajax; Jason (of the Argonauts); Female sorcerers as well Circe, Calypso and goddess Hecate; Daedalus and Icarus.  East Asia  The figures of Chinese dragons were influential on the modern fantasy use of the dragon, tempering the greedy, thoroughly evil, even diabolical Western dragon; many modern fantasy dragons are humane and wise. Chinese traditions have been particularly influential in the vein of fantasy known as Chinoiserie, including such writers as Ernest Bramah and Barry Hughart.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Chinoiserie\\", p 189 Taoist beliefs about neijin and its influence on martial arts have been a major influence on wuxia, a subgenre of the martial arts film that is sometimes fantasy, when the practice of wuxia is used fictitiously to achieve super-human feats, as in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Eric Yin, \\"A Definition of Wuxia and Xia\\" Islamic Middle East \\"Ali Baba\\" by Maxfield Parrish The most well known fiction from the Islamic world was The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights), which was a compilation of many ancient and medieval folk tales. The epic took form in the tenth century and reached its final form by the fourteenth century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Arabian fantasy\\", p 51 All Arabian fairy tales were often called \\"Arabian Nights\\" when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, in any version, and a number of tales are known in Europe as \\"Arabian Nights\\" despite existing in no Arabic manuscript. This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland.L. Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, p 10 Many imitations were written, especially in France.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Arabian fantasy\\", p 52 Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. Part of its popularity may have sprung from the increasing historical and geographical knowledge, so that places of which little was known and so marvels were plausible had to be set further \\"long ago\\" or farther \\"far away\\"; this is a process that continue, and finally culminate in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. A number of elements from Persian and Arabian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. When L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.James Thurber, \\"The Wizard of Chitenango\\", p 64 Fantasists on Fantasy edited by Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, The Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, is a mythical and heroic retelling of Persian history. Amir Arsalan was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as The Heroic Legend of Arslan. Medieval Europe Thor's Fight with the Giants, by M√•rten Eskil Winge, 1872 Medieval European sources of fantasy occurred primarily in epic poetry and in the Fornaldarsagas, Norse and Icelandic sagas, both of which are based on ancient oral tradition. The influence of these works on the German Romantics, as well as William Morris, and J. R. R. Tolkien means that their influence on later fantasy has been large.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Nordic fantasy\\", p 692 =Anglo-Saxon= Beowulf is among the best known of the Nordic tales in the English speaking world, and has had deep influence on the fantasy genre; although it was unknown for centuries and so not developed in medieval legend and romance, several fantasy works have retold the tale, such as John Gardner's Grendel.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Beowulf\\", p 107 =Norse= Norse mythology, as found in the Elder Edda and the Younger Edda, includes such figures as Odin and his fellow Aesir, and dwarves, elves, dragons, and giants.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Nordic fantasy\\", p 691 These elements have been directly imported into various fantasy works, and have deeply influenced others, both on their own and through their influence on Nordic sagas, Romanticism, and early fantasy writers. The Fornaldarsagas, literally tales of times past, or Legendary sagas, occasionally drew upon these older myths for fantastic elements. Such works as Grettis saga carried on that tradition; the heroes often embark on dangerous quests where they fight the forces of evil, dragons, witchkings, barrow-wights, and rescue fair maidens.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Saga\\", p 831 Fornalder (times past), painting by Peter Nicolai Arbo More historical sagas, such as V√∂lsunga saga and the Nibelungenlied, feature conflicts over thrones and dynasties that also reflect many motifs commonly found in epic fantasy. The starting point of the fornaldarsagas' influence on the creation of the Fantasy genre is the publication, in 1825, of the most famous Swedish literary work Frithjof's saga, which was based on the Fri√∞√æj√≥fs saga ins fr≈ìkna, and it became an instant success in England and Germany. It is said to have been translated twenty-two times into English, twenty times into German, and once at least into every European language, including modern Icelandic in 1866. Their influence on authors, such as J. R. R. Tolkien, William Morris and Poul Anderson and on the subsequent modern fantasy genre is considerable, and can perhaps not be overstated. =Celtic= Maev Celtic folklore and legend has been an inspiration for many fantasy works. The separate folklore of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland has sometimes been used indiscriminately for \\"Celtic\\" fantasy, sometimes with great effect; other writers have distinguished to use a single source.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Celtic fantasy\\", p 275 The Welsh tradition has been particularly influential, owing to its connection to King Arthur and its collection in a single work, the epic Mabinogion. One influential retelling of this was the fantasy work of Evangeline Walton: The Island of the Mighty, The Children of Llyr, The Song of Rhiannon, and Prince of Annwn. A notable amount of fiction has been written in the area of Celtic fantasy.Michael Moorcock, Wizardry & Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy p 101 The Irish Ulster Cycle and Fenian Cycle have also been plentifully mined for fantasy. Scottish tradition is less used, perhaps because of the spurious nature of the Ossian cycle, a nineteenth-century fraud claiming to have much older sources. Its greatest influence was, however, indirect. Celtic folklore and mythology provided a major source for the Arthurian cycle of chivalric romance: the Matter of Britain. Although the subject matter was heavily reworked by the authors, these romances developed marvels until they became independent of the original folklore and fictional, an important stage in the development of fantasy.Colin Manlove, Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present p 12 =Finnish= The Finnish epic, the Kalevala, although not published until the 19th century, is compiled from oral tradition dating back to an earlier period. J. R. R. Tolkien cited it, with the Finnish language he learned from it, as a major inspiration behind the Silmarillion.Tom Shippey, The Road to Middle-earth, p 242-3, Renaissance \\"Undine Rising From the Waters\\" by Chauncey Bradley Ives: an elemental as a force of nature. During the Renaissance, Giovanni Francesco Straparola wrote and published The Facetious Nights of Straparola, a collection of stories, many of which are literary fairy tales Giambattista Basile wrote and published the Pentamerone, a collection of literary fairy tales, the first collection of stories to contain solely the stories later to be known as fairy tales. Both of these works includes the oldest recorded form of many well-known (and more obscure) European fairy tales.Steven Swann Jones, The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination, Twayne Publishers, New York, 1995, , p38 This was the beginning of a tradition that would both influence the fantasy genre and be incorporated in it, as many works of fairytale fantasy appear to this day.L. Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, p 11 Although witchcraft and wizardry were both more commonly believed to be actual at the time, such motifs as the fairies in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Weird Sisters in Macbeth and Prospero in The Tempest (or Doctor Faustus in Christopher Marlowe's play) would be deeply influential on later works of fantasy. In a work on alchemy in the 16th century, Paracelsus identified four types of beings with the four elements of alchemy: gnomes, earth elementals; undines, water elementals; sylphs, air elementals; and salamanders, fire elementals.Carole B. Silver, Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness, p 38 Most of these beings are found in folklore as well as alchemy; their names are often used interchangeably with similar beings from folklore.C.S. Lewis, The Discarded Image, p135 Romanticism Arthur Rackham, illustration to Hansel and Gretel Romanticism, a movement of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, was a dramatic reaction to Rationalism, challenging the priority of reason and promoting the importance of imagination and spirituality. Its success in rehabilitating imagination was of fundamental importance to the evolution of fantasy, and its interest in medieval romances providing many motifs to modern fantasy.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Romanticism\\", p 821 In the later part of the Romantic tradition, in reaction to the spirit of the Enlightenment, folklorists collected folktales, epic poems, and ballads, and brought them out in printed form. The Brothers Grimm were inspired in their collection, Grimm's Fairy Tales, by the movement of German Romanticism. Many other collectors were inspired by the Grimms and the similar sentiments. Frequently their motives stemmed not merely from Romanticism, but from Romantic nationalism, in that many were inspired to save their own country's folklore: sometimes, as in the Kalevala, they compiled existing folklore into an epic to match other nation's; sometimes, as in Ossian, they fabricated folklore that should have been there. These works, whether fairy tale, ballads, or folk epics, were a major source for later fantasy works.Michael Moorcock, Wizardry & Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy p 35 Despite the nationalistic elements confusing the collections, this movement not only preserved many instances of the folktales that involved magic and other fantastical elements, it provided a major source for later fantasy.Philip Martin, The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Liar to Hero's Quest, pp. 38-42, . Indeed, the literary fairy tale developed so smoothly into fantasy that many later works (such as Max Beerbohm's The Happy Hypocrite and George MacDonald's Phantastes) that would now be called fantasies were called fairy tales at the time they written.W.R. Irwin, The Game of the Impossible, p 92-3, University of Illinois Press, Urbana Chicago London, 1976 J. R. R. Tolkien's seminal essay on fantasy writing was titled \\"On Fairy Stories.\\" Ossian and the ballads also provided an influence to fantasy indirectly, through their influence on Sir Walter Scott, who began the genre of historical fiction.Michael Moorcock, Wizardry & Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy p 79 Very few of his works contain fantastic elements; in most, the appearance of such is explained away,John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Scott, (Sir) Walter\\", p 845 but in its themes of adventure in a strange society, this led to the adventures set in foreign lands, by H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs,Michael Moorcock, Wizardry & Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy p 80-1 Although Burrough's works fall in the area of science fiction because of their (often thin) justifications for their marvels,John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Burroughs, Edgar Rice\\", p 152 Haggard's included many fantastic elements.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Haggard, H. Rider \\", p 444-5 The works of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, romantic historical fiction, contained many fantasy tropes in their realistic settings.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Dumas, Alexandre p√®re\\", p 300 All of these authors influenced fantasy for the plots, characters and landscapes used‚Äîparticularly in the sword and sorcery genre, with such writers as Robert E.

The species was last recorded in June 1904 near Tamworth, New South Wales, Australia, and was presumed extinct until rediscovered in 2008 by Forests worker Graham Marshall in NSW's Nundle State Forest. Some scientists consider that it is a variety of the threatened Rough Eyebright (Euphrasia scabra). Previously the whole genus Euphrasia was regarded as part of the family Scrophulariaceae. It was first described by Robert Brown in his reference work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen in 1810. A further identification of the plant was reported from the Barrington Tops in 2012. Description The erect stem of this annual herb reaches a height from 20 to 35 centimetres and is covered with dense hairs. The deeply lobed leaves are opposite. The upper stem leaves with a length of about six to fourteen millimetres and a width from 3.5 to 13 millimetres are ovate-ellyptic. The racemes consists of 50 to 90 flowers. The length of the usually scabrous calyx reaches from 5.5 to 7 millimetres. The corolla measures from ten to fourteen millimetres coloured from white to lilac with yellow markings. The tube is 6.7 to 8.5 millimetres long and the anthers 0.9 to 1.7 millimetres. The capsule has a length of 4 to 7.5 millimetres and is bristly at the upper half. Like the other eyebright species Euphrasia arguta is a partial parasite and is connected through a haustorium to the rootlets of other plants. The flowering period is from October to January. Occurrence Its previous habitat consists of grassy areas near rivers in elevations until 700 m asl with an annual rainfall of 600 mm. It was native in the ecoregions North Coast (NC), Northern Tablelands (NT), Central Tablelands (CT), North West Slopes (NWS) and Central West Slopes (CWS) in the Australian state of New South Wales, in particular in the areas from Bathurst to Walcha. Status In 1982 Australian botanist William R. Barker stated in his study \\"Taxonomic studies in Euphrasia L. (Scrophulariaceae). A revised infrageneric classification, and a revision of the genus in Australia\\" in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens that Euphrasia arguta was not collected for at least 75 years. In 1997 the World Conservation Monitoring Centre compiled it into the IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants within the category \\"globally extinct\\".Kerry S. Walter & Harriet J. Gillett: 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants. Compiled by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. After the enacting of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2000 it was listed as officially extinct in July 2000 by the Australian government. On 6 July 2008 Ian MacDonald, New South Wales Primary Industries Minister, announced that Forestry Workers had rediscovered specimens of Euphrasia arguta in Nundle State Forest, New South Wales.

It is known for its oppidum. The Vaunage area is located between Languedoc and Provence and between Sommi√®res and N√Æmes. It is north of the Camargue. From east to west the villages of Vaunage are: Caveirac, Clarensac, Langlade, Saint-Dionizy, Nages-et-Solorgues, Calvisson, Boissi√®res, Saint-C√¥me-et-Maru√©jols, Cong√©nies. Demography According to the 1999 census, The population of the Vaunage was 15,250, the area being 9981 ha. * Boissi√®res : 485 area 333 ha * Calvisson : 4725 area 2897 ha * Caveirac : 3860 area 1479 ha * Clarensac : 3117 area 1449 ha * Cong√©nies : 1672 area 864 ha * Langlade : 2850 area 900 ha * Nages-et-Solorgues : 1150 area 18 ha * Saint- C√¥me-et-Maru√©jols : 580 area 1400 ha * Saint-Dionizy : 1050 area 641 ha History The name is a contraction of \\"Vall√©e de Nages\\", the valley of Nages. The valley is a furrowed combe at the edge of the garrigues plateau, surrounded by 200m-high hills that isolate it from the surroundings. There are two natural entrances, one to east coming from N√Æmes, and one to the south towards Verg√®ze. This geographical situation has led to a strong regional identity. Le Camisard chief, Jean Cavalier called it \\"petite Chanaan\\", little Canaan. This is an agricultural region, rich in history. There are hundreds of archaeological sites in this small area. These valleys have been populated for over 2,000 years. Six oppida, dominated by that at Nages, were home to the Volques, who built them in the 8th century BC and remained there till the 1st century AD : * Oppidum de Nages-et-Solorgues ; in the commune of the same name; * Oppidum de Roque de Viou, in the commune of Saint-Dionizy; * Oppidum de la Liqui√®re, above the hamlet of Sinsans, in the commune of Calvisson; * Oppidum de la Font du Coucou above Calvisson; * Oppidum du Roc de Gachonne above Calvisson; * Oppidum de Mauressip or \\"Mouressipe\\", in the commune of Saint-C√¥me-et-Maru√©jols. However it is the oppidum of Nages that has provided the richest archeological finds. This region has a strong Protestant history, and is today predominantly Protestant. Cong√©nies is unique in France in having a Quaker Meeting House and cemetery. One finds many recent chateaux, mas and bastides. The Camargue traditions such as the running of the bulls happen in each village. The soil is argilo-calcaire so the flora is essentially that of the garrigue- and this leads to fine wines. However, the region is being targeted by the expanding housing needs of N√Æmes. The former railway has been transformed into a cycle way,¬´voie verte¬ª opening the Vaunage to Green Tourism.
