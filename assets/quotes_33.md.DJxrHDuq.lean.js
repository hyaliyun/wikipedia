Characterized as the ‚Äúbite and run‚Äù parasite, the first reported case of Cheyletiella Yasguri was in Italy in the year of 1965. It is named after Dr. I. Yasgur. It has been found throughout the world with reported cases in the Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, the U.S. etc. A distinguishable characteristic that sets species C. yasguri apart from the others is the morphology of the sensory organ in the legs. The mite contains two lobes compared to the species C. parasitivorax which only contains one. Cheyletiella Yasguri causes irritation and inflammation of the skin (Dermatitis) usually as a result of allergic reaction. Young pups are most vulnerable and conditions can be mild to very severe. This mite resides in the outer layer of the skin (keratin) and does most of its feeding on the liquid substance of tissue. They do not dig into the skin and do not replicate.  Diagnosis  In order to diagnose the condition, samples of the skin or fur must be further examined under a microscope. Other techniques used to diagnose the condition include deep scraping of the skin and removal of samples with the use of tape. Because symptoms are often similar those of Scabies, an accurate diagnosis would be under a microscope.  Transmission  It is highly transmittable especially through physical contact. Humans are also prone to becoming infested with mites. If contact with pet is cut off completely symptoms will disappear after a short amount of time because the parasites do not replicate on humans. Common infested areas in humans vary from the chest, abdomen, arms, and buttocks. Common infestation areas in dogs include the neck, back, and tail. Results can be anything from lesions of the skin, severe itching, and sometimes the condition will go unnoticed in dogs.  Treatments  In animals treatments range a wide variety of antibiotic therapy, antiparasitic therapy, topical steroids, Gamma benzene hexachloride, and insecticides. Less than one percent Gamma benzene hexachloride has proven to be very effective if used as prescribed by a veterinarian.

Norman would later join non-league club Wycombe Wanderers for the remainder of the 1987‚Äì88 season, where he made 78 appearances during a two-year spell with the club, also earning England semi-professional honours in 1989.

As a prolific author of romance novels, she had two other pseudonyms, Kathryn Blair and Celine Conway. At the height of her career, Warren was considered one of publisher's superstars, who set high sales records and a standard for romances published during the 1950s. Joseph McAleer in his book Passion's Fortune: The Story of Mills and Boon, describes Brett's work as so sexy for the era, that it often had to be \\"watered down\\". According to McAleer, she is credited by Anne Weale as inventing the \\"punishing kiss\\". Brett/Warren came to Mills & Boon from Rich & Cowan, a publisher she felt didn't offer her enough support. Book notes Rosalind Brett's romances from the 1950s are historically significant for the Mills & Boon series, by her choice of locations. Her stories take readers away from the British Isles, to East Africa: Rhodesia, Nyasaland, providing glimpses of Salisbury (present day Harare) and Bulawayo, the second city in what is now Zimbabwe. Other locations are French Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The main characters are at work trying to build prosperous lives in what were British, French and Portuguese colonies. Publishing in post World War II period, Brett writes at the crossroads of history when, colonial rule once paramount in parts of Africa, Asia and the Pacific, would come to be challenged. While her stories depict the colonial life, absent from them is any underlying tension between rulers and subjects.

Court decisions Markey, along with judges Mark Boonstra, and Stephen Borrello overturned a lower court verdict, that involved a tire coming off a vehicle, shortly after a tire rotation was performed at a dealer in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in October 2013. Lug nuts apparently had failed to be tightened or torqued resulting in an accident and injuries. The plaintiffs, Samuel Anaya and Doris Myricks, through their attorney, sued for injuries, negligence, and a violation of the Motor Vehicle Service and Repair Act (Act 300 of 1974) The three judge panel reached a unanimous conclusion: > We conclude, under the plain language of MCL257.1307a, that defendants > ‚Äúperformed‚Äù a tire rotation, albeit negligently...There is no support for > the trial court‚Äôs determination that a tire rotation is not ‚Äúperformed‚Äù if a > service person fails to sufficiently tighten the lug nuts on one tire. The 3-0 decision revolved around the word \\"performed\\" and it was decided that the work of revolving the tires had been performed even if the lug nuts failed to be tightened. The court consulted the 11th edition of Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Collegiate Dictionary to determine that a job could be considered \\"performed\\" even if incorrectly. Judge Boonstra authored the decision.

Business Model RAW Artists produce platforms in various cities in which independent artists from 10 different creative categories can showcase their work to their community, local business professionals and press. The 10 creative categories of artists include Visual Art, Photography, Technology, Film, Crafts, Accessories, Beauty (Hair & Makeup), Fashion, Performance Art and Music. The business model is set up to allow artists the opportunity to not pay out of pocket for fees associated with the production of their showcase. To cover these costs, artists can sell 20 tickets to the showcase. The tickets cover costs of production and staff. If all 20 tickets are sold, an artist pays nothing to RAW for the showcase. RAW Artists earn $10 for every ticket they sell after the full 20 ticket commitment is fulfilled. If artists do not sell the 20 tickets, they may pay for the remaining tickets to participate, postpone or opt out of the showcase. Each RAW artist is paired with the Showcase Director for their city who produces the full event and mentors RAW artists through the process leading up to their showcase. In 2019 RAW Artists created more tools and resources for independent artists within the RAW community such as the RAW Artists App, RAWards, Industry Exchange, RAW Spotlight and Found Agency.

Muthukrishnan predicted in January 2005 that Lakshmi Nivas Mittal, the UK-based, NRI steel magnate, would face adversities as he crossed the Carbon Phase (downtrend period).http://westwind.co.in/pdf/mittal.pdf On 20 June 2005, Mittal, as predicted, faced severe adversities in South Africa, where he was dragged into a legal battle over the acquisition of a South African steel plant. Muthukrishnan also predicted the death of Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister of India on Tamil Nadu soil at the hands of the LTTE. The Hindustan Times, in its article in HT Diary on 13 September 1993, called Muthukrishnan \\"an extraordinary man\\".

Under similar justifications, a 2010 subpoena approved by Eric Holder implicated Fox News reporter, James Rosen, as a possible co-conspirator under the Espionage Act of 1917. Investigators gained access to the times of his phone calls, and two days of Rosen's emails. Stephen Jin-Woo Kim eventually pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act for communicating North Korean nuclear test plans to Rosen. These investigations provoked considerable criticism from major news organizations, and precipitated the revision of media guidelines at the Department of Justice. Associated Press On May 13, 2013, the Associated Press announced telephone records for 20 of their reporters during a two-month period in 2012 had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. AP reported the Justice Department would not say why it sought the records, but news sources noted the US Attorney's office for the District of Columbia was conducting a criminal investigation into a May 7, 2012 Associated Press story about a CIA operation which prevented the Yemeni terrorist Fahd al-Quso's plot to detonate an explosive device on a commercial flight. The DOJ did not direct subpoenas to the Associated Press; instead, the subpoenas were issued to their telephone providers, including Verizon Wireless. The AP claimed these acts were a \\"massive and unprecedented intrusion\\" into news-gathering operations. Gary Pruitt, CEO of the Associated Press stated: \\"These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.\\" The US Attorney's office in Washington responded that federal investigators seek records from news outlets only after making \\"every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means.\\" Verizon neither challenged the subpoena nor did it try to alert the journalists whose records were being requested. Debra Lewis, Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, said the company \\"complies with legal processes for requests for information by law enforcement.\\" James Rosen On May 17, 2013, the Washington Post reported the Justice Department had monitored reporter Rosen's activities by tracking his visits to the State Department, through phone traces, timing of calls and his personal emails in a probe regarding possible news leaks of classified information in 2009 about North Korea. In obtaining the warrants, they labeled Rosen a \\"possible co-conspirator\\" with Stephen Kim. In a written statement, the Justice Department said it had followed ‚Äúall applicable laws, regulations, and longstanding Department of Justice policies intended to safeguard the First Amendment interests of the press in reporting the news and the public in receiving it.‚Äù Some analysts have described the Justice Department's actions as \\"aggressive investigative methods\\" that have a chilling effect on news organizations' ability to play a watchdog role. Fox News contributor Judge Andrew Napolitano commented: \\"This is the first time that the federal government has moved to this level of taking ordinary, reasonable, traditional, lawful reporter skills and claiming they constitute criminal behavior.\\" An editorial board of the New York Times wrote: \\"With the decision to label a Fox News television reporter a possible 'co-conspirator' in a criminal investigation of a news leak, the Obama administration has moved beyond protecting government secrets to threatening fundamental freedoms of the press to gather news.\\" Dana Milbank of the Washington Post stated: \\"The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush‚Äôs administration, and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of. To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job ‚Äî seeking out information the government doesn‚Äôt want made public ‚Äî deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based.\\" Department of Justice Days prior on May 15, 2013, Attorney General Holder had testified under oath in front of the House Judiciary Committee that he had recused himself from the leak investigations to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Holder said his Deputy Attorney General, James M. Cole, was in charge of the AP investigation and would have ordered the subpoenas. When questioning turned to the possibility of journalists being charged under the Espionage Act for reporting classified material, Holder stated: \\"With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy.\\" On May 23, 2013, NBC confirmed with the Justice Department that Holder had personally signed off on the Rosen case. The Justice Department defended their decision and spoke about a balance between protecting national secrets and the 1st Amendment, stating: \\"After extensive deliberations, and after following all applicable laws, regulations and policies, the Department sought an appropriately tailored search warrant under the Privacy Protection Act.\\" The revelation brought into question whether Holder was being intentionally misleading during his previous testimony when he denied knowing of, or being part of possible prosecutions of journalists. House Committee members sent an open letter to Holder, saying: \\"It is imperative that the committee, the Congress, and the American people be provided a full and accurate account of your involvement.\\" Perception Members of Congress and media figures have questioned the motivations behind the Justice Department's actions, and if they were even warranted: \\"For five days, reporters at the Associated Press had been sitting on a big scoop about a foiled Al-Qaeda plot at the request of CIA officials. Then, in a hastily scheduled Monday morning meeting, the journalists were asked by agency officials to hold off on publishing the story for just one more day. The CIA officials, who had initially cited national security concerns in an attempt to delay publication, no longer had those worries, according to individuals familiar with the exchange. Instead, the Obama administration was planning to announce the successful counterterrorism operation that Tuesday. AP balked and proceeded to publish that Monday afternoon.\\" On June 19, 2013, while giving a speech at the National Press Club, President and CEO of the Associated Press Gary Pruitt said: ‚ÄúSome longtime trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking with us ‚Äî even on stories unrelated to national security. In some cases, government employees we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to us by phone. Others are reluctant to meet in person... And I can tell you, that this chilling effect on newsgathering is not just limited to AP. Journalists from other news organizations have personally told me, that it has intimidated both official and nonofficial sources from speaking to them as well.‚Äù Aftermath The U.S. Department of Justice undertook a comprehensive evaluation of their practices and policies regarding issuing subpoenas, search warrants and court orders to obtain records or information from journalists, meeting with stakeholders in the news media, First Amendment advocates, and members of the Congress. The DOJ published a six-page report of the review entitled \\"Report on Revised Media Guidelines\\" on July 12, 2013. Holder said the \\"revised guidelines help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures\\" and that these \\"reforms will make a meaningful difference\\". He claimed that \\"there are additional protections that only Congress can provide\\" alluding to media shield legislation. Media lawyers involved in the negotiations of the revised guidelines called them a significant progress, but the reactions of journalists were mixed. David E. Sanger, veteran chief Washington correspondent of The New York Times, for example stated that the revised guidelines were ‚Äújust formalizing what was observed in past administrations. The guidelines worked pretty well until the Obama administration came in.‚Äù On February 24, 2014 the Attorney General Eric Holder signed the final new rules that lay down the guidelines for the U.S. Department of Justice on seeking information from journalists. The Attorney General‚Äôs Order No. 3420-2014 mentions it lays down the ‚ÄúPolicy regarding obtaining information from, or records of, members of the news media; and regarding questioning, arresting, or charging members of the news media.‚Äù  See also  * NSA warrantless surveillance controversy * Mass surveillance  References  Category:Political scandals in the United States Category:2010s controversies in the United States Category:2013 in the United States Category:2013 scandals Category:Obama administration controversies Category:Privacy of telecommunications Category:Privacy in the United States Category:United States national security policy Category:Surveillance scandals Category:2013 in Washington, D.C.

Geomembranes are frequently referred to as Flexible Membrane Liners (FMLs) in environmental regulations, such as in Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Fabricated geomembranes are geomembranes that are flexible enough to be seamed or welded into large panels in a factory, folded, transported to the project site, unfolded without creasing or damage, and field seamed and tested as necessary. These geomembranes are relatively thin (usually less than 45 mils, [1.1 mm] thick), flexible, and can be reinforced with fabrics. Fabricated geomembranes can be accordion folded or rolled up to facilitate deployment and reduce double folds as shown in photographs. Factory fabrication reduces field seaming by 70 to 90% depending on the geometry of the installation and weight of the geomembrane material used, which reduces field testing and patching, installation time, and overall cost. The panel size is limited only by the allowable shipping weight, which depends on the mode of transportation. The reduction of installation time and testing is particularly important in harsh environments which can extend the ‚Äúfield installation season‚Äù. Fabricated panels can be large enough to create ‚Äúdrop- in‚Äù liners that do not require any field seaming, testing, or patching which speeds installation and improves quality. Fabricated geomembranes also allow a more modular construction approach which results in less resources having to be committed to one location for an extended period, e.g., personnel and deployment, welding, and testing equipment. Modular construction also adds more predictability to project scheduling by reducing weather, transportation, site access, testing and data interpretation, and labor issues.  Applications  Fabricated geomembranes can be used for a variety of applications including in alphabetical order: aquaculture, baffle curtains, canals, decorative ponds, deicing fluid ponds, drill pad liners for oil and gas development, exposed or floating covers, fertilizer containment, golf course ponds, hydrocarbon containment, landfill liners and covers, mine tailings ponds and heap leach pads, reservoirs, sewage lagoons, tank liners, and wastewater ponds.  Installation practices  Flexible geomembranes are fabricated into panels the size of which is controlled by the allowable shipping and handling weight. It is common to ship panels that weigh 1,816 kg (4,000 Ibs.) but panels as heavy as 4,086 kg (9,000 Ibs.) have been shipped. After moving the panel to the proper deployment location as indicated on the Panel Layout Diagram for the project, the panel is unfolded or unrolled from the shipping pallet. The pallet is usually on a front-end loader or forklift which moves backwards to facilitate unfolding or unrolling of the panel. Pulling the geomembrane panel off the pallet or the roll by a chain is not recommended because it may damage the geomembrane. Deployment personnel are then positioned approximately apart along the edges of the panel to unfold and move the panel into the proper location. If the edge to be gripped is to be subsequently welded or bonded, the panel edge is folded back about , creating a fold. The fold is gripped using the 0.3 m long by 10 mm (1-foot long by 2 inch) diameter smooth wooden dowel or a smooth grade stake rather than the edge itself. This is to avoid stretching the panel edge where it is to be bonded to another panel. As the panel is pulled out, it is necessary to maintain air under the geomembrane to reduce friction with the ground surface. This can be accomplished by holding the panel edge and advancing at a rate fast enough to create air under the geomembrane as it is unfolded. Another method is to ‚Äúfan‚Äù air under the geomembrane by raising and lowering the edge of the panel to create a wave-like action across the liner as it is being spread. After the panel is set in the exact position, it is welded or bonded to adjacent panels.

Louis Pasteur proved it to be the cause of conversion of ethanol to acetic acid in 1864. It is a benign microorganism which is present everywhere in the environment, existing in alcoholic ecological niches which include flowers, fruits, and honey bees, as well as in water and soil. It lives wherever sugar fermentation occurs. It grows best in temperatures that range from 25 to 30 degrees Celsius and in pH that ranges from 5.4 to 6.3. For a long time it has been used in the fermentation industry to produce acetic acid from alcohol. Acetobacter aceti is an obligate aerobe, which means that it requires oxygen to grow. Acetobacter aceti is economically important because it is used in the production of vinegar by converting the ethanol in wine into acetic acid. The acetic acid created by A. aceti is also used in the manufacturing of acetate rayon, plastics production, rubber production, and photographic chemicals. A. aceti is considered an acidophile, which means it is able to survive in acidic environments, due to having an acidified cytoplasm which makes nearly all proteins in the genome to evolve acid stability. A. aceti has become important in helping to understand the process by which proteins can attain acid stability. Industrial use A. aceti is used for the mass production of acetic acid, the main component in vinegar. During the fermentation process of vinegar production, it is used to act on wines and ciders resulting in vinegar with acetic acid. It can be converted by a silicone tube reactor, which aids the fermentation process with oxidation. A. aceti has not been reported as a human pathogen. Human skin does not provide the bacteria with the optimum conditions for it to grow, which makes it safe to handle in factories that use the species to produce acetic acid. However, some evidence indicates it can be harmful to plants and other flora, though it exists naturally in the world. Growth Oxidation is used to stimulate the growth of the A. aceti. Samples of the bacteria are placed in a few silicone tubes. These tubes are permeable to oxygen, after which they are left in a region warmer than the typical room temperature and cultured. Pink disease in pineapples Because A. aceti occurs naturally and is widespread in the world, so far, no evidence shows it is a threat to humans, but in recent studies, it has been shown to cause some detrimental effects on pineapples. The pink disease in pineapples causes the fruit to turn a slight pink color, only to eventually become brown and then rot. Similar experiments have also been tested on other fruits such as apples and pears and results end with rotten fruits. However, the bacterium seems to only be effective if the fruit has any locations exposing its flesh and the temperature surrounding its invasion is warmer than average. With the discovery of other Acetobacter species, skepticism exists regarding A. aceti being the only cause of the pink discoloration disease in pineapples. Studies are still being conducted on other species on the genus Acetobacter because 15 other species have been found in rotting fruits, as well.

He served as Governor of Hubei and Hebei provinces, and as the top leader of Hebei during the Cultural Revolution, but was ousted from his positions after he opposed the reforms of Deng Xiaoping. He was a prot√©g√© of Li Xiannian, one of China's top leaders. Communist revolution Liu Zihou was born Liu Wenzhong (ÂàòÊñáÂø†) in Ren County, southern Hebei province in December 1909. He also used the pseudonym Ma Zhiyuan (È©¨Ëá¥Ëøú). In middle school he secretly participated in revolutionary activities and later joined the Communist Party of China in October 1929. In 1935 he was one of the leaders of the peasant riot in southern Hebei, establishing a guerrilla force under the Red Army of China. In 1936 his force was expanded to a division and Liu became the division commander. During the Second Sino-Japanese War and the subsequent Chinese Civil War, he was a leader of the Communist guerrilla forces in the border region of Hubei and Henan provinces. Early PRC After the Communists defeated the Kuomintang and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, Liu Zihou became a leader of Hubei, and was the provincial governor from 1954 to 1956. From 1956 to 1958 he was appointed head of the Sanmenxia Dam project on the Yellow River. In April 1958 he was appointed Governor of his native Hebei province, subordinate to Lin Tie, the First Secretary of the Communist Party and top official in Hebei. In Hebei Liu was a proponent of class struggle and was praised by Chairman Mao Zedong. Cultural Revolution In May 1966, the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Liu Zihou made a bid for the top office of Hebei. He courted Li Xuefeng, party chief of North China, which includes Hebei province, and denounced the Hebei party chief Lin Tie. Lin was stripped of his positions and detained by the military. Liu then persecuted many war heroes including his own former associates, resulting in at least thirty-three deaths. On August 25 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China appointed Governor Liu as First Secretary of Hebei and Political Commissar of the Hebei Military Region. Having consolidated power over party, government, and army, Liu ruled Hebei like a monarch. In January 1967, however, Liu Zihou was attacked and detained by the Red Guards in Baoding, which had been designated the temporary capital of Hebei. When Liu arrived in Baoding, two major rival Red Guard factions, both of which included supporters of the former party chief Lin Tie, united to overthrow and capture Liu. On January 29, the Red Guards of the August First faction paraded Liu on a truck for five hours, which was reportedly witnessed by a million people. On February 11, the 69th Army of the PLA commanded by General Xie Zhenhua jailed 1000 members of the August First Red Guards, and restored Liu Zihou to power. At the end of February, 100,000 soldiers of the 38th Army loyal to Marshall Lin Biao, the designated successor of Chairman Mao Zedong, entered Baoding from Beijing, while some units of the 69th Army were transferred to neighbouring Shanxi province. In April, both Chairman Mao and Lin Biao criticized the February suppression of the Red Guards. The two rival armies armed their respective supporters (including high school students), who clashed with each other, resulting in high death toll. The bloodshed continued off and on until the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. By summer 1967, Liu was again consolidating his power in Hebei. Worried about the situation in Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, in December Chairman Mao sent Chen Boda and Li Xuefeng to the province. Revolutionary leaders all over Hebei, with the exception of Baoding, called for an alliance of the military and Liu Zihou's supporters. In mid-January 1968, the Beijing Military Region helped to create the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei, chaired by Li Xuefeng, the party boss of North China. Liu Zihou was nominally the first deputy chair, but the de facto head. The military exerted strong influence over the 121-member committee, but the 38th Army in Baoding still backed the rebels and challenged Liu's authority. On 29 January 1968, the capital of Hebei was moved from Baoding to Shijiazhuang. In 1971, national political circumstances changed when Lin Biao died in a mysterious plane crash over Mongolia, and Li Xuefeng and Chen Boda were thrown into prison. On 28 July 1976, the Great Tangshan earthquake, the deadliest of the 20th century, struck the city of Tangshan in northeastern Hebei. As the top official of Hebei, Liu Zihou led the relief effort in the aftermath of the earthquake. Reform era After the death of Mao Zedong and the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976, Liu Zihou supported Mao's designated successor Hua Guofeng and resisted Deng Xiaoping's reformist agenda. On 26 December 1979, he was ousted from his long-held positions in Hebei province. However, with the help of his patron, the senior party leader Li Xiannian, in January 1980 he became the Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission of China. Liu retired in 1982 and died in Beijing on 22 December 2001, aged 92. Liu was an alternate member of the eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of the ninth to eleventh Central Committees.

This was Bowe's first defense of the titles he had won from Evander Holyfield, while Dokes was trying to join Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, and Tim Witherspoon as the only fighters to regain a piece of the heavyweight title after having lost it. The fight took place at Madison Square Garden and was broadcast by HBO. Background On November 13, 1992, Bowe defeated Holyfield to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion. The World Boxing Council ordered Bowe to defend against Lennox Lewis, the man who had defeated Bowe at the 1988 Olympics to capture the gold medal for Canada, in his first defense as its mandatory challenger. However, since both sides had been in a massive dispute over terms of the fight (especially the purse), Bowe refused and in a memorable press conference on December 14, 1992, Bowe and his manager Rock Newman tossed the WBC belt into a wastepaper basket with Bowe stating \\"If Lennox wants this belt, he must get it out of the garbage and then we'll be calling him the garbage picker.\\"Bowe Trashes His WBC Belt, N.Y.

Dokes took Holyfield to the tenth round before falling to a TKO. Dokes' comeback was temporarily stopped when Donovan \\"Razor\\" Ruddock knocked him unconscious in the fourth round of a 1990 bout where Dokes lost the WBA Intercontinental championship.Ruddock Knocks Dokes Unconscious in Fourth, L.A. Times article, 1990-04-05, Retrieved on 2013-05-16 He returned in late 1991 and fought a series of journeyman fighters, recording nine bouts with nine wins, five by knockout, before facing Bowe. The Fight Bowe came out firing early, constantly hammering Dokes with powerful combinations. Midway through the first round, Bowe scored a knockdown after a three-punch combination knocked Dokes into the ropes, which prevented him from hitting the canvas. After taking the referee's standing eight count, Dokes was allowed to continue the fight but was met with a relentless assault from Bowe, who was able to get Dokes up against the ropes and continuously batter Dokes with multiple-punch combinations. Referee Joe Santarpia stepped in and stopped the fight at 2:19 of the first round, awarding Bowe a technical knockout victory.Riddick-ulous, Sports Illustrated article, 1993-02-15, Retrieved on 2013-05-16 It was the first time that a heavyweight title fight had ended in the first round since Mike Tyson knocked out Carl \\"The Truth\\" Williams in his last successful defense of the undisputed championship in 1989. Aftermath Initially, Bowe hoped to face 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist Ray Mercer, who fought journeyman Jesse Ferguson earlier in the same event at Madison Square Garden. Ferguson, however, upset Mercer in a unanimous decision and Bowe decided to give him the shot instead.Bowe Brings Title Show To D.C., Chicago Tribune article, 1993-03-25, Retrieved on 2013-05-16 The fight took place in Washington, DC on May 22, 1993 and Bowe knocked out Ferguson in the second round. He would then accept a rematch with Evander Holyfield later in 1993, which resulted in Bowe suffering his only professional defeat. Dokes, meanwhile, never fought for a championship again. He returned to the ring in 1995 and fought five more times, winning three and losing two, with his final fight coming in 1997. Dokes retired with a final career record of 53-6-2, with thirty-four knockouts. He died in 2012.

The republic was created in August 1789 after the Li√®ge Revolution led to the destruction of the earlier ecclesiastical state which controlled the territory, the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. It coexisted with the even more short-lived revolutionary state, the United States of Belgium, created by the Brabant Revolution of 1789, to the north. By 1791, the forces of the republic had been defeated by Prussian and Austrian forces and the Prince-Bishop was restored. Revolution On 18 August 1789, Jean-Nicolas Bassenge and other democrats arrived at the H√¥tel de Ville of Li√®ge. They demanded the dismissal of current magistrates in favour of two popular burgomasters: Jacques-Joseph Fabry and Jean-Remy de Chestret. The citadel of Saint Walburge fell into the hands of the rebels. The Prince-Bishop, C√©sar- Constantin-Fran√ßois de Hoensbroeck, was brought back from his Summer Palace in Seraing to ratify the nomination of the new officials and to abolish the unpopular R√®glement de 1684. Several days later, the Prince-Bishop fled to the city of Trier in modern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire condemned the Li√®ge revolution and demanded the restoration of the Ancien r√©gime in the prince- bishopric. The radical mood in Li√®ge led to the proclamation of a republic, two years before France. Law One of the first acts of the republic was the introduction of the \\"Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of Franchimont\\" on 16 September 1789. The document was heavily influenced by the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen introduced in August 1789 but contained several important differences: *Article 3: Sovereignty resides in the people [and not the nation] *Article 10: Every citizen has freedom of thought and opinion [without restriction] *Article 17 of the French declaration concerning property is absent because civil and legal rights in Li√®ge relative to property had been in force since 1196.

She was the first woman in Africa to join a municipal council and in 1966 became the first woman to serve as mayor of Freetown. She was based in London, England, for the latter part of her life. Biography Early years and education; London and New York She was born Constance Agatha Horton\\"Constance Cummings-John\\", Oxford Index. into an influential Creole family, black migrants to West Africa from the Americas in the 18th century who by the 20th century had become intellectuals, business people, and members of the professions.Hakim Adi, Marika Sherwood, Pan-African History: Political Figures from Africa and the Diaspora since 1787 (2003, ), pp. 29‚Äì31. Her father, John William Horton (1861-1916), was city treasurer of Freetown, while her mother, Regina Horton, nee Awoonor-Wilson, was a concert pianist.Maureen Needham, \\"Kykunkor, or The Witch Woman: An African Opera in America, 1934\\", in Thomas F. De Frantz, Dancing Many Drums: Excavations in African American Dance (University of Wisconsin Press, 2002), p. 233. Constance herself went to London in 1935, aged 17, to train as a schoolteacher. While there she joined the West African Students' Union and the League of Coloured Peoples. Having gained her teaching certificate, she took up further studies in the United States at Cornell University. When she returned to London she joined the International African Service Bureau, under the leadership of George Padmore, and married Ethnan Cummings-John, a radical lawyer. In 1937 she returned to Freetown as principal of the African Methodist Episcopal Girls' Industrial School, but her political activities caused her great problems with the British Colonial Office. During the Second World War she established a mining company, which later became an important source of funds for her educational projects. Between 1946 and 1951 she lived in New York City, where her brother Asadata Dafora Horton was a successful musician and dancer. While living in the US, she worked in hospitals and served on the executives of the American Council for African Education and the Council on African Affairs, the second of which was chaired by Paul Robeson. Return to Freetown On her return to Freetown in 1951 she joined the Sierra Leone People's Party and founded a new school for girls, the Eleanor Roosevelt School, which by 1953 had more than 600 students. During these years Cummings- John gained a licenciate from the London College of Preceptors, and in 1952 the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir George Beresford-Stooke, appointed her to the Freetown Council. At the general election of 1957 she was one of two women elected to the new House of Representatives, even though women did not yet have the franchise. The Krio-led opposition then successfully demanded the resignation of both women, but the next year Cummings-John was elected to the Freetown Municipal Council. In 1961, with the independence of Sierra Leone, Cummings-John's husband became the new country's ambassador to Liberia. In 1966 Prime Minister Albert Margai appointed her as Mayor of Freetown, in succession to Siaka Stevens, but she held the position for only a few months. Her party lost the general election of 1966, and there was then a successful military coup against the new government. Cummings-John was herself accused of financial corruption while outside the country and was advised not to return. Political activity in London She settled again in London, where she became an active member of the Labour Party and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and also a school governor. Cummings-John was a member of political organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States as well as in Sierra Leone, and she and I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson were the only Krio to fight for the participation of the indigenous \\"Protectorate peoples\\" in West African political processes. Her actions also led to the formation of the Sierra Leone Market Women's Union and a Washerwoman's Union. Despite unsuccessful attempts to return to Sierra Leone in 1974 and 1996, Cummings- John lived the rest of her life in London. In 1995 she published an autobiography. She died in London on 21 February 2000 at the age of 82.

It is also found elsewhere in England, including two places called Thwaite in Norfolk and one in Suffolk. It is most often found as a suffix. It is a common element of field names, as well as settlement names. It is most frequent in the North West, where some 80 examples are found in Cumberland, at least 30 in Westmorland, about 40 in Lancashire and 30 in the North Riding, whilst it is common in the western parts of the West Riding. Elsewhere in England it is rare, only three examples occurring in the East Riding and seven in Nottinghamshire. The name is usually from Old Norse thveit (also written √æveit), but sometimes from Old Danish thwƒìt, both meaning \\"clearing\\" or \\"meadow\\". The element is also found in Normandy. In the Eure department alone there are at least five placenames with the same thveit root and meaning \\"clearing in a wooded area\\", locally represented as Thuit: Le Thuit; Thuit- H√©bert; Le Thuit-Simer; Le Thuit-Signol; Le Thuit-Anger.

At 1.4 million square feet of turf, it currently lays claim to being the largest single installation artificial turf project in North America.  History  Sparks' largest public works project ever, Golden Eagle Regional Park opened near the city's Wingfield Springs area on April 14, 2008. After a 14-year process with help from the Bureau of Land Management, Golden Eagle replaced the softball fields of the former Don Mello Sports Complex. It cost around $30 million to construct and is spread out over 140 acres of a partially undeveloped 450-acre lot. The park is partially funded through open space bond funds that were approved by voters in 2000. The remainder of the funding for Golden Eagle Regional Park comes from impact fees paid by its developers. Sparks city officials have discussed plans to further develop the lot as money becomes available, including a possible equestrian park. In 2008, Sparks city officials explored the possibility of securing a naming rights sponsor for the park, but the park has retained its original name. Since the park opened in 2008, FieldTurf, the company that originally installed the turf, has replenished parts of the playing field with new turf. In 2009, a Sparks city official estimated to the Nevada Assembly that the park attracts a million visitors annually, particularly for softball tournaments. On November 7, 2011, NV Energy and the city of Sparks celebrated the completion of the park's solar energy system which generates power for the stadium's lights. In May 2013, it was announced that phase two of the Little League area of the park was completed, including accessibility for youths with disabilities.  Features  Golden Eagle Regional Park features six softball fields, two full-size baseball fields, two little league baseball fields, a stadium-size multi-use (football/soccer) field and two additional multi-purpose fields. Also located in the park are bocce ball courts, an artificial turf wiffle ball court, a beach volleyball area with four volleyball courts, and a climbing wall. The park is equipped with stadium-sized bleachers and energy-efficient lighting. There are also a pro shop, a restaurant and a 7200-square foot concession venue on site.

Historical Encyclopedia of Switzerland. was a Swiss Argentine paleontologist.  Life  Kaspar Jakob (Spanish: Santiago) was born and raised in Herisau, Canton Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Switzerland, as the oldest of 12 children. He attended school in the nearby town of St. Gallen, where his teacher Bernhard Wartmann raised his interest in the science of nature. Wartmann was a well known botanist and director of the Museum of History of Nature in St. Gallen.Weigelt, Gertrud: Santiago Roth 1850-1924. Ein Berner als wissenschaftlicher Pionier in S√ºdamerika, Berner Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichte und Heimatkunde, Paul Haupt Bern, 1951/1, pp. 19‚Äì39 For economic reasons the Roth family emigrated to Argentina in 1866, where they initially settled in the Colonia Baradero (Buenos Aires Province). There, Roth started a small business with leather goods. In his sparetime he collected plants, butterflies and rocks. He married Elisabeth Schuetz, a teacher educated in Switzerland, who emigrated with her family to Argentina in 1872 as well. After finding the first fossils he became an ardent explorer and collector of extinct mammals. Already in 1878 he was able to sell a collection of fossils to Dr. Laussen, a Dane, who gave these bones to the Museum of Zoology in Copenhagen. Roth was encouraged to continue finding and collecting rare prehistoric mammals as a profession. He contacted Prof. Carl Vogt at the University of Geneva, who was interested to buy a further collection from Roth. The transport arrived in Geneva heavily damaged. Therefore, Roth traveled to Switzerland in 1880 to repair the skeletons in the laboratories of the university. There, he had the additional benefit of being able to attend lectures on geology, zoology and osteology. After his return to Argentina, he continued his search in the basin of the Paran√° River and in the Entre R√≠os Province belonging to the Pampas. He published his findings in his mother tongue, German.Roth, S.: Beobachtungen √ºber Entstehung und Alter der Pampasformation in Argentinien, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Geologischen Gesellschaft, Berlin 1888, S. 375-464 Roth was continuously looking for buyers to generate income for his large family. Such an opportunity arose in 1887 when he traveled to Switzerland with his family. The Swiss geologist Prof. Albert Heim, ETH Zurich had recommended that the Swiss authorities should buy his collection nr. 5. Today, this collection is held by the Museum of Zoology at the University of Zurich and includes a huge, extinct ground sloth (Megatherium) as well as a large armored mammal (Glyptodon).Schultess, B.: Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis der Xenarthra auf Grund der Santiago Roth‚Äôschen Sammlung des Zoologischen Museums der Universit√§t Z√ºrich.

Das Riesenfaultier und seine Verwandten, Zoologisches Museum der Universit√§t Z√ºrich, Z√ºrich 2000, During his stay in Switzerland he joined Albert Heim on his hydrogeological excursions to study subterranean water flows. These experiences were of much value in his country of residence, Argentina. Roth extended his range of paleontological expeditions to Patagonia, including the areas along the Rio Negro, Limay River and Chubut River, partly together with F. Machon, another researcher from Switzerland from 1885 to 1891. There, he saw Nahuel Huapi Lake for the first time. Francisco Moreno (known as Perito Moreno, the famous Perito Moreno Glacier in Patagonia is named after him), first director of the La Plata Museum in the new capital of the Province Buenos Aires, named Roth as head of the Department of Paleontology at this museum in 1895. His friend Florentino Ameghino worked at this institution as well. Moreno had a mandate from the Government of Argentina to work out a solution for the border disputes with Chile in the Andes region. Roth joined Moreno in 1897 ‚Äì 1899 and again in 1902 on his expeditions. While at Lake Nahuel Huapi Moreno asked Roth to find a suitable place for a new settlement on the shores of this lake. He proposed a particular site and filed corresponding land claims for Swiss and German families already living in the area. This was the origin of the town to be named San Carlos de Bariloche later on. In a publication dated 1903Roth, Santiago: Los Ungulados Sudamericanos. Anales del Museo de La Plata (Secci√≥n Paleontol√≥gica) 1903/5, pp. 1‚Äì36, OCLC 14012855 Roth defined the order of Notoungulata as a category of prehistoric hoofed mammals found only in South America. Roth was named professor for paleontology at the National University of La Plata in 1905. In 1908 he also became director of the Geological- Topographical Institute of the Buenos Aires Province. In this capacity he organized a series of wells to find groundwater. The Argentine government sent him to the arid regions of the Santiago del Estero Province where he installed many wells. The local population was very grateful to get better access to drinking water. His last expedition to Patagonia took place from 1921 to 1922.  Honors  * The University of Zurich honored him with the title Dr. phil. honoris causa in 1900 * Roth was elected as member of the International Committee of Geological Correlation, New York, the only member from South America. * A species of South American lizard, Liolaemus rothi, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

About The Belize Police Department is descended from the British Honduras Constabulary (BHC), which was established in 1886. Constabulary personnel initially numbered 141 and were recruited in Barbados because local men showed no interest in enlisting. The government assigned the early police the task of preserving law and order in the colony. The Constabulary was at first a paramilitary force, but in 1902, it was made into a civil police force. The constabulary was reorganized after World War I, when soldiers returning from service abroad (as well as several Barbadians and Jamaicans) joined the force. The force was reorganized again in 1957, when its first commissioner of police instituted modernizing reforms that resulted in the force's present form. During the colonial period, expatriate officers filled all senior posts in the police. But with self-government and then independence, more Belizeans assumed positions of authority. The official name of the force was changed to the Belize Police Force in 1973, later the word Force was changed to fit the new vision of the Police and it is now known as the Belize Police Department. In the early 1990s, the commissioner and all senior police officers were Belizeans. In 1991, the force, which was part of the Ministry of Home Affairs, was the sole organization responsible for policing the country and for managing regular immigration matters. A commissioner of police headed the force. The governor general appointed the commissioner with the concurrence of the prime minister after consultation with the leader of the opposition. The commissioner exercised operational and disciplinary control over the police force. The police force had an authorized strength of approximately 500, a ratio of about three police to every 1,000 inhabitants. Police operations were divided into three territorial divisions: Eastern, which included Belmopan and Belize City; Central; and Western. The force had a small maritime element that operated six shallow-draft motorboats capable of patrolling coastal waters frequented by smugglers. The force was also divided into three operational branches: General Duties, Crime Investigation, and Tactical Service. The Tactical Service, formed in 1978, assumed the nonmilitary responsibilities of its predecessor, the Police Special Force, which was incorporated into the BDF. The police underwent training at the Police Training School in Belmopan. In sixteen-week programs, recruits studied general police duties and procedures, criminal law, evidence, traffic management, and firearms. Senior police officers attended a ten-week command course run by the British police in Britain. There were a small number of women police in the force, and the first woman was promoted to the rank of inspector in 1989. All personnel were subject to transfer anywhere in the country. Police performed their regular duties unarmed, although arms were issued for special duties or in cases of extreme necessity. Officers' uniforms resembled those of British police forces except that sergeants and lower ranks wore khaki shirts, blue serge trousers with a green seam on both sides, and dark blue peaked caps. Some police investigators were not required to wear uniforms. During the 1980s, the large increase in drug trafficking greatly challenged the police. Unfortunately, some personnel proved vulnerable to corruption by traffickers, and public confidence in the police suffered from charges of official collusion in the drug trade. Public perceptions of the police also suffered from charges that police sometimes resorted to unnecessary force in their efforts to deal with escalating violent crime. During the late 1980s, police leadership began to focus on both problems, expressing a willingness to pursue every allegation of malpractice and to rid the police of unworthy personnel. Penalties for official violators of criminal statutes also increased. The success of these efforts was unclear by mid-1991. Strength On 31 March 2008, the Belize Police Department maintained 1,073 sworn officers and 141 civilian employees. Organization The Belize Police Department is headed by a Commissioner and is divided into two main branches, Operational and Administrative, headed by an Assistant Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, respectively, which contain the following units: * Headquarters, National Criminal Investigation Branch ‚Äì Detective Branch * Special Branch ‚Äì handles national security matters * Operations ‚Äì which consists of the Anti-Drug Unit and Uniformed Operations, including the Gang Suppression Unit and the Mobile Interdiction Team. ** Uniformed operations consists of Community Policing, the Special Patrol Unit, and the National Traffic Branch. * Eastern Division * Management Services, which consists of the following: ** Internal Affairs * National Prosecuting Branch * Planning Unit and Inspections * Personnel Officer * Administration * Chaplain, Welfare and Sports * Police Information and Technology unit (PITU) * Training Director * Training Academic Ranks The Belize Police Department ranks are listed in descending order: * Commissioner of Police * Deputy Commissioner * Assistant Commissioners * Senior Superintendents * Superintendents * Assistant Superintendents * Inspectors * Sergeants * Corporals * Constables Operations :See article John McAfee On 30 April 2012, the Belize Police raided John McAfee's property in Orange Walk Town, The raid was conducted by the Gang Suppression Unit. A GSU press release stated that McAfee was arrested for unlicensed drug manufacturing and possession of an unlicensed weapon. He was released without charge. In 2012, Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez confirmed that he was not convicted nor charged but only suspected. On 12 November 2012, Belize police started a search for McAfee as a \\"person of interest\\" in connection to the murder of American expatriate Gregory Viant Faull. Faull was found dead of a gunshot wound on 11 November 2012, at his home on the island of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize. Faull was a neighbour of McAfee. No one has yet been formally charged. In a November 2012 interview with Wired, McAfee said that he has always been afraid police would kill him and thus refused their routine questions; he has since been evading the Belizean authorities. Belize's prime minister Dean Barrow called McAfee \\"extremely paranoid, even bonkers\\". McAfee fled Belize when he was sought for questioning concerning the murder.

Family Michael Dormer was the son of Geoffrey Dormer (d. 9 March 1503), Merchant of the Staple of Calais, by his second marriage to Alice Collingridge. By his first marriage to a wife named Margery, whose surname is unknown, Geoffrey Dormer had five sons, including his eldest son and heir, William Dormer (d.1506), and eight daughters. By his second marriage, Geoffrey Dormer had seven sons, including Michael Dormer, and five daughters. By 1498, however, only six of Geoffrey Dormer's twelve sons were still living, William and Thomas, by his first marriage, and Geoffrey, Michael, Peter and Edward by his second marriage. Career Dormer was a demy at Magdalen College, Oxford, and \\"brought up in learning there\\". He acquired considerable wealth as a London Mercer, and as a member of the wool staple at Calais, and was actively involved in both the affairs of the Worshipful Company of Mercers and in civic government. He was Sheriff of London in 1529‚Äì30, Master of the Mercers in 1531 and 1545, an Alderman from 1531 until his death in 1545, and Lord Mayor of London in 1541. Dormer purchased several manors, including Long Crendon, which he bought from Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset in 1520,'Parishes : Long Crendon', A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 4 (1927), pp. 36‚Äì45 Retrieved 21 May 2013. and the manor of Hughenden, which he purchased from the Crown for ¬£387 in 1539 after the last Prior of Kenilworth had surrendered it during the dissolution of the monasteries..'Parishes: Hughenden', A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 3 (1925), pp. 57‚Äì62 Retrieved 21 May 2013. In 1539 Dormer married Katherine (n√©e Dallam), and he and his wife resided for a time at The Key, a property which her former husband, Richard Collier (d.1533), had purchased in 1520. It was said to have been \\"an extensive holding on the south side of Cheapside, almost opposite Mercers' Hall, in the parish of St Pancras, Soper Lane\\". Collier had directed in his will that if his two children died without issue, his property called The Sun was to be sold to establish a free school in Horsham, Sussex, where he had been born, and The Key was to be granted to the Mercers' Company to enable them to pay a schoolmaster and maintain the school. Collier's children had both died by 1540, and the Mercers \\"had to persuade the widow and sole surviving executor, Katherine, now married to Sir Michael Dormer, to establish the school\\". In August 1540 Dormer paid ¬£8 6s 8d for \\"a house and garden near Horsham church\\", which remained the home of The College of Richard Collyer until 1893. Almost 300 years after Dormer's purchase, as a result of a lawsuit in 1810, it was found that, as the school property had been conveyed to Dormer by a deed dated 10 August 1540, the school was therefore now the property of Dormer's heir at law, but that \\"it was impracticable at such a distance of time to ascertain who was such heir at law\\".. Dormer was knighted after 1538, probably during his term as Lord Mayor of London in 1541. He made his will on 17 September 1545, leaving a house in London and extensive lands in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire to his widow, six sons, and daughter. He appointed as executors his wife, Katherine, and son, John, and as overseers his son-in-law, Anthony Stapleton (c.1514‚Äì1574),Stapleton, Anthony (by 1514‚Äì74), of the Inner Temple, London, History of Parliament Retrieved 17 May 2013. and his nephew of the half blood, Sir Robert Dormer (d.1552), son of William Dormer (d.1506), and father of Sir William Dormer (d.1575). Marriages and issue Dormer married firstly, before 1505, a wife named Elizabeth, whose surname is unknown, by whom he had six sons, Thomas, William, Geoffrey, John, Ambrose and Walter (a cleric), and a daughter, Joan, who married firstly James Bolney (d.1536), by whom she had a daughter, Agnes; secondly Edward Borlase (d.1544); and thirdly, Anthony Stapleton, by whom she had two sons, Michael and Amyas, who died without issue. Dormer married secondly, on 21 August 1539, Katherine Dallam, the daughter of Thomas Dallam, Warden of the Skinners' Company in 1497. Katherine Dallam's first husband was a London Mercer, Richard Collier (d.1533), the founder of Collyer's School in Horsham, Sussex, by whom she had a son and daughter, George and Dorothy. Between 1533 and November 1535 Katherine married, as his second wife, Robert Pakington (d.1536), a London Mercer who was murdered on the morning of Monday 13 November 1536 while crossing Cheapside on his way to early Mass at the Mercers‚Äô chapel of St Thomas of Acre. Katherine's two children by her marriage to Richard Collier died about the time of her third marriage to Dormer. She appears to have had no issue by her second and third marriages. Katherine survived Sir Michael Dormer by many years, and was buried 29 January 1563.

The company is a professional network serving the US military and its veterans, and has been called \\"LinkedIn for the military,\\" empowering military personnel to take greater control over their own careers. The community allows current military members and veterans to connect, explore career opportunities both inside and outside the military, and engage on topics important to the military. The company's Board of Advisors includes former Army Chief of Staff General George Casey, former Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz, former Navy Admiral John Harvey, and former Army Lieutenant General Benjamin Freakley. Its board of directors includes Bob McDonald, the eighth United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Ellen Levy, former head of Corporate & Business Development at LinkedIn. In April 2012, RallyPoint won $10,000 for placing as runner-up in the Harvard Business School Business Plan Competition and on October 23, 2012, RallyPoint won $100,000 from MassChallenge after competing against over 1,300 other ventures. The company raised private funding after both of these events, and went on to raise $5M in venture capital in late 2013, and an additional $5M of capital in late 2015. RallyPoint was launched out of the Harvard Innovation Lab at the Harvard Business School, and is currently headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts.  History  The company's two co-founders, Yinon Weiss and Aaron Kletzing, first met in Iraq in a remote combat outpost northwest of Baghdad in 2008. Several years later, the two ran into each other again as students this time at Harvard Business School. After discussion of the difficult transition from military to civilian life as well as the transition from job to job within the military, the two decided to create RallyPoint as a platform for the military community to connect based on the common bond of service.  Company   Website  RallyPoint is a professional network available to all US military members and veterans, described by Forbes as \\"LinkedIn on steroids for members of the military.\\" To create a verified account one needs to either sign in with a .mil email address, send in proof of service, or receive an invitation from a verified member. Unverified members may also use the site, but have more limited access. Information of users and connections is sorted based on the military structure, such as rank, specialty, duty position, and duty location. With use of civilian job and company pages, members can be put in contact with mentors, veterans, and civilian recruiters for transition out of military life. According to the Huffington Post, RallyPoint is \\"solving two problems by creating both an easy-to-use professional network within the military, as well as the most technologically advanced employer-to- servicemember matching network in the country.\\" RallyPoint's revenues stem from civilian companies, universities, and organizations that wish to strengthen their brand within the military community.  RPx  Starting in 2014, RallyPoint began running an annual conference geared to bring together RallyPoint members, leaders, and business partners. The inaugural event was held on August 16, 2014, at the Raleigh Convention Center. The event included speakers such as General (Ret.) Norton Schwartz, Admiral (Ret.) John Harvey, US Army Reserve CSM Luther Thomas Jr., Constellis Holdings CEO Craig Nixon, Student Veterans of America CEO D. Wayne Robinson, and veteran industry leaders from places such as Time Warner Cable and Pentagon Federal. The event also included numerous awards to RallyPoint members, including the first ever Member of the Year, which was awarded to SSG Robert Burns. The keynote speaker was Jeff Tice, a former F-16 Air Force pilot who was shot down in the 1991 Gulf War and held POW for 46 days.

In a ploy to arrest her, a pregnant Gunn was accused of the bombings in a statement issued by then Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok on 10 January 1989. After the birth of her son, Haroon Gunn-Salie, Gunn was arrested in June 1990 and detained with her son. Gunn was held in cells that had appalling conditions, resulting in her lodging a complaint with the police. As punishment for the complaint, the police in court took her son away. Recordings of her son's weeping were used during Gunn's interrogation as a means of forcing her to confess. She was later taken to the Caledon Women's Prison where she was detained for 68 days. In June 1990, Gunn and her 16-month-old son travelled with her mother and sister to a guest farm outside Victoria West in the Karoo. Here she was arrested by large numbers of security policemen. She and her son were driven to Cape Town where they were again detained. Gunn was tortured for 64 days. Two years later, when it was discovered that the security forces were responsible for the bombing, Gunn laid defamation charges in a civil case against Ministers Vlok, Rina Venter and Kobie Coetsee. She won an out-of-court settlement of R70 000 for the trauma she and her son endured and for having been framed. Gunn later testified of her own experiences to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), while Vlok, former Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe and 17 others were granted amnesty for the bombing. Present day Gunn continues to work in advancing human rights.

It is approximately long and flows through Butler Township, Sugarloaf Township, and Conyngham. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is acidic and receives mine water from the Jeddo Tunnel. The main rock formation in the watershed is the Mauch Chunk Formation. However, the Pottsville Formation also appears in some areas. Soil series in the drainage basin include the Arnot Series, the Basher Series, and various other soil types. There is one source of acid mine drainage in the watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek: the Jeddo Tunnel. Major roads in the creek's watershed include Interstate 80, Pennsylvania Route 93, and Pennsylvania Route 309. Additionally, wetlands occur in the drainage basin. The watershed of the creek was inhabited by 8000 B.C.E. However, European settlers did not arrive until the 18th century. The Sugarloaf Massacre occurred near the creek in 1780. Recreational opportunities in the watershed include swimming and boating, and there are golf courses, public parks, and rail-trails in within the watershed. The watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Several fish species inhabit the creek near its headwaters, but there is no aquatic life downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel. Fourteen amphibian species and eight reptile species also inhabit the watershed; some of them breed there as well. Dozens of species of insects and macroinvertebrates live in the creek's drainage basin. Common mammals include white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, and others. Plants inhabiting the watershed include conifer and hardwood trees, herbs, legumes, and grasses. Course Little Nescopeck Creek north of Conyngham Little Nescopeck Creek begins in a valley near Prospect Rock in Butler Township. It flows west-southwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning west-northwest as its valley broadens. The creek crosses Pennsylvania Route 309 before turning west-southwest after more than a mile. It then turns west-southwest for several miles, crossing Interstate 81 and entering Sugarloaf Township, where it flows along the base of Butler Mountain. In Sugarloaf Township, the creek turns northwest for several tenths of a mile, passing through Conyngham before turning north. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Nescopeck Creek. Little Nescopeck Creek joins Nescopeck Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Before the Jeddo Tunnel was constructed, Little Nescopeck Creek was around ten feet wide. However the creek it is currently around 30 to 40 feet wide. This is also ten times wider than the creek was in the early 18th century. However, other factors besides the Jeddo Tunnel, such as discharges from sewage treatment plants and an increase in storm water runoff have also contributed to the widening of the creek. Plans to fix the pollution of Little Nescopeck Creek via the Jeddo Tunnel include reducing the tunnel's discharge and the construction of wetlands. Little Nescopeck Creek's discharge upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel is 2.18 cubic feet per second. Downstream of the tunnel, the discharge is 60.02 cubic feet per second. The creek's specific conductance upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel is 178.3 micromhos per centimeter. Downstream of the tunnel, the specific conductance is 446.13 micromhos per centimeter. The average level of precipitation in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed between 1932 and 1998 was 49 inches per year. Near Little Nescopeck Creek's confluence with Nescopeck Creek, there are white-water rapids that are rated as Class III. Some areas of the creek are also rated Class IV. Little Nescopeck Creek is one of the main sources of flooding in Conyngham.  Water quality  Between 1996 and 1998, the average pH of Little Nescopeck Creek was 4.6. During the same period, the waters of the creek contained an average of 130.87 milligrams per liter of sulfate, 4.03 milligrams per liter of aluminum, 2.01 milligrams per liter of iron, 1.83 milligrams per liter of manganese, and 0.31 milligrams per liter of zinc. Upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, the manganese concentration of the water of Little Nescopeck Creek averages around 108 micrograms per liter. Downstream of the tunnel, the average manganese concentration is 3320 micrograms per liter. Upstream of the tunnel, the average aluminum concentration is under 200 micrograms per liter. Downstream of the tunnel, the average aluminum concentration is 7470 micrograms per liter. Upstream of the tunnel, the average iron concentration is 380 micrograms per liter. Downstream of the tunnel, the average iron concentration is 1947 micrograms per liter. Upstream of the tunnel, the average nickel concentration is below 50 micrograms per liter. The average nickel concentration for the whole watershed is almost three times higher, at 144 micrograms per liter. The average zinc concentration is under 10 micrograms per liter above the Jeddo Tunnel but 519 micrograms per liter downstream of the tunnel. The calcium average concentration above the tunnel is 16.2 milligrams per liter. The average calcium concentration below the tunnel is 32.5 milligrams per liter. There are between 10 and 36 micrograms per liter of copper in nine different sites in and near Little Nescopeck Creek. There are between 1 and 3.3 micrograms per liter of lead at these sites on the creek. There are between 10 and 621 micrograms per liter of zinc at these sites. The average concentration of sulfates upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel is below 10 milligrams per liter, but it is 257 milligrams per liter downstream of the tunnel. The average concentration of calcium carbonate upstream of the tunnel is 33 milligrams per liter, and downstream of it, it is 272 milligrams per liter. There are also a number of non-metallic pollutants in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed. Ammonia is one such pollutant, although the Jeddo Tunnel contributes little to the creek. There is also phosphorus and nitrite in the creek, but the tunnel does not contribute a measurable amount of such compounds. In three different sites on Little Nescopeck Creek downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, the daily load of aluminum passing through ranges from . In the same sites, the daily load of iron ranges between . The daily load of manganese at the sites ranges from . At one site upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, these values are much lower. The daily load of aluminum is , the daily load of iron is , and the daily load of manganese is . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Little Nescopeck Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The creek is in the ridge and valley physiographic province. Little Nescopeck Creek is mostly situated on top of the Mauch Chunk Formation, a Mississippian period rock that consists of shale, conglomerate, and coarse gray sandstone. Areas containing the Mauch Chunk Formation in the watershed include the bottom of the Little Nescopeck Creek valley and Nescopeck Mountain. The Pottsville Formation is another formation in the creek's watershed. It consists of coarse sandstone, gray quartz conglomerate, and shale with some coal. The Pottsville Formation is found in small amounts on Nescopeck Mountain. There is no coal in the watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek. The watershed has never been mined. There are several main types of soil in the watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek. Two of them are the Arnot Series and the Alluvial land. The Arnot Series soil is shallow and drained well. It ranges between close to flat and steep. The Alluvial land ranges between close to flat and moderately sloping. It contains gravel and stones and is found along flood plains within the watershed. A large number of other types of soils are found in very small amounts in the creek's watershed. One type of soil that is also found in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed is the Basher Series. Along the creek near Sybertsville, this type of soil is reddish-brown and sticky to a depth of six there inches (15 centimeters). From 6 to 18 inches (15 to 45 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with some areas of yellowish-red. From 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with pinkish-gray areas and is a sandy loam. From 24 to 37 inches (60 to 93 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with pinkish-gray areas and is a sandy loam. From 37 to 47 inches (93 to 118 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with light gray and yellowish-red areas, and is a coarse sandy loam. From 47 to 53 inches (118 to 133 centimeters), the soil is a reddish-gray sandy loam with some yellowish-red areas. From 53 to 62 inches (133 to 156 centimeters), the soil is reddish-gray and contains sand and gravel. The creek's river valley is steep and narrow. Nescopeck Mountain is in the northern part of the watershed and Buck Mountain is in the southern part. The elevation in the watershed ranges from between 850 and 1800 feet. There is very little limestone near the creek, thus making it very acidic. There are several floodplains in the watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek. The largest of them is near where the creek turns northward, but there is also one not far from its headwaters.  Watershed  The watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Sybertsville. The watershed extends over Sugarloaf Township, Butler Township, Conyngham, and an extremely small part of Hazle Township. The communities of Drums and Kis-Lyn are also in the watershed. The Little Nescopeck Creek watershed is bordered by the Black Creek watershed to the south and the main stem of Nescopeck Creek to the north. The Little Nescopeck Creek watershed is affected by pollution from the Jeddo Tunnel. However this is the only source of acid mine drainage in the watershed. The pollution of the Jeddo Tunnel affects Nescopeck Creek, the Susquehanna River, and the Chesapeake Bay. The creek's watershed consists mostly of farmland and suburbs. However, there are also some woodlands and riparian buffers. The major highways in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed are Interstate 80, Pennsylvania Route 93, and Pennsylvania Route 309. There are a number of different types of wetlands in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed. One type of wetland is the various palustrine, which is scattered in small areas along the creek. The palustrine forested wetland is the type of wetland that makes up the largest patch of wetland in the creek's watershed. This patch's dimensions are by . In the northeastern part of the watershed there are palustrine shrub-scrub, deciduous, broad-leaved evergreen wetlands. In the northwestern portion of the watershed there are palustrine unconsolidated bottom and palustrine forested broad-leaved deciduous wetlands.  History  The area in the vicinity of Little Nescopeck Creek was inhabited by Native Americans as early as 8000 B.C. Some of the earliest people to settle in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed were the Lenni Lenape. European occupation of the creek's watershed began at the middle of the 1700s. The construction of the Susquehanna and Lehigh Turnpike also helped to increase the population of the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Sugarloaf Massacre occurred near Little Nescopeck Creek on September 11, 1780. In 1809, Redmond Conyngham built a sawmill on M. Beishline's land on Little Nescopeck Creek in southwestern Butler Township. In 1810, a carding mill was built on the creek in what was then known as the community of Ashville. Redmond Conyngham also built a gristmill across the creek from the sawmill in 1814. Phillip Drum built a woolen mill near the carding mill in 1835. The creek flooded during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. There are a number of historical sites in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed. Most of them are devoted to the anthracite industry. Little Nescopeck Creek's name comes from a Lenni Lenape word meaning \\"deep black river\\". In 1995, a $50,000 grant was given to the Wildlands Conservancy to improve the water quality of Little Nescopeck Creek. Since the beginning of the 21st century, traffic in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed has multiplied fourfold. The Environmental Protection Agency has established five sites along Little Nescopeck Creek. They are called LNESC5, LNESC6, LNESC7, and LNESC9. The last of these is upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, but the other sites are downstream of the tunnel.  Biology  The drainage basin of Little Nescopeck Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel there is no aquatic life. Although there are plans to restore the fish population on the creek, such plans are impossible to carry out in the near future, due to the expense that would be required for such a restoration. Near the creek's headwaters there are sunfish, brook trout and brown trout and bass. The brown trout and brook trout are native. In 1998, a total of 56 fish over eight different taxa were discovered upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel. The most common species were creek chub and white sucker. One brook trout was discovered in the creek. Upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, there are also turtle and salamander populations. There are a total of 14 species of amphibians in the watershed. Of these, ten species breed in the watershed. There are also a total of eight species of reptiles in the watershed. They consist of two turtles and six snakes. Only the two turtles breed in the watershed. Additionally, there are more than 50 species of birds in the watershed. The most common large game animal in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed is the white-tailed deer. Cottontail rabbits are also common in the watershed, especially in the areas devoted to farming. Beavers, raccoons, and muskrats are the most common fur-bearing animals in the watershed. The macroinvertebrates in the area of Little Nescopeck Creek include five species of flies, five species of caddisflies, four species of mayflies, three species of stone flies, two species of alder flies, two species of beetles, one species of gastropod, and one species of sow bug. There are 30 species of butterflies on the watershed of Little Nescopeck Creek. Of these, seven breed in the creek's watershed. The creek's watershed is also home to seven species of dragonflies and damselflies. Of these, three species breed in the creek's watershed. Common plants in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed include conifer and hardwood trees, herbs, legumes, and grasses. The plants in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed are fairly typical for the Ridge-and-Valley province. Resident deciduous trees in the watershed include five species of oak, one species of cherry, five species of maple, one species of walnut, two species of hickory, and four species of birch, two species of dogwood, and one species each of basswood, poplar, ash, and beech. All but four of these trees are found in the creek's riparian zone. Coniferous trees in the watershed include three species of pine, two species of spruce, and one species of hemlock. Four of these species are found in the creek's riparian zone. There are also 16 species of legumes, grasses, and weeds, seven species of bushes, and six species of perennials. All of the bushes and perennials, and seven of the grasses are found in Little Nescopeck Creek's riparian zone. There are also a number of aquatic plants in Little Nescopeck Creek. These include bulrush, pondweed, duckweed, waterweed, and some types of algae, all of which are typical for a stream in the eastern United States. The forest around the creek's headwaters are composed mostly of oak and hickory. Little Nescopeck Creek's riparian zone has survived to date due to conservation efforts of the local community. The narrowest area of the riparian zone is zero feet in a pasture one mile upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel. The widest area of the riparian zone is on the Keystone Jobs Corps Center property. At Little Nescopeck Creek's confluence with Nescopeck Creek, the riparian zone is wide or more. There are a total of five species of special concern in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed. These include the mountain starwort, which is critically endangered in Pennsylvania.  Recreation  There are few opportunities for activities in Little Nescopeck Creek itself, such as swimming and boating. However, there are some golf courses, public parks, and rail-trails within the creek's watershed. The four golf courses are the Sugarloaf Golf Course, the Sand Springs Golf Course, the Edgewood in the Pines Golf Course, and the private Valley Country Club. There are three recreational sites in the creek's watershed. One is the Butler Recreation Complex in the eastern part of the watershed. The other two are the Whispering Willow Park and the Historic Brainard Church in the western part of the watershed. In 1998, there were plans to convert abandoned railroad beds in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed to rail-trails. There are already a number of trails in the watershed. Some of these date back to Native American times. There are also a number of outlooks in the creek's watershed. There is some kayak traffic on the creek during the spring. There is a 24-acre area of fields and woodlands known as the Bishop Tract; a portion of this tract is along Little Nescopeck Creek.

The concept was introduced by to develop a theory of Jordan algebras using linear algebraic groups and axioms taking the Jordan inversion as basic operation and Hua's identity as a basic relation. There is a classification of simple structures deriving from the classification of semisimple algebraic groups. Over fields of characteristic not equal to 2, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras. Definition Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field K and j a rational map from V to itself, expressible in the form n/N with n a polynomial map from V to itself and N a polynomial in K[V]. Let H be the subset of GL(V) √ó GL(V) containing the pairs (g,h) such that g‚àòj = j‚àòh: it is a closed subgroup of the product and the projection onto the first factor, the set of g which occur, is the structure group of j, denoted G'(j). A J-structure is a triple (V,j,e) where V is a vector space over K, j is a birational map from V to itself and e is a non-zero element of V satisfying the following conditions.Springer (1973) p.10 * j is a homogeneous birational involution of degree ‚àí1 * j is regular at e and j(e) = e * if j is regular at x, e + x and e + j(x) then : j(e+x) + j(e+j(x)) = e * the orbit G e of e under the structure group G = G(j) is a Zariski open subset of V. The norm associated to a J-structure (V,j,e) is the numerator N of j, normalised so that N(e) = 1. The degree of the J-structure is the degree of N as a homogeneous polynomial map.Springer (1973) p.11 The quadratic map of the structure is a map P from V to End(V) defined in terms of the differential dj at an invertible x.Springer (1973) p.16 We put :P(x) = - (d j)_x^{-1} . The quadratic map turns out to be a quadratic polynomial map on V. The subgroup of the structure group G generated by the invertible quadratic maps is the inner structure group of the J-structure. It is a closed connected normal subgroup.Springer (1973) p.18 J-structures from quadratic forms Let K have characteristic not equal to 2. Let Q be a quadratic form on the vector space V over K with associated bilinear form Q(x,y) = Q(x+y) ‚àí Q(x) ‚àí Q(y) and distinguished element e such that Q(e,.) is not trivial. We define a reflection map x* by : x^* = Q(x,e)e - x and an inversion map j by : j(x) = Q(x)^{-1} x^* . Then (V,j,e) is a J-structure. Example Let Q be the usual sum of squares quadratic function on Kr for fixed integer r, equipped with the standard basis e1,...,er. Then (Kr, Q, er) is a J-structure of degree 2. It is denoted O2.Springer (1973) p.33 Link with Jordan algebras In characteristic not equal to 2, which we assume in this section, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras. Let A be a finite-dimensional commutative non-associative algebra over K with identity e. Let L(x) denote multiplication on the left by x. There is a unique birational map i on A such that i(x).x = e if i is regular on x: it is homogeneous of degree ‚àí1 and an involution with i(e) = e. It may be defined by i(x) = L(x)‚àí1.e. We call i the inversion on A.Springer (1973) p.66 A Jordan algebra is defined by the identitySchafer (1995) p.91Okubo (2005) p.13 : x(x^2 y) = x^2 (x y) . An alternative characterisation is that for all invertible x we have : x^{-1}(x y) = x (x^{-1} y) . If A is a Jordan algebra, then (A,i,e) is a J-structure. If (V,j,e) is a J-structure, then there exists a unique Jordan algebra structure on V with identity e with inversion j. Link with quadratic Jordan algebras In general characteristic, which we assume in this section, J-structures are related to quadratic Jordan algebras. We take a quadratic Jordan algebra to be a finite dimensional vector space V with a quadratic map Q from V to End(V) and a distinguished element e. We let Q also denote the bilinear map Q(x,y) = Q(x+y) ‚àí Q(x) ‚àí Q(y). The properties of a quadratic Jordan algebra will beSpringer (1973) p.72McCrimmon (2004) p.83 * Q(e) = idV, Q(x,e)y = Q(x,y)e * Q(Q(x)y) = Q(x)Q(y)Q(x) * Q(x)Q(y,z)x = Q(Q(x)y,x)z We call Q(x)e the square of x. If the squaring is dominant (has Zariski dense image) then the algebra is termed separable.Springer (1973) p.74 There is a unique birational involution i such that Q(x)i x = x if Q is regular at x. As before, i is the inversion, definable by i(x) = Q(x)‚àí1 x. If (V,j,e) is a J-structure, with quadratic map Q then (V,Q,e) is a quadratic Jordan algebra. In the opposite direction, if (V,Q,e) is a separable quadratic Jordan algebra with inversion i, then (V,i,e) is a J-structure.Springer (1973) p.76 H-structure McCrimmon proposed a notion of H-structure by dropping the density axiom and strengthening the third (a form of Hua's identity) to hold in all isotopes. The resulting structure is categorically equivalent to a quadratic Jordan algebra.McCrimmon (1977)McCrimmon (1978) Peirce decomposition A J-structure has a Peirce decomposition into subspaces determined by idempotent elements.Springer (1973) p.90 Let a be an idempotent of the J-structure (V,j,e), that is, a2 = a. Let Q be the quadratic map. Define :\\\\phi_a(t,u) = Q(ta + u(e-a)) . This is invertible for non-zero t,u in K and so œÜ defines a morphism from the algebraic torus GL1 √ó GL1 to the inner structure group G1. There are subspaces : V_a = \\\\left\\\\lbrace{ x \\\\in V : \\\\phi_a(t,u) x = t^2 x }\\\\right\\\\rbrace : V'_a = \\\\left\\\\lbrace{ x \\\\in V : \\\\phi_a(t,u) x = tu x }\\\\right\\\\rbrace : V_{e-a} = \\\\left\\\\lbrace{ x \\\\in V : \\\\phi_a(t,u) x = u^2 x }\\\\right\\\\rbrace and these form a direct sum decomposition of V. This is the Peirce decomposition for the idempotent a.Springer (1973) p.92 Generalisations If we drop the condition on the distinguished element e, we obtain \\"J-structures without identity\\".Springer (1973) p.21 These are related to isotopes of Jordan algebras.Springer (1973) p.22 References  * Category:Algebraic structures ","title":"J-structure"},{"id":"39406267","text":"The Mill‚ÄìPine Neighborhood Historic District is a residential historic district located in Roseburg, Oregon, United States.

In addition to awarding the B Corporation certifications, B Lab‚Äôs initiatives include administration of the B Impact Management programs and software, as well as advocacy for the adoption and improvement of benefit corporation statutes at the state level. (The B Corporation certification should not be confused with state-sanctioned benefit corporation status.) In that sense, B Lab is in the same historical tradition as private certification authorities such as Det Norske Veritas (a Norwegian foundation, operating as a classification society), UL (a private US company, whose standards are recognized by the insurance industry), and Germany's T√úV's (associations devoted to all aspects technical safety). These organizations formally are private-sector entities, but their reach is complementary with, and broadly comparable to, public or intergovernmental standards-setting bodies and certificating authorities. B Lab runs a separate websiteSee devoted to information about benefit corporations and the progress of relevant state legislation. B Lab has attracted media attention to the concept of benefit corporation. The concepts of benefit corporation and B Corporation are sometimes used interchangeably. B Lab has established a partnership with the United Nations to help the private sector translate the SDGs into practical business processes.

During that time the band released 3 studio albums and became known for their live shows but accusations of violent sexual abuse made against vocalist Matthew Johnson saw the dissolution of the band in 2018.  Biography  Hookworms released their first tape cassette EP on Sun Araw's Sun Ark/Magic Lantern label in August 2011. They were known for their live shows. They released live recordings (including a CD release of their WFMU live session) and several other releases through Gringo Records. In 2013 Hookworms signed with the Domino imprint Weird World; they also joined the Too Pure roster with their single \\"Radio Tokyo.\\" Hookworm's 2013 LP Pearl Mystic was widely praised. It was named the number 1 album of 2013 by Loud and Quiet, BrooklynVegan, and Drowned in Sound. Their second LP The Hum also received positive critical reviews. The band was composed of EO, JN, JW, MB, and MJ. They produced through MJ's own Suburban Home Studio in Leeds. All related art was done through JW's Idiot's Pasture. Fans of Hookworms included Bobby Gillespie, Charlotte Church, and Julian Cope, who described their 2011 EP as \\"an epic 26 minutes of sub-Zabriskie Point ambient road-movie heat haze-on- the-road sonic wipeout of the post-Loop variety.\\" On 30 October 2018, Alanna McCardle - formerly a member of Welsh group Joanna Gruesome and a former partner of Hookworms singer Matthew Johnson - took to Twitter to post a series of tweets on behalf of another unnamed woman, referred to only as 'L', who had also been in a relationship with Johnson. In the tweets, McCardle reported allegations made to her by 'L' of her experiences of suffering emotional torture and repeated incidents of sustained brutal, violent sexual assaults by Matthew 'MJ' Johnson. In her assessment of the allegations, McCardle called attention to the frequent and strident messages posted by the official Hookworms social media accounts as well as Johnson's own personal accounts regarding their staunch feminist and anti-abuse ethic - particularly in the context of the music industry. McCardle suggested that this was a strategy intended to somehow mitigate or distract from Johnson's alleged history of abusive behaviour. The next day, the band announced their breakup. In the aftermath of the widely covered allegations made against the singer on Twitter which resulted in the band's breakup - Johnson appeared not only to have removed himself entirely from social media but also the website for, and most references to his recording studio business also appear to have been largely removed from the internet. To date, no follow ups to the allegations made by a third party on Twitter are known to have been made, no further details relating to the actual allegations have come to light, and 'L' remains anonymous.

The oldest house in Scotland dates from the Mesolithic era. In the Neolithic era settled farming led to the construction of the first stone houses. There is also evidence from this period of large timber halls. In the Bronze Age there were cellular roundcrannogs (built on artificial islands) and hillforts that enclosed large settlements. In the Iron Age cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. The largest constructions that date from this era are the circular brochs and duns and wheelhouses. After the First World War, the government responded to urban deprivation with a massive programme of council house building. Many were on greenfield sites of semi-detached homes or terraced cottages. In the 1930s, schemes tended to be more cheaply built, but a survey of 1936 found that almost half of Scotland's houses were still inadequate. There was also extensive private building of sub-urban \\"bungalow belts\\", particularly around Edinburgh. From the mid-twentieth century, public architecture became more utilitarian, as part of the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block. Another solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like Glenrothes and Cumbernauld. Initially praised, they were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century. The creation of Scottish Homes in 1989 increased the stock of private housing and reducing the role of the state sector and the direction of planning by local authorities. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers, many introducing English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland. Sales of council houses were also popular. There have been increasing attempts to preserve much of what survives from Scotland's architectural heritage and programmes of urban regeneration resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres. By 2011, there were 2.37 million households, of which over sixty per cent were owner occupied. The number of single occupied households increased since 2001, largely accounting for an increase in the number of households. The devolved Scottish government took a distinct perspective on homelessness, making accommodation a right for the voluntarily homeless. Prehistory Stone Age The stone building at Knap of Howar, Orkney, one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe The oldest house for which there is evidence in Scotland is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.R. Gray, \\"Bridge works uncover nation's oldest house\\", Herald Scotland, 18 November 2012, retrieved 7 December 2012. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE.A. Moffat, Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History (London: Thames & Hudson, 2005), , pp. 90‚Äì1. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation sites are particularly common and well- preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.F. Pryor, Britain BC (London: HarperPerennial, 2003), , pp. 98‚Äì104 and 246‚Äì50. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney is one of the oldest surviving houses in north- west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE.I.

Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village. From the Neolithic era there is evidence of timber halls.G. Noble, Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), , p. 45. These are probably unique to Scotland and were massive roofed buildings made of oak, all of which seem to have been subsequently burnt down. There is debate as to the role of these buildings, which have been seen variously as regular farming homesteads of Neolithic families and as related to a series of monumental constructions such as barrows.Noble, Neolithic Scotland, p. 17. The hall at Balbridie, Aberdeenshire was long, wide and may have had a roof high, making it large enough to accommodate up to 50 people.Moffat, Before Scotland, pp. 109‚Äì13. Reconstructed crannog on Loch Tay Bronze Age As bronze working developed from about 2000 BCE, there was a decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population.Moffat, Before Scotland, p. 154. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh in Shetland.B. Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest (New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), , p. 60. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.I. Armit, Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), , p. 28. There is also evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters.N. Dixon The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), . They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were revetted around the edges with vertical piles and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak. As elsewhere in Europe, hillforts were first introduced in this period, including the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop,Moffat, Before Scotland, p. 182. and Traprain Law in East Lothian, which had a 20-acre enclosure, sectioned in two places west of the summit, made up of a coursed, stone wall with a rubble core.D. W. Harding, The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders (New York: Routledge, 2004), , p. 190. Iron Age In the early Iron Age, from the seventh century BCE, cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, Pierowall, and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickimin in Shetland. From about 400 BCE more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and Crosskirk, Caithness.B. Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest (New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), , p. 325. The largest constructions that date from this era are the circular broch towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed in height.Armit, Towers in the North, p. 55. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland.Armit, Towers in the North, p. 16. Despite extensive research, their purpose and the nature of the societies that created them are still a matter of debate.B. Smith and I. Banks, In the Shadow of the Brochs (Stroud: Tempus, 2002), , p. 218. Archaeologists since the 1960s have distinguished brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns.B. Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest (New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), , p. 323. The heaviest evidence of the occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they would continue to be used until the Middle Ages.B. Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the seventh century BC until the Roman Conquest (New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), , p. 340. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation.V. Turner, Ancient Shetland (London: B. T. Batsford/Historic Scotland, 1999), , p. 81. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure.J-D. G. G. Lepage, British Fortifications Through the Reign of Richard III: An Illustrated History (McFarland, 2012), , pp. 25 and 31. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.A. Konstam, Strongholds of the Picts: The Fortifications of Dark Age Scotland (Botley: Osprey, 2010), , p. 12. Middle Ages The Moirlanich Longhouse, a byre dwelling built in the nineteenth century in the traditional manner with a cruck frame Rural houses Very few rural houses have survived from the Medieval era in Scotland. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof, however, unlike in England, they were usually hidden from view.R. W. Brunskill, Houses and Cottages of Britain (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), , pp. 235‚Äì40. The major timbers often belonged to the local laird and were known as \\"master's wood\\" or \\"master's timbers\\" and were often reused. The responsibility for infilling the walls usually belonged to the tenants.A. Fenton, \\"Housing: rural lowlands, before and after 1770s\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 321‚Äì3. There was extensive use of turf to fill in the walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.C. McKean, \\"Improvement and modernisation in everyday Enlightenment Scotland\\", in E. A. Foyster and C. A. Whatley, ed., A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1600 to 1800 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , pp. 55‚Äì6. Central to most houses was the hearth. The simplest were in the centre of the floor, with smoke exiting through a hole in the roof and this form tended to be used longer in the Highlands. More developed forms had a backstone of a single flagstone or walling. There is evidence of Lowland houses with canopies for smoke extraction. Burghs From the twelfth century, burghs, towns that were granted certain legal privileges from the crown, developed, particularly on the east coast. They were typically surrounded by a palisade or had a castle and usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross, beside houses for the nobles, burgesses and other significant inhabitants,A. MacQuarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 136‚Äì40. which were often built in a relatively elaborate style and by the end of the period some would have slate roofs or tiles.J. Hunter, Last of the Free: A History of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (London: Random House, 2011), . Very little has survived of the houses of the urban poor. They were probably largely located in the backlands, away from the main street frontages. From Aberdeen and Perth there is evidence of nearly forty buildings dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, with walls of planks or wattles.D. M. Palliser, P. Clark, M. Martin and J. Daunton, The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, Volume 1 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 386. Early modern Rural settlement The six story Gladstone's Land, Edinburgh, demonstrating the tendency to build up in the growing burghs Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 5. Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 41‚Äì55. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing), becoming permanent settlements.Whyte and Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, pp. 18‚Äì19. The standard layout of a house throughout Scotland before agricultural improvement was a byre-dwelling or longhouse or blackhouse with humans and livestock sharing a common roof, often separated by only a partition wall, leading to the byre (barn)Whyte and Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, p. 35. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast, many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. Urban settlement By the sixteenth century perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of the many burghs.E. Gemmill and N. J. Mayhew, Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: a Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , pp. 8‚Äì10. A characteristic of Scottish burghs were long main streets of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , pp. 99‚Äì100. Many houses in Scottish towns had forms derived from those in major urban centres in Tuscany and the Low Countries, although realised with traditional Scottish techniques and materials. Timber-framed houses were common across urban centres in Europe, but, perhaps because of the shortage of large timbers and an abundance of workable stone in Scotland, houses with only timber fronts were more common. Despite the logistical problems timbered houses enjoyed a resurgence in the late sixteenth century, particularly in Edinburgh where there were large numbers of board, jettied and boarded construction.G. P. Stell, \\"Housing: urban, to c. 1770\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 323‚Äì4. Increasingly half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. By the late seventeenth century these had taken on a recognisably Flemish or Dutch appearance. They were often narrow, with four stories, gabled and crow stepped, but often built in stone and harl. They sometimes had ground floor arcades or piazzas. Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-story Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , pp. 75‚Äì6. Improvement and Industrial Revolution Agricultural improvement The rear of tenements at the back of the Parliament House, shown in 1820 In the eighteenth century there was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 288‚Äì91. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun, and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. Hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled. Of those that remained many were now crofters: poor families living on \\"crofts\\"‚Äîvery small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals, with kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service as important sources of revenue.M. J. Daunton, Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700‚Äì1850 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), , p. 85. Many lived in blackhouses with double thickness walls about high, made of local stone and packed with rubble and earth and thatched with reeds. They were unfaced inside and were usually warmed by a peat fire on a slab floor, the smoke from which gave them their name.R. Miers, Scotland's Highlands and Islands (New Holland Publishers), 2006, , p. 24. Others were forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn at Ormiston and Archibald Grant's Monymusk,D. Ross, Scotland: History of a Nation (Lomond Books, 2000), , p. 229. to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, northern England, or to Canada or the United States. Urban growth New Town by James Craig (1768) The Industrial Revolution transformed the scale of Scottish towns. In Edinburgh classicism, together with its reputation as a major centre of the Enlightenment, resulted in the city being nicknamed \\"The Athens of the North\\". In the second half of the eighteenth century a New Town of classically inspired buildings was laid out according to a plan drawn up by James Craig. This gridiron plan, building forms and the architectural detailing would be copied by many smaller towns throughout Scotland, although rendered in locally quarried materials.Maxwell, \\"A History of Scotland‚Äôs Masonry Construction\\", p. 27. With industrialisation Glasgow became the \\"second city of the Empire\\",J. F. MacKenzie, \\"The second city of the Empire: Glasgow ‚Äì imperial municipality\\", in F. Driver and D. Gilbert, eds, Imperial Cities: Landscape, Display and Identity (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), , pp. 215‚Äì23. growing from a population of 77,385 in 1801 to 274,324 by 1841.A. Clark, The Struggle for the Breeches: Gender and the Making of the British Working Class (University of California Press, 1997), , p. 18. Between 1780 and 1830 three middle class \\"new towns\\" were laid out on gridiron plans, similar to those in Edinburgh, to the south and west of the old town.A. Middleton, \\"Glasgow's East End\\", in D. V. Donnison and A. Middleton, Regenerating the Inner City: Glasgow's Experience (London: Routledge, 1987), , pp. 19‚Äì20. The other side of increasing wealth and planned architecture for the aristocracy and middle classes was the growth of urban sprawl. In Glasgow, the growing workforce was left to the mercy of market forces as sub-urban tenements were thrown up, particularly to the east of the city, like those of the Gorbals to the south, where overcrowding, lack of sanitation and general poverty contributed to disease, crime, and very low life expediency.P. Fry, P. S. Fry and F. S. Fry, The History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 1990), , pp. 203‚Äì4. Urban centres increasing made use of locally mined stone. While Edinburgh made extensive use of yellow sandstone, the commercial centre and tenements of Glasgow were built in distinctive red sandstone. After a major fire in the largely wooden Aberdeen in the 1740s, the city fathers decreed that major buildings should be in the locally abundant granite, beginning a new phase in large-scale mining and leading to the \\"granite city\\", becoming a centre of a major industry in the nineteenth century, which supplied Scotland and England with faced stone, pavement slabs and pillars.G. Coyle, The Riches Beneath Our Feet: How Mining Shaped Britain (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), . New towns Housing for workers at New Lanark The sometimes utopian concept of the new town, aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, was an important part of Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth to the twentieth century. In addition to the new towns of Edinburgh and Glasgow, these included the complete rebuilding of Inverary for John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll by John Adam and Robert Mylne, between 1772 and 1800.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 164. Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a gridiron plan.R. Taylor, M. Cox and I. Dickins, eds, Britain's Planning Heritage: A Regional Guide (London: Routledge, 1975), , p. 200. From 1800, Robert Owen's New Lanark, designed as a self-contained community, combining industry with ordered and improved living conditions, was an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.A. Alexander, Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities (London: Taylor & Francis, 2009), , p. 55. Scotland also produced one of the major figures in urban planning in sociologist Patrick Geddes (1854‚Äì1932), who developed the concept of conurbation, and discarded the idea of \\"sweeping clearances\\" to remove existing housing and the imposition of the gridiron plan, in favour of \\"conservative surgery\\": retaining the best buildings in an area and removing the worst. He put this into practice, purchasing and improving slum tenements in James Court, and in new developments at Ramsay Garden, Edinburgh.H. Meller, Patrick Geddes: Social Evolutionist and City Planner (London: Routledge, 1994), , pp. 54‚Äì5, 133 and 135. Twentieth century Council housing and slum clearance Bungalows in Comiston: typical of the suburban low density housing around Edinburgh In the twentieth century the distinctive Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland cement, concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals.Maxwell, \\"A History of Scotland‚Äôs Masonry Construction\\", p. 29. During the First World War, the government became increasingly aware of Scotland's housing problems, particularly after the Glasgow rent strike of 1915. A royal commission of 1917 reported on the \\"unspeakably filthy privy- middens in many of the mining areas, badly constructed incurably damp labourers' cottages on farms, whole townships unfit for human occupation in the crofting counties and islands ... groups of lightless and unventilated houses in the older burghs, clotted masses of slums in the great cities\\".A. McIntosh Gray and W. Moffat, A History of Scotland: Modern Times (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), , pp. 70‚Äì1. The result was a massive programme of council house building. In 1914, 90 per cent of housing stock was in private hands, but by 1981 public sector housing would be peak at 55 per cent (compared with 29.1 per cent in England and Wales).P. Robson, \\"Housing\\" in E. Sutherland and K. E. Goodall, eds, Law Making and the Scottish Parliament: The Early Years Volume 9 of Edinburgh Studies in Law Series (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 143. Many early council houses were built on greenfield sites away from the pollution of the city, often constructed of semi-detached homes or terraced cottages. Knightswood, north-west of Glasgow, was built as a show piece from 1923‚Äì29, with a library, social centre and seven shopping \\"parades\\". In 1937 the Scottish Special Housing Association (SSHA) was established to develop housing for economic growth, but most schemes depended on local initiatives. In the 1930s, schemes tended to be more cheaply built, like Blackhill, Glasgow, with a thousand houses built as two and three storey tenements. These building schemes were designed to rehouse those displaced by urban slum clearance, by which thousands of tenements were demolished. However, often crammed into poor land near railways or gasworks, they soon became notorious. A survey of 1936 found that almost half of Scotland's houses were still inadequate. Residents tended to prefer low-rise solutions to rehousing and there was extensive private building of sub-urban \\"bungalow belts\\", particularly around Edinburgh,M. Glendinning, \\"Housing: urban and suburban since c. 1770s\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 325‚Äì6. laid out with squares and crescents. They helped make the fortunes of builders including Miller Homes, Ford and Torrie and Mactaggart and Mickel.R. Rodger, \\"Urbanisation in twentieth century Scotland\\", in T. M. Devine and R. J. Finlay, eds, Scotland in the Twentieth Century (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , pp. 142‚Äì3. Post-war planning Red Road Flats, Glasgow From the mid-twentieth century, public architecture became more utilitarian, as part of the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of Modernism.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 173. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 450 and 451. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964‚Äì69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents.R. Johnston and A. Mcivor, Lethal Work: A History of the Asbestos Tragedy in Scotland (East Linton, Tuckwell Press, 2000), pp. 103‚Äì4. Robert Matthew (1906‚Äì75) and Basil Spence (1907‚Äì76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow. Another solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like Glenrothes (1948) and Cumbernauld (1956), designed to take excess population from the cities. These used a new low, dense pattern of community design, with terraced cottages and low flats.Glendinning, MacInnes and MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture, p. 457. Cumbernauld was praised for its architecture when first built, but the uncompleted centre and the layout of the town in general, were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century: its modernist architecture described by one resident as \\"the lego fantasy of an unhappy child\\".A. Alexander, Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities (London: Taylor & Francis, 2009), , p. 117. The brutalist tendency in comprehensive Scottish urban planning would be derided by critics for its \\"tabula rasa planning\\" and \\"architect's arrogance\\".Glendinning, MacInnes and MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture, p. 453. The introduction of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 merged the SSHA with the Scottish Housing Association to form Scottish Homes, which had duty to provide housing stock, but did not retain possession, reducing the role of the state sector and the overall direction of planning by local authorities.Colquhoun, The Riba Book of British Housing Design: 1900 to the Present Day (London: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2008), , p. 321. Private building and urban renewal Modern housing at Woodend, Aberdeen, built in brick, half timbering can be seen in the distance The drive to use housing to transform and reorder society subsided in the 1970s. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers. These introduced English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland, which had been largely unknown before this period. Many were small and built to minimum standards with little regard to energy or environmental issues. Sales of council houses were popular in Scotland and until the mid-1990s, unlike in England, local authorities could use the whole of their capital receipts for development, including the building of new houses.Colquhoun, The Riba Book of British Housing Design, p. 319. Under the Scottish Assembly, Scottish Homes was abolished and replaced by Communities Scotland in 2001, which had a responsibility to provide affordable housing and environmental improvement. In 2011, it was in turn replaced by the Scottish Housing Regulator, whose remit includes Scottish local authority landlords.P. Robson, \\"Housing\\" in E. Sutherland and K. E. Goodall, eds, Law Making and the Scottish Parliament: the Early Years (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 150. There have been increasing attempts to preserve much of what survives from Scotland's architectural heritage, including the great buildings and monuments, and the classically influenced houses of towns such as Edinburgh and Glasgow.P. Wilson, \\"A modern material\\", in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , p. 5. There have also been attempts at preserving the surviving Glasgow tenements, many of which have been renovated, restored to their original pink and honeyed sandstone from the black fronts created by pollutionD. Howard, ed., William Adam, Volume 1, Volume 17 of The Journal of the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1990), , p. 112. and brought up to modern standards of accommodation.R. W. Brunskill, Houses and Cottages of Britain (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), , pp. 234‚Äì5. Urban regeneration has also been attempted in areas of post- industrial decline, such as the Merchant City in Glasgow, which was returned to housing from the 1980s, with warehouse loft conversionsM. Cowen and C. Lindsey, \\"City centre regeneration in an urban context: the Glasgow experience in the 1980s\\" in J. Berry, S. McGreal, and W. Deddis, eds, Urban Regeneration: Property Investment and Development (London: Taylor & Francis, 1993), , pp. 175‚Äì92. and more recently the waterfront in Edinburgh, resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres.P.

Modern households Pie chart showing forms of house ownership in Scotland based on the 2011 census In 2011, there were estimated to be 2.37 million households in Scotland. Of these approximately 1.5 million (62.5 per cent) were owner- occupied homes, 319,000 (12.7 per cent) homes rented from local authorities, 305,000 (11.5 per cent) privately rented homes, and 277,000 (11.5 per cent) homes rented from housing associations.National housing statistics \\"National housing statistics\\", Shelter Scotland, retrieved 23 February 2014. The total number had increased by around 173,000 (7.9 per cent) over the previous ten years, with the rate of increase having slowed substantially since the start of the economic downturn in 2007. The rate of growth in households was affected by falls in new housing supply (which includes new builds, refurbishments and conversions). This fell in each year from 2008‚Äì09 to 2010‚Äì11, from around 27,600 units in 2007‚Äì08 to 17,100 units in 2010‚Äì11. The number of households increased after 2010 in every local authority except Clackmannanshire, Inverclyde and West Dunbartonshire. The area with the greatest increase since 2001 in percentage terms was Aberdeenshire with an additional 13,800 households (15.2 per cent). Edinburgh City saw the largest absolute increase of 17,000 households (8.3 per cent). Overall 2.8 per cent of dwellings are vacant and 1.5 per cent are second homes, with the largest proportions in rural areas. The average household size has decreased, with more people living alone or in smaller households. Between 2005 and 2010, the number of households containing just one adult increased by five per cent and the number of two adult households increased by eight per cent, while the number of households containing one adult fell by 11 per cent and the number of households containing two or more adults with children fell by three per cent. The number of households containing three or more adults increased by 11 per cent. These changes in household composition contributed to a four per cent increase in the number of households in Scotland between 2005 and 2010, which was higher than the increase in the population over this time (2.5 per cent).General Register Office of Scotland, Estimates of Households and Dwellings in Scotland, 2011 , retrieved 23 February 2014. Since the establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament and devolved government in 1999, there has been a response to homelessness in Scotland that has been distinctive from the rest of the UK, described as a \\"rights-based approach\\". The 2001 Housing (Scotland) Act required local authorities to house homeless people while claims of priority need were investigated. Even if applicants were found not to be in priority need, councils were required to provide accommodation for a reasonable period. The 2003 Homelessness (Scotland) Act went further in phasing out the distinction between priority and non-priority need, so that by 2012 all people unintentionally homeless would be entitled to a permanent home. Partly as a result of these changing definitions, the number of applications for assistance assessed as in priority need increased from 20,000 in 2000/01 to 34,940 in 2008/09. The number of households in temporary accommodation also increased in from 4,600 in 2002 to 10,815 by 2010. Some local authorities expressed concerns that they would be unable to meet expanding demand from existing permanent accommodation.B.

He was executed in Sachsenhausen concentration camp because of his activities in the \\"Community for Peace and Development\\" (German: \\"Gemeinschaft f√ºr Frieden und Aufbau\\"), which he founded together with Hans Winkler in Luckenwalde.Chronic of Luckenwalde (German)  Life  Stone embedded in front of Werner's home in Berlin Werner Scharff was born into a Jewish family in Posen in 1912.Johannes Tuchel (ed.): Der vergessene Widerstand. Zu Realgeschichte und Wahrnehmung des Kampfes gegen die NS-Diktatur. Wallstein Verlag, G√∂ttingen, 2001, pp. 97-107 (German) The family moved to Berlin in 1918. After the early death of his father in 1929, Scharff took up an apprenticeship as an electritician to be able to take care of his mother and his two younger siblings. In 1938, he married Gertrud Weissman. A planned emigration of the Jewish couple failed. In 1941, Scharff started to work as an electrician in the synagogue Levetzowstra√üe in Berlin-Moabit, which was misused as a deportation site from 1942 by the SS. This provided Scharff with a deep insight into the cruelty of the Nazis and the bitter fate of their victims. As the electrician, Scharff was allowed to move freely within the deportation site and to leave it at any time. He used this to smuggle messages, food and clothes from the relatives of the detained into the deportation site on a large scale.Edith Hirschfeldt: Werner Scharff, In: Die Unvergessenen, Heidelberg 1952(German) Thanks to the occupation of his new girlfriend Fancia Gr√ºn, who worked as a secretary in the registration office of the Jewish Community and who was responsible for writing deportation lists, he was also able to warn many of his friends and acquaintances from imminent deportations.  Deportation and escape  When the other community members where deported in the summer of 1943, Scharff fled to the underground on June 10, 1943.Werner Scharff and the Community for Peace and Reconstruction Four weeks later, on July 14, the Gestapo found him and deported him to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. He did not stay long however and escaped on September 7 together with Fancia Gr√ºn. His destination was the address of resistance member Hans Winkler, which had been recommended to him in Theresienstadt as a possible hideout in Berlin.  Active resistance and execution  Werner Scharff was full of ideas how to actively encourage other citizens to passive resistance against the Nazis, but he needed people to help him. When Winkler heard of Scharff's plans, he was instantly willing to participate. Together with G√ºnter Samuel and Erich Schwarz, Winkler had already been operating a loose resistance group since before the outbreak of the war to help saving Jews from deportation. The resistance group became later known as the \\"Community for Peace and Development\\" (German: \\"Gemeinschaft f√ºr Frieden und Aufbau\\"). His occupation at the district court gave Winkler the opportunity to organise passports and to issue death certificates of Jews who had been hidden at his and his friends' places. He also had many friends and acquaintances who were willing to provide food stamps and accommodation. Scharff gradually became the head of the organisation which mainly consisted of friends and acquaintances of Scharff and Winkler, of opponents of the Nazi regime, and other like-minded citizens of Berlin-Wedding, Berlin-Mitte, and Berlin- Kreuzberg. Scharff developed new ideas how to distribute chain mails and opposition leaflets and how to recruit new supporters. Together with Winkler he organised the large-scale distribution of their leaflets, in which they appealed to independent thinking, to resistance and to putting an end to the war. Furthermore, they provided shelter to 6‚Äì10 persecuted Jews at any time. Scharff and Winkler even contacted inhabitants of the prisoner of war camp Stalag III-A in Luckenwalde, most likely with the goal to ultimately gain access to military arsenal. It was Scharff's dream to free the last Jews that were imprisoned in the prison and detention camp at the Jewish hospital in Berlin. Many, most of all the wife of Hans Winkler, thought that the organisation was acting too reckless. A member of the group, Hilde Bromberg, was indeed arrested in April 1944 after a denunciation by the widow of the executed book seller August Bonne√ü jr. (1890-1944). Although Bromberg did not reveal the other group members and even managed to lead the Gestapo astray, they eventually tracked down the group and arrested Werner Scharff on October 14, 1944. Scharff was brought to the prison at Alexanderplatz and brutally interrogated. Shortly thereafter, Winkler and many other members of the organisation were arrested as well. By the end of 1944, Scharff was transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The SS executed him on March 16, 1945. Fancia Gr√ºn was executed in the concentration camp as well. Many other members of the community only survived thanks to the end of the war‚Äîotherwise they would have faced certain death.

Built in the early 1850s, the adobe is typical of the building style prevalent during and around California's period of Mexican governance. Raimundo Yorba built the adobe on land thought to be part of Rancho El Rincon, a land grant owned by his father, Bernardo Yorba; however, a later survey determined the adobe was not part of the rancho. The younger Yorba lived in the adobe until 1868, when Forty-Niner and Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War veteran Fenton M. Slaughter bought the house. Slaughter, who later served in the California State Assembly, lived in the house until his 1897 death. Slaughter's daughter, Julia Slaughter Fuqua, began rehabilitating the adobe in 1928.

History it was Built between 1570 and 1571, the Catedral Nuestra Se√±ora de La Asunci√≥n is the oldest church in Venezuela and was one of the first in the Americas. Its construction was started in 1570 (much before the construction of the cathedral of Santa Ana de Coro) and was never completed. The church was founded by a member of the Dominican order, the priest Juan de Manzanillo. It was later destroyed by French Lutherans, and by the year 1602 the cathedral was reported to be \\"en ruinas\\", in ruins. Work for reconstruction of the building began again in 1609, and the cathedral was finally completed eleven years later, in 1621. Features Interior view. Set in the tree lined Plaza Bolivar, the church has a rectangular plan with massive walls as protection against pirate attacks. The main body of the cathedral, which is rectangular in shape, has dimensions of , and the interior is lined with two rows of huge columns in the tuscan style which support the roof. There is a bell tower outside, which is unique and the bells are now preserved in the plaza. One of the most important religious buildings on the Island, the Virgin of La Asunci√≥n is worshiped here. The cathedral has been declared a historical city monument. It has a plain fa√ßade and interior, but its left lateral tower, which dates to 1599, is the oldest in the country.

No trace of Allen has been found and his fate remains unknown. Background Martin Allen and his brothers grew up in a council flat in Hornsey, where their mother was a secretary at Tufnell Park Primary School. When Martin was 12 his father gained employment as a chauffeur to the Australian High Commissioner and the whole family moved to a cottage in the grounds of the Australian High Commission in Kensington, London. This was a significant change in circumstance and their new neighbours included the De Beers jewellery family. Margaret Thatcher and Ted Heath were regular visitors to the street and Thatcher had a passing acquaintance with Allen's father. Martin attended the Central Foundation Grammar School in Old Street and was described as intelligent, good at French, maths and drawing. Martin was a shy boy, young for his age, and not the type to run away from home. Disappearance On 5 November 1979, Allen travelled home from school on the London Underground. His intention was to go to see his older brother, Bob, who lived near Holloway Road, but he needed to go home first in order to collect some money. At around 3:50pm he said goodbye to some school friends at King's Cross station and set off in the direction of the Piccadilly line platform to travel home. Initial reports state that this was the last confirmed sighting of Martin. Later reports state that Martin came home around 5pm as witnessed by his brother Kevin but went straight out again. Allen failed to reach his brother Bob's home. The family were not alarmed that Martin did not come home that night as they knew that if it got too late Martin would stay at his brother Bob's house. The next day the family had not heard anything. At 7pm Mrs Allen rang Bob. The parents phoned Martin's best friend, Robert, who told them Martin had not been at school. The parents then called the police.  Initial Investigation  When he was reported missing, a large-scale police operation was launched supported by a media campaign. This failed to locate Allen. The police searched Martin's bedroom in the family cottage for 9 hours but did not find any fingerprints, not even any belonging to Martin himself. After a TV appeal five weeks after the disappearance, a male witness came forward to report seeing a man accompanying a boy acting suspiciously at Gloucester Road tube station at 4:15pm on the day of the disappearance. This was about half an hour after Martin disappeared. The witness reported that the man was standing with his arm around the shoulder of a boy resembling Martin. The boy appeared distressed and both parties appeared to be nervous as they got onto a Tube train. The witness saw the man prod the boy in the back and overheard him tell the boy not to try to run when the pair left the train at Earl's Court station. The witness described the man as 6 ft tall, in his 30s, well built, with very blonde hair and moustache and was wearing a denim jacket and trousers. The investigation to find the identity of the man was described at the time as London's biggest ever house-to-house search. It included a visit to every property in Earls Court, the publication of an artist's impression and the wide circulation of Identikit pictures of the man. Investigators eliminated 200 possible suspects, spoke to 50,000 people and collected 600 statements during the inquiry. The identity of the man was never discovered. Allen's brother Jeffrey alleged that in the early stages of the police investigation the detective responsible for the original 1979 investigation had told the Allen family that there were \\"high-up people involved\\" and that they should stop talking and \\"not take it further because someone will get hurt\\". Subsequent events In 1984, a book on the case by writer Anton Gill was published by Corgi Books.Anton Gill (1984) Martin Allen is missing, Corgi Childrens. . In 1998 it was reported that police in Liverpool, acting on an anonymous tip off, had discovered a ‚Äòshrine‚Äô dedicated to Martin at the home of an alleged paedophile. Officers reportedly visited the house of the 62-year-old man and found a makeshift shrine including newspaper cuttings, pictures and a headstone engraved \\"In Memory of Martin Allen\\". This bizarre development prompted a brief resurgence of interest in the case, but no new leads were forthcoming. In 2009, police told Kevin and Jeffrey that the files on the investigation had been destroyed in a flood. In 2009 Allen's parents conceded they had no hope of seeing him alive again, believing him to have been abducted; they stated their wish simply to know what had happened and why. Martin's father, Tom, died in 2012. His mother has since also died. Subsequent investigations The case was closed in the 1980s, but reopened in 2009 in light of new information. The officer leading the new police investigation admitted that police were baffled by the case and that, despite a massive initial inquiry and a good response from the public, they had few leads. The police interviewed serial killer Dennis Nilsen twice about Martin's disappearance. No evidence of a connection was found. In 2012, British police initiated a number of new investigations into child abuse allegations dating back over the previous 20‚Äì30 years. This included a re- investigation of claims of child abuse at the Elm Guest House. Elm House was a London guest house where it was known that exploitation and abuse of children had taken place repeatedly over a prolonged period of time during the 1970s and 1980s. The location of Elm Guest House, along with the known predatory activities of the individuals involved there, have led to media speculation that Martin and another boy, eight-year-old Vishal Mehotra, could have been abducted (and later murdered) by paedophiles active at the guest house around that time.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-failings-put- dozens-of-children-at-risk-from-notorious-paedophile-ring-8518522.html \\"Police failings put dozens of children at risk from notorious pedophile gang\\", Independent, 3 March 2013. In 2015 Operation Midland officers told Kevin to ‚Äúprepare for the worst‚Äù as they had ‚Äúcredible evidence‚Äù from a VIP gang survivor that Martin had been murdered. Operation Midland interviewed Carl Beech, then known publicly under the pseudonym \\"Nick\\", who falsely claimed that he saw three boys being murdered by the paedophile network: one was run over, another strangled by a Conservative MP and the third killed in front of a government minister. Beech told police that former Tory MP Harvey Proctor had been responsible for two of the murders and had been implicated in the third. Proctor denied any and all allegations and did not recognise an E-FIT photograph of the boy when questioned. The allegations were proved false and Beech was proved to be a fantasist. Beech was convicted of crimes related to lying to police in July 2019 and was jailed for 18 years. In April 2015 it was announced by the police that some of the lost evidence had been rediscovered. In May 2016 Operation Malswick superseded Operation Midland and was formed specifically to re-investigate Martin Allen's case. Police questioned Sidney Cooke, a paedophile gang leader who was jailed for life in 1985.

The character made her first on-screen appearance on 3 June 2013. Lindsey had been involved in such storylines as covering up the murder of Dr. Paul Browning (Joseph Thompson), with Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) and Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), having to choose between two brothers, Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan) and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham), being revealed as the notorious Gloved Hand Killer, and teaming up with fellow serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). Lindsey had killed seven people in her killing spree: Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener), Will Savage (James Atherton), Mariam Andrews (Helen Lederer), Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill), Dylan Jenkins (James Fletcher), Ashley Davidson (Kierston Wareing) and Dr. Charles S'avage (Andrew Greenough), while also attempting to kill five others: Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks), Freddie, her sister Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis) and Mercedes. She is known to viewers as the \\"Gloved Hand Killer\\". It was revealed during the 20th anniversary week of Hollyoaks that Lindsey had also attempted to murder her younger sister, Kath Butterfield (Mikaela Newton) when they were adolescents, as shown in flashbacks. In 2016, it was announced that Austin had quit the role and would be departing the soap later that year. Her final scenes aired 18 May 2016, during which she was murdered by Silas. Development Creation and Introduction The character and Austin's casting were announced on 17 May 2013. In July 2012, Austin appeared in an episode of Hollyoaks as Sapphire, a girl who works in the strip club that Ally Gorman (Daniel O'Connor) visits. She also appeared in an episode of Hollyoaks Later in October 2012. She was then approached to audition for the part of Lindsey and underwent a series of screen tests. Austin secured the role in January 2013 and signed a one-year contract. She had to keep it a secret and began filming her scenes four months later. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that Lindsey was being introduced as the fianc√©e of fellow new character Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Kilkelly revealed that Lindsey and Joe have a strong relationship because she is Joe's one true love. Lindsey is also in good standing with the Roscoe family matriarch Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth) who enjoys the female company. The character was described in a Hollyoaks press release as \\"feisty, determined and driven\\" and \\"more than capable of holding her own with the outspoken Roscoe boys\\". In addition Lindsey was written as a junior doctor working at the Dee Valley Hospital with the established character Doctor Browning (Joseph Thompson). Of her casting, Austin said \\"I'm so excited to be joining the cast of Hollyoaks as Lindsey Butterfield and being part of the Roscoe clan. We have lots of exciting stories ahead.\\" Lindsey began appearing in the series from early June 2013. Characterisation In an E4.com interview, Austin detailed her character as \\"feisty, determined, unpretentious, passionate, strong\\". Lindsey wants to live life to the fullest and be happy. She is always determined to do the right thing and places importance on being loyal to family and friends. Lindsey, a clever junior doctor, worked hard to create a career and sought guidance and encouragement from Sandy. Lynsey takes pride in her job and wants to better herself by being ambitious. She is a \\"sturdy member\\" of the Roscoe family and is closer to them than her own family. She has also devoted time and care to keep Joe out of trouble. Austin later described Lindsey as \\"quite feisty, but she is also very good, she has a good moral high ground.\\" She added that her character creates \\"lots of drama, but in a good way\\". Austin later told Natalie Dearman from the Herts and Essex Observer that \\"Lindsey is quite a dominant character and is very feisty, she really holds her own and has got some quite lively story lines coming up.\\" The character's feisty side has been displayed through her willingness to fight other characters. Austin notes that her fictional counterpart would never instigate a physical fight, but would always finish one. It also shows that she has \\"a bit of street about her\\" that she has learned from her London upbringing. As she is not a quiet character, Austin warned that there would be many more disagreements with fellow residents. Following the departures of Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton), Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) and Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper), executive producer Bryan Kirkwood felt that Hollyoaks needed Lindsey, a new \\"strong leading lady with a big heart and a strong moral code.\\" He also viewed Lindsey as the reason the Roscoe family had been successful additions, adding that \\"Sophie has arrived with such confidence and charisma, which I'm overjoyed by\\". Feud with Doctor Browning Karen Hassan who plays Lynsey Nolan revealed that she had been working with Austin on a new storyline. She explained that Lynsey returns to haunt her murderer Doctor Browning and Lindsey would also be involved. Doctor Browning develops an attraction to Lindsey because of his overbearing fianc√©e's wedding plans. He invites Lindsey to a lecture and attempts to seduce her in a lift. But she is appalled and brands his behaviour pathetic. Her attitude reminds him of Lynsey and attacks Lindsey. Austin told Kilkelly that Lindsey views Doctor Browning as a charming role model and wants to work hard to impress him. She noted that Lynsey is not stupid and this is conveyed when she becomes concerned about his behaviour. But not wanting to jeopardise her career prospects she acts wary. Austin revealed that Doctor Browning likes her character's \\"down-to-earth\\" nature and shares his problems. But the attack occurs soon after and changes their work relationship. Thompson told Laura Morgan from All About Soap that Doctor Browning's attempt to attack Lindsey came about in a \\"strange\\" way. He added that his scheming alter-ego underestimated Lindsey because he did not expect her to be \\"extremely feisty\\". She is also very similar to Lynsey, Doctor Browning believes that it is all a \\"nasty joke\\", but Thompson thought that it was the reason Browning was \\"weirdly drawn\\" to Lindsey. On 14 June 2013, Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star reported that Lindsey would tell Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) of her fianc√©'s infidelity causing a \\"catfight\\" between the two. Thompson informed the reporters that \\"it all comes to a head in an explosive way. Mercedes and Lindsey have a catfight. You have to see it to believe it. And Browning has a scrap with Joe.\\" Metcalfe told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that the fight scenes were complex and required a stunt coordinator to help choreograph. The fight took a number of hours to complete as Austin and Metcalfe put extra effort into making it believable. Doctor Browning claims that Lindsey tried to seduce him but Mercedes is not convinced. A mystery character begins stalking Doctor Browning over Lynsey's murder. He soon begins to have hallucinations of Lynsey each time Lindsey interacts with him. Joe and Freddie Roscoe Lindsey is introduced as Joe's fianc√© who have been in a long-term relationship. They share a strong relationship built on honesty. Lindsey moving to Chester shows their strength. Austin described Joe as a character with a troubled past and it was not until they met that he turned his life around. She cannot imagine a life without Joe because he means everything to her. Callaghan told Kilkelly that Lindsey's love saved him from a life in prison because she \\"keeps him on a level ground\\". She gave him aims in life and a future to work towards. He concluded that without Lindsey \\"could be incredibly destructive to himself and to anybody around him\\". In June 2013, Charlie Clapham who plays Joe's brother Freddie Roscoe revealed that his character shares a special bond with Lindsey. Austin also confirmed the connection stating that Freddie is Lindsey's best friend and confidant. Like with Joe, she wants to make him a better person because she sees goodness in him. Their friendship was subtly developed and played out gradually on-screen. The Roscoe family later face a series of problems which sees Freddie begin dating Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis). Clapham told All About Soap's Morgan that Lindsey's own problems actions begin to push him closer to Sinead. But he noted that Freddie loves Lindsey and only cares about Sinead. Lindsey realises that Freddie was responsible for a fire at a local nightclub. Clapham explained that Lindsey looked at Freddie and automatically knew. He added that \\"he spins his family all kinds of lies, and he just can't do that with Lindsey. She's his soulmate.\\" He also branded Lindsey and Freddie's \\"deep connection\\" the \\"emotional backbone\\" of the Roscoe family. The storyline resulted in Clapham being inundated with tweets asking questions about Lindsey and Freddie's relationship. As the storyline progresses Freddie struggles with feelings for two women. Clapham branded it a \\"bizarre situation\\" for Freddie after secretly loving his brother's girlfriend for nine years. Lindsey is oblivious and the actor thought that her never discovering the truth would be a sad scenario for the characters. He concluded that Freddie should just pursue Lindsey. Storylines Lindsey arrives in Dee Valley Hospital after getting a job there. She is revealed to be the fianc√©e of Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Dr. Paul Browning (Joseph Thompson) is shocked by her name as it reminds him of Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan), who he murdered the previous year. Whilst waiting for the lift alongside Doctor Browning, he tries to rape her but she escapes after scratching his face. Joe tells Lindsey that he wants children with her and she agrees to his suggestion. After falling pregnant, she miscarries, disappointing both Lindsey and Joe. Lindsey begins friendships with Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) and Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), who have both been attacked by Doctor Browning, which is unknown to Lindsey. Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) becomes close to Lindsey, who sees him as a brother. Unknown to her, Freddie is developing feelings for her. Lindsey is delighted when she hears that she is pregnant again but only a few months later whilst coming home from shopping, she is run over by Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson). She later tragically miscarries in hospital. With Cindy, Lindsey goes to visit Mercedes and they find Doctor Browning trying to kill her, so they all murder him. The three girls decide to keep it a secret. They dump his body in Cindy's freezer but they take the body away when the freezer breaks. Whilst taking his body, Grace Black (Tamara Wall) catches them and suspects something after arriving in the village to find Clare Devine's (Gemma Bissix) murderer. She tries to befriend Lindsey but she goes away. Freddie helps Lindsey, Mercedes and Cindy by pushing the car down the cliff and setting it on fire. On Freddie's wedding day to Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis), Grace kidnaps a person he loves. He believes it is Lindsey but when he arrives back at the house, she is there and then he realises that it is Joe who Grace has kidnapped. Freddie tells Fraser Black (Jesse Birdsall) and they find Joe but in a building that is about to be demolished. After, everyone believes Joe is dead so Fraser threatens Freddie to keep it a secret. Freddie tells Sinead, and they lie to the whole family. After a while, Lindsey starts to develop feelings for Freddie and they kiss, so Freddie tells her they can run away but Sinead sees this. Soon, Freddie goes back to Sinead because he thinks Lindsey doesn't have feelings for him. Later, Sinead's daughter Katy O'Connor is feeling sick and asks Lindsey to cure her as she is one of the nurses available but Lindsey refuses, thinking Sinead is lying. Baby Katy then suddenly dies, causing Sinead to go into a clinic. After a while, Lindsey falls in love with Freddie and they sleep together. Then, Joe comes rushing in the hospital, shocking Lindsey and Freddie. Lindsey later decides she wants to be with Freddie but she discovers that Freddie has lied. Due to recent events, Cindy tells Dirk Savage (David Kennedy) that she murdered Doctor Browning but he doesn't go to the police. Joe later vanishes so Lindsey and Freddie enjoy time together. When Lindsey finds out about Sinead trying to commit suicide, she feels guilty and is later sued to court by Sinead. Lindsey loses her job in the process, and is later slapped by Sinead. Lindsey discovers that she is pregnant again but doesn't know who the father is. Lindsey and Joe resume their relationship. Lindsey's sister Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis) later arrives. Whilst trying to get her job back, Lindsey is held hostage by and Big Bob (Vincent Ebrahim), alongside Freddie, Kim, Grace and other village residents. She tries to escape and Freddie persuades Big Bob to allow her to go but when one of the terrified doctors flees, Freddie is shot by Big Bob. Thinking that Freddie is going to die after a large amount of blood loss, Lindsey tells him that he might be the father of her child as she lied about having a paternity test before. Freddie eventually recovers from his bullet injury, and Big Bob dies after being shot during a fight with Cameron Campbell (Cameron Moore). After discovering that Freddie killed Fraser, Lindsey goes into labour and gives birth to Joseph Roscoe Jr., better known as JJ. Later in the hospital, Lindsey confesses her love for Freddie and the pair kiss. As Freddie confronts Lindsey the next day about recent events, they kiss again but unfortunately they are spotted by Mercedes and she blackmails Freddie for money. Lindsey tells him to silence Mercedes, and later that night, she is \\"murdered\\". Freddie is the prime suspect of the investigation, and he is later arrested. Lindsey believes that Freddie didn't kill Mercedes and Kim gives him a false alibi. Kim discovers that Freddie has lied about his whereabouts on the night of the murder, so decides to tell the police but is persuaded by Lindsey against the idea. Lindsey and Freddie still continue their affair and numerous of times they are nearly caught by DS Geoff Thorpe (James Bradshaw), a detective investigating Mercedes' \\"murder\\". D.S Thorpe then sends a photograph to Joe of Lindsey and Freddie together. Freddie and Lindsey later discover the photograph is of them, so Freddie pays a man to mug Joe and destroy the evidence. While the man is burning the photograph, Joe turns up and all that is left is Freddie's face. Later, Joe finds out that Freddie paid a man to mug him. When Freddie leaves a party, Joe follows him to the Roscoe garage with JJ and his mother Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth). As Joe opens the garage shutters, he and Sandy are disgusted to find Lindsey and Freddie in a passionate embrace. Joe then returns to the party and shouts at Lindsey and Freddie in front of everyone. Back the Roscoe household, Joe confronts Lindsey and asks if she still loves him, but she admits that she doesn't and that she is in love with Freddie. Lindsey then leaves the house, and Joe punches Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener) when he finds him fighting with his younger brother, Robbie (Charlie Wernham). Rick is rushed to hospital, where he falls the first victim of the Gloved Hand Killer. Joe is believed to have killed Rick and is arrested. He is later released without charge. Lindsey and Freddie become a couple but their happiness is short-lived when evidence against Freddie begins to mount, but they later discover that Grace is setting Freddie up for murdering Mercedes. It is later revealed that Mercedes is not dead and that she is very much alive after Grace gives Joe her new address in France. Mercedes and Grace are framing Freddie, as they both have reasons for despising him. Mercedes gives Joe some of Freddie's clothing with her blood on it and asks him to plant it in Freddie and Lindsey's flat. At JJ's naming ceremony, Joe enters Freddie and Lindsey's bedroom and plants the evidence behind the wardrobe. The police then find it when the McQueen family show them a diary entry by Mercedes which Grace planted. Freddie and Lindsey then go on the run with JJ and are constantly narrowly escape capture. Joe then finds them and forces Lindsey to choose between Freddie and JJ, of whom she chooses Freddie. Lindsey later calls Joe for help and reveals that she witnessed Freddie violently beating up a man in a nightclub, and nearly attacked her. Joe arrives and brings her back to the village, where she reveals that she believes Freddie killed Mercedes. Unbeknownst to everyone, Freddie and Lindsey are still a couple and they are trying to play Grace at her own game. When Lindsey catches Grace call somebody on Skype, she discovers that Mercedes is still alive. After revealing this to Freddie, Lindsey goes to the police with Joe and she tells them that she knows that Mercedes is still alive. When they interview Grace, however, she cunningly covers her tracks, leaving Lindsey frustrated. With the help of Sinead, Lindsey manages to get the knife with Mercedes' blood on it, which Kim had found into the McQueen's house and puts some of what she assumes is Porsche McQueen's (Twinnie Lee Moore) hair, is actually Phoebe McQueen's (Mandip Gill) and she is imprisoned, much to Lindsey's horror. However she doesn't confess. Freddie then proposes to Lindsey and she accepts. When Lindsey finds out that Kim was visiting their brain-damaged sister Kath Butterfield (Mikaela Newton), she has Kath moved, much to Kim's anger. On her wedding day Kim tells Lindsey she saw Grace with a gun and thinks she is going to kill Freddie, as she now has nothing to lose as Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) had pulled out of her surrogacy agreement earlier that day. The two then witness first Grace, then Joe try to shoot Freddie, but Mercedes knocks the gun away. In October 2015, it was later revealed to be Lindsey as the Gloved Hand Killer who has been killing people at the hospital. She reveals it to Kim after supposedly killing Freddie. Kim thinks Lindsey killed Freddie by accident, and also did the same with Ashley Davidson (Kierston Wareing), but she realises Lindsey deliberately killed them. Lindsey admits to killing Rick, Will Savage (James Atherton), Mariam Andrews (Helen Lederer), Phoebe, Dylan Jenkins (James Fletcher), Ashley and Dr. Charles S'avage (Andrew Greenough). She reveals that she was killing people to fill in the void that she caused when she pushed Kath into a lake. She then says after killing Rick, she couldn't stop killing more people, but does not admit to Kim that she targeted her ex-girlfriend Esther. Lindsey pleads with Kim to help cover up her tracks, but Kim is very shocked and disgusted, and locks Lindsey in a room, and calls the police, but Kim later has second thoughts, and puts Freddie's body in the boot of Trevor's car, framing him for Freddie's apparent murder. When Lindsey learns that Jason is investigating the deaths of her victims she tries to convince to let it go and to confide in her. Jason however ignores her on both counts. Lindsey is later promoted to senior doctor of the hospital, much to Kim's shock. Jason then links the deaths as murders, and informs the news press. Lindsey thinks Kim told the news press, and injects her with potassium chloride, putting Kim in a coma. Lindsey then starts to fall for Joe again, and tries to get back together with him, but it is apparent that he wants to be with Mercedes. Lindsey then visits Kim, along with Mercedes, to which Kim then starts to awake from her coma. Lindsey then makes Mercedes leave by getting her drunk, to which she is escorted out of the hospital. Lindsey then takes a syringe, and puts it in Kim's IV drip. Kim pleads with Lindsey not to kill her, but Lindsey says that she must, but then refrains from it. Lindsey then attends Freddie's funeral, but Kim then bursts in the church, and nearly reveals that Lindsey killed Freddie, but Lindsey interrupts her by taking her outside of the church, saying that she can't cope with herself, and that she needs Kim's help. Kim then agrees to help Lindsey. Lindsey and Joe then later sleep with each other, and Lindsey thinks that she and Joe are back together, but Joe says that it was a mistake, and he is in love with Mercedes. Lindsey then plans to kill Mercedes, but Kim talks her out of it. Lindsey pretends to agree, and calls Mercedes over to her house. When Mercedes is distracted, Lindsey pulls out a syringe, and was about to kill Mercedes with it, until Kim then bursts in, and fights with Lindsey, shouting that she must not kill again, to which Joe then becomes concerned. Lindsey then fakes a pregnancy so she can get back together with Joe. When Joe finds out Lindsey being \\"pregnant\\", Mercedes and Joe break up and Mercedes then leaves Hollyoaks. Kim then finds out about Lindsey faking a pregnancy, and then pushes her. Joe then gets furious with Kim and accuses her of assaulting Lindsey. Kim then manipulates Joe into discovering Lindsey's lie by making him concerned for the baby's health causing him to make her check to see if there is a heartbeat, which there is, meaning Lindsey is actually pregnant. Kim then runs further tests, and she reveals that Lindsey is pregnant, meaning that the baby is Freddie's and not Joe's. As a result, Lindsey then hides the fact from Joe that the baby is Freddie's by pretending it is Joe's. Later on, Lindsey and Kim then plan to frame Tegan for the murders and attempted murders at the hospital by planting syringes full of potassium chloride in her trolley. Kim then feels guilty for what she's doing and stops her from doing it. However Freddie, who believes she's the person who attempted to kill him, calls the police and Kim is then arrested of his attempted murder. This leaves Tegan and Lindsey shocked. While Kim is in prison, Lindsey says to Kim that she is going to get her out. But in fact, she planted the syringe she used to kill people and the earring she dropped while she attempted to kill Esther in Kim's handbag. Kim is then accused of being the Gloved Hand Killer, and is charged with the murders of Rick, Will, Mariam, Phoebe, Dylan, Ashley and Dr. S'avage, and the attempted murders of Freddie, Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher) and Esther. When Mercedes returns from Spain, she and Esther realise that Lindsey is wearing the same earrings at the person who tried to kill Esther. Mercedes and Cindy question Lindsey about the killings, she denies the accusations. Esther still believes the killer is Kim and heads to the prison to visit her. When Esther leaves, Mercedes sees a drawing of an eye that Lindsey drew. She then realises that she's the killer after she and Esther read a fake letter of Kim confessing to the murders earlier in the day. Lindsey still denies the accusations but after more questions, she finally confesses to the murders. When Cindy goes to call the police, Lindsey blackmails then by saying if she goes down, Cindy and Mercedes will go down with her as they killed Doctor Browning back in 2013. When Mercedes leaves the room they're in, Lindsey attacks Cindy by hitting her over the head with Phoebe's copy of Little Women, rendering her unconscious. After Mercedes discovers her, Lindsey hits her over the head with the book as well. She then locks the door to Phoebe's room so they can't escape and contact the police. Unbeknownst to her, Esther discovers that Lindsey is the Gloved Hand Killer when Kim tells her. Esther then goes to the police with the information and DS. Thorpe does not believe her while at the McQueen home Tegan and Celine her banging from upstairs and go to see what is going on. They then unlock the door and see Mercedes and Cindy lying on the floor they then reveal that Lindsey is the Hospital Killer. Their both shocked to hear the revelation and Mercedes then says she is going to see Joe as she believes Lindsey would have taken JJ while Cindy rushes off to the police. While Cindy is at the police station DS. Thorpe is talking to Esther and overhears Cindy saying Lindsey is the killer and take action. At the Roscoe house, Joe proposes to Lindsey and she says yes and then says to Joe that they should go on holiday right away Joe Is stunned but reluctantly agrees. While Lindsey is upstairs with JJ Joe sees Mercedes and he tells her what Lindsey said she also tells him that Lindsey is the killer but think she is lying but she asks him to tell her that he can't go until tomorrow which he does. Lindsey knocks Joe unconscious and Mercedes finds him. When Lindsey discovers the police are looking for her she decides to go on the run with JJ she then goes to Freddie who then remembers that Lindsey tried to kill him and says that she can't borrow the car he was going to lend her. She then sees Frankie who is back and tells her Esther has been in an accident and they need to get to the hospital, Lindsey then kidnaps Frankie. She rings Esther and tells her to go and get her passport so she can leave or she will kill Frankie, Esther agrees and successfully gets the passport but Kim then finds out and calls the police and tells them were Lindsey is. Esther then gives Lindsey the passport and she gives her Frankie. Lindsey then goes on the run and puts a wig on so she doesn't get recognised she then gets a call from Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). He tells her when they meet up that he will help her run away and he admires her 'work'. Lindsey, along with Silas, return to Hollyoaks village a few weeks later as Lindsey returns to deal with her sister Kim for her betrayal. She stalks Mercedes and Joe. She then blackmails Kim into kidnapping JJ so that she will give Kath back. When Kim kidnaps her, JJ gets sick and Kim believes he has meningitis. She phones Lindsey informing her that she's taking him to hospital. Lindsey tells her to bring him to her so she can examine him, and if she doesn't she'll kill Kath. Kim takes him to the hospital and JJ is diagnosed with a minor viral infection and that he'll need to be kept in hospital overnight. Joe and Mercedes come in the hospital after and Kim tells them that they should stay in overnight to look after him. Unbeknownst to them, Lindsey is outside JJ's ward watching their every move. Lindsey meets up with Silas and they begin to plot to kill Mercedes. Their first few attempts fail and Silas even threatens to leave Lindsey on her own, but he comes back after she says she could use Joe's phone to lure her into a trap. As they plot, Lindsey's waters break and she is later taken to hospital by Kim who asks for Celine and Tegan to help Lindsey give birth. They refuse at first, but they then help as Kim reminds them they are nurses and it's their job to help everyone, so they help her. Lindsey gives birth to a girl, who she names Kimberley, after her sister. Freddie and Joe come in later after Joe realises his phone disappeared and somehow ended up at the hospital. Lindsey reveals that she took it and that she used it to lure Mercedes into Silas's trap. Freddie takes Kimberley off her and refuses to give her back to her. Lindsey says that if they let her escape with Kimberley (now named Lexi), she asks Silas not to hurt Mercedes. Everyone agrees apart from Freddie, who thinks Lindsey should stay where she is. Freddie later lets her go with Kimberley, but Lindsey locks them all in the room and walks off. Lindsey then phones up Silas telling him to not hurt Mercedes. At the Roscoes, Mercedes tells Silas about Lindsey cheating on Joe with Freddie and going back to Joe after thinking she had killed Freddie. When she comes home, Silas corners Lindsey and says he was wrong about her, before strangling Lindsey off-screen. When Joe, Freddie and Kim come back, they find Mercedes crying on the stairs. They enter the living room and find Lindsey's corpse on the sofa. After her death, however, Kim never forgives her for what she has done to Kath. Reception Natalie Herrera from handbag.com acknowledged Lindsey's many troubles writing that \\"it's one thing after another for Lindsey\\". Carena Crawford from All About Soap branded Lindsey a \\"feisty filly\\" and was overjoyed that she fought back against Doctor Browning. But revealed that she and her colleagues found characters named Lindsey and Lynsey involved in the same storyline confusing.

Biography Gregory Shuvalov was the youngest son of Lieutenant-General Peter Shuvalov, a nephew of the governor-general of Moscow Alexey Shcherbatov. His initial education was in the Jesuit hostel in Saint Petersburg, since 1817 he studied in Switzerland and Italy. In 1823-1826 he served in the Hussars. Shortly after his marriage, he retired and, like the Saltykov princes, had gone with his family abroad. He lived in Italy, where he attended lectures by Giovanni La Cecilia, was engaged in literary work and wrote sonnets. Conversion to Roman Catholicism The death of one of his sons and his wife's illness was a serious spiritual drama, and forced him to turn to God. In Paris, he was a frequent guest at Sophie Swetchine's salon, where he met Prince Ivan Gagarin. In 1843 Shuvalov converted to Catholicism and in the mid-1850s he was a novice in the Order of Barnabites and in 1856 in Milan he became a monk as Father Augustine Mary. Shuvalov died in a Catholic convent in 1859. He wrote an autobiography: \\"My Conversion and My Vocation\\". (London, Washbourne, 1877); originally published in French: \\"Ma conversion et ma vocation\\". Family Since 1824, he was married to Princess Sophie Alexandrovna Saltykova (1806-1841), daughter of Alexander Saltykov. She made a lot of effort to return her husband to the Christian faith. Sophie wanted to accept Catholicism, but at the request of her husband postponed her decision. Due to her early death, she could not fulfill her desire; her husband was very sorry afterwards. Sophie Saltykova died of consumption. He had four sons: Peter (1826-1882), member of the board of the Minister of Internal Affairs, was, like his father, a Catholic. Grgorevich Alexander (1828-1829). Elena (1830-1884), returned to the Orthodox Church and in her memoirs she spoke about the religious quests of her father; she married a collector of vintage music, Alexander Ya Skaryatin (1815-1884).

Political career during the Revolution  Pontard was born in Mussidan in Dordogne. He followed a career in the Roman Catholic priesthood and became a cur√© in Sarlat. Having espoused the reforming ideas of the Revolution, he was a fervent advocate of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. In February 1791 he was elected constitutional bishop of the Dordogne,the post which replaced that of the Bishop of P√©rigueux during the Revolution and on 8 September of that year was elected to the National Constituent Assembly as a representative of the clergy of Dordogne. A critic of clerical celibacy, he married, and presented his wife to the Convention Nationale on 22 September 1793. He supported several measures in favour of the marriage of priests issued by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Pontard was responsible for bringing to Paris the prophetess Suzette Labrousse, like him a native of the Dordogne, and remained closely associated with her subsequent career. He was also closely connected to the esoteric circles of the time, particularly to the Duchess of Bourbon, Bathilde d'Orl√©ans, to Catherine Th√©ot, and also Dom Gerle (presented as rivals by some contemporaries). He was also linked to the scandals associated with these circles. He actively encouraged Suzette Labrousse while she was being sheltered and having her works published by the Duchess of Orl√©ans (Journal proph√©tique, 1792; Recueil des ouvrages de la c√©l√®bre Mlle Labrousse, 1797), and supported Labrousses's journey to Rome. He brought ridicule upon himself by presenting her to several prominent religious figures. When she died he was the executor of her will, in which she left him a (contested) legacy of 3,000 francs. In Suzette Labrousse's analysis of the Apocalypse he saw the proofs that the French Revolution was initiating a \\"universal regeneration\\"..  After the Directoire  Under the Consulate, Pontard ran a boarding school in Paris, but had to abandon it for financial reasons. He fell into poverty and was supported from 1820 by Bathilde d'Orl√©ans, who gave him a life annuity. He lived for the rest of his life in the H√¥pital Sainte-P√©rine, where he died. In 1812 he published the Grammaire m√©canique √©l√©mentaire de l'orthographe fran√ßaise.

It was originally Benedictine, but later became Cistercian. In 1065, at the urging of Pope Nicholas II, a monastery was founded at Matina by Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia and Calabria, and his wife, Sichelgaita. On 31 March, by order of Nicholas' successor, Alexander II, the monastery was dedicated in a ceremony officiated by Archbishop Arnulf of Cosenza, with the bishops Odo of Rapolla and Lawrence of Malvito in attendance, before Robert and Sichelgaita and the first abbot, Abelard. The monastery received rich gifts from its Norman patrons, but also a large piece land from the diocese of Malvito, for which the bishop was compensated in gold. In 1660, Gregorio de Laude, abbot of Santa Maria del Sagittario, who had seen the now lost parchments of the foundation himself, described it thus:White (1935), 488. > Monasterium Matinae a Robert Nortmando Apuliae et Calabriae Duce, uxoreque > sua Sirlegatta anno 1066 [sic] fundatum, tunc Nigrorum, modo Cisterciensium > Monachorum Casamaris filiationis situm in Calabria, duobus dissitum > milliariis a ... Sancti Marci Urbe. > Robert the Norman, duke of Apulia and Calabria, and his wife Sichelgaita, > founded the monastery of Matina in 1066, then Benedictine, now Cistercian, a > daughter of the monks of Casamari in Calabria, two miles removed from ... > San Marco. The monastery was under the direct ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Papacy. As such, it appears in the earliest redaction of the Liber censuum of the early twelfth century. On 18 November 1092, Pope Urban II visited the monastery. In 1167, the Frenchman William of Blois became abbot, but resigned his position by 1169.His brother Peter refers to him as abbas Matinensis or Mathinensis in his letters to him, cf. White (1935), 488. By this time, the monastery was in decline. Joachim of Fiore refused the request of King Tancred of Sicily to move his new religious foundation at Fiore to Matina. There has long been speculation that Matina became Cistercian in 1179 or 1180.White (1935), 489, citing Leopold Janauschek, Origines Cistercensium (Vienna, 1877). This is contradicted by documents in the archive of the Aldobrandini family. In October 1221, upon request of the abbot of Sambucina and with the permission of Pope Honorius III and the bishops Andrew of San Marco Argentano and Luke of Cosenza, Matina finally became a Cistercian abbey dependent on Sambucina. In February 1222, the act received the consent of the Emperor Frederick II, and in June 1222 was confirmed by the pope. In 1235, the abbot of Casamari requested permission from the general chapter to send the monks to Sambucina for three months every summer on account of the climate.White (1935), 489, quotes the letter: conventum filiae de Matina annis singulis ad grangiam quae dicitur Sunthurina, moraturum ibi tribus mensibus in aestate. Louis Duchesne came to believe that Matina and Sambucina were one and the same foundation. From 1410, the monastery was usually given in commendam, causing further decline. In 1633, it joined the Cistercian congregation of Calabria and Basilicata. In 1652, the monastery was finally suppressed by Pope Innocent X, but the commandery remained until the abolition of feudalism in 1809, during the reign of Joachim Murat, when the land became state property. Subsequently the buildings and grounds were granted to General Luigi Valentoni, who transformed it into a farm. The property remained in his family until the end of the twentieth century. In the seventeenth century, most of the abbey buildings, which dated to the thirteenth century,White (1935), 490. were still intact. Currently only ruins remain of the church. Among the best preserved parts are the parlour, the scriptorium, the staircase leading to the upper floors and chapel, and the Gothic chapter house, which has three naves with vaulted ceilings reminiscent of the abbey of Casamari.

Air force career In 1935, Leonid Khrushchev enrolled in the Balashov Pilot School of the Civil Air Fleet, graduating in 1937. In 1938, he returned to work as a flight instructor. In 1940, he joined the Soviet Air Force as a fighter pilot. During World War II, Khrushchev was part of the 134th Bomber Aviation Regiment, 46th Air Division, stationed in the Andreapol, Kalinin Oblast. He saw action in the Winter War against Finland, in which he completed over thirty combat missions and bombed the Mannerheim Line; after the war was finished on 13 March 1940, he volunteered to stay at the front. During the summer of 1941, he completed twelve combat missions and was presented with the Order of the Red Banner. On July 26, Khrushchev's plane was hit by German fighters near Moscow and he had to crash land, broke his leg so seriously that the bone protruded through his boot. He was then hospitalized and a doctor wanted to amputate until he threatened the doctor with a pistol. After recovery, his injured leg was shorter than the other. During his recovery in Kuibyshev, he associated with Rub√©n Ruiz Ib√°rruri. Impatient while idle, he would shoot bottles on friends' heads and killed one drunken naval officer by accident. Although court martialled, he was allowed to return to be a fighter pilot again. Disappearance On 11 March 1943, Khrushchev's plane, a YaK-7B fighter, was shot down, with Khrushchev presumably being killed. The pilots of his squadron saw his plane explode and disintegrate in the air after being hit by Focke Fw 190's fire, allegedly while attempting to shield another pilot with his own plane. However, even though the area of his approximate crash was under partisans control, and several planes attempted to locate his plane's wreckage on the next night, his body was never found. This, together with the fact that his father was already a member of Politburo and one of the most important political figures in the country, gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories about the circumstances of his death.–°. –ë–æ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ –†–∞–¥–∞ –•—Ä—É—â—ë–≤–∞ –æ–± –æ—Ç—Ü–µ –∏ —Å–µ–º–µ–π–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–∞–π–Ω–∞—Ö // Vedomosti. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 15.11.2003.

He was a pioneer in the modern discipline of public health and in the speciality of preventive medicine.

MacNalty was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was Shute Exhibitioner and took second class in the Oxford Honor School of Physiology (researcher on central nervous system, Dept. of Physiology). From Oxford, he went to University College Hospital, London, where he was Filliter Exhibitioner and qualified MRCP and LRCP in 1907. MacNalty received his M.D. Oxon (1911) for his dissertation Lyphadenoma with relapsing Pyrexia. After a series of medical and surgical postings at hospitals, he abandoned his course toward specializing as a thoracic physician (the speciality of \\"chest service\\", tuberculosis being endemic), when called to government service as a public health officer in 1913 (even though solicited to assume this office, MacNalty worked in preparation for nearly a year as Assistant Medical Officer and Tuberculosis Officer to Essex County Council, under their progressive County Medical Officer, J. Thresh) and through which public office ranks he rose to his appointment as Britain's Chief Medical Officer (1935‚Äì1941). MacNalty became an authority on communicable diseases, public health and on endocrine system based neurological disorders. He was president of the Royal Society of Medicine's Epidemiology and its Medical History sections.

It ceased operations as a railroad in 1982.  History  Wyandotte Terminal Railroad was originally created and owned by Michigan Alkali, a producer of an ingredient in the making of soda ash and other sodium-based products, to provide railroad switching services to its two plants located about four miles from each other on the Detroit River in Wyandotte, Michigan, United States of America. Michigan Alkali was later named Wyandotte Chemical and eventually BASF Wyandotte Corporation.Pinkepank, Jerry A., Trackside Around Detroit Downriver 1946‚Äì1976, Morning Sun Books, 2004, p. 9  Operations  At one time owning almost 9 miles of track, Wyandotte Terminal Railroad did all the intra-plant and inter-plant railroad switching for BASF Wyandotte‚Äôs two large plants located on the Detroit River in Wyandotte, Michigan. The City of Wyandotte is located just south of the City of Detroit. Wyandotte Terminal Railroad interchanging freight cars with two Class 1 railroads, the Michigan Central Railroad (later known as New York Central, Penn Central Railroad and, eventually, Conrail) and the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad, as well as neighboring industrial railroad named Wyandotte Southern Railroad. During the last few years of operations, Wyandotte Terminal Railroad would operate a train six days a week from BASF Wyandotte Chemical‚Äôs South Plant to its North Plant. Leaving the South Plant, this train would run on about a mile of its own trackage to the Detroit Toledo & Ironton Railroad‚Äôs (‚ÄúDT&I;‚Äù) Ford Yard located at the extreme south end of the City of Wyandotte to interchange freight cars with DT&I; and Wyandotte Southern Railroad. From Ford Yard the train would then run north approximately four miles with freight cars destined for the North Plant of BASF Wyandotte Corporation utilizing trackage rights on the DT&I; line. Just west of the North Plant the train would regain Wyandotte Terminal Railroad trackage and proceed about a half-mile to the North Plant. When finished switching at the North Plant, this train would return to the South Plant via the same route, again interchanging freight cars received from the North Plant with DT&I; at Ford Yard, if necessary. Wyandotte Terminal Railroad interchanged with Conrail at its North Plant. Wyandotte Terminal Railroad kept additional locomotives at each of its two plants to perform the intra-plant switching. Freight cars handled by the Wyandotte Terminal Railroad were largely tank cars and covered hoppers.Babbish, Byron C., 1980, \\"Detroit ‚Äì Motor City Railroading.\\" Rails Northeast, Vol 8, No. 6, Issue 71, p. 37, July, 1980 Wyandotte Terminal RR Baldwin VO 660 103 at BASF Wyandotte North Plant August 5, 1978  Locomotives  In 1945, Wyandotte Terminal Railroad‚Äôs replaced its fleet of steam switcher-type locomotives with three Baldwin Locomotive model VO 660 diesel- electric switchers, nos. 101 through 103. It purchased a fourth new Baldwin switcher, model DS 4-4-660 no. 104, in January 1949. All were painted in a green with yellow striping paint scheme. At some point a fifth diesel locomotive switcher, a General Electric 65 ‚Äìtonner, was obtained from its parent, Michigan Alkali. Boyd, Jim, ‚ÄúBaldwin Diesels-3, Morning Sun Books, 2002, p. 108 In 1975, Wyandotte Terminal purchased two used American Locomotive diesel-electric switcher-type locomotives to replace Baldwin switchers nos. 102 and 104 that were out of service. One of these was an ex- Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Alco model S-2 (numbered WTR 106) and the other was an ex-Nickel Plate Railroad Alco model S-4 (numbered WTR 107). Around this time Wyandotte Terminal Railroad began to repaint its locomotives in an orange with black striping paint scheme. Wyandotte Terminal Railroad‚Äôs Baldwin diesel-electric locomotives have all been scrapped except for no. 103, which is now in the collection of the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois.  The End of Wyandotte Terminal Railroad  Though BASF Wyandotte Corporation was still operating its two plants in the City of Wyandotte, Michigan, it decided to discontinue using the Wyandotte Terminal Railroad for its railroad switching needs in 1982 and, instead, entered into contracts with the two connecting Class 1 railroads, Conrail and Detroit, Toledo & Ironton Railroad, for the switching of its two plants.

He was the Later Zhou chancellor from 951 until 960, and the Song Dynasty chancellor from 960 until 964, not long before his death. A strict adherent to legal guidelines, he had influenced Later Zhou and Song rulers to rely more on civil administration in an age dominated by the military. F√†n was a member of the elite F√†n family. Early life Growing up, F√†n Zhi's father F√†n Shouyu (ËåÉÂÆàÈÅá) was a staff supervisor () serving the Later Liang. Biographer Jack Dull considers F√†n Zhi a representative of the rise of \\"new families\\" which were gradually replacing the exclusive aristocracy of the Tang Dynasty. At age eight, F√†n Zhi was able to write essays, and by 12 he already mastered and began teaching the voluminous classic Book of Documents. Career under Later Tang Later Liang was replaced by the Later Tang in 926, and F√†n passed the imperial examination in 933. The chief examination administrator He Ning () reportedly liked F√†n's writing the most that he intentionally assigned F√†n 13th place, which was the placing he himself got back in the day. F√†n became a prefectural judge () for the Zhongwu Commandery (Âø†Ê≠¶Ëªç; roughly governing today's central Henan), and was later promoted to the post of subprefect of Fengqiu which he served until Later Tang was overthrown in 936. Career under Later Jin Under the new Later Jin, F√†n's essays caught the eyes of chancellor Sang Weihan, who helped F√†n become the imperial investigating censor (), a lowly position at the censorial offices. When Sang was subsequently appointed to other prefectures and eventually back as the chancellor, F√†n followed him along the way. In 943, F√†n Zhi was promoted to the post of assistant division chief of the Department of Hospitality () and auxiliary official of the Institute of History (). A year later, he became a Hanlin Academician and division chief () of the Department of Accounting, Ministry of Finance (), as well as special drafting of the Secretariat (). Career under the Liao Dynasty Career under Later Han Career under Later Zhou Guo Wei (), a Later Han general, had been impressed by the timeliness and the contents of the imperial orders he received while fighting rebellions away from the capital. Once he asked the messenger who wrote the orders. \\"F√†n Zhi\\" was the reply, and Guo remarked, \\"Definitely fit to be chancellor.\\" In the winter months of early 951, Guo Wei rebelled against the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou and his army swiftly conquered the capital Kaifeng. Amidst the chaos after Liu's fleeing from the city, Guo remembered the name F√†n Zhi and asked for his whereabouts. When F√†n ‚Äì who was living with other commoners ‚Äì was located, Guo paid him a personal visit in heavy snow and during the conversation, removed his own robe to put on F√†n for warmth. As a token of his friendship to Guo, F√†n wrote several imperial orders for Guo, helping him to transition the state as Guo declared himself the emperor of the new Later Zhou Dynasty. Career under Song One day in 960, F√†n was dining in his own residence when general Zhao Kuangyin, who was supposed to be on the way to resist the Liao Dynasty invasion, stormed in. In tears, Zhao explained to F√†n that he was forced to become the emperor and return to the capital by his subordinates. Stunned and not sure what to suggest, F√†n was confronted by Zhao's attendant Luo Yangui (), who raised his sword to threaten F√†n into accepting the usurpation. When F√†n realized that everything was nothing but acting, he came down the stairs and bowed to Zhao, who became the first emperor of the Song Dynasty.

Born in Melbourne, Australia in 1957 and educated at University High School and Latrobe University. Overs set up organisations, oversaw events and authored texts that established the place of sex workers rights within the global response to HIV/AIDS. Biography In 1981 Overs joined a group of feminist lawyers lobbying for decriminalisation and destigmatisation of sex work and protesting violence and discrimination against sex workers. By 1984 that group evolved into a membership based sex workers group named the Prostitutes Collective of Victoria (PCV) which was based on the English Prostitutes Collective. As first director of the PCV Overs led the successful campaign for law reform in Victoriahttp://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt5.nsf/d1a8d8a9bed958efca25761600042ef5/e3cb3a2edbe7cd34ca25776f007f8608/$FILE/94-102a068.pdf and oversaw the development of innovative programmes for sex workers including peer education, needle and syringe exchange, and the Ugly Mugs List, a tool for preventing violence against sex workers. These were models for international adaptation and replication. In 1988 the PCV hosted the Prostitution and the Aids Debate Conference in Melbourne which led to the formation of the national federation of sex workers' organisations, the Scarlet Alliance. After attending the International AIDS Conference in Canada in 1989 Overs moved to Europe to advocate for sex workers rights in the nascent global response to HIV/AIDS. This included working as an advisor to the Global Program on Aids at the World Health Organization and contributing to International Aids conferences and publications such as Harvard Aids Institute‚Äôs ‚ÄòAids in the World‚Äô She is the author of several articles and monographs that set out the sex workers rights movement's positions on health and human rights.

The NSWP supported new sex worker organisations, led global advocacy on sex work issues, created the first information clearing house and international discussion group on sex work and sent delegations of sex worker advocates to attend conferences and other key events such as the Beijing Women‚Äôs Conference, World Social Forums and the International AIDS Conferences. Since 2000 Overs has continued advocating for health and human rights working with various UN and civil society agencies in more than twenty countries including Ethiopia, India, UK, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia and Brazil. In 2009 Overs joined Monash University where she contributed to the establishment of the Michael Kirby Centre for Public Health and Human Rights and she has continued working on human rights and sex work issues at Sussex University and the Institute of Development Studies where she has developed an on-line resource centre on sex work research (PLRI); published a map of sex work law, and several articles about sex work and human rights in the context of public health and development aid.,\\\\\\\\\\\\ad.monash.edu\\\\home\\\\User083\\\\oversc\\\\Documents\\\\Developing More Effective Strategies for Sex Work, Law and Poverty LGBT rights; economic empowerment and poverty reduction for marginalised women and girls;\\\\\\\\\\\\ad.monash.edu\\\\home\\\\User083\\\\oversc\\\\Documents\\\\Sex Workers, Empowerment and Poverty Alleviation in Ethiopia pre exposure HIV prophylaxis and sexual citizenship.

Perspectives  The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For an example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others.Omonzejele, F.

Retrieved from http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/31/health/frank-njenga-mental-health  Causes of mental illnesses  Some mental illnesses have been linked to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters help nerve cells in the brain communicate. If these chemicals are out of balance or are not working properly, messages may not properly transmit through the brain, leading to symptoms of mental illness. In addition, defects in or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) to areas of the brain have also been linked to some mental conditions. There are many other factors that may contribute to mental illness. These include psychosocial and socioeconomic stressors such as political unrest, violence, poverty, migration, family conflict and any kind of addiction. These may all play a role in the high incident of mental illness in Southeast Africa. Adequate care may not be available to sufferers, due to the stigma that surrounds people dealing with mental illness. The reversal of this stigma, is due to the lack of educational resources for instance laboratories.Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. (2011).

It is located in the barrio of Balvanera at its limit with Monserrat, an area informally known as the Congreso neighbourhood. Constructed between 1898 and 1906, the palace is a National Historic Landmark. The Kilometre Zero for all Argentine National Highways is marked on a milestone at the Congressional Plaza, next to the building. History The Palace of Congress under construction, 1906. The idea of a congressional palace was first proposed and decreed in 1895. Designed by the Italian architect Vittorio Meano and completed by Argentine architect Julio Dormal, the building was under construction between 1898 and 1906. Inaugurated that year, its aesthetic details were not completed until 1946. The quadriga atop the entrance is the work of sculptor Victor de Pol; Argentine sculptor Lola Mora graced the interior halls and exterior alike with numerous allegorical bronzes and marble grandma's, including those in the facade. The edifice was built at a cost of US$6 million allocated by the federal government. The building was officially accepted by Congress on 12 May 1906. As time went by, the building proved too small for its purpose, and in 1974 the construction of the Annex, which now holds the Deputies' offices, was started. From 1976 to 1983 the palace housed the Legislative Advisory Commission (CAL), which was a group of officers from the three Armed Forces. Congressional Plaza, built by French Argentine urbanist Charles Thays, faces the palace. Popular among tourists since its inauguration in 1910, the plaza is also a preferred location for protesters and those who want to voice their opinion about congressional activities. Architecture The Congress today. The palace is in Neoclassical style, largely made of white marble with elaborately furnished interiors, especially in the Lost Steps Hall and the Blue Room. It is crowned by a bronze-plated dome in height, weighing , weathered to green color. This cupola is supported over a deep inverted dome foundation. The dome is lit during Argentina‚Äôs national holidays and other special occasions. The main entrance, called the Entrada de Honor (\\"Honor Entrance\\"), is exclusively used for ceremonial purposes. In front of it is the high quadriga sculpture, by Victor de Pol. It is made of bronze and weighs . A symbol of the Argentine Republic, it follows the typical depiction of Roman Empire generals making a declaration of Victory but in this case it is driven by the symbolic Liberty holding the reins of the horses. The palace used to have a barber shop in the basement but it was demolished. Statues Recovery In 1997, with the first general restoration of facades, representatives of the Government of Buenos Aires promoted the recovery of the statues designed by Lola Mora to crown the entrance to Congress. As the sculptor had personally donated to the government of province of Jujuy, the only thing possible was to make rubbings to place in Buenos Aires. However, at that time the idea did not materialize. Only in 2012, with the new Master Plan, the initiative gained momentum again and began to take shape. The government of Jujuy reaffirmed its ownership of the statues of Mora, so that Congress signed a treaty for the restoration of the original and creating two copies of each work by a 3D mapping, which began in January 2013. the original had suffered deterioration caused by hundred years of outdoor exposure, so it must be kept in a closed and adequate space, while one group of rubbings will be placed in its place in the Government House of Jujuy, and the other set of rubbings will be placed in the original spaces of the National Congress. On 1 March 2014 replicas of the statues were inaugurated by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner at the opening of the regular session.

He becomes involved with two women: Ottilie Garinger and her aunt, Charlotte. The presence of Charlotte's husband, Edward Lawless, creates a romantic triangle-plus-one. It has been observed that Charlotte, Ottilie and Edward are the three main characters of Goethe's 1809 novel Elective Affinities. The Newton Letter is the third of Banville's \\"scientific tetralogy\\" (preceded by Doctor Copernicus and Kepler, followed by Mefisto, a reworking of the Faust theme).

It is native to south-central and southeastern North America, from the lower Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic seaboard in Virginia, south through Florida and the Gulf states. Its natural habitat is in sandy open woodlands and fields. Description It is a stemless evergreen shrub growing to tall by broad. It has a basal rosette of sharply pointed, swordlike leaves up to long. In summer, long panicles of bell-shaped creamy white flowers are held above the foliage. The Latin specific epithet flaccida means \\"weak\\", \\"feeble\\", referring to the leaves which often fold under their own weight (the inner leaves may remain erect as they are supported by the outer ones). Taxonomy Some authorities regard Y. flaccida as a variety or form of Y. filamentosa, rather than as a separate species. Populations in the South Central Region of the United States with unusually narrow leaves have been segregated as Y. louisianensis by some authorities. This entity is found in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. Ecology A number of yucca moths lay their eggs upon Y. flaccida as a host plant, an example being Tegeticula intermedia. Cultivation It is cultivated and valued as an architectural plant.

Since then, the Armory building on Mountain Avenue has served the community in various ways, including as a roller skating rink, a laundry, a meeting hall, and office and retail space.A tour of the armory Lost Fort Collins With References Category:Armories on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado Category:Buildings and structures in Fort Collins, Colorado Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Colorado Category:Government buildings completed in 1907 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Larimer County, Colorado ","title":"Fort Collins Armory"},{"id":"39407814","text":"Blachea longicaudalis is an eel in the family Congridae (conger/garden eels).Blachea longicaudalis at www.fishbase.org.

The houses in Primskovo mingle with those of neighboring Klanec, also a former independent settlement. Name The name Primskovo is probably derives from an adjective form of the Slavic common noun *prij—åm—åsk—ä 'son-in-law that settles on the bride's farm', shortened from a longer name such as Prij—åm—åskovo selo/polje (literally, 'son-in-law's village/field'). It may also be derived from the (unconfirmed) nickname *Prim—ä, meaning 'Prim—ä's (village/field)'. In the past the German name was Primskau or Primskou. History The remains of a stronghold built for protection against Ottoman attacks are visible in Primskovo. A primary school with four grades was established in the village in 1890. Primskovo was annexed by the city of Kranj in 1957, ending its existence as a separate settlement.Raz≈°irjeni seznam sprememb naselij od 1948 do 1964: preimenovanja, zdru≈æevanja, odcepitve, pristavki, razglasitve in ukinitve. 1965.

The service was terminated on October 31, 2017, at 11:59 JST. However, streaming of Dragon Ball Super continued until February 22, 2018, when it was transferred to DRAGON BALL SUPER CARD GAME.  Content  Originally airing 30 episodes of content on May 16, the first series to be included were Sword Art Online, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, The Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament, Lupin III: Part II, Mobile Suit Z Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED.  History  Originally set to launch in April 2013, Daisuki was delayed until May 16, 2013. The initial media services were streaming over the web, with future plans to expand for mobile devices and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. In October 2013, they released an iPad app, followed by an iPhone app in February 2014, and an Android app in January 2015.  Operation  Founded on October 17, 2012, Daisuki Inc. was a joint venture between Asatsu-DK and six major anime studios. The venture's backers by initial shareholder stakes were split with minority shares amongst all backers. The largest minority shareholder is Asatsu-DK with 121,000,000 yen for a 26.3% stake; Toei Animation, Aniplex, Sunrise, TMS Entertainment, and Nihon Ad Systems each have a 61,700,000 yen investment for 13.4% shares. Dentsu has 30,000,000 yen invested for a 6.5% stake. However, its capital on launch was noted to be 229,750,000 yen. The CEO was Kunihiko Shibata. In an interview with Japanator, it was announced that the releases on Daisuki would be released worldwide without region restrictions except in cases of exclusive rights licensed by other companies. Daisuki Inc, was folded in 2014 and replaced by Anime Consortium Japan (ACJ), which took over the operation of the Daisuki.net website. ACJ's initial shareholders included Bandai Namco Holding inc., Asatsu-DK inc., Aniplex inc., the Cool Japan Fund, Toei Animation, Sunrise, TMS Entertainment, Nihon Ad Systems, and Dentsu Inc.

Tissue residue is used in aquatic toxicology to help determine the fate of chemicals in aquatic systems, bioaccumulation of a substance, or bioavailability of a substance, account for multiple routes of exposure (ingestion, absorption, inhalation), and address an organism's exposure to chemical mixtures.Tissue-Based Criteria for ‚ÄúBioaccumulative‚Äù Chemicals.http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/meetings/2008/october/aquatic_life_criteria_guidelines_tissue_08_26_05.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2005 A tissue residue approach to toxicity testing is considered a more direct and less variable measure of chemical exposure and is less dependent on external environmental factors than measuring the concentration of a chemical in the exposure media.McElroy, A.E., M.G. Barron, N. Beckvar, S.B. K. Driscoll, J.P. Meador, T.F. Parkerton, T.G. Preuss, and J.A. Steevens. 2011. A review of the tissue residue approach for organic and organometallic compounds in aquatic organisms. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 50-74.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.132/abstract. In general, tissue residue approaches are used for chemicals that bioaccumulate or for bioaccumulative chemicals. The majority of these substances are organic compounds that are not easily metabolized by organisms and have long environmental persistence. Examples of these chemicals include polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, furans, biphenyls, DDT and its metabolites, and dieldrin. The use of tissue residues in assessing toxicity and bioaccumulation may also be referred to as the tissue residue-effects approach (TRA), critical body residue (CBR), or tissue residue-based toxicity tests.  History  Historically, aquatic toxicology toxicity tests have focused on water-based approaches where concentration of a toxicant is determined by its concentration in the water. Although tissue residue use and concepts have existed for over 100 years due to interest in narcosis and anesthesia, it was not widely used in toxicology. The first known study of tissue residue in environmental toxicology was reported in 1912 by White and Thomas who investigated the effects of copper exposure to fish using whole-body copper concentrations.McCarty, L.S., P.F. Landrum, S.N. Luoma, J.P. Meador, A.A. Merten, B.K. Shephard and A.P. van Wezel. 2011. Advancing environmental toxicology through chemical dosimetry: External exposures versus tissue residues. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management 7 (1): 7-27.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.98/abstract Since the 1980s, there has been rapid growth in the tissue residue approach to toxicology. The water-based approach has been re-evaluated due to challenges in assessing the toxicity of bioaccumulating chemicals. Water-based approaches are not always an accurate estimation of the concentration of a bioaccumulating chemical in an organism, nor does the water-based approach incorporate the multiple routes of exposure of an organism to a toxicant and the additive effects across these routes.  Advantages  The use of tissue residue allows an investigator to: account for multiple routes of exposure, account for toxicokinetic differences between species, account for factors that alter bioavailability and potentially address exposure of an organism to a chemical mixture.Jarvinen, A.W., D.R. Mount and G.T. Ankley. Development of Tissue Residue Threshold Valueshttp://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/mount.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)McCarty, L.S. Comments on the Significance and Use of Tissue Residues in Sediment Toxicology and Risk Assessment.http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/mccarty.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tissue residue also has the ability to represent temporal and spatial exposure or an organism,Field, L.J. Use of Tissue Residue Data in Exposure and Effects Assessments for Aquatic Organisms.http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/field.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as clarify the cause-effect relationship of chemicals. These relationships are often distorted by uncertainty in chemical bioavailability. The mechanism of action for a chemical depends on the internal tissue concentration, thus tissue residue gives researchers a more direct estimate of the residue-effect (dose-response) relationship.Dyer, S., St J. Warne, J.S. Meyer, H. A. Leslie, and B.I. Escher. 2011. Tissue residue approach for chemical mixtures. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 99-115. Tissue residue is also less variable than other measures of chemical exposure. In addition to the aforementioned advantages of tissue residue use, the U.S. EPA also states that this approach explicitly considers exposure through diet, will support identification and investigation of a chemical's mode of action, incorporate the effects of an organism's metabolism on accumulation and allow for experimental verification between lab and field studies.  Disadvantages  The majority of issues with tissue residue arise in the interpretation of tissue residue data. Interpretation complication can be caused by choice of endpoints, species choice, life stage sensitivity, data quality, and toxicity data extrapolation. Choice of tissue for tissue residue analysis can also be difficult and has an effect on tissue residue data. When choosing tissue, a scientist needs to consider: mode and mechanism of action of chemical being tested, site of toxic action for the chemical and species combination being studied and strength of the tissue residue-response relationship. There is also a lack of reliable tissue residue relationships available for comparison. Although use of tissue residue can account for multiple routes of exposure, it cannot identify the routes of exposure. Tissue residue also cannot account for biotransformation of organic chemicals. If a chemical is biotransformed, the concentration of the parent chemical is lower, but the metabolites may still be toxic. Tissue residue approaches are not as useful for chemicals with short half-lives because an organism will only be sporadically exposed. Overall, tissue residue is meant to complement data from water-based approaches, not replace them.  Use in regulation   North America  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has incorporated tissue residue through the development of the Biotic Ligand Model as well as water quality standards for copper. USEPA has also recently published draft aquatic life criteria for selenium using a tissue-based approach. USEPA is currently working on incorporating tissue residue into standards for bioaccumulating chemicals, which are usually hydrophobic with a log octanol-water partition coefficient greater than 5 (log Kow>5). Canada uses tissue residue formally in guidelines called tissue residue guidelines (TRGs), which are primarily used for protecting wildlife that consume aquatic life.Canada Environmental Quality Guidelines. 1998. http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/download/en/290/Canada Environmental Quality Guidelines. 1999. http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/download/en/314/  Europe  There is a lack of formal use of tissue residue in Europe.  Australia and New Zealand  Australia and New Zealand both use tissue residue-based approaches for biomonitoring programs for mussels and oysters.  Available databases  There are two comprehensive aquatic toxicology databasesAquatic Toxicology Databases available for tissue residue in the United States. The first is the Toxicity Residue Database maintained by the USEPA. The second is the Environmental residue-effects database (ERED) maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Currently, the majority of the data available is derived from acute lethal response studies.  Applications   Metals  Tissue residue of metals in invertebrate prey organisms may reduce uncertainty in estimating exposure from multiple routes. This may be especially important in early life stages of an organism or for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). However, it is challenging to develop a suitable approach to assessing metal toxicity through tissue residue because water quality can have a large influence on metal toxicity. With the exception of organometallic compounds, no generalized approaches have been created for analyzing metals in tissue residue, although site-specific and species-specific approaches have been successfully developed and used, especially for invertebrates.Adams, W. J., R. Blust, U. Borgmann, K. V. Brix, D. K. DeForest, A. S. Green, J. S. Meyer, J. C. McGeer, P. R. Paquin, P. S. Rainbow and C. M. Wood. 2010. Utility of tissue residues for predicting effects of metals on aquatic organisms. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 75-98. A recent paper examined tissue-residue toxicity for copper and cadmium in fish and found low variability among species for both metals compared to aqueous- exposure toxicity metrics. These results indicate that whole-body concentrations of metals in fish may be useful for Environmental Quality Guidelines, forensic evaluation, and ecological risk assessment. An additional benefit includes the potential to characterize a contaminated ecosystem based on elevated whole-body metal concentrations resulting from acclimation.  PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)  Fish are able to quickly metabolize and eliminate PAHs, therefore tissue residue of parent PAH compounds will not provide adequate information on exposure to the organism. PAH exposure in fish has been associated with reproductive impairment, immune deficiency, and liver lesions as well as other health problems. In contrast, invertebrates do not metabolize and excrete PAHs as efficiently as fish, therefore an investigator can better understand location and temporal patterns of bioavailable PAHs through tissue residue of these invertebrates.  PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls)  Unlike PAHs, tissue residue of PCBs for fish can provide reliable information on exposure and toxicity. The tissue residue of PCBs in fish can provide vital information in an exposure assessment because fish generally receive PCBs through exposure via the food web. There are currently two screening approaches for PCBs in fish based on PCB body burdens.  In-situ  Both the United States and United Kingdom have mussel watch monitoring programs. Although these programs differ in many ways, both use tissue residues to establish biological effects, such as survival and body condition, of chemicals present. In contrast to the passive nature of the mussel watch monitoring programs, tissue residue has also been applied in in- situ bioassays in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.  Superfund sites  Tissue residue guidelines were developed for tributyltin (TBT) for the Harbor Island Superfund site, Lower Duwamish Superfund site and the Portland Harbor Superfund site. At the Harbor Island Superfund site, tissue trigger levels were developed to provide guidance on remediation action. Tissue residue toxicity reference value (TRV) was developed for TBT regarding mortality and growth at the Lower Duwamish Superfund site. Tissue residue TRVs were also developed for TBT, as well as many other chemicals, for use in the Portland Harbor Superfund site work.  Ecological risk assessment  Ecological risk assessment aims to source of contamination to exposure to a toxicity endpoint. This requires a risk assessor to identify and estimate exposure pathways. Tissue residue is the only approach that inherently accounts for toxicity due to multiple exposure pathways. There is also a need in risk assessment to understand the bioaccumulation of chemicals4, as well as a direct estimation of bioavailability. Modeling food web exposure is difficult in risk assessment and requires many assumptions but this uncertainty can be reduced through tissue residue. Tissue residue may also allow provide a link between ecological risk assessment and human health risk assessment. The issues with using tissue residue in risk assessment are similar to the disadvantages listed above.

Utilization by game and livestock Many animals use the tree, especially for food. Kudu, bushbuck, elands, giraffes, and elephants browse the leaves. Eland are so attracted to the tree that they can do damage to it with their feeding. The brown-headed parrot eats the seeds. Cattle also eat the leaves. The fruits are hazardous to livestock, however, because they are toxic. The foliage can be fed to goats as a supplemental fodder.

He was a soldier during the Texas Revolution and received bounty land for participating in the Siege of Bexar. He and his brother James Bell later donated the land upon which the town of Bellville, Texas was built. His will was probated in Austin County, Texas. He formally adopted a grown man who was living in Hamilton County Florida in 1855. This man John G. Slade turned out to be his illegitimate son by a Nancy Slade. Most of Thomas Bell's estate was left to this son who was already married to Penelope Green and had children when he came to Texas to receive his inheritance. Texian settler In 1822, Thomas Bell moved to Texas from Florida with his brother James Bell.Bellville state historical marker A different Thomas Bell is recorded on 16 August 1824, Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop granted Bell title to a league of land in what is now Brazoria County. This Thomas Bell can be traced until his death living on the grant of land in Brazoria, Texas until his death in 1849. His estate partition lists his surviving widow as Nancy M. Bell who received 1/2 of his estate. The remainder was divided in 1/10 increments to: Toila Bell, Laura D. Hinkle, Willis C. Bell, Emily A Bell and Christopher E. Bell. As head of a committee in Cedar Lake, a Thomas Bell corresponded with Austin on how to deal with the Karankawa Indians in October 1825. The census of 1825 recorded that a Thomas Bell was married with three children and made a living farming and raising livestock. A legal document from 1829 noted that his wife's name was Prudencio and his place of habitation as Austin Municipality. Noah Smithwick was a guest at Bell's pole cabin on the San Bernard River in 1835. A Thomas Bell served in Captain John York's volunteer company from September to December 1835, including the Siege of B√©xar. Thomas Bell of Bellville is noted in his obituary as having been with Ben Milam in the Siege of Bexar. A Thomas Bell was the flag bearer at the Battle of Concepci√≥n in October 1835. Thomas Bell was on a committee that helped write the Goliad Declaration of Independence in December 1835. Texas independence Thomas Bell received 2,000 acres of land from the Republic of Texas in 1837. It is known that a Thomas Bell was living with his family in Austin County in 1844. Since a new county seat to replace San Felipe was desired, he along with his brother James Bell donated the land on which Bellville was founded in 1846. The town grew rapidly. A courthouse and jail were constructed in 1848 and a hotel the following year. Bell later obtained a certificate for 640 acres in Archer County in north Texas. In 1857 he received an additional 320 acres in the same county. There is much confusion between these two Thomas Bells as they both arrived in Austin's Colony in the early years. Both Thomas Bells received leagues of land. Both Thomas Bells are recorded in Austin's earliest accounting. The Thomas Bell of Bellville along with his brother-in-law Benjamin Granville donated land to the Methodist Church on Piney Creek. It is apparent that the younger Thomas lived in Bellville most of his life while the other Thomas Bell lived in Columbia in Brazoria County until his death in 1849.

She was the daughter of Field Marshal Earl Pyotr Saltykov. Biography In 1762 Catherine married Count Andrei Petrovich Shuvalov and soon after the wedding, her husband made a Grand Tour, which included among other things, a visit of Voltaire in Ferney. Back in 1766 in Moscow, Shuvalov settled here in the house on Butcher Street, where in 1767 he was awarded the visit of the empress Catherine. Thanks to her favor Countess Catherine Petrovna took a prominent position at the court. \\"Cancelled amiable in a simple and a friendly community,\\" according to Prince Dolgoruky, Shuvalov was holding an open house, \\"where science, art, poetry, theater and all captivating the imagination, abducted first place in the conversation, activities and amusements.\\" Shuvalova assimilated the Deism of her husband, a fervent devotee of Voltaire, and Countess' doctrines last enjoyed in life to justify their weakness, and in this spirit that brought their daughters. In 1776 Shuvalovs again went abroad and settled in Paris. \\"Shuvalov travels to many, but to her, no one, consequently, is not familiar to everyone nicely,\\" - wrote at the time Denis Fonvizin. Madame du Deffand calls her a woman intolerably boring, though polite. In 1781, Shuvalova returned to Saint Petersburg and at 8 years old widowed. Staying at the court in 1792, she was granted a Mistress, and in the same year, Empress requested it, as experienced in foreign travel, to bring to Saint Petersburg young princesses Baden- Durlahskih, one of which was intended bride Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, future Alexander I of Russia. Shuvalov fulfill its mandate very skillfully, went abroad under the pretext of going to the Aachen water, and returning with the princesses in Russia, the day of the engagement of the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Alexeievna was appointed to consist in her Lady-in-waiting of the Imperial Court of Russia. In this field, so Shuvalov has shown its penchant for intrigue, which antagonized the grand courtyard and was nicknamed la Grande clabaudeuse (\\"great zlopyhatelnitsa\\"). Disliking the Grand Duke, she tried hard to settle discord between the young couple, all pleasing to the Grand Duchess and her constantly pointing out the mistakes of her husband. The result of this behavior it was unanimous and strong condemnation of all others. Grand Duke Alexander Shuvalov hated, but his father Paul I of Russia made no secret of his contempt for her. According to Varvara Golovina, to strengthen its position Shuvalova was trying to flatter the prince Zubov, becoming the \\"main confidante of his senses. On his accession to the throne of Emperor Paul eliminated her from the post of the lady-in-waiting, but on the day of the coronation in 1797 gave to her the Order of Saint Catherine the second degree and two years only made the tape. Soon after that she was allowed to go abroad. Conversion to Roman Catholicism In 1807, Catherine and her daughter Alexandra, supported by the Prince of Dietrichstein family, converted themselves to Roman Catholicism from Russian Orthodoxy. She resided in Rome in the palace on the Via della Scrofa, which the Romans called the Palazzo Golitsyn. Death Catherine Shuvalova died on 13 October 1817. Her body was transported to Saint Petersburg and was buried in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. Children Praskovja Andriivna (1767-1828), writer, was married to Mikhail Andreyevich Galitzine (1765-1812). Peter (1771-1808), Adjutant General of the Emperor Paul I. He was married to Princess Sophia Fosdick Scherbatova (1776-1849), had two daughters and two sons, their grandsons Peter and Paul A. Shuvalov. Alexandra Andriivna (1775-1847), was married since 1797 to Prince Franz Joseph von Dietrichstein (1767-1854). Paul (1776-1823), Adjutant General of the Emperor Alexander I. He was married from 1815 to Varvara Petrovna Shakhovskoy (1796-1870), had two sons.

Hanner polytopes are named after Olof Hanner, who introduced them in 1956.. Construction The Hanner polytopes are constructed recursively by the following rules:. *A line segment is a one-dimensional Hanner polytope *The Cartesian product of every two Hanner polytopes is another Hanner polytope, whose dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the two given polytopes *The dual of a Hanner polytope is another Hanner polytope of the same dimension. They are exactly the polytopes that can be constructed using only these rules: that is, every Hanner polytope can be formed from line segments by a sequence of product and dual operations. Alternatively and equivalently to the polar dual operation, the Hanner polytopes may be constructed by Cartesian products and direct sums, the dual of the Cartesian products. This direct sum operation combines two polytopes by placing them in two linearly independent subspaces of a larger space and then constructing the convex hull of their union. Examples The three- dimensional cube and its dual, the octahedron, the two three-dimensional Hanner polytopes Schlegel diagram of the octahedral prism A cube is a Hanner polytope, and can be constructed as a Cartesian product of three line segments. Its dual, the octahedron, is also a Hanner polytope, the direct sum of three line segments. In three dimensions all Hanner polytopes are combinatorially equivalent to one of these two types of polytopes.. In higher dimensions the hypercubes and cross polytopes, analogues of the cube and octahedron, are again Hanner polytopes. However, more examples are possible. For instance, the octahedral prism, a four-dimensional prism with an octahedron as its base is also a Hanner polytope, as is its dual, the cubical bipyramid. Properties Coordinate representation Every Hanner polytope can be given vertex coordinates that are 0, 1, or ‚àí1.. More explicitly, if P and Q are Hanner polytopes with coordinates in this form, then the coordinates of the vertices of the Cartesian product of P and Q are formed by concatenating the coordinates of a vertex in P with the coordinates of a vertex in Q. The coordinates of the vertices of the direct sum of P and Q are formed either by concatenating the coordinates of a vertex in P with a vector of zeros, or by concatenating a vector of zeros with the coordinates of a vertex in Q. Because the polar dual of a Hanner polytope is another Hanner polytope, the Hanner polytopes have the property that both they and their duals have coordinates in {0,1,‚àí1}. Number of faces Every Hanner polytope is centrally symmetric, and has exactly 3d nonempty faces (including the polytope itself as a face but not including the empty set). For instance, the cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, 6 squares, and 1 cube (itself) as faces; 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27 = 33. The Hanner polytopes form an important class of examples for Kalai's 3d conjecture that all centrally symmetric polytopes have at least 3d nonempty faces.. Pairs of opposite facets and vertices In a Hanner polytope, every two opposite facets are disjoint, and together include all of the vertices of the polytope, so that the convex hull of the two facets is the whole polytope.. As a simple consequence of this fact, all facets of a Hanner polytope have the same number of vertices as each other (half the number of vertices of the whole polytope). However, the facets may not all be isomorphic to each other. For instance, in the octahedral prism, two of the facets are octahedra, and the other eight facets are triangular prisms. Dually, in every Hanner polytope, every two opposite vertices touch disjoint sets of facets, and together touch all of the facets of the polytope. Mahler volume The Mahler volume of a Hanner polytope (the product of its volume and the volume of its polar dual) is the same as for a cube or cross polytope. If the Mahler conjecture is true, these polytopes are the minimizers of Mahler volume among all the centrally symmetric convex bodies.. Helly property The translates of a hypercube (or of an affine transformation of it, a parallelotope) form a Helly family: every set of translates that have nonempty pairwise intersections has a nonempty intersection. Moreover, these are the only convex bodies with this property.. For any other centrally symmetric convex polytope K, defined I(K) to be the smallest number of translates of K that do not form a Helly family (they intersect pairwise but have an empty intersection). He showed that I(K) is either three or four, and gave the Hanner polytopes as examples of polytopes for which it is four. later showed that this property can be used to characterize the Hanner polytopes: they are (up to affine transformation) exactly the polytopes for which I(K) > 3.. Combinatorial enumeration The number of combinatorial types of Hanner polytopes of dimension d is the same as the number of simple series-parallel graphs with d unlabeled edges./ For d = 1, 2, 3, ... it is: :1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 18, 40, 94, 224, 548, ... . A more explicit bijection between the Hanner polytopes of dimension d and the cographs with d vertices is given by . For this bijection, the Hanner polytopes are assumed to be represented geometrically using coordinates in {0,1,‚àí1} rather than as combinatorial equivalence classes; in particular, there are two different geometric forms of a Hanner polytope even in two dimensions, the square with vertex coordinates (¬±1,¬±1) and the diamond with vertex coordinates (0,¬±1) and (¬±1,0). Given a d-dimensional polytope with vertex coordinates in {0,1,‚àí1}, Reisner defines an associated graph whose d vertices correspond to the unit vectors of the space containing the polytope, and for which two vectors are connected by an edge if their sum lies outside the polytope. He observes that the graphs of Hanner polytopes are cographs, which he characterizes in two ways: the graphs with no induced path of length three, and the graphs whose induced subgraphs are all either disconnected or the complements of disconnected graphs. Conversely, every cograph can be represented in this way by a Hanner polytope.

It states that every d-dimensional centrally symmetric polytope has at least 3d nonempty faces (including the polytope itself as a face but not including the empty set). Examples The cube and the octahedron, two examples for which the bound of the conjecture is tight In two dimensions, the simplest centrally symmetric convex polygons are the parallelograms, which have four vertices, four edges, and one polygon; . A cube is centrally symmetric, and has 8 vertices, 12 edges, 6 square sides, and 1 solid; . Another three-dimensional convex polyhedron, the regular octahedron, is also centrally symmetric, and has 6 vertices, 12 edges, 8 triangular sides, and 1 solid; . In higher dimensions, the hypercube [0,1]d has exactly 3d faces, each of which can be determined by specifying, for each of the d coordinate axes, whether the face projects onto that axis onto the point 0, the point 1, or the interval [0,1]. More generally, every Hanner polytope has exactly 3d faces. If Kalai's conjecture is true, these polytopes would be among the centrally symmetric polytopes with the fewest possible faces. Generalizations In the same work as the one in which the 3d conjecture appears, Kalai conjectured more strongly that the f-vector of every convex centrally symmetric polytope P dominates the f-vector of at least one Hanner polytope H of the same dimension. This means that, for every number i from 0 to the dimension of P, the number of i-dimensional faces of P is greater than or equal to the number of i-dimensional faces of H. If it were true, this would imply the truth of the 3d conjecture; however, the stronger conjecture was later disproven./ Status The conjecture is known to be true for d\\\\le 4. It is also known to be true for simplicial polytopes: it follows in this case from a conjecture of that every centrally symmetric simplicial polytope has at least as many faces of each dimension as the cross polytope, proven by ... Indeed, these two previous papers were cited by Kalai as part of the basis for making his conjecture. Another special class of polytopes that the conjecture has been proven for are the Hansen polytopes of split graphs, which had been used by to disprove the stronger conjectures of Kalai..

His uncle Georges Paulin was a part-time automobile designer and invented the mechanical retractible hardtop, who was later executed by the Nazis in 1941 as a hero of the French Resistance. After failing his Baccalaur√©at, Pierre trained to become a ceramist in Vallaurius on the French Rivera and then as a stone-carver in Burgundy. Soon after, he injured his right arm in a fight, ending his dreams as a sculptor. He then went on to attend the Ecole Camondo in Paris. He had a stint with the Gascoin company in Le Havre where he gained an interest in Scandinavian and Japanese design. He was famed for his innovative work with Artifort in the 1960s and interior design in the 1970s. At the time, his chair designs were considered very modern and unique and kick-started the successes of his designs among the younger population. Even today, his pieces are still being made and are sought after at auctions. Biography Early life Born in Paris in 1927, he had a French father and a German-speaking Swiss mother. He was as well the nephew of Georges Paulin who designed vehicles and invented the first mechanical retractible hardtop roof. Pierre Paulin had failed his Baccalaur√©at and moved on to train as a ceramist in Vallaurius and then as a stone-carver in Burgundy. Training as a sculptor, he would get into a fight that injured his right arm ending his dreams as a sculptor. He attend the Ecole Camondo in Paris afterwards. Relations with the Gascoin company, he would gain interest in Scandinavian and Japanese design which would influence his works later on. Early career Pierre Paulin had his debut exhibition at the Salon des arts m√©nagers in 1953. Afterwards, he would appear on the cover of the magazine La Maison Fran√ßaise. A year later he would be employed by the Thonet company and began experimenting with stretching swimwear materials over traditionally made chairs. Around 4 years later he would join the Maastricht- based Dutch manufacturers Artifort. Working at Artifort he would become famous worldwide with his Mushroom chair (1960). At his time working for Artifort, Paulin quoted \\"It represented the first full expression of my abilities. I considered the manufacture of chairs to be rather primitive and I was trying to think up new processes\\" he said in 2008, he worked with foams and rubbers from Italy all worked around a light metallic frame. He would then use a new stretch material over the chair. His designs were focused on applied design rather than focusing on form with comfort as his chair's starting-point. The combination of these materials made Paulin's chair designs rounder, and comfortable shapes that are still being used in chairs today. Later career During the 1970s and 1980s he was invited to decorate and furnish several important places for important people. He redecorated the living, dining, smoking and exhibition rooms of the Elys√©e's private apartments for Pompidou in 1971. In 1983 he furnished the office of Fran√ßois Mitterrand. In 1979 he launched his own consultancy and worked for Calor, Ericsson, Renault, Saviem, Tefal, Thomson and Airbus. In 1994 he would retire to the C√©vennes in southern France but would still continue on designing furniture. He died on 13 June 2009 in a hospital in Montpellier, France. Furniture design Chairs Pierre Paulin was well known for designing chairs. He worked using foams and metallic frames covered with stretch materials, admired for \\"their clear lines, the sensual feel of their material or just simply for the way their shapes cradled the body.\\" His designs were widely popular during their time and have influenced different designers such as Olivier Mourgue. Pierre Paulin influenced Olivier Mourgue's Djinn chairs that were featured in Stanley Kubrick's classic film 2001: A Space Odyssey.

His most famed chair designs were the Mushroom chair (1959), Ribbon chair (1966) and Tongue chair (1968). Interior design Pierre Paulin was as well highly influential during the 1970s. He was invited by Mobilier national to decorate the private apartments of Georges Pompidou in the √âlys√©e Palace (1971). He was then invited again in 1983 to furnish the office of Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Most of his iconic models were made in collaboration with the Atelier de Recherche et de cr√©ation - Mobilier national. He also redesigned the interiors of the Denon Wing of the Louvre Museum, the hall of Tapestries in the Paris City Hall, the Economic and Social Council assembly room, the Green Room of the state radio's Broadcasting House (\\"Maison de la Radio\\") the Nikko Hotel and other places.

The knight is equipped with a detailed Armour of God, including an early depiction of the Shield of the Trinity, and he is crowned by an angel holding the gloss non coronabuntur nisi qui legitime certaverint \\"none will be crowned but those who truly struggle\\" and in the other hand a list of the seven beatitudes, matched with the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit and the seven heavenly virtues which in turn are set against the seven cardinal vices. The Christi milites to the left of the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb in the Ghent Altarpiece (c. 1430) The miles Christianus (Christian soldier) or \\"milites Christi\\" (soldier of Christ) is a Christian allegory based on New Testament military metaphors, especially the Armor of God metaphor of military equipment standing for Christian virtues and on certain passages of the Old Testament from the Latin Vulgate. (Vulgate): Militia est vita hominis super terram... By the fifth century, the Church had started to develop doctrines that allowed for Christian participation in battle, though this was limited by a requirement that the fighting must be undertaken to convert infidels or spread the glory of Christ. Christians were not to fight for conquest or personal glory. The concepts of miles Christi and militia Christi can be traced back to the first century AD. The phrase miles Christi, derived from a letter from Paul the Apostle and much employed by Pope Gregory VII, also appeared in the Gesta Francorum in reference to the young Prince Tancred, Bohemond, Godfrey and Count Raymond of Toulouse, each of whom were Christian leaders in the First Crusade. The metaphor has its origins in early Christianity of the Roman Empire, and gave rise to the contrasting term paganus (hitherto used in the sense of \\"civilian,\\" \\"one lacking discipline\\") for its opposite, i.e. one who was not a soldier of Christ.Ernest Weekley, Etymological Dictionary of English, s.v. \\"pagan\\". Chivalry as the idealized image of knighthood was a common moral allegory in early Christian literature. Knighthood emerged as a concept during the time of Charlemagne. During the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne's Christian knights attended mass, surrounded by relics, before battles. Fragments from 15th c. Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz describe the sanctification of weapons and a concept of knighthood that was grounded in religion. It became a theme in art during the High Middle Ages, with depictions of a knight with his various pieces of equipment identified with various virtues. This parallels the development of the understanding in medieval Christendom of the armed nobility as defenders of the faith, first emphasized by Gregory VII in the context of the Investiture controversy and later made even more explicit with the actual military expeditions of the crusades. Depictions of the miles christianus with the emblematic Armour of God however remained very rare in the medieval period and only became prominent after the Protestant Reformation.\\"depictions of the miles christianus in emblematic armour are extremely rare before the Reformation\\" (Evans p. 14) In the early modern period, the understanding of the term again became more metaphorical, but it survives in various Christian orders or confessions; it is especially pronounced among the Jesuits and in the Salvation Army, and it is the central theme of the 18th century hymn \\"Soldiers of Christ, Arise\\" and the 19th century hymn \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers.\\" Priests in the 20th century also faced a decision of conscience between pacificism and struggle. So the later executed chaplain Heinrich Maier decided to actively resist Nazi terror. Maier was convinced that the inhuman Nazi system based on brutality and military power could only be overcome by force and only by military means.Gerhard Jagschitz \\"Speech in the Church of St. Leopold - Gersthof about Chaplain Heinrich Maier, Easter Monday, March 28, 2005.

Thus, the King of France only made a single fire census in his territory ‚Äì in 1328. Yet the result was incomplete as it excluded the great fiefs (e.g. Guyenne and Flanders) and some Appanages. In addition, it became quickly outdated due to the Black Death. In 1426, the Duke of Brittany made a \\"reformation of taxes\\" to limit exemptions (noble families had to prove their nobility) in all the provinces.The Reformation of 1426 There were no records of fires by urban community or territorial division (bailliage or s√©n√©chauss√©e in France). Yet their accuracy should be put in perspective: the provinces did not stop asking the central government for revisions, always for reduction, due to famine or epidemic. The total number of fires was therefore subject to hard bargaining between the central government and municipalities, regardless of the reality on the ground. In addition, the poorest families were grouped at the parish level as a single fire for joint taxation. This led to rounded off counts cut off from reality. The \\"feu fiscal\\" became a purely theoretical unit, as distinguished from the \\"feu allumant\\" (fire lights) which corresponded to the family home. Its value varied depending on the year or on social status even within the same city. It could even be set arbitrarily. Thus, in 1426, the Duke of Brittany decreed that a \\"fire\\" corresponded to three \\"estagiers\\" (heads of households). The Taille roles were updated regularly during \\"visites de feu\\" (fire visits). Their Use and historical demography The population counts were, for the most part of the \\"Ancien R√©gime\\", made in fires, not real people. The French monarchy continued to focus on the counts by fire until 1726.Jacques Dup√¢quier, History of the French Population, Paris, PUF, 4 volumes, 1988, p. 38 To estimate the number of inhabitants according to the given fires, some people applied a multiplier of 5. Thus for a population of 34 fires, 170 inhabitants are obtained. However, the conversion factor from fires to inhabitants is still under discussion among historians. The State of fires in 1328 counted 61,098 fires for Paris. The calculations on the numbers of population varied from 80,000 to 240,000 inhabitants. The coefficient of 5 was not a rule but an average indicator. The Census of Population and the \\"counting of the fires\\" Across regions and eras, the multiplier varied.

Life From Brechin, Lowe attended the University of St Andrews and University of Edinburgh. He then went into business, spending time in the Netherlands from 1792, and then London. Lowe spent a period at Caen in France, from June 1814. From September 1815 he was tutor there to Edward Deas Thomson and his elder brother; Thomson later kept in touch and discussed technology with Lowe. He also employed Nathaniel Morren and others as writers. James Mill was a friend of Lowe from school days, and his son John Stuart Mill visited Lowe in France for some weeks in 1821. Lowe was appointed lecturer in Commerce at King's College, London, around 1830, at the end of his life. According to Mill's biographer Alexander Bain, Lowe was partly dependent on Mill, and was unable to retain his position. Books *An Inquiry into the State of the British West Indies (1807) *Naval Anecdotes: or a New Key to the Proceedings of a late Administration (1807), an anonymous defence of the government, is attributed to Lowe. The Present State of England in Regard to Agriculture, Trade and Finance (1822) was Lowe's major work, now noted mostly for its Chapter IX, Fluctuation in the Value of Money or in the Price of Commodities, which influenced George Poulett Scrope.Correa Moylan Walsh, The Fundamental Problem in Monetary Science (1903), pp. 171‚Äì2; archive.org. Otto Neurath later praised this book as an attempt at a comprehensive sketch of a war economy. Lowe's general conclusions were rather buoyant, allowing the British economy good prospects and the moderation of the culture being promising for the future. He supported free trade and opposed the views of Robert Malthus. Lowe advocated indexation as applied to bonds, but also to wage contracts and land rents. His advocacy of a \\"tabular standard\\" (a precursor of the indexed unit of account) has been recognised as a technical advance in monetary analysis; Lowe used the terms \\"standard of reference\\" or \\"table of reference\\";Redvers Opie, A Neglected English Economist: George Poulett Scrope, The Quarterly Journal of Economics Vol. 44, No. 1 (Nov. 1929), pp. 101‚Äì137, at p. 121 note 3. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1885442 the idea itself, and the term \\"tabular standard\\" are attributed to George Shuckburgh-Evelyn. The first to use weighted index numbers, Lowe in effect anticipated the Laspeyres index. The book reviewed previous work by William Fleetwood, George Shuckburgh and Arthur Young. A German translation appeared in 1823.England nach seinem gegenw√§rtigen Zustande des Ackerbaues, des Handels und der Finanzen betrachtet, translated by L. H. von Jakob, Leipzig 1823. Lowe innovated in his use of constant price estimates, and the consideration of different demographic groups and their consumption, which anticipated the modern concept of consumer price index. Samuel Bailey argued against the concept of tabular standards, pointing to the difficulties arising from the need for like-to-like comparisons. William Stanley Jevons later found Lowe's pioneer work on inflation-indexed bonds \\"ingenious\\". Lowe was a proponent of such bonds, to support and buffer the developing capital market. The book also opposed expansion of the workhouse system, on grounds of expense.Anthony Brundage and David Eastwood, The Making of the New Poor Law Redivivus, Past & Present No. 127 (May 1990), pp. 183‚Äì194, at p. 192 note 27. Published by: Oxford University Press on behalf of The Past and Present Society. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/650946 Statistician As a statistician, Lowe was one of an early group who collected economic data, and applied it in pamphlets and polemics. In fact the term current then was \\"political arithmetician\\". The larger significance of the statistical work of Lowe and Thomas Tooke is that they collected figures from the period of the Continental System, of the latter part of the Napoleonic Wars. These data were then deployed in the theoretical arguments of the 1820s, dominated by David Ricardo and his doctrine on convertibility. There were no agreed principles on collection and use of data. Others bringing forward sets of figures were Patrick Colquhoun, Frederick Morton Eden, and George Richardson Porter. Their work carried less intellectual prestige than that of the political economists. Lowe was mainly concerned with fiscal policy. He accused those who had drawn up the Bullion Report into monetary policy after the end of the Napoleonic Wars of failing to take into account recent economic growth.James Frederick Rees, A Short Fiscal and Financial History of England 1815‚Äì1918 (1921), p. 51; archive.org. He argued the point quantitatively for the previous decade in The Present State of England (1822). Journalism Lowe turned from his career as merchant to writing, after a reply he made to a pamphlet of Henry Brougham in 1806 was a success. He wrote for Lloyd's Evening Post and the Edinburgh Review. He mainly contributed to the Monthly Review, for which he wrote in the period 1805 to 1815. In reviewing a work of Davis Giddy on bullionism, he produced his own analysis, in the context of the Napoleonic Wars, of the connection of foreign exchange and shortages of bullion. He also contributed to The Athenaeum edited by John Aikin. Encyclopedias Lowe wrote in the 1824 Britannica supplement on copyright, using the article to advocate for an extension of the current term of authors' copyright. This work was reprinted in Remarks on Literary Property (1838) by Philip Houlbrooke Nicklin in Philadelphia. In the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Seventh Edition Lowe wrote on \\"Austria\\" and \\"Book-Keeping\\". He wrote also for the Edinburgh Encyclop√¶dia, on \\"Bullion\\", \\"Commerce\\", \\"Currency\\" and other topics.

Its terminus in Franklin marked the beginning of the Santa Fe Trail, which eventually became a major conduit for Spanish trade in the Southwestern United States. Later it connected to the large emigrant trails, including the Oregon and California Trails, used by pioneers, gold-seekers and other early settlers of the West.Barile, Mary. The Santa Fe Trail in Missouri. (Columbia: University of Missouri Press. 2010) The region takes its name from a salt spring or \\"lick\\" in western Howard County, used by Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone, sons of famed frontiersman Daniel Boone. The County Election by George Caleb Bingham portrays early political life in Missouri Many of Missouri's early leaders came from the Boonslick. Its early French and Spanish colonial vestiges were overtaken by settlement of European-American migrants from the Upland South ‚Äî largely Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee ‚Äî who brought numerous African- American slaves with them.http://www.mo- river.net/history/boonslick/Reflections of Change: Death and Cemeteries in the Boonslick Region of Missouri\\" Maryellen Harshbarger McVickerBabcock, Rufus, editor. Forty Years of Pioneer Life: Memoir of John Mason Peck D.D. (Philadelphia: American Baptist Publication Society, 1864) The region's borders often vary in definition but have included the present-day counties of Boone, Callaway, Cooper, Howard, and Saline. Before and after the American Civil War, the area developed as the center of a larger region known as Little Dixie. Franklin, Missouri, founded in 1816, became a large port on the Missouri River and an early center of settlement and economic activity. There, the Boone's Lick Trail ended and William Becknell blazed the Santa Fe Trail to the west. The Chouteau brothers of St. Louis had previously established a fur trade monopoly with the Spanish in Santa Fe, and the fur trade was the basis of early St. Louis wealth. Columbia, Missouri is the largest city in the region; it is the location of the flagship campus of the University of Missouri system, which was established in 1839. George Caleb Bingham painted in both Franklin and Columbia. His works illustrate pioneer and river life in the early and mid-nineteenth century. Other early towns were Arrow Rock, Boonville, Fayette, and Rocheport. In 1827, Franklin was lost to the powerful floods of the river, and the town was re-built upon the bluff as New Franklin. The Smithton Company established the village of Smithton, Missouri, which would later grow into the city of Columbia. In the 21st century, the area is predominantly rural, with the exception of the city of Columbia. The region is adjacent to the Missouri Rhineland and maintains its own developed vineyards. The Katy Trail State Park runs along the Missouri River, providing recreational access by a conversion of former railroad lines to trails for biking and walking. 200px See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Howard County, Missouri *National Register of Historic Places listings in Boone County, Missouri *List of cemeteries in Boone County, Missouri *Great Osage Trail References External links *Boonslick Historical Society *Boone's Lick Road Association Category:Regions of Missouri Category:Regions of the Southern United States Category:Pre-statehood history of Missouri Category:Missouri Territory in the War of 1812 Category:African- American history in Columbia, Missouri Category:History of Columbia, Missouri ","title":"Boonslick"},{"id":"39409027","text":"Sate Bandeng is a popular Southeast Asian traditional cuisine from Banten, a province near Jakarta, Indonesia.

Development Works *Water supply pipelines: Village is equipped with pipelines for water supply. Public water taps has been also installed at few places. Village has been water rich but due to increasing population and lack of awareness for water conservation, water level goes down and due to which summers becoming hard for people nowadays. Most of hand pumps and wells dries during summer. However, supply of water is available periodically morning-evening but it is also subject to availability of electricity. One of the major issue which has been faced by farmers in past years was irrigation of crops because most of the existing old Pumps were not working at all due to Lack of Water level but this has been resolved a bit, because there are a few New Submersible Pumps installed in 2019 (private, with the help of Govt. subsidies), which allows farmers to irrigate their crops at lower rates than earlier.

Cousins George Langford and Tom Van Buskirk started making music together in Providence, RI in 2005, although their earliest tape experiments date back to childhood. Each member is a multi-instrumentalist. George plays the guitar, bass guitar, drums, and mandolin, while Tom plays the cello and piano. The duo has been described as \\"obsessed with old school hip-hop of an ‚Äò80s vintage\\". While creating mostly mellow electro-pop/80s-synth style music, the band's music is very eclectic and they have even produced a country music album. For years, Javelin used colorfully painted boomboxes on stage to color their sound like a guitar amp. The signal from the show was broadcast via FM transmitter, fostering audience participation (B.Y.O. Boombox) or fueling battery-powered, mobile parties. The band has played over 200 events including Lollapalooza in 2010. In 2009 Javelin was identified a \\"Rising\\" artist by Pitchfork Media, tagged Best New Music Pitchfork's and was given honorable mention for Pitchfork's \\"Albums of the Year\\" for their breakout release JAMZ N JEMZ.

History  The origin of Oishi Shinkage-ry≈´ was Aizu Kage-ry≈´ kenjutsu (swordsmanship), which was founded by Aizu Ik≈çsai Hisatada. Aizu Kage-ry≈´ was transmitted to founder by Murakami Itt≈ç. He came to Yanagawa domain from ≈åoka domain. He taught Aizu Kage-ry≈´ kenjutsu, Oshima-ry≈´ s≈çjutsu (use of spear) and Okuyama Shinkan-ry≈´ jujutsu. One of his student was Oishi Yuken who was a grandfather of Oishi Susumu. Oishi Yuken taught Oishi Susumu his kenjutsu and s≈çjutsu arts. Both Susumu's grandfather and his father were instructors of Yanagawa domain. Oishi Susumu improved the protective gear used during practice. In addition, he improved fukuro shinai (bamboo sword covered with leather) to a modern bamboo sword. He devised stab technique, and a technique of striking one's opponent's breastplate. He was said to be five foot eleven inches tall (1.8 meters), a great height for a Japanese of his day. Therefore, his style of swordsmanship uses longer bamboo practice swords than most other styles. There are stories of him engaging in combat around Japan using his four shaku shinai (about 121 cm). By the order of his feudal lord, he went to the capital city, Edo in 1832. In the next year, he did kenjutsu matches with many famous instructors. After Oishi Susumu, his son, also named Oishi Susume, inherited the school. Because the latter didn‚Äôt have a son, his younger brother, Oishi Yukie was placed as the headmaster of the ry≈´. After the Meiji Restoration, they didn‚Äôt practice swordsmanship for some time, but the school survived still. When Oishi Yukie died, his son, Oishi Hajime was young, so Itai Masumi, the pupil of Oishi Yukie protected the Oishi Shinkage-ry≈´. After Oishi Hajime grew up, he inherited his father's martial art. He taught the ry≈´ to his grandson, Oishi Eiichi. And Oishi Eiichi taught the Oishi Shinkage-ry≈´ to Morimoto Kunio.

The features of the Oishi Shinkage-ry≈´ are techniques called morotezuki (to make a both hands pass), katatezuki (to make a single hand pass) and d≈çgiri (to cut the waist). These techniques were used by Oishi Susumu for the first time in swordsmanship matches with the protective gear. Oishi Susumu made 79 kata, which are called tekazu in Oishi Shinkage-ry≈´. Techniques of the Oishi Shinkage-ryu kenjutsu include use of one sword with both hands, techniques to use two swords, saya-no-uchi (iai) and naginata. The first three groups of kata is the basis of the ry≈´.

He has been a professor at the University of Bonn since 2012 and director at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics since 2018. He has been called one of the leading mathematicians in the world. He won the Fields Medal in 2018, which is regarded as the highest professional honor in mathematics.  Early life and education  Scholze was born in Dresden and grew up in Berlin. His father is a physicist, his mother a computer scientist, and his sister studied chemistry. He attended the in Berlin-Friedrichshain, a gymnasium devoted to mathematics and science. As a student, Scholze participated in the International Mathematical Olympiad, winning three gold medals and one silver medal. He studied at the University of Bonn and completed his Bachelor's degree in three semesters and his Master's degree in two further semesters. He obtained his Ph.D. in 2012 under the supervision of Michael Rapoport. Career From July 2011 until 2016, Scholze was a Research Fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute in New Hampshire. In 2012, shortly after completing his PhD, he was made full professor at the University of Bonn, becoming at the age of 24 the youngest full professor in Germany. In Fall 2014, Scholze was appointed the Chancellor's Professor at University of California, Berkeley, where he taught a course on p-adic geometry. In 2018, Scholze was appointed as a director of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.  Work  Scholze's work has concentrated on purely local aspects of arithmetic geometry such as p-adic geometry and its applications. He presented in a more compact form some of the previous fundamental theories pioneered by Gerd Faltings, Jean-Marc Fontaine and later by Kiran Kedlaya. His PhD thesis on perfectoid spaces yields the solution to a special case of the weight-monodromy conjecture.  Awards  In 2012, he was awarded the Prix and Cours Peccot. He was awarded the 2013 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize. In 2014, he received the Clay Research Award. In 2015, he was awarded the Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Algebra, and the Ostrowski Prize.

It takes its title from the NW postcode area in North-West London, where the novel is set. The novel is experimental and follows four different characters living in London, shifting between first and third person, stream-of-consciousness, screenplay-style dialogue, and other narrative techniques in an attempt to reflect the polyphonic nature of contemporary, urban life. It was nominated for the 2013 Women's Prize for Fiction. Content  Plot  Set in the northwest of London, England, four locals ‚Äî Leah Hanwell, Natalie (born Keisha) Blake, Felix Cooper, and Nathan Bogle ‚Äî try to make adult lives outside of Caldwell, the working-class council estate where they grew up. While Leah has not managed to venture far from her childhood location, her best friend Natalie, now a successful, self-made barrister, lives in an affluent neighbourhood in a Victorian house. Despite their friendship and history, the two women find that they are very different from each other socio-economically. Meanwhile, a chance encounter brings Felix and Nathan together. Leah is the focus of a lower-working-class life in comparison to Natalie who represents the small higher-working-class. All four characters represent a piece of the lost generation struggling to ascend economically. Part 1 - \\"visitation\\": Leah Hanwell falls for a scam artist, who knocks at her door to ask for financial support in an emergency. The encounter with the scammer leads her to question her trust in the community. Part 2 - \\"guest\\": Former drug addict Felix Cooper wants to start a new life with his girlfriend Grace. He meets one last time with his drug-using ex-lover to say goodbye and officially leave that part of his life behind. On his way home he is murdered during an armed robbery. Part 3 - \\"host\\": Natalie Blake has met every goal she ever set for herself. She graduated from a prestigious university, became a successful lawyer, married an investment banker from a rich family, and moved to one of to the most expensive parts of London to raise her two children with him. But she leads a double-life, using the Internet to arrange secret sexual encounters with swinger couples. Part 4 - \\"crossing\\": Natalie's husband discovers the online account Natalie uses for her affairs and calls her out. Upset by the confrontation, Natalie spends the night aimlessly wandering the streets of her old neighborhood. She meets Nathan Bogle, a former classmate who became a drug addict. He seems to be involved in some sort of shady business. Natalie is about to jump from a bridge, but Nathan stops her. Part 5 - \\"visitation\\": Natalie's friend Leah also has marital problems - her husband Michel has discovered that she has been lying about no longer taking birth control. Leah finally admits that she does not share his desire for children. The quarrel is interrupted by Natalie, who wants to discuss her encounter with Nathan with Leah. News about an armed robbery resulting in the death of the victim makes recent events appear in a new light. Leah and Natalie conclude that Nathan must be involved in the crime and decide to inform the police.  Characters  Leah Hanwel: Her parents are from Ireland and were able to provide a stable home for Leah. Unlike her best friend Natalie, Leah has never been very ambitious and still lives in her old neighbourhood. She is content with her job, working for an organisation distributing lottery earnings to social projects and still very attracted to her husband Michel, a Frenchman with Algerian roots. But while Leah does not want her life to change, Michel wants children. Leah has been avoiding the confrontation and lies about no longer taking her birth control. Although Leah is generally at peace with the choices she has made so far and therefore should have little reason to envy Natalie, she's increasingly ill-at-ease with her successful friend's new-found wealth and status. Felix Cooper: After struggling with drug addiction for years, Felix is about to turn his life around. He cuts ties with people from his drug-dominated past and makes plans for a career in film. His new lease on life is inspired by his new girlfriend Grace, whose optimism and can-do-spirit is contagious. Natalie Blake: Natalie's parents are from Jamaica. They originally gave her the name Keisha, which Natalie dropped during her time at university, to better fit in with her new social circle. After graduating from a prestigious university, becoming a successful lawyer and marrying into money, Natalie is the only member of her family who is upwardly mobile. This enables her to financially support her previously convicted younger brother and her older sister's large family. Nevertheless, Natalie is regularly accused of being a \\"coconut\\" - black outside, white inside; someone who denies her origins to pander to the ruling class. Natalie feels increasingly alienated from her original community and cannot even open up to her childhood friend Leah. Nathan Bogle: As a young boy, he showed great potential as a soccer player. His ambitions were foiled by his drug addiction. Now he earns his living through illegal activities, operating from a house in Leah's street.  Themes  One of the novel's main concerns is the restructuring of the British class system. Whereas skin colour used to be seen as an identity defining feature, it now no longer automatically entails membership in any specific milieu, as illustrated by Natalie's example. Yet society has not become any more egalitarian. In a highly competitive society, belonging to cultural minority no longer guarantees mutual solidarity. Ambitious immigrants may accomplish high status and wealth in individual cases, but this does not lessen general tensions between the rich and poor in the face of widening wealth and income disparities. Even though skin colour no longer determines biographies to the extent it used to, ethnic frames still guide people's perceptions in multiple ways. Thus skin colour remains a relevant factor, even in a multi-ethnic society, but becomes increasingly ambiguous as a marker of social belonging. In a world with an increasing variety of life style choices, the issue of self examination gains importance. Leah, who sees no appeal in the traditional maternal role, rejecting still widespread societal expectations, cuts to the core of this new liberty: \\"I am the sole author of the dictionary that defines me\\". This freedom of self-definition however also come with increased responsibility. Getting to choose means having to carefully consider your choices and having more occasion for doubts. In NW, the possibility of being the sole author of your own life is portrayed as a blessing and a curse at the same time. Self-examination, however, does not always protect against delusion. In a quest to be all things to all people, a person can lose sight of their innermost self. In contrast to Leah, Natalie has always tried her best to meet societal expectations - in her role as daughter, sister, mother, wife, lawyer, rich person, poor person, Briton and Jamaican. Each of this roles demands its own costume. Natalie comes to see them as cage, from which she tries to escape, through her sexual escapades. The novel portray different reactions to the social pressures placed on women with regard to motherhood. Leah ultimately resists the pressure, but still feels a need to hide her desire to remain childless as long as possible. Natalie's wants to meet social expectations of motherhood, but in a way that does not hamper her career - to her, having it all is mostly a question of timing, allowing her to meet personal as well as professional objectives. The novel also highlights different attitudes towards maternal perfectionism depending on someone's milieu. In Caldwell it is enough to abstain from physical violence to be considered a decent mother. Everywhere else, everything has to be perfect and even then the mother is not guaranteed to escape judgement.  Form  Smith's style in NW is characterized by a rapid succession of associations, conveyed in brief sentences, dialogues and short scenes in a mix of literary and colloquial language. Instead of an omniscient narrator, she uses various narrative techniques to portray the multiple layers and idiosyncrasies of her four central characters' perspectives. Natalie is efficient, goal-oriented, well-organized - her life is systematically laid out in 185 numbered vignettes. Leah in contrast is mellow and prefers to go with the flow - her part of the book is dominated by stream-of-consciousness. Smith's use of this narrative technique invites comparisons to James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and John Dos Passos. The central characters' life stories are told independently, but juxtaposed in a manner that enhances mutual characterization. The use of various narrative techniques as well as the frequent change of perspective create a tension between internal and external views on the characters. While Smith places an emphasis on the interior, with characters like Leah, Natalie and Felix, she deliberately refrains from guiding readers' sympathies towards Nathan, neglecting to portray his inner life. She aims for Nathan to remain a stranger to readers, in order to confront them with their reaction to such a character - the sort of isolated, homeless addict, who is likely to be perceived as a threat first and foremost. The objective is to preserve his otherness. Reception The novel was widely praised by critics, and in particular by James Wood, who criticised Smith's early work for its tendency towards what he called hysterical realism. Wood included the novel in his \\"Best Books of 2012\\" and commented that \\"underneath the formal experimentation runs a steady, clear, realistic genius. Smith is a great urban realist... the best novel she has yet written.\\" Wood, James, \\"Books of the Year\\", The New Yorker, 17 December 2012. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Philip Hensher gave the novel five stars, describing it as \\"a joyous, optimistic, angry masterpiece, and no better English novel will be published this year, or, probably, next.\\"Hensher, Philip, \\"NW by Zadie Smith: review\\" , The Telegraph, 3 September 2012.

Biography Wijaya was born in Bandung, West Java, Dutch East Indies, on 7 March 1940. After graduating senior high school, she studied for some time at the National Theatre Academy of Indonesia in Jakarta. During this period she was active as a singer and actress; she had made her film debut in 1954 with Gagal. In 1956 Wijaya rose to fame as one of the stars in Perfini's Tiga Dara. The film, directed by Usmar Ismail, saw Mieke play Nana, one of three sisters raised by their grandmother after their mother's death; in 2006 Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang wrote that Tiga Dara was the eleventh best Indonesian film of all time.

Through the 1970s and 1980s Wijaya acted in numerous films, including the religious Sembilan Wali (1985), the comedy Bing Slamet Koboi Cengeng (1974), the drama Ranjang Pengantin (1973), and the romances Badai Pasti Berlalu (1977) and Dr. Karmila (1977). In 1987 she acted in three productions. After a four-year hiatus, during 1991 Wijaya acted in two films, Saat Kukatakan Cinta and Zig Zag (Anak Jalanan). This was followed by another long hiatus from featured films: the Indonesian film industry declined drastically in the early 1990s, and Wijaya began to concentrate on television series. , her most recent feature film role was in Hanung Bramantyo's Ayat- Ayat Cinta.

I felt better and better as each game went on and I think I was playing my best footy at the end of the year, which was really pleasing.\\" Coach Jason Taylor named Nofoaluma the club's best player for the second half of the season. At the end of the year, Nofoaluma made his international debut for Samoa, playing fullback in an historic test match against Fiji in Apia. 2017 Nofoaluma received high praise for the first game of the year, with the Daily Telegraph saying, \\"Playing as if he needed to break 200 metres to get paid, Nofoaluma eventually churned through 211 while also creating several opportunities, through his seven tackle breaks and two line breaks, that would eventually lead to points for others. Hell, the Tigers No. 2 even offloaded‚Äîyes, offloaded‚Äîfive times.\\" In April, it was announced that Nofoaluma had re-signed with the Wests Tigers on a four-year contract. Weeks later, he suffered an injury that required groin and hernia surgery, but played on for the remainder of the season. He said, \\"I couldn't do certain movements. Even when sitting up, I couldn't get out of bed; I had to roll out. I could have had the operation straight away, but there was no depth in the team, and Ivan needed me out there.\\" Nofoaluma finished the regular season in the NRL's top five performers for metres gained, tackle-breaks and offloads. He led the Wests Tigers in these fields and was also their leader for line- breaks. He was the only player to play in all 24 games for Wests Tigers, scoring 8 tries. At season's end, he was named as a winger in the Rugby League Players Association Dream Team. 2018 Despite his achievements in 2017, Nofoaluma was a surprise exclusion for round 1, with Corey Thompson chosen ahead of him on the right wing. Playing reserve grade, he scored two tries. Nofoaluma said, \\"It was one of the biggest shocks of my career so far. But in saying that, for me coming out today, even the whole week leading up to this game, it makes you feel like you've got to perform at your best to be at the top with the best.\\" With Tuimoala Lolohea suffering a knee injury, Thompson moved to fullback and Nofoaluma returned his regular spot in the team for round 2. In June, Nofoaluma suffered a calf injury that would see him on the sideline for a month, and had to be helped from the field. He later tweeted. \\"Disgraced when coming off injured to hear a roosters fan in the crowd say \\"Nofoaluma you cunt. Your a fucking piece of shit\\". Hope your satisfied!!\\" Returning in round 18, he remained in first grade for the remainder of the season, scoring six tries from his eighteen appearances. 2019 Nofoaluma suffered a shoulder injury in the preseason and didn't make an appearance in first grade until round 11. He remained in the team for the rest of the year, scoring 8 tries in his 14 games. In round 23, he scored his first ever hat- trick of tries in Wests 46‚Äì4 win over the Newcastle Knights at Campbelltown Stadium. 2020 Nofoaluma scored two tries for Wests in round 1 of the 2020 NRL season as the club defeated St. George Illawarra 24‚Äì14 at WIN Stadium. After a further 2 tries in round 4, he led the competition with 6 tries, 2 ahead of his closest rival. In round 7, he scored a third double as the Wests Tigers defeated Canterbury-Bankstown 34‚Äì6. In round 17, he scored a hat-trick as Wests defeated Manly-Warringah 34-32 at Brookvale Oval, taking him three clear on the NRL's leading try-scorer list for the season. He was still leading the competition with 17 tries coming in to final round of the season, but was surpassed when Kyle Feldt scored 3 tries and then Alex Johnston scored 5.

It is an architectural landmark in the city's Montserrat district, situated in a triangular block bounded by the streets Calle Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, Avenida Presidente Julio Argentino Roca and Calle Per√∫. Built of grey granite, it has a Neoclassical design. The building is open to the public on week-days only. The building contains the Esteban Echeverr√≠a Library, Salon Rosado (also known as the Salon Eva Per√≥n), and a carillon which, when it was installed in 1930, was the largest in South America. History A lot southwest of the Plaza de Mayo was set aside for the building's construction. The building's design was awarded through a competition to local architect H√©ctor Ayerza. Approved and budgeted by the council in 1926, Ayerza's eclectic design drew heavily from French Neoclassical architecture. The foundation stone was laid under the First Congress of Municipalities of the Republic of Argentina, on November 18, 1926 by Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. A commemorative plaque was affixed on the occasion. Louis Falcone was awarded the contract with a completion time of 5 years, and the work started on September 19, 1927; the contract included works of luxury fittings, lighting, a clock tower with five bells and a carillon with 30 bells. Problems with contractual interpretation were arbitrated by the engineer Sebastian Ghigliazza. The palace was inaugurated on October 3, 1931. The building has been home to other government agencies. Juan Per√≥n, who established the Secretariat of Labor and Social Insurance, set aside a wing in the building for the purpose. Per√≥n had the building declared a National Historic Monument in 1951. Architecture Exterior ledge facing Calle Per√∫ Constructed in the Neoclassical style, the building has a basement, three storeys and a penthouse. It incorporates an older residence that faced the Plaza de Mayo but now fronts the Avenida Julio A. Roca. The main door, located at the corner of Avenida Julio A. Roca and the Calle Peru, is of carved wood with a central brass knocker shaped as a lion's head. The front of the building has Corinthian style colonnades and balconies with balustrades. The former Municipal shield, made of bronze, adorns a large window. Architecturally, the building is perhaps best known for its 26 cornice caryatids (most by sculptor Troiano Troiani), the clock tower, and carillon (a musical instrument that is typically housed in the bell tower) of 30 bells. Aside from the legislative chambers themselves, the building's interior features a number of architecturally noteworthy salons and halls, as well as two libraries; the spacious halls are named the Golden Hall, the San Martin Hall, the Montevideo Hall, the Lost Steps Hall, the Eva Per√≥n Lounge, the Dining Room of Honor, the Aldermen Hall and the Exhibition Hall. The Esteban Echeverr√≠a Library houses a unique collection of 2,000 books from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. The other library, known as the Hemeroteca Jos√© Hern√°ndez, has numerous newspaper archives from 1870 covering topics of history, culture and general news. A staircase is situated opposite the main entrance to Avenida Julio A. Roca. It splits into two sections before reaching the main floor rotunda. Above it, a stained glass dome representing the sun can be opened manually or electronically to view the open sky. Library Esteban Echeverr√≠a Library Previously known as the Centennial Library, the Esteban Echeverr√≠a library was designed in 1884 by the then Council president, Dr. Roberto Larroque, who ordered library materials from foreign counties. It also houses a collection of 30,000 texts on law and legislation. There are texts from Visigothic Spain, from the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, and the colonial Buenos Aires Cabildo, and others. It includes the Jos√© Hern√°ndez Periodicals Library whose works have been microfilmed. Initially created to assist legislators and municipal officials, it was later opened to the general public. The library was renamed to honor the Argentine poet Esteban Echeverria who introduced literary romanticism to the city. The library is designed in an eclectic style with Neoclassical elements. It is clad in walnut; above the wrought iron fireplace is the city shield. Halls The Golden Hall, reserved for ceremonies and other formal events, was inspired by the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles, France. It is reached by climbing the Stairway of Honor. Columns with Ionic capitals surround the central area, supporting an arched gallery which serves as a balcony over the central area. At its base there is a shield of honor with the arms of the city. The hall is lit by six chandeliers, each with 45 lights, as well as 14 candelabras. The room is used for public hearings, receptions and events. After women obtained voting rights in 1947 and female politicians began to enter the government's legislative system, First Lady Eva Per√≥n established the palace's Salon Rosado (\\"pink room\\"; now known as the Salon Eva Per√≥n) as a reserved area for government women to discuss issues in a place from which men were excluded. The room is now open to visitors. It is decorated with a memorial bust of Eva Per√≥n and includes original fixtures. The edifice was declared a Historic Protection Area in 1977 and at the \\"comprehensive protection level\\" since 2000. The salon is a study which she used as head of the Eva Per√≥n Foundation. A number of scenes for Alan Parker's 1996 film, Evita, were filmed here and in the legislative chambers. It is located between the offices of the President and the Vice President of the First Legislature. It houses some of the original furniture and personal objects such as a desk, chair, lamp, folders, ink and letter rack. Its walls are paneled in wood. There are also two Louis XIV cabinets by cabinetmaker Tarris, the municipal arms engraved on the doors. Two vases stand there, one in Baccarat crystal, the other bronze. Tower and carillon Carrillon of the Palacio Legislativo de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires The clock tower is high. It houses a clock with five bells named Santa Maria, Pinta, La Ni√±a, La Porte√±a and, the largest, at 1,800 kg, Argentina. The tower's four quadrants have a diameter measuring . The clock has a system that controls the running of 80 other clocks distributed in the rest of the building. The German-made carillon, made of bronze, has 30 bells that together weigh over 27 tons; most are more than 4 tons. Its architect was Hector Ayerza. It is situated on a semicircular pergola, surrounded by gargoyles and the silver pipes of a powerful air conditioner. The bells are suspended in an iron frame in height and weigh 8 tons. When installed in 1930, it was the largest carillon in South America.

Harry, detailing an invasion of the United States by China. Plot The United States turns its military into a much smaller force, switching its priorities to domestic matters, beginning with using the U.S. military budget to fill the gap in Social Security's trust fund left there by past Congresses and presidents who spent the money on other things, and continuing onward in the same theme. As the U.S. is downsizing its military, China becomes a world superpower, building new supercarriers and becoming a dominant naval power in addition to a growing economic power. Eventually, China goes down the route of conquest. China begins to conquer Eurasia to such an extent that it reaches the borders of the European Union in the west. With most of Asia under its domination, including Japan, everyone assumes China is coming for Europe next; however, through a strategy of misdirection making the Europeans think they will invade Western Europe, they actually pin the European naval force in the Mediterranean and blockade it, neutralizing it as a threat without the cost of invasion. China instead throws its resources into attacking the Caribbean. Due to the Monroe Doctrine, new President Bill Baker, who came to office on a pro- war platform, has to make a critical decision: to try to halt them with conventional forces, or use nuclear weapons. The U.S. must make a decision as the Chinese invasion forces in Central America gather steam: to build traditional naval super-carriers to meet the new Chinese ones, or to build highly experimental arsenal ships capable of firing thousands of missiles at once, showering its target with overwhelming force while having a crew of only around 100 due to the extent of automation. They might be more effective but are also untested, and the U.S. does not have the resources for both. Baker decides to back the arsenal ships. As the likelihood of invasion via the Gulf of Mexico comes, many Americans leave the exposed states. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are not sure if this is another diversion attempt and the Chinese might come from the east or west coasts. The U.S. President orders the military to plan for those eventualities as well. A full war economy along with total mobilization is called up, including all able-bodied women, which includes the U.S. President's daughter. Baker refuses to order a nuclear strike and orders the military to meet the threat with conventional arms come what may. He is convinced any nuclear strike will lead to a series of escalating exchanges that will leave the two countries so destroyed that neither side can achieve any victory. Baker is frequently meeting in the situation room, or the Map Room of the White House (returned to its original purpose) to oversee plans. There is tension between the Chinese military and civilian leaderships and Baker is trying to make a behind-the-scenes deal with the civilian leaders. Baker tells the National Security Council, \\"We will die as a united nation of 50 states or we will win; there will be no territorial concessions\\". In the meantime, the U.S. braces for invasion.

On 17 December 2015, Walker signed with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles on a 4-year deal starting from 2016, after he was heavily linked to sign with them since his release from the Rabbitohs, putting the end to his tumultuous off season. Although he has played most of his first-grade career in the centres, Walker has been touted by new Manly coach Trent Barrett and Sea Eagles legend and rugby league Immortal Bob Fulton, themselves Australian former international five-eighths, as the replacement five-eighth for New Zealand international half Kieran Foran who has moved to play for Parramatta from 2016. At the official announcement of his signing during a Sea Eagles pre-season training camp in Coffs Harbour, Walker told the Sydney Morning Herald \\"Five-eighth was my favourite position coming through the juniors and if the coach (Barrett) wants me there I will jump at the opportunity\\". 2016 On 13 January, Walker was named in the emerging New South Wales Blues squad.

Walker played in both finals matches as the club reached the elimination semi-final against South Sydney in which Manly were defeated by his old club 34-26 at ANZ Stadium. Assault allegations On 6 December 2018, Walker was arrested by police after allegedly assaulting his fianc√©e Alexandra Ivkovic that day at their home on Sydney‚Äôs northern beaches. He was charged with domestic-related common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The altercation was triggered by Ivanovo preparing dinner early and asking Walker whether he would prefer to use a fork or a spoon, while he wanted to continue playing his PlayStation. At a pre-trial court hearing on 26 February 2019 it was revealed that in two video statements and multiple written statements to police, Ivkovic had said that Walker pulled her to the ground by her ponytail, while she was holding their four month-old son in her arms, causing her to sustain several bloodied minor cuts. These statements were supported by the only witness, her neighbour. However, at the hearing, Ivkovic told the court that she believed Walker did not pull, but ‚Äútouched my hair‚Äù, at which point she over-balanced and fell. The NRL applied its new no-fault stand down policy, so Walker was suspended indefinitely. On 10 May 2019, at the court hearing, the magistrate dismissed the charges, saying she was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Walker had assaulted his partner. The NRL stated immediately that its no fault stand down had expired and therefore Walker became free to resume playing for Manly.

With a total installed capacity of 4,200 MW, the plant is Taiwan's third largest coal-fired power plant after Taichung Power Plant and Hsinta Power Plant. History The groundbreaking ceremony for the power plant construction was held on 12 December 1996. Invited to the ceremony were Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang and President of Legislative Yuan Liu Sung- pan. Commissioned in June 1999 for its first two units, the power plant is the first independent power producer power plant after Taipower ended the electricity supply monopoly in Taiwan in 1994. Architecture The power plant is located on a 87 hectares of area made of reclaimed land. Ownership The power plant is owned by the Mai-Liao Power Corporation (MPC) and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPCC). Generation units The power plant consists of five 600 MW pulverized coal-fired units owned by the MPC and two 600 MW pulverized coal-fired co-generation units owned by the FPCC. The plant is designed for base load service with the capability for daily startup and shutdown operation per instructions from Taipower's dispatcher center. Components The coal handling system of the power plant has a truck unloading station capacity of 600 tonnes/hour and its flexible sidewall conveyor capacity of 800 tonnes/hour. It gets its coal directly from cargo ships docking at its Mai-Liao Industrial Port, next to the power plant. The coal is stored in coal domes in which each dome is 120 meter in diameter, 60 meter in height and 180,000 tons in capacity. The cooling system for the plant comes directly from the sea water with a total usage amount of 200,000 tons per day. Events 2012 On 20 June 2012 at 11:55 am, the power plant tripped during the Tropical Storm Talim. This caused the shut down of 54 out of 66 units of the Yunlin petrochemical complex. 2016 On 1 August 2016, a generating unit of the power plant broke down, disrupting the supply of power.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2016/08/02/474162/Orange-alert.htm 2017 On 7 October 2017, the no. 1 generation unit of the power plant was shut down due to pipe rupture, causing 600 MW of power loss.

The idea took 13 years to develop and was the brainchild of Alex Hearn, an asthmatic Oxford graduate whose parents smoked and who went through more than 800 prototypes before settling on a design.Times Newspaper (2014) - E-cigarette rival wins medical approval The Voke Inhaler contains a micro-valve which is activated by the user inhaling, and unlike an e-cigarette, does not need electronics, batteries or heat to produce a hit of nicotine. Since it uses inhaler technology to deliver the nicotine, the Voke administers a precise dose of the drug which does not contain the tar, tobacco or other substances found in regular cigarettes. In late 2010, Kind Consumer agreed an exclusive development and distribution agreement with Nicoventures Limited (later renamed Nicovations Limited) a wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco plc. BAT's manufacturing, intellectual property, manufacturing, marketing and branding rights were assigned to Kind Consumer (Jan 2017) who took back ownership for the commercialisation of Voke.

Perry, and starring Ryan Reynolds, Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick and Jacki Weaver. It had its world premiere at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2014. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on February 6, 2015, by Lionsgate. It received positive reviews from critics. Plot Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) is an upbeat man who works at a bathtub factory, and lives in a modified apartment above a bowling alley with his dog, Bosco, and his cat, Mr. Whiskers. Jerry is a schizophrenic who chooses not to take his medication and enjoys delusions and hallucinations that manifest in the form of his pets talking to him. Bosco often represents his good intentions while Mr. Whiskers represents his more violent nature. Jerry has a workplace crush on an English woman named Fiona, and asks her out on a date at a local Chinese dinner theater called Su Shen. She agrees to go, but stands him up to go to a karaoke party with two other women from work, Lisa and Alison. Fiona's car doesn't start, leading her to flag down Jerry as he drives by. While driving her home, Jerry accidentally hits a deer which crashes through his windshield. Jerry's hallucinations show the deer urging him to put it out of its misery. Jerry does as told, using a hunting knife to cut its throat. Terrified, Fiona runs off into the woods. Jerry chases her, still carrying the knife, to explain but ends up tripping over Fiona, and accidentally stabbing her. As Fiona bleeds out, Jerry tearfully apologizes for hurting her and says that he loves her. To end her pain, Jerry stabs her again, and she dies. Upon returning home, Bosco suggests he go to the police and confess, while Mr. Whiskers says there is no shame in what he did, but insists Jerry needs to dispose of the body. Jerry collects Fiona's body but leaves a bloody shoe and pile of organs. He dismembers Fiona, packing her innards in numerous Tupperware containers and placing her severed head inside his fridge. As his delusions increase in intensity, Fiona's head comes to life and starts talking to him. Jerry attempts to apologize once again, but she rejects his apology, citing the good life she had before she died. Fiona then demands Jerry take his medication. Jerry takes his pills, and the next day, he experiences nightmares of his emotionally abusive father. When he wakes up his hallucinations have ended; his pets no longer speak to him, his apartment is a mess, with animal waste and garbage littering his living room, and blood stains all over his kitchen. Fiona's head no longer speaks and is foul and rotting. He throws away the pills in terror, and the next morning, his hallucinations return and his life is back to 'normal'. Fiona tries to convince Jerry to kill another person \\"so she has a friend\\". Jerry asks Lisa on a date. He takes her to his abandoned childhood home, where it is revealed his mother had admitted to her insanity and was about to be taken away by the authorities when he was a child. When they arrived, she decided to commit suicide by trying to slit her throat, but couldn't do it herself and so she begged Jerry to finish the job to end her suffering. The police found Jerry standing over his dead mother and he was committed instead. Jerry sobs in front of Lisa, who comforts him. They go to her house and spend the night together. Lisa goes to Jerry's house. She wanders in and discovers the state of the apartment, including all the containers of organs and blood stains, becoming hysterical when she discovers Fiona's disembodied head on the coffee table. Despite pressure from Mr. Whiskers, Jerry refuses to kill her. Jerry tries to explain, but Lisa flees and locks herself in the bathroom. When Jerry breaks in, Lisa starts hitting him with a towel hanger and runs to his room. Jerry tries to calm her with an apology, which she seems to accept. When she tries to escape, Jerry throws her back into the room, causing the back of her neck to hit a shelf, badly breaking it, leaving her paralyzed and slowly dying. After she dies, Jerry dismembers her, placing her head in the fridge next to Fiona's. Other workers realize Fiona and Lisa have gone missing. When Alison goes to Jerry's house to investigate, Jerry immediately kills her, taking her head as well. Jerry confesses his killings to his counselor Dr. Warren. She tries to call the police, but he takes her hostage and flees into the countryside, desperately wanting her to help him. She calms him down and shows understanding, seeming to make some progress with Jerry. Meanwhile, two other workers from accounting break into Jerry's home, letting Bosco escape through the front door, and immediately call the police. Shortly after Jerry returns home, still holding Warren hostage, the police surround his house and prepare to move in. Jerry flees down into the basement, accidentally breaking a gas pipe while doing so. After rescuing Dr. Warren, the police are knocked back from an explosion caused by the gas leak. Jerry realizes the bowling alley is on fire and he is in grave danger. The voices of Bosco and Mr. Whiskers speak to him in his own mind. Mr. Whiskers insists that he get out of there and find another place to live, to hide, so that he may continue killing and feeling alive. However, Bosco tells him that there is no place for him in life any longer and that he should let the fire \\"put him to sleep\\". Choosing to stay and end his own misery, he lies down and waits until he blacks out and eventually dies from the smoke inhalation. In a white void, Bosco and Mr. Whiskers confess that, despite their opposing beliefs, they did like each other, before going their separate ways. Jerry then appears with his parents, Fiona, Lisa and Alison, and he apologizes to the women for killing them. Jesus appears, and they all dance and sing together. In the end, Jesus ascends Jerry in a forklift.

When asked about casting Ryan Reynolds in the leading role, Satrapi stated in an interview with Digital Spy, \\"At the beginning, the producer and myself said let's look for an actor, and then Ryan made the voices on his iPhone and he sent it over, and I was like, \\"Who is that?\\" And suddenly it makes sense. That is the voices the guy hears, so who else but him can do it?

Ramli is credited as the \\"first Malay rock singer to hold two solo concerts at the Istana Budaya in Kuala Lumpur.\\" He was awarded the COMPASS Artistic Excellence Award in 1998. He formed five-piece band, Sangkakala, to serve as his backing band. A 1990 Malaysian Hari Raya Puasa television special Bersama Ramli Sarip, in which Ramli hosted, was released on the first day of the season.

He is mostly notable for the cityscapes of Livorno and paintings of Livornese daily life. Biography Luigi Levi, who signed his paintings as Ulvi Liegi (an anagram of his real name), was born in Livorno in a wealthy Jewish family. He got initial art education in Livorno, and then he moved to Florence, where he studied in the Academy of Arts under Adolfo Tommasi, Carlo Mark√≤ the Younger, and Giuseppe Ciaranfi. While in Florence, he became friends with many artists from the Macchiaioli group, first Telemaco Signorini, and later one of the leaders of the group, Giovanni Fattori. Liegi first exhibited his paintings in 1882, and got positive responses. In the 1880s, he painted in the style close to the Macchiaioli, but later started to paint in a style close to impressionism. In 1886‚Äì1888 Liegi visited Paris, where he studied works of impressionists, and London; in 1889, two of his works were exhibited in the World's Fair in Paris. In 1882, he exhibited at the Mostra of the Societ√† d'incoraggiamento delle Belle Arti of Florence three studies dal vero; in 1884, Liegi sent to Turin three landscapes: Un tramonto lungo il Mugnone; Una giornata grigia nei camp√¨; Un effetto autunnale. In 1887 at Venice, he exhibited: After the rain; Sulla strada del Romito a Florence; Giornata invernale; Sulla sera al Manzollo presso Florence. In 1888, he exhibited at Bologna: Nei campi, dopo the pioggia; Giornata d' inverno, presso San Gervasio, large dal vero study. The same year in London and in 1889 at Paris and at the Promotrice of Florence, he sent: Nel Mugnone; Tramonto; Casolari in montagna; Garda; and Barche peschereccie a Riva ed altri.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti, by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, Page 260-261. From 1890 to 1908, Liegi lived in Florence, but often spent summers in Liguria. In 1908, he moved to Livorno, and stayed there until his death in 1939. He was involved with the Postmacchiaioli, of which he and Llewelyn Lloyd are considered to be the best known representatives. In 1918, Liegi had his first personal exhibition, in Galleria Mario Galli in Florence. Since 1920, he was the president of the Gruppo Labronico and promoted Livornese art. He died in 1939 in extreme poverty.

The coup was carried out at British instigation and involved British intelligence operatives. Mirkoviƒá and the other plotters were all funded by the British. The coup resulted in the German-led invasion of Yugoslavia during which the armed forces of Yugoslavia were defeated within 11 days. On 14 April 1941, Mirkoviƒá handed command of the air force to Colonel Petar Vukƒçeviƒá, the commander of the 4th Bomber Brigade.

He worked with writers such as Gerhard R√ºhm, Antonio Fian and Gernot Wolfgruber, painters such as Maria Lassnig, Tone Fink or musicians such as Wolfgang Mitterer together. Through his specialization in animation film his work has a special position in the Austrian film avant-garde. Sielecki's films were featured on film festivals in Germany, including at the Berlin International Film Festival, the Hamburg Short Film Festival, the International Videofestival Bochum, the Bamberg Short Film Festival and the Regensburg Short Film Week. Outside the German-speaking countries, he was shown on important festivals such as the Hiroshima International Animation Festival and the Krak√≥w Film Festival.

It was originally built between 1881 and 1883 as a residence, the expanded as a boarding house, a hotel, and finally as a motel. The original structure is thought to be the oldest extant structure in Holbrook. History The original house was built by Pedro Monta√±o, probably as a single-story house, using plastered adobe. With its dormers and steeply-pitched roof, it represents a hybrid of Hispanic and Anglo building styles. The house was expanded about 1885 with a two-story wing of adobe bricks, the Higgins addition, after an 1884 sale of the property to James and Maggie Higgins, who established a boarding house. After several changes of ownership, the Higgins House became the Brunswick Hotel after 1889, operated by John and Anna Connor. The upstairs portion of the addition was used as a dance hall and as a Masonic lodge. After several more changes of ownership the property was bought by S. Earle Taylor, an oil investor, to house workers. The property has remained in the Taylor family since then. Lloyd Taylor, a geologist, bought the hotel from his uncle. During the 1930s the west wing of the Brunswick Hotel was Holbrook's hospital. A kitchen addition, necessitated by this change was designed in the mid-1930s by Lorimore Skidmore. Skidmore went on to design the later additions after the hotel became the Arizona Hotel. In the 1940s the compound was enclosed with an adobe wall, and adobe loggias were added, and the hotel's name was hanged again to the Arizona Rancho. During World War II the hotel was leased by Fullerton Junior College to house pilot candidates training for the U.S. Navy at Park Field in Holbrook. The Taylor family added to the complex for their own living quarters at this time. With the end of the war, business prospered. The hotel catered to tourists going to California on U.S. 66, which ran through Holbrook. However, the main road was farther north, and a new commercial district developed along 66 a few blocks to the north of the old town center, which had been oriented to the railroad line. The construction of Interstate 40 farther away caused further decline, leading to the hotel's closure after some time as a youth hostel. Description The Arizona Rancho compound is located on a corner lot to the south of the present Holbrook business district, between the railroad tracks and the Little Colorado River. The buildings are arranged on the north side of the site, facing an open, partially walled parking area. The wall is broken by openings with decorative wagon wheels set into the spaces, echoed by round window openings in the main building with inset wagon wheels. The complex is described as a \\"hodgepodge\\" of additions and styles. It retains a general Southwestern style with an emphasis on Pueblo Revival style, mainly expressed in the motel addition. The Monta√±o residence alone has a steeply-pitched roof, partly obscured by a later two-story adobe addition. The motel section is a long, low structure with projecting vigas over the fronting porch. Windows throughout the complex are framed in heavy wood timbers that are flush with the adobe plaster exterior wall finish. The motel wing includes a variety of wall materials, including stone, wood framing covered with stucco, and an adaptation of log-style construction with old wood posts laid up and chinked with stucco. The Arizona Rancho was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 17, 1997. In 2007 plans were advanced to sell some surrounding properties and to restore the Rancho.

Biography Taltabull was born in Barcelona. He came from an educated, middle-class family and studied music (mainly piano) locally. Upon the first publication of his work in 1907, he moved to Munich to study aesthetics and music theory under Franz Wiedermeyer. He also studied composition in Leipzig with Max Reger, for whom Taltabull dedicated his Sonatina per a piano (1910). In 1911, after a brief stay in Barcelona, he established himself in Paris working as a composer, pianist, and arranger. While in Paris, he continued his musical studies with Andr√© Gedalge, Charles Tournemire and Charles Koechlin. He married Lea Masson in 1914. He was forced to leave Paris during the German invasion of France during World War II. When Taltabull returned to Barcelona, he was received indifferently and did not find much professional success in Spain under Francisco Franco. He supported himself by giving private music lessons in his home. He died in Barcelona in 1964. After his death, Taltabull's pupils celebrated him as a gifted teacher. Some of the most important Catalan musical figures of the later 20th century, such as Xavier Benguerel, Joan Guinjoan, Josep Mestres Quadreny, Josep Soler, and Salvador Moreno Manzano, were among Taltabull's students.

As a consequence, DRE forwarded to the applicant's head office a memorandum of agreement of lease for signature, accompanied by a letter dated September 18, in which the applicant was requested to return the memorandum, duly signed, as soon as possible, together with a cheque for the first month's rental, deposit and incidental charges. History The lease was to commence on October 1, 1986. In terms of clause 3 of the memorandum, rental was payable in advance on the first day of each month, failing which the lessor was entitled summarily to cancel the lease. On October 8, the applicant sent a letter to DRE enclosing a cheque for the amount requested and advising DRE that the memorandum would be signed and returned after its executive meeting, which would be held at the end of October. The respondent deposited the cheque. The memorandum was signed on November 4, and was returned, together with a cheque for November rental, to DRE. That cheque was not deposited. Instead, it was returned to the applicant, together with a cheque for the amount previously tendered and deposited. The applicant was informed in writing that the respondent had not regarded itself as having concluded an agreement of lease with it. Details of the case The applicant applied for an interdict to prevent the respondent from leasing the premises to any other person on the grounds that a valid lease agreement had been concluded and had not been validly cancelled, and for a mandamus directing the respondent to allow the applicant free and undisturbed access to the premises. The applicant alleged that the respondent's conduct had been motivated by racism, which the respondent strenuously denied. It contended that no agreement had been concluded: DRE's letter to the applicant, enclosing the memorandum, had been no more than an invitation to the applicant to submit an offer to lease the respondent's premises, which the applicant had done by signing the memorandum. That offer the respondent had not accepted. It submitted, in the alternative, that, if a valid agreement had been concluded (which was not conceded), it had justifiably cancelled that agreement due to non-payment of rental for October and November by the due date, being the first day of the month. The court held, as to the issue of whether or not a valid agreement of lease had been concluded, that an examination of the letter written to the applicant by DRE on September 18, and the applicant's reply thereto, dated 8 October, made it clear that the parties had reached consensus on the essentials of the lease: Once the applicant had accepted the terms and conditions contained in the memorandum attached to DRE's letter (which it had, by sending its cheque for the first month's rental, deposit and other charges), a binding agreement would have been concluded between the parties. The court held that the argument that the memorandum of agreement had to be signed, at least by the applicant, if not by both parties, before a contract of lease came into existence, could not be upheld. There had been nothing in DRE's letter of September 18 to indicate that signature of the memorandum was a precondition for the existence of a legally valid contract. The fact that the respondent had accepted and deposited the applicant's cheque was yet another indication that a lease had come into existence. The respondent, then, had failed to discharge the onus of proving that signature by the parties to the memorandum had been an essential prerequisite to a binding lease. As to the question of whether or not the lease had been validly cancelled, the court held that the agreement had not provided for any days of grace for the payment of rent. The respondent had thus been entitled to terminate the lease when the applicant had submitted payment for November after November 1. The applicant, therefore, had no right to occupy the premises and no right to restrain the respondent from leasing them to other persons.

Section 4(1) of the Provincial Tender Board Act provides, inter alia, that the tender board established in terms of the Act > shall have the sole power to procure supplies and services for the province, > and, subject to the provisions of any other Act of the provincial > legislature, to arrange the hiring or letting of anything or the acquisition > or granting of any right for or on behalf of the province, and to dispose of > movable provincial property, and may for that purpose‚Äî(a) on behalf of the > province conclude an agreement, which shall be in writing, with a person > within or outside the Republic for the furnishing of supplies and services > to the province or for the hiring or letting of anything or the acquisition > or granting of any right for or on behalf of the province or for the > disposal of movable provincial property; (b) with a view to concluding an > agreement referred to in para (a), in any manner it may deem fit, invite > offers and determine the manner in which and the conditions subject to which > such offers shall be made. These and other provisions of the Act, the court noted, show how important a role the tender board is intended to play in ensuring good governance in the field of procurement policies and procedures, and the priority accorded to fair dealing and equitable relationships among parties to provincial contracts. It was difficult to see any room for the co-existence of a power residing in other entities or persons within the provincial administration to do, without any reference whatsoever to the tender board, that which section 4(1) (a) and (b) empowers the tender board to do. That the tender board \\"acts on behalf of the province\\" in arranging to hire premises, or in concluding a lease, could not derogate from the fact that section 4(1) disables the province from acting autonomously in this regard. The mischief which the Act seeks to prevent was plain enough to the court: It is to eliminate patronage or worse in the awarding of contracts, to provide members of the public with opportunities to tender to fulfil provincial needs, and to ensure the fair, impartial and independent exercise of the power to award provincial contracts. If contracts were permitted to be concluded without any reference to the tender board, and without any resultant sanction of invalidity, the very mischief which the Act seeks to combat could be perpetuated. Accordingly, the court held that leases entered into by a department of the provincial government (as lessee) without the tender board's having arranged the hiring of the premises in terms of section 4(1) of the Act, are invalid.

Jungwirth placed third in the 1500 metres at the 1954 European Championships and set a world record for the same distance in 1957. Career Jungwirth started training seriously in 1949. By 1951 he was already a quality runner, clocking 3:48.8 for 1500 metres; Track and Field News ranked him No. 8 in the world that year. In 1952 he won the Czechoslovak championship at both 800 and 1500 metres and was selected to run the latter distance at the Olympics in Helsinki, where he survived the heats but went out in the semi-finals. Late in October 1952, he set a new world record at 1000 metres in Star√° Boleslav, running 2:21.2 to improve Olle √Öberg's time by 0.1 seconds. This record was broken less than ten months later by the United States' Mal Whitfield. Jungwirth continued improving and won his only international medal at the 1954 European Championships in Bern, where he placed third behind Roger Bannister and Gunnar Nielsen with a time of 3:45.4. At the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne he finished 6th in 3:42.6. On 12 July 1957 - again in Star√° Boleslav - Jungwirth ran 1500 metres in 3:38.1, breaking the world record of 3:40.2 set just the previous day by Finland's Olavi Salsola and Olavi Salonen. A week later in London, he became the first Czechoslovak to run a four-minute mile; however, his clocking of 3:59.1 was only good enough for third place while the winner, Derek Ibbotson, ran a new world record 3:57.2. Jungwirth suffered from health problems in 1958 and only placed 8th at the European Championships, even though his time of 3:44.4 was a second faster than his bronze medal performance in 1954. He lost his world record on 28 August 1958, when Australia's Herb Elliott ran 3:36.0 in G√∂teborg; Jungwirth himself placed second in that race in 3:39.0. Jungwirth's health problems continued in 1959 and 1960 and he was unable to take part in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He retired from athletics as a result. Track and Field News ranked Jungwirth in the world's top 10 at 1500 metres a total of seven times between 1951 and 1959, with a highest ranking of No. 3 in 1957.

She died at the age of 41 in 1987 after being abducted and interrogated by the South African security forces due to her role as a co-ordinator for Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). Kubheka's death was highly disputed during the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which South African Police officials originally claimed they were not responsible for her death. Her body was exhumed in May 1997, near KwaDukuza, revealing that Kubheka had died of gunshot wounds.TRC Final Report Volume 6 Section 4 Chapter 2  Disappearance  Kubheka lived in KwaMashu, a township north of Durban. She acted as a co-ordinator for externally and internally trained MK members living in KwaMashu. Wanting to obtain information on the arrival of four MK members from Swaziland, Vlakplaas police officers combined their resources with the Durban security branch to infiltrate Kubheka's network. Under the command of Captain Adriaan David Baker working with the Port Natal Security Branch, two C1/Vlakplaas askaris, Simon Radebe and Xola Frank ‚ÄòJimmy‚Äô Mbane, were tasked to make contact with her. Pretending to be MK members, they offered to help her accommodate activists from Swaziland. In May 1987, Mr Mbane drove Ms Kubheka to Battery Beach from where she was abducted by the Port Natal team. She was blindfolded, bound and taken to an abandoned shooting range at Winkelspruit, south of Durban. Still blindfolded, she was then subjected to interrogation by the Port Natal Security Branch. This team consisted of Colonel Andy Taylor, Captain Hentie Botha, Sergeant Laurance ‚ÄòLaurie‚Äô Wasserman, Sergeant Cassie van der Westhuizen, Joe Coetzer and Warrant Officer ‚ÄòBossie‚Äô Basson.TRC Special Report  Testimony  During amnesty hearings conducted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, contrasting details surrounding Kubheka's death were given by those involved in her death . Captain Botha stated the interrogation was conducted largely in Zulu by Colonel Taylor, during which he struck Ms Kubheka across the back with a sjambok. According to Captain Botha, this was not a severe assault but intended to convey the gravity of the situation and persuade her to co-operate with them. Captain Botha testified that the interrogation lasted approximately fifteen to twenty minutes and that Taylor struck her approximately ten to fifteen times with a sjambok. Sergeant van der Westhuizen's testimony suggests that the interrogation lasted an hour. Both of these accounts were disputed by Mbane who alleged that the interrogation lasted for approximately two hours, during which he could hear her screams of pain from outside. Botha and other applicants testified that, during the course of the interrogation, Ms Kubheka agreed to co-operate with them but that she suddenly died of a heart attack. They claimed she grabbed her chest and fell over, experiencing a heart attack due to her being overweight. Ms Kubheka's dead body was dumped near the Bhambayi informal settlement, some distance away from her home by Sergeants Wasserman and Salman Gerhardus du Preez. Captain Botha established that her family was unaware of her death and appeared to believe that she had gone into exile. It was subsequently rumoured that she had left the country for Mozambique because of the attentions of the Security Branch.  Exhumation  These claims of the details surrounding Kubheka's death were seriously challenged by Kubheka's family. IOL NewsThey contended that the police shot her in the head before dumping her body, which was confirmed following the exhumation of her body. The TRC's Investigative Unit exhumed remains believed to be Ms Kubheka's from a pauper's grave at Charlottedale Cemetery, KwaDukuza in May 1997. The applicants charged that the wrong body had been exhumed. In the post-mortem examination, a pathologist concluded that the remains matched those of Ntombi Kubheka. A spent 7.65mm bullet was found in the skull, indicating that she had been shot in the head. An attempt to use DNA testing from samples of bone and teeth failed as these had deteriorated and could not be used for DNA typing. The skull was sent to the University of Glasgow, which made a positive facial identification of the skull. Challenging these findings, the applicants demanded that another expert examine the skull. A report by the South African Police Service Forensic Science Laboratory in Pretoria further confirmed that the skull belonged to Ntombi Kubheka. The applicants did not challenge these conclusions, although they continued to contest the results of the investigation. The six members of the Port Natal Security Branch, Radebe and Baker applied for amnesty for their role in the abduction, death and subsequent disposal of the body of Ms Kubheka. Applicants Botha, Du Preez, Wasserman and Van de Westhuizen were refused amnesty for failing to make full disclosure. Colonel Taylor died before his amnesty hearing. Applicants Radebe and Baker, who had not been present during the interrogation or involved in the disposal of the body, were granted amnesty for her abduction. Mr Mbane did not apply for amnesty.

It was later transformed into a Renaissance ch√¢teau. The castle is constructed of brick, typical of the Dombes area. Origins The origin of Montribloud is uncertain. Some have derived the name of Montribloud from Mons terribilis (terrible mount) as the site of a battle in 197 BC between Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus to become Roman Emperor. Others suggest a Germanic origin, citing ancient transcriptions referring to \\"Montribloz, Montriblou, Montriblout\\".  Middle Ages  The first proven historical mention of Montribloud dates back to 1299. In 1313, Hugues Brun, canon of Lyon Cathedral, directed his heirs to build a monastery there. In fact, Humbert V, lord of Thoire-Villars, built a castle on a mound during the 1320s. On 21 February 1334, Humbert V paid homage to the Dauphin du Viennois for the \\"donjon\\" (keep) of Montribloud. Later, his son Humbert VI, did the same Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1355, following the joining of Dauphin√© to France. On 31 October 1384, Humbert VII of Thoire-Villars exchanged the territory of Beauvoir en Bugey with Eudes de Villars, seigneur of Montellier, his cousin, for the seigneurie of Montribloud including the parishes of Saint-Andr√©-de-Corcy, Civrieux, Bussiges and Saint-Marcel-en-Dombes. At the beginning of the 15th century, after the death without heirs of Eudes de Villars, Montribloud passed in 1418 to his grand-nephews, the sons of Jeanne de la Tour and of Jean de La Baume, Count of de Montrevel and Marshal of France. It remained in this powerful Baume-Montrevel family until Antoine, who sold it in 1590, to Martin and Jean de Covet, seigneurs of la Mure, rich merchant drapers originally from Bresse.  The Renaissance ch√¢teau  The Covets transformed the castle, surrounded with ditches, into a Renaissance residence with mullioned windows. On 8 August 1660, Antoine de Covet, marquis de Villars, had the barony of Montibould established in the county. Deeply in debt, his grandson Jean- Baptiste de Covet, was forced to sell the seigneurie of Montribloud to his creditor, Pierre Nicolau, alderman and treasurer of the town of Lyon. on 24 January 1754.  The ch√¢teau of the Nicolaus  Alexandre Bodin. Inheriting the ch√¢teau from his father, Christophe Nicolau engaged the celebrated Lyonnais urban architect Jean-Antoine Morand to rebuild the castle to his tastes. The mound was enlarged, the castle was given a neoclassical plan and a French formal garden was created. But, accused of having mixed his personal funds with those of the town of Lyon, he fled to Paris. His son, Antoine Nicolau, gave it to the Lyonnais banker Melchior Bodin in 1826. His son, Alexandre Bodin (1804-1893), who became d√©put√© for l'Ain and a member of the Corps L√©gislatif under the Second Empire), transformed the appearance of the castle by introducing slate roofs, according to the fashion of the time, and remodelled the gardens in the English landscape style. The present ch√¢teau has changed very little since then and still belongs to the Bodin family.  The ch√¢teau in the 21st century  The ch√¢teau is normally closed to the public. During European Heritage Days, the Bodin family open the ch√¢teau to visitors.  Sources  Guigue, Marie-Claude, Topographie historique du d√©partement de l'Ain, 1873.

Crombie says Deveson came up with the idea \\"because she had a personal interest in child abuse, baby-bashing we should call it, as opposed to sexual abuse... I think with her third child she had felt the impulse to injure the child. She was a young mother with three kids and it was all too much.

The research that Anne did was quite extraordinary: women admitting that they would literally lock themselves in a room to stop them getting to the kid. Pretty horrific stuff.\\" Anne Deveson said, \\"As a child Dianne was emotionally damaged, constantly criticized and frustrated, made to feel inadequate and insecure. She longs for society's and her mother's approval, tries too hard to be perfect. She gets by pretty well until a combination of stresses makes her erupt into violence against her third child.\\" Finance was obtained from Film Australia and Channel 9.

Cantab operates quantitative funds using computer models to drive investment decisions. As of Feb 2015 Cantab had $4.5 billion in assets under management, after launching with $30 million in 2006. The firm takes its name from Cantabrigia, the medieval Latin name for Cambridge. It is regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority. Cantab Capital Partners was acquired by GAM in 2016 and is since part of GAM Systematic.  Funds  Cantab's stated investment philosophy is that algorithmic trading can help to overcome cognitive biases inherent in human-based trading decisions, by exploiting persistent statistical relationships between markets. Taking a multi-asset, multi-model approach, the majority of Cantab's traded instruments are liquid futures and forwards, across currencies, fixed income, equity indices and commodities. Cantab manages two investment funds: the CCP Quantitative Programme (launched 2007, with $30m) and the CCP Core Macro Programme (launched 2013). Both are computer-based algorithmic trading systems, also known as automated trading, black-box trading, algo trading or systematic trading. In January 2013, Goldman Sachs became a minor investor in Cantab. Kirk is a former Goldman partner; Schlaikjer is a former Managing Director and European Chief Technology Officer of Goldman's Quantitative Strategies Group. Cantab is reported to have been granted access to Goldman's technology infrastructure.  Performance  At the end of December 2014 Cantab's leading fund, the CCP Quantitative Fund, had gained 39.3% over the previous 12 months. The fund gained 13 percent over January 2015 alone. These gains brought the fund to an annualized return of 11.38 percent since inception in March 2007; the Quantitative fund now has $3.5bn in assets under management. The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Cantab's 2014 results took place in the context of renewed investor interest in computer-traded funds and commodities-based funds.  Fee structure  Cantab‚Äôs Core Macro Programme is notable for its fee structure, charging a 0.5 per cent management fee and 10 per cent of profits. Industry-standard fees among hedge funds are often 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits. Although algorithm-based hedge funds tend to offer lower fees, made possible by their technological infrastructure, The New York Times reported that Cantab had \\"...lowered the fees to a point that not everybody can afford to do. Some industry experts, such as Robert Leonard of Credit Suisse, believe that such commission levels are unsustainable.  Employees  Cantab is largely staffed by mathematicians and scientists, many of whom have ties to nearby University of Cambridge. In a 2013 interview with the Financial Times, Kirk said ‚ÄúWe have made a commitment to investors that we have no plans to be bigger than 80 professionals.\\" Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information In 2015 Cantab donated ¬£5 million to launch the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information at Cambridge University. The research institute will use mathematical science techniques to analyse data for application in fields such as medicine, meteorology, urban planning and financial risk analysis. The Institute will have six lecturers and up to 18 Ph.D. students. The Institute was set-up in order to address the lack of philanthropic funding for data research, and to stimulate cutting-edge research in the area. In an interview with Pensions and Investments, Kirk said \\"...it is much easier to get funding for medical science or computer science [than for] more theoretical subjects like mathematics‚Äù. Kirk also characterised the donation as \\"philanthropic‚Äù and that the firm plans to keep its research in-house, while maintaining a \\"rewarding dialogue\\" with the Institute.

The program focuses on fashion trends, dining spots and social life, originally hosted by actress Angel Aquino, interior designer and model Daphne Ose√±a-Paez and journalist Cher Calvin. The trio became known as the F Girls. However, when Calvin left the show for the United States, supermodel Amanda Griffin joined the cast. History 1999: F's Beginning; Citiline's Replacement On April 17, 1999, lifestyle show Citiline, which was then hosted by Cory Quirino, had to move to the newly opened subsidiary of ABS-CBN which happened to be Studio 23. The management needed to fill the show's slot. That's when they formulated the show entitled F which focused on the life of a woman and lifestyle. It was planned to be hosted by Daphne Ose√±a-Paez, then working at the News and Current Affairs division, but ABS-CBN managed to add actress Angel Aquino and newcomer Cher Calvin to the hosts, where they became the trio called the F Girls. 2003‚Äì2006: Amanda is in; Cher is out In 2003, one of the original hosts of the show Cher Calvin leaves the country to pursue a broadcasting career in the United States. That leaves Aquino and Osena-Paez the original hosts. During the latter part of the year, the show welcomes supermodel Amanda Griffin as the replacement for Calvin. 2006: F's Farewell The show didn't last long because ratings started to slide. F aired its last episode on February 26, 2006 due to this cause. The F girls decided to part ways after 7 years of working together, bringing Filipino viewers a different view in lifestyle programming. However, Aquino didn't leave the hosting of lifestyle show as she hosted Us Girls with actresses Cheska Garcia and Iya Villania joining her as the main hosts. 2007‚Äì2009: Life after F: Future Plans After F ceased airing, the girls became successful in their careers. Angel Aquino became a successful actress and still continuing what she started at F as a lifestyle host. Cher Calvin became a journalist in the United States at KTLA-TV. Daphne Osena-Paez started her own business by selling furniture, became the host of lifestyle show Urban Zone in ABS-CBN and Amanda Griffin still continues being a model. 2009: Olay TV Reunion of F Girls after a decade In 2009, the F girls were reunited once again after 10 years of working together in F. They had interviews, photoshoots and even guest appearances on TV and radio. ABS-CBN executives decided that the original F girls would do a comeback special as they reminisce the days they had working again. The TV special was sponsored by Olay Total Effects Cream, which is also being advertised in the show.

The complexity is then reduced by the econometrician by a series of restrictions which are tested. One particular functional form, the error-correction model, is often arrived at when modelling time series. Denis Sargan and David Forbes Hendry (with his general-to-specific modeling) were key figures in the development of the approach and the one way the approach has been extended is through the work on integrated and cointegrated systems by Robert F. Engle, Clive Granger, and S√∏ren Johansen. Another commonly used functional form is distributed lag or autoregressive distributed lag. David F. Hendry is considered to be the principal architect of the LSE approach. The methodology is often referred to as general-to-specific modelling, \\"Gets modeling\\" or \\"Hendry's methodology\\". The software package OxMetrics implements this process via the PcGive module Autometrics In the 1970s, when the LSE approach was in its infancy, Edward E. Leamer was an early critic of model discovery methodologies. The approach evolved to include: multiple reduction path searches, indicator saturation, COMFAC testing, and cointegrated vector autoregressive structures. Economists often associated with \\"Hendry's methodology\\" include Clive Granger, Robert F. Engle, S√∏ren Johansen, Grayham Mizon, Jennifer Castle, Hans M. Krolzig, Neil Ericsson, and Jurgen Doornik. References  Category:Econometrics ","title":"LSE approach to econometrics"},{"id":"39410836","text":"Keita is a surname.

Bewick taught him wood-engraving, but discovered Johnson's talent for sketching in watercolour directly from nature. Life Born at Shotley Bridge, near Ovingham, Northumberland, he was son of a joiner and carpenter, who shortly afterwards removed to Gateshead. Through his mother, who was acquainted with Thomas Bewick, Johnson was in 1788 apprenticed to Ralph Beilby and Bewick in Newcastle, to learn copperplate- engraving. Johnson mainly occupied himself in sketching from nature in water- colours. On the expiration of his apprenticeship, he abandoned engraving, and took up painting. Johnson died at Kenmore, Perthshire, on 26 October 1796, in his twenty-sixth year. He was buried in Ovingham churchyard, where a monument was erected to his memory by his friends. Works Johnson made most of the drawings for Bewick's Fables. His drawings for William Bulmer's edition of Oliver Goldsmith's and Thomas Parnell's Poems were cut by Thomas and John Bewick, and published in 1795. A drawing by Johnson of Newcastle Cathedral was engraved in wood by Charlton Nesbit; Johnson made a small copperplate engraving from the same drawing for the publisher, Joseph Whitfield of Newcastle. Having fallen out with Whitfield, he engraved three caricatures of him. Johnson was employed by Messrs. Morison of Perth to copy the portraits by George Jamesone at Taymouth Castle, the seat of the Earl of Breadalbane, for reproduction in John Pinkerton's Iconographia Scotica. Two drawings by him were engraved by Charles Warren, as illustrations to John Gay's Fables and Ossian's Poems.

Early life and career  Yosef Mizrachi was born in Israel. After his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces, he worked in finance in New York City. In 1994, Mizrachi began dedicating himself to Orthodox Judaism outreach, and in 1997, Mizrachi left his professional career and began learning and teaching Torah at Yeshivat Ohr Yisrael in Monsey. Mizrachi discussed his Semikhah (rabbinical ordination) credentials in a January 9, 2016 radio interview with Zev Brenner. When asked if he has Semikhah, Mizrachi stated that he lacks such Semikhah which involves testing and is common among Synagogue rabbis. However, Mizrachi explained that he has received certification in recognition of his Torah background by Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Haim qualifying him to be a rabbi.  Kiruv work  Mizrachi founded a Kiruv organization in 1995. The organization provides free DVDs, Audio CDs, and MP3 CDs, sponsored by donors. As of 2013, the organization has handed out thousands of these audio and video disks. Mizrachi offers an extended ethical audio and video lecture series, called \\"The Path of the Just\\", (21 lectures √° c. 1h30min each) based on the musar text Mesillat Yesharim composed by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto. In 2001 Mizrachi opened a Kolel and a Yeshiva in Alfandari Street, Jerusalem. In 2002 Mizrahi and Yuval Ovadia produced a film titled Divine Information. In 2004, Mizrachi launched a website by that name, posting many of his video and audio lectures.  Controversies   Down syndrome and autism as punishment  In early 2014, before a lecture tour in London, concern was expressed about statements by Mizrachi in his previous lectures relating to the behaviour of secular and religious Jews during the Holocaust suggesting that Down Syndrome and autism are \\"punishments for sins committed in a previous life\\" and among others. Mizrachi was criticized for his views while he explicitly maintains are \\"Torah sourced.\\" As a result, at least one of his planned lectures in London was initially cancelled.  Holocaust revisionism  In December 2015, in one of his lectures, Mizrahi claimed that it is possible that only one million Jews died in The Holocaust as opposed to the well accepted figure of 6 million, since many of them were not Jewish according to Jewish law which requires a person's mother to be Jewish. His views also include lectures using Bible Codes to \\"explain\\" the Holocaust. Mizrahi was criticized by academics and Jewish leaders including Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, who said that he \\"made up history to suit an agenda.\\" He was also criticized by Berel Wein who stated that \\"It is too damaging a matter to be left unanswered and unrefuted.\\" Later Mizrahi issued an apology.  Pittsburgh synagogue shooting  After hearing a false report that the October 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting took place during a bris ceremony for the son of a gay couple, Mizrahi blamed the shooting on the allegedly sinful behavior of the congregation.  COVID-19 'treatment'  In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mizrachi claimed that blowing hot air from a hair dryer was a guaranteed cure for coronavirus.  Condemnation from other rabbis  In 2016, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis spoke out against the travel plans of this \\"Jewish hate preacher\\"; and the UK Home Office has suggested that the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, was considering banning Mizrachi should he apply to visit Britain. In March 2019, a planned visit by Mizrachi to the UK was canceled following reports that the Home Office was considering a ban on account of his track record of spreading hatred and extremism. Mizrachi went on to blame Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis - referring to him as \\"the number one most wicked person in the whole world\\", along with senior Sephardi rabbi Joseph Dweck, claiming that they are ‚Äúthe two friends, gay lovers, who do everything they can to promote homosexuality and destroy the Jewish nation from inside, destroy the Jewish community in England‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs going to bring a Holocaust on the Jews in England.‚Äù In December 2016, 16 prominent US rabbis issued an open letter about Mizrachi. They said that Mizrachi \\"reduce[s] complex issues to simplistic and misleading sound bites,\\" and his assertions are \\"objectionable, and even dangerous.\\" The letter continued that institutions should be more \\"discerning\\" with the guests they invite. In July 2020, a video from Mizrachi calling 14 prominent rabbis infidels was removed from social media platforms and prompted calls to have his videos removed more broadly from Jewish sites such as Torah Anytime for fear that it will incite violence. Rabbi Natan Slifkin one of the rabbis threatened in the video said, \\"We need to protest this hateful, potentially violence-inciting rhetoric.\\"  References   External links  * * Rabbi Yossi Mizrachi - on TorahAnytime.com Category:1968 births Category:Sephardi rabbis Category:Israeli emigrants to the United States Category:Israeli Orthodox rabbis Category:American Haredi rabbis Category:Living people ","title":"Yosef Mizrachi"},{"id":"39410904","text":"Paaske is a surname.

The museum displays objects which were common in the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and characterizes the way of life of the population of the village in those ancient times. The museum is organized according to the production cycles and experiences. It starts with the country house, which was the basis of all social structure, and then presents all the set of patent cores in the museum collection.  The country house  The country house is a unit composed by three elements: the built part, the productive complex and the family. People are identified by the house they own, which also defines the social status. The status implies obligations and duties, as well as obtained benefits on the use of what is common, such as water and wastelands.  The rural kitchen  In the country house, the kitchen is the place where all the family life happens. The kitchen can be a ground or a wooden compartment, forming a separated room. Here we can find the fireplace, receive who comes for a visit and prepare and have meals in family or with those who work for the house. In the fireplace the boilers with meat are kept and, in the oven, bread baking is weekly prepared. Around the fireplace, surrounded by heat and light, people spent the evenings, spinning linen or wool, while listening to songs and telling stories. The rural kitchen  The farmyard  Sometimes isolated, this home is structured to meet the needs of exploring the farm. It may consist of buildings arranged around a central space, patio, made up by housing, livestock, pigsty, chicken coop, rabbit hutches and stores where farm implements and crops are kept and where there is the mill, the winery and the distillery. The farmyard is the farming space, where are the oxen cars, the cereals cleaner, the seed drill and the agricultural implements. left  The linen cycle  The linen should be sown in March, in the beginning of the Spring season. In the Summer, the harvest is done ‚Äì people pull out the linen, to make good use the textile fiber, which is found in the stalk. Then, we must hackle the linen, which consist of taking of the seed with the ‚Äúripo‚Äù (a comb made of iron). The next action is to soak ‚Äì the linen stays for two weeks in current but not very strong water. Then, it will dry in a previously cut and cleaned field. The linen balls are placed on the field. Once dry, the linen is scutched. This action is made in ‚Äúespadeladouro‚Äù, with a flax-comb (a wooden board and a hive (cylinder made of cork). The purpose is to separate the fibres. The linters are taken out (rough, thick and short fibre, which is also used to make some kind cloth, like mattress liners, kitchen rags and flour sacs). The fibre that remains, after the separation of the linters, is put in a machine, which repeatedly tramples the linen in the river. The linen can also be made with a maul. In this way the linen is squeezed. Now it is time to go to the next step, which consists of putting the fibre that remained in a machine that softens the linen and makes it glossy, separating the linen from the cotton waste (that remains trapped inside the machine making the linen become finer). The linen is now ready to be sharpened. For its spinning, the distaff and the spinning wheel are used, turning the fibre into thread. Loom  The craftsmanships   The blacksmith  One of the most popular crafts in Lavra was blacksmithing craft. Nowadays, there are few blacksmiths who still work with traditional forge and are usually old people. This craftsmanship, as most of the offices in the old times, was transmitted from parents to children. It was an activity that was perpetuated in the family with obvious advantages: there were workshops and tools, requiring no additional investments. Only the art of knowing how to do... Nowadays, that art is a thing of the past as industrialization has replaced the small craftsmanship.  The miller  The cereal mill, another structure once essential and widely used in Lavra, was generally of collective use and was near a watercourse, as for example, near the rio Onda. Fishing Fishing is another traditional activity strongly established in Lavra. As a complement to the agricultural activity, the people of the household participated in this activity, either directly or indirectly: the fishermen, the gulfweeth gatherer, the carters, jobs done by women and other family members. This was a very strong religious activity.

He was noted as a wood carver, a skill he had learned in his native city, which had also produced the carver and sculptor, Andrea Brustolon, and the contemporary rival of Bortotti, Valentino Panciera Besarel. Bortotti was sought after for his carved frames, caskets, and other woodwork. Some of his frames were themselves displayed and awarded at expositions. For many years, Bortotti was mainly dedicated to sculpture, and the 1881 exhibition of Fine Arts in Milan he displayed: The Rape (ratto) of the Venetian Brides.

Description The Harlingen lighthouse is in the center of the Harlingen docks. The same site has been used for at least two earlier lighthouses. A square tower on a fortress was built around 1750 and demolished in 1872. A hexagonal red wooden tower with white bands was operated between 1904 and 1921. The current lighthouse was designed by architect C. Jelsma and built between 1920 and 1922. The highest point is above mean high water. The tower is square, built of stone and steel. The beacon has an Art Deco design. It came into service in 1922, and the light was finally extinguished in 1998. Harlingen lighthouse was part of a network of twenty lights along the Dutch coast, eighteen of which remain operational. The channels and harbor mouth had been adjusted so that this lighthouse was no longer needed. Between 1998 and 1999 the lighthouse was restored by architect B. Pietersma. The lighthouse is now privately owned and provides a single hotel suite on three levels that can accommodate two people.

This article discusses the first hearing of this matter in the Cape Provincial Division. The final judgment is listed on SAFLII as Minister of Health and Another v New Clicks South Africa (Pty) Ltd and Others (CCT 59/2004) [2005] ZACC 14.http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2005/14.html  Facts  The applicants sought the review and setting aside of a recommendation made by the Pricing Committee, and of regulations made pursuant to the Medicines and Related Substances Act.Act 101 of 1965. The regulations dealt with a new pricing system for medicines in South Africa, as well as dispensing fees and wholesale pricing. The Pricing Committee had taken representations on behalf of interested parties. After this process, it made recommendations to the first respondent in the form of draft regulations. These were then published as final regulations.  Judgment  The first question before the court was whether or not the conduct of the Pricing Committee constituted administrative action. Yekiso J, for the majority, began his analysis as follows: > For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to constitute an administrative > action as against the applicants, there ought to exist an administrative law > relationship based on authoritative power. This relationship encompasses an > element of subordination on the object of such administrative law > relationship which, in the instance of these proceedings, ought to be the > applicants. Use of the authoritative power presupposes the administrative > law relationship between the organ of state, as the subject of the > administrative law relationship and the object, which could either be an > individual or a group of individuals as the objects of such > relationship.Para 30.Footnote omitted. Yekiso J then referred to section 33 of the Constitution and the definition section of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA) and continued as follows: > In terms of this definition conduct, in order to constitute administrative > action as defined, has to have a direct, external legal effect and has to > adversely affect rights of the individual or a group. On the face of it, it > would appear that the definition of administrative action in section 1 of > the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act limits the scope of > administrative action in section 33 of the Constitution. Whether such > limitation conforms to the requirements of the limitation clause in section > 36 of the Constitution and thus passes muster, does not call for > determination in these proceedings. From this definition, the following > elements of the term administrative action emerge, namely: > * a decision > * that is of an administrative nature > * made in terms of the empowering provision > * that is not specifically excluded by the Act > * that adversely affects rights and > * that has a direct, external legal effect. > For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to be subject to review in terms of > section 6 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act it has to embody > all the elements enumerated in the preceding paragraph failing which the > conduct complained of cannot be subject to review in terms of the Promotion > of Just Administrative Act. If the conduct of the Pricing Committee does not > fall within the ambit of the definition of administrative action contained > in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, the issue which > will then call for determination is whether the conduct of the Pricing > Committee is beyond judicial review. All these issues will be determined in > the course of this judgment. To revert to the Pricing Committee, it will be > recalled that it is a committee that was appointed and established in terms > of section 22G(1) of the Act. Its mandate was to formulate recommendations > which, if accepted, would enable the first respondent to make regulations > relating to the introduction of a transparent pricing system for all > medicines and Scheduled substances sold in the Republic and, on an > appropriate dispensing fee to be charged by a pharmacist or by a person > licensed in terms of section 22G(1)(a) of the Act. In line with its mandate > the committee did formulate the required recommendations which it submitted > to the first respondent for acceptance. It was for the first respondent to > either accept or reject the recommendations as formulated. It is these > recommendations which are the subject of a challenge by the applicants on > the basis that the conduct of the Pricing Committee, in going about > fulfilling its functions in the formulation of the recommendations, > constitutes an administrative action within the meaning of the term as > contemplated in section 1 of the Promotion of Just Administrative Act. > For the conduct of the Pricing Committee to constitute an administrative > action within the meaning of that term in terms of the Promotion of > Administrative Justice Act, not only should it fall within the ambit of that > definition, but, at the very least, it will have to contain those elements I > have set out in paragraph [35] of this judgment. The most important of these > elements are, in my view, that the recommendations should adversely affect > rights and should have a direct external legal effect. I venture to suggest > at this stage that such conduct or action should affect the rights of the > person concerned directly rather than indirectly. Once the recommendations > were formulated and submitted to the first respondent for acceptance, at > that stage, that is prior to acceptance thereof by the first respondent, > they did not affect any one of the applicants' existing rights or legitimate > expectations directly. Such recommendations did not have any force or effect > on any one of the applicants. These were mere recommendations. They were not > binding on the applicants and thus could not be construed as having had any > direct, external legal effect. The applicants did not feel any effect of the > recommendations. > The recommendations, prior to the acceptance thereof by the first > respondent, did not impose any burden on the applicants nor did they, at > that stage, remove rights from any one of the applicants. Even if one were > to accept that the Pricing Committee is an organ of state, in my view, it > can hardly be conceivable that the formulation of the recommendations which > can only have a final effect once promulgated into regulation could be said > to constitute exercise of public power. The direct, legal effect > contemplated in the definition of administrative action cannot be > conditional, in the sense of pending acceptance by the first respondent. In > my view, and on the grounds set out in this and the preceding paragraph > alone, the conduct and the activities of the Pricing Committee can hardly be > construed as constituting an administrative action nor do such activities > fall within the ambit of the definition of administrative action as defined > in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. Furthermore, > for the activities of the Pricing Committee to constitute administrative > action, such conduct, in terms of the definition of administrative action, > should have, in as far as the applicants are concerned, a \\"direct legal > effect.\\" For any action to have a direct effect, it obviously must affect > the person concerned directly rather than indirectly. Some writers, in > particular, de Ville are of the view that direct effect requires finality in > the administration of rights, which would exclude preliminary steps in > multi-staged decisions. This would include the making of reports prior to > decisions and any conduct preparatory to the taking of a decision. As > regards the term legal effect, what this in my view would entail to is that > the administrative action or decision must be a legally binding > determination of individual rights. In other words, the recommendations, to > constitute an administrative action, must either establish, change or > withdraw existing rights. The recommendations of the Committee do not have > any of these attributes. The principles of administrative justice apply to > administrative action only and the Committee's recommendations fall short of > this. > To the extent that the applicants seek to have the recommendations to be > reviewed and set aside in terms of the provisions of the Promotion of > Administrative Justice Act, the applicants' challenge on this ground cannot > succeed for the simple reason that the conduct of the Committee, culminating > in the recommendations, does not constitute an administrative action within > the meaning of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act.Paras 34-43. Having found, however, that the recommendation could not be reviewed in terms of PAJA, Yekiso J held that the recommendation was nevertheless reviewable in terms of the common law and section 33 of the Constitution.Para 44. He then turned to consider whether the passing of the regulations themselves fell under the definition section of the PAJA: > The making of regulations, which clearly is a legislative administrative > action, as against judicial and pure administrative action, is not > specifically referred to in the definition of the term \\"decision\\" in section > 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. Could it therefore be said > that \\"rule making\\" was deliberately left out of the definition of the term > \\"decision\\" and if so, whether it was the intention of the legislature not to > include \\"rule making\\" in the definition of administrative action? The making > of regulations, the subsequent promulgation and the enforcement of such > regulations govern the general administrative law relationship as against > the individual administrative law relationship. The former is what would > constitute \\"administrative action affecting the public\\" as contemplated in > section 4 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. This obviously > would entail the making and promulgation of such regulation by following the > procedure as provided for in section 4(1) of the Promotion of Administrative > Justice Act. Following the procedure as laid down in section 4(1) of the > Promotion of Administrative Justice Act would obviously be preceded by a > decision to follow that procedure. A decision to follow that procedure would > constitute a decision taken in terms of section 4(1) of the Promotion of > Administrative Justice Act. Now, the taking of a decision or failure to take > a decision in terms of section 4(1) has been specifically excluded from the > definition of the administrative action. > Could it be that the omission to refer to legislative administrative action > in the definition of the term \\"decision\\" in section 1, and the specific > exclusion of taking a decision or failure to take a decision in terms of > section 4(1), is a pointer or an indication of an intention to exclude \\"rule > making\\" from the ambit of administrative action? In my view the legislature > could not have intended otherwise. In short, my view is that it was not the > intention of the legislature to include rule making in the definition of and > in the ambit of administrative action as defined in section 1 of the > Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. To the extent that rule making > could be construed as the implementation of national legislation as > contemplated in section 85(2)(a) of the Constitution, the latter section of > the Constitution provides \\"in implementing national legislation except where > the Constitution or an Act of Parliament provides otherwise\\". In the > instance of this matter the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, which > is an Act of Parliament, provides otherwise. > Once again, I must re-iterate, the fact that rule making does not constitute > administrative action, does not render the regulations themselves to be > beyond judicial scrutiny. The regulations are subject to review on the basis > of the principle of legality, the principles of common law to the extent > such common law principles are not inconsistent with the Constitution, the > provisions of section 33(1) of the Constitution and other relevant > provisions of the Constitution. I am making these observations mindful of > what was said by the Constitutional Court in Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of > SA and Another: In Re Ex Parte President of the Republic of South Africa and > Others that the control of public power is always a constitutional > matter.Paras 48-50. Yekiso J considered this question later in the judgment and said as follows: > I have already determined in paragraph [49] of this judgment that the > Regulations do not constitute an administrative act within the meaning of > the term as defined in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice > Act. I made this determination well aware of the remarks by O'Regan J in > Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v The Minister of Environmental Affairs and > Tourism and Others where the learned Justice said: > \\"The grundnorm of administrative law is now to be found in the first place > not in the doctrine of ultra vires, nor in the doctrine of parliamentary > sovereignty nor in the common law itself, but in the principles of our > Constitution. The common law informs the principles of Paja and the > Constitution and derives its force from the latter. The extent to which the > common law remains relevant to administrative review will have to be > developed on a case by case basis as the courts interpret and apply the > provisions of PAJA and the Constitution.\\" > I made this determination also well aware of the remarks by the > Constitutional Court in Minister of Home Affairs v Eisenberg [2003 (8) BCLR > 838 (CC) at paras 52 and 53] that, in that matter, it was not necessary to > consider causes of action for judicial review of administrative action that > do not fall within the scope of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. > The Regulations which are the subject of this review, as I have already > determined, do not fall within the scope of the Promotion of Administrative > Justice Act. I re-iterate that the Regulations in question are susceptible > to review on the basis of the principle of legality and other provisions of > the Constitution in particular, the administrative justice clause.Para 69. In a minority judgment, Traverso DJP also considered whether the recommendations and the regulations constituted administrative action. Unlike Yekiso J, Traverso DJP found that the recommendation did constitute administrative action within the definition section of the PAJA. She reasoned as follows: > One of the issues raised is whether the making of recommendations by the > Pricing Committee is reviewable under PAJA. [Counsel for the first > respondent] submitted that the recommendation of the pricing committee is > not reviewable because it is neither an \\"administrative action\\" nor a > \\"decision\\" as defined in PAJA. He argued that the \\"recommendation\\" of the > Pricing Committee is purely advisory in nature, and therefore does not fall > within the definition of a decision as contained in Section 1(v) of PAJA. I > agree with [counsel for the first respondent] that the recommendation of the > Pricing Committee is not covered by those \\"decisions\\" listed in Section > 1(v)(a)-(f) of PAJA. Section 1(v)(g) is more problematical. Its wording is > much wider and it is a typical \\"catch all\\" provision. [Counsel for the first > respondent] however argued that the words \\"any other act ... of an > administrative nature\\" should be interpreted restrictively and with > reference to the kinds of decisions listed in paragraphs 1(v)(a)-(f). For > this submission he relied on the ejusdem generis principle, as there is a > distinct genus of decisions listed under this definition. I cannot agree. > Firstly the wording of this sub-section makes it plain that the actions > listed in Section 1(v)(a)-(g) are not exhaustive. This was conceded by > [counsel for the first respondent]. Secondly, there is nothing in the > wording of Section 1(v)(g) which indicates that the words \\"any other act or > thing of an administrative nature\\" refers to only acts or things belonging > to a certain \\"genus\\". PAJA was specifically enacted to give effect to the > constitutional right of citizens to just administrative action. This relates > to all forms of administrative action and not just a restrictive \\"genus\\" of > acts of an administrative nature. (See Pharmaceutical Manufacturers > Association of SA: Ex parte President of the Republic of South Africa, > 2000(2) SA 674 CC; JR de Ville: Judicial Review of Administrative Action in > South Africa at p. 39.) > The Pricing Committee was appointed to make recommendations. As I will show > later it is not in dispute that these recommendations are a jurisdictional > prerequisite for the making of recommendations. It is in my view clear that > the recommendations could adversely affect not only the rights of members of > the pharmaceutical industry but also the rights of consumers, and therefore > the public at large. When the Committee considered the public comment in > formulating their recommendations they were clearly performing a function > which was of an administrative nature. I am therefore satisfied that the > word \\"decision\\" does not have the narrow meaning contended for by the > Respondents. > The next point to consider is whether the recommendations of the Pricing > Committee would have a \\"direct external legal effect\\". From the wording of > Section 22G(2), it is clear that the making of a recommendation by the > Committee is a specific and separate requirement for the making of the > regulations, because it is only upon the recommendation of the Pricing > Committee that the Minister can make the Regulations. That being so, and for > the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, it follows that the > recommendations must ultimately have a direct external legal effect. These > recommendations are not mere preliminary determinations, investigative > actions or intermediate steps, which the legislature intended to exclude > from the definition of administrative action. (See Currie & Klaaren: > Promotion of Administrative Justice Act Benchbook at 44-45) On the contrary > the recommendations are upon promulgation transformed into the regulations > [....] I am [...] satisfied that a valid recommendation by the Pricing > Committee is a jurisdictional requirement for valid regulations. Valid > recommendations entail at least 3 elements: > (a) A recommendation made by the Pricing Committee, and not by any other > person or entity; > (b) A fair procedure must be adopted and sustained by the Pricing Committee > in its meetings; > (c) A proper application of the mind by a duly constituted Pricing Committee > to all representations made to it. > These are in my view all matters which fall squarely within the definition > contained in Section 1(v)(g) namely \\"any other act of an administrative > nature\\".Paras 25-40. Traverso DJP then turned to the question of whether or not the passing of the regulations also constituted administrative action within the definition as provided by the AJA. She wrote, (para 44‚Äî58) > PAJA excludes the executive powers and functions of the National Executive > under Section 85(2)(b)-(e) of the Constitution from the definition of > administrative action. It is however important to note that the powers and > functions of the National Executive under Section 85(2)(a) of the > Constitution are not excluded. They are: > \\"85(2) The President exercises the executive authority, together with other > members of the Cabinet by‚Äî > (a) implementing national legislation ...\\" > The implementation of national legislation therefore falls under the > definition of administrative action. In my view this provides a strong > indication that the making of Regulations falls within the definition of > administrative action as contained in PAJA. Section 33(1) of the > Constitution provides that everyone has the right to administrative action > that is lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair. Section 33(3) provides > that national legislation must be enacted to give effect to those rights. If > the definition of administrative action in PAJA has to be given the narrow > meaning contended for on behalf of the First Respondent, it would in my view > follow that PAJA will not pass constitutional muster as it will then not > give effect to Section 33(1) of the Constitution. It would rather than give > effect to the Bill of Rights, and in particular to Section 33 thereof, limit > an individual's right to lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair > administrative action. Such an interpretation must be avoided in favour of > one which conforms to the Constitution. See National Director of Public > Prosecutions v. Mohamed N.O, 2002 (4) SA 843 CC at 856 A-C. I therefore > conclude that both the recommendations and the Regulations are subject to > judicial review. The grounds of judicial review have now been codified by > Section 6 of PAJA, and therefore if PAJA applies to the Regulations the > review grounds must be located within Section 6 of PAJA (Bato Star Fishing > (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 2004 (7) BCLR 687 > CC at 705 B-D). But as I have stated before, even if I am wrong in my > conclusion that PAJA applies to the rule-making, then the Regulations may be > challenged on the basis of the conventional grounds under the Constitution > referred to above.

The Amarda Road airstrip, as it was called in war terminology, spreads across an area of nearly 600 acres. Built in the 1940s at a cost of Rs 3 crore, it was eventually abandoned after the war. It was probably named as Amarda Road Airfield because of the nearby Amarda Road railway station. The airfield was used by No. 136 Squadron RAF,Jacobs, Vivian K. The Woodpecker Story. Durham, UK: The Pentland Press Ltd., 1994. . 1994, p. 156. No. 177 Squadron RAF and No. 607 Squadron RAF. The 'Air Fighting Training Unit', formed in February 1943, was also based here. As an airfield, Amarda Road fell on the supply route for the Nationalist Armies of China in their fight against the Japanese. Aircraft of the RAF and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) would regularly fly from this space to China via Chabua (Dibrugarh), Jorhat and Vijaynagar across the infamous hump route over Arunachal and East Tibet. Amarda Road and other neighbouring airfields - Dhalbhumgarh, Dudhkundi, Salua, Digri, Salbani and Chakulia - formed a web of airfields created by the Allies to stop the impending Japanese advance in the east. During the war, Amarda Road was, to put it simply, a battle hub. After the war was over, most airfields, including this one, fell into disuse. Today, only the Kalaikunda airstrip, which was declared an Air Force Station in 1954, exists. Seven decades after the base was built, the concrete runway is still intact, though the buildings that once cluttered the edges are gone.

Sofia Giatsintova, the People's Artist of the USSR (1955), received the USSR State Prize (1947, for her part of Varvara Mikhaylovna in the film The Vow, 1946), as well as numerous state awards, among them the Order of Lenin (1965, 1975). She is the author of the book of memoirs Alone With Memories (–° –ø–∞–º—è—Ç—å—é –Ω–∞–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ, 1985). Biography Sofya Giatsintova was born in 1895 to a noble family from Moscow. Her father Vladimir Giatsintov was the Moscow University professor; after 1914 he became the director of the Moscow University Fine Arts museum. Her mother Elizaveta Alexeyevna Giatsintova (n√©e Vekstern) was connected to the renowned Chaadayev family. Sofia remembered her childhood as a happy one. The family adored theatre; Vladimir Giatsintov was a member of the Moscow Shakespearean Society and an amateur playwright. Even as a gymnasium student Sofia decided she'd be an actress and started to take lessons from Elena Muratova, the actress of the Moscow Art Theatre, and in summer 1910 joined its troupe. In MAT Giatsintova became part of the active group of young actors, among them Evgeny Vakhtangov, Mikhail Chekhov, Serafima Birman, which soon became known as the MAT's First Studio and later Second Moscow Art Theatre. Among her best known parts there were those of Maria in Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night (1917, 1933), Sima (Crank, by Alexander Afinogenov, 1929), Nelly (Humiliated and Insulted by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, 1932). In 1924 she married Ivan Bersenev, the theatre's actor and later artistic director. In 1936, as MAT 2 closed, Giatsintova (along with Bersenev and Birman) moved to the Lenkom Theatre which she became the head of in 1952. In 1946 Giatsintova starred in Mikhail Chiaureli's The Vow as Varvara Petrovna, a woman who travels to Moscow on foot to give the beloved Vladimir Ilyich Lenin the letter written by common people, only to find that the great revolutionary leader has just died. She finds herself on the Red Square and gives the letter to Iosif Stalin instead, right after he's proclaimed his allegiance to the Lenin's cause, speaking at the funeral. The film brought Giatsintova the Stalin Prize, but hasn't been seen much of after the Soviet dictator's death in 1953. In 1955 Giatsintova was honoured with the title People's Artist of the USSR. Her acclaimed book of memoirs Alone With Memories (–° –ø–∞–º—è—Ç—å—é –Ω–∞–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ) came out in 1985. Sofia Giatsintova died on April 12, 1982, in Moscow. She is interred in Novodevichye Cemetery.

ADGB Trade Union School, Bernau Retrieved 17 April 2019 In Meyer and Wittwer's building theory classes students were taught to scientifically analyse both the client's requirements and the site conditions. Students carried out environmental studies at the site, such as how the sunlight entering the buildings would change during the day. The buildings were designed to fit the topography of the site, the client's needs and to facilitate social interaction. In keeping with the Bauhaus philosophy of teaching via practical experience and working with industry, a number of students from the building theory course were involved in the project, including Arieh Sharon, Konrad P√ºschel, , Lotte Stam-Beese, and Edmund Collein. As well as giving the students training in draughting and project management, it also gave them experience with the practical aspects of building, such as brick laying, painting and laying concrete. Following Meyer's socialist principles, this had the aim of encouraging close interaction between the students and the building site workers. \\"Meyer‚Äôs was a holistic approach to architecture, making no distinction between masters and students, or site managers and skilled tradesmen.\\"  Design  Dining room, ADGB Trade Union School The complex was designed to fit harmoniously with the natural environment. The buildings are organised on the sloping, wooded site in a rational sequence, based on usage. The buildings are built in reinforced concrete, with load-bearing masonry block walls with yellow brick cladding.Markgraf, Monika (ed.) (2017) Bauhaus World Heritage Site. Leipzig: Spector Books Throughout the complex, the design of the windows, often large floor-to-ceiling in style which take advantage of the outdoor views, characterise the interiors, following on from the careful site analysis that was done as part of the design process. Unlike Walter Gropius‚Äô Bauhaus Dessau building, which was designed entirely for visual and symbolic effect and could become a \\"sweatbox\\" in summer due to its large glass surfaces, the ADGB school was designed to avoid overheating by taking into account the sun's movement and changing angles. The two-storey entrance building contains the foyer, auditorium, dining room, kitchen and administration area on the ground floor. There is a caretakers flat on the top floor. The appearance of the entrance was changed in the 1950s and these alterations were left in place in the 2003-2007 restoration. A long, glazed corridor runs from the entrance building, linking five three-storey blocks, four of which house the trainees' halls of residence; the fifth provides communal space. At the end of the corridor is a two-storey building which has a gymnasium on the ground floor and seminar rooms above. The library is in a one-storey building in front of this. The four residential blocks have distinct interior colour schemes, respectively blue, green, yellow and red. In each block the colours get lighter as the buildings get higher on each of the three floors.Sokol, David. \\"An Architectural Gem in Germany is Reborn, Architectural Record, 13 August 2008. Retrieved 21 June 2013 This was done to help navigation, as trainees were usually only there on short courses and didn't have much time to orientate themselves. The colours could also be used to group teams together for sports and other activities. There are also four teachers' residences and two one-storey semi-detached houses. Paths around the complex were designed to encourage trainees and teachers to get to know each other as they walked between the living and teaching areas of the school. The architectural historian Winfried Nerdinger described it as a \\"masterpiece of poetic functionalism\\".  Interior furnishings  ADGB Trade Union School, glass corridor, 1928-1930 Meyer wanted to draw in skills and ideas from every Bauhaus workshop, not just the building theory course. Students involved in the interior design of the ADGB Trade Union School came from the weaving, carpentry and metalwork workshops, including: (1906 - 1964), who studied under Marcel Breuer in the carpentry workshop and later became an architect, designed most of the furniture for the project.

Until the end of World War II the site was used by the Reich Leadership School, for training leaders of the SS (Schutzstaffel), SD (Sicherheitsdienst) and Gestapo. At the end of World War II, in spring 1945, the site was in the Soviet Occupation Zone. The Soviet Army used it as a temporary hospital and for military housing. In spring 1946 the building was given to the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB), an East German organisation. During the Nazi period and the Russian occupation the school had been extensively damaged, so long term repair work began. In 1947 the school opened under the name FDGB-Bundesschule \\"Theodor Leipart\\" (Theodor Leipart FDGB Trade Union School). In January 1952 it was renamed again as the Gewerkschaftshochschule \\"Fritz Heckert\\" (Fritz Heckert Trade Union College). In the early 1950s the architect Georg Waterstadt was contracted to build a second large building on the site to extend the FDGB school. This newer building sits parallel to the forest clearing and is clad in a darker brick than the Meyer/Wittwer complex. Waterstadt aimed to respect the original complex with his building which is also functionalist in style, and uses glass corridors. However, he also made major changes to the Meyer/Wittwer building itself, including changing the entrance building.Richter, Wolfgang (12 April 2002) F√ºnftes Leben f√ºr Bauhaus-Denkmal in Neues Deutschland.

The property of the former FDGB was initially managed by an asset management company which temporarily leased the complex to various organisations. From August 1991 it was leased long term to the State of Brandenburg for use as a school of public administration, which opened in January 1992 following renovation work. In 1996 the state government took over the complex and it remained vacant for sometime. In 2001 the Handwerkskammer Berlin (Berlin Chamber of Skilled Crafts) sub-leased the main historic building of the complex, the Meyer-Wittwer-Bau (Meyer Wittwer Building) to use as a training centre. The centre, known in German as the Internat des Bildungszentrums der Handwerkskammer Berlin, has been in operation since 2007 when the major renovation project was completed.  Restoration  Rebuilt wintergarden pavilion extension to the dining room. In January 2001 the new lease holders, the Berlin Chamber of Skilled Crafts (Handwerkskammer Berlin), made a European-wide call for tenders for a redevelopment project, to restore Hannes Meyer's original architecture and to enable to building to be usable as a modern teaching facility. There were 102 responses with the contract awarded to Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten in July 2001. The first phase of construction was started in February 2003. In early 2005, the work in the foyer and the dormitories was completed. The second phase was completed 2007. The school building was almost completely restored to its original state, although the 1950s entrance has been retained. In 2008 the architects, Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten, won the World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism prize for the restoration. The prize is now given every two years, but this was the first time that it had been awarded.

Kahane maintained the view that the majority of Arabs living in Israel are enemies of Jews and Israel itself, and believed that a Jewish theocratic state, where non-Jews have no voting rights, should be created.: \\"Any non-Jew, including the Arabs, can have the status of a foreign resident in Israel if he accepts the law of the Halacha. I don‚Äôt differentiate between Arabs and non- Arabs. The only difference I make is between Jews and non-Jews. If a non-Jew wants to live here, he must agree to be a foreign resident, be he Arab or not. He does not have and cannot have national rights in Israel. He can have civil rights, social rights, but he cannot be a citizen; he won‚Äôt have the right to vote. Again, whether he‚Äôs Arab or not.\\" The Kach party has been banned by the Israeli government and the U.S. State Department has labeled it a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Ideology The term Kahanism has come to denote the controversial positions espoused by Rabbi Meir Kahane. Kahane's positions spanned a broad range of subjects. * Aliyah: Kahane believed that every Jew should live in Israel. * Anti-Semitism: Kahane believed that anti-Semitism should be fought immediately and by all means necessary. * Democracy: Kahane wrote that democracy was the best form of government for those who lacked a divine truth and a standard of good and evil. * Hate and Violence: Kahane believed that hate and violence were terrible, but terribly necessary at the right time and place. * Holocaust: Kahane felt that the history of the Holocaust should be taught to youth with all of the lessons that it implied, including the need to fight spiritual assimilation, the need to physically defend the Jewish people and the importance of leaving what he termed \\"the Exile\\". * Israel: Kahane proposed that the State of Israel should enforce Jewish law, as codified by Maimonides, under which non-Jews who wish to dwell in Israel would have three options: remain as \\"resident strangers\\" with all rights but national ones, which would require non-Jews to accept resident- stranger status with all rights but political ones. Those who are unwilling to accept such a status will be required to leave the country with full compensation and, those who refuse to do even that, will be forcefully removed. * Judaism: Kahane stressed that Jewish is beautiful. He felt that the Reform and Conservative movements have been the leading causes of assimilation due to their discontinuation of the belief in mass Revelation as the cornerstone of Jewish theology. * Love of Fellow Jews: Kahane emphasized the importance of loving Jews and the willingness to sacrifice for Jewish brothers. * Pride: Kahane felt that Jews should embrace pride in their heritage and tradition. * Respect: Kahane stated that there is nothing more important than respect and he added that only one who respects himself can end up respecting others. * Torah: Kahane wrote that every Jew should have enough Torah knowledge to be a qualified rabbi. * Unity: Kahane felt that Jewish unity was of the utmost importance, and he believed that everything should be done in order to avoid a Jewish civil war. The central claim of Kahanism is the belief that the vast majority of the Arabs of Israel are now, and they will continue to be, enemies of Jews and Israel itself, and that a Jewish theocratic state, governed by Halakha, absent of a voting non-Jewish population that includes Israel, Palestine, areas of modern-day Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, should be created.: \\"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern Sinai, including Yamit. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the Jordan river, hence part of what is now Jordan. Eretz Yisrael also includes part of Lebanon, and certain parts of Syria, and part of Iraq, all the way to the Tigris river.\\" According to Kahane, the term \\"Kahanism\\" is primarily used by those who are ignorant of Torah Judaism in order to discredit his ideology, which he asserted is rooted in Halakha and the same as Torah Judaism.: \\"I am committed to Judaism and real Jewish values, and every word in this book ‚Äì disagreeable as it may be to most ‚Äì is Judaism.\\" \\"Meir Kahane did not hate the Arabs ‚Äì he just loved the Jews\\", said his widow Libby in her November 20, 2010 TV interview.Special: Meir Kahane's widow regrets Rabin murder (Heb: ◊û◊ô◊ï◊ó◊ì: ◊ê◊ú◊û◊†◊™◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊û◊ê◊ô◊® ◊õ◊î◊†◊ê ◊û◊°◊™◊ô◊ô◊í◊™ ◊û◊®◊¶◊ó ◊®◊ë◊ô◊ü), Channel 10 (Israel), November 20, 2010 Criticism and legal action Since 1985, the Israeli government has outlawed political parties espousing Kahane's ideology as being \\"racist\\", and it forbids their participation in the Israeli government.

Notable kahanist terrorists  Baruch Goldstein The deadliest Jewish terrorist attack occurred when Dr. Baruch Goldstein, supporter of Kach, shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers, and wounded another 150, at the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in Hebron, in 1994. This was described as a case of Jewish religious terrorism by Mark Juergensmeyer. Goldstein was a medical doctor who grew up in Brooklyn and he was educated at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. He resettled in the Kiryat Arba settlement in the West Bank, and he was politically active for years ‚Äì he saw Rabbi Meir Kahane as a hero, and he was Kahane's campaign manager when he ran for the Israeli parliament through Kahane's Kach party. When Goldstein was threatened with a court-martial for refusing to treat non-Jewish soldiers in the Israeli Defence Force, he declared: \\"I am not willing to treat any non-Jew. I recognize as legitimate only two religious authorities: Maimonides and Kahane.\\"Arych Kizel in Yediot Aharonot, 1 March 1994. Goldstein was denounced \\"with shocked horror\\" by Orthodox Jews,The ethics of war in Asian civilizations: a comparative perspective By Torkel Brekke, Routledge, 2006, p.44 and most Israelis denounced Goldstein as insane. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin condemned the attack, describing Goldstein as a \\"degenerate murderer\\", \\"a shame on Zionism and an embarrassment to Judaism\\".West Bank Massacre: The Overview; Rabin Urges the Palestinians To Put Aside Anger and Talk. Haberman, Clyde. The New York Times. March 1, 1994. At the same time, Goldstein's actions were praised by some extremist settlers; Yochay Ron said that he \\"felt good\\" when he heard the news, and he also stated that Jews were \\"at war with the Arabs\\" and \\"all Arabs who live here are a danger to us... they threaten the very existence of the Jewish community on the West Bank.\\" Goldstein and other religious settlers at Beit Hadassah (both Kahanist and Gush Emunim) believe that the biblical lands on the West Bank are sacred, that Jews are required by God to occupy them, and that the presence of Muslims desecrates the Holy Land. After this attack, members of the Kach Party praised Goldstein's actions, and in the ensuing political turmoil, the Knesset banned Kach in Israel. The Shamgar Commission in Israel concluded that Baruch Goldstein acted alone. Yoel Lerner In October 1982 Yoel Lerner, a member of Meir Kahane's Kach, attempted to blow up the Dome of the Rock in order to rebuild the Temple Mount site. He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. Mark Juergensmeyer identified him as a Jewish religious terrorist, writing that he \\"yearned for a Jewish society in Israel. He hoped for the restoration of the ancient temple in Jerusalem, the exclusive right of Jews to settle on the West Bank of the Jordan River, and the creation of a state based on biblical law.\\" Lerner had previously served a three-year sentence for heading a group that plotted to overthrow the government and establish a state based upon religious law. Eden Natan-Zada On August 4, 2005, Eden Natan-Zada, an AWOL Israel Defense Forces soldier, killed four Israeli Arab citizens and wounded several others when he opened fire on a bus in the northern Israeli town of Shfaram. Natan-Zada had recently moved to the settlement of Tapuach, site of a Kahanist yeshiva. Zada was handcuffed by the Israeli police who arrived to the scene but then lynched by the mob. Alleged Kahanist violence Roadside shootings, stabbings and grenade attacks against Palestinians have been carried out in Jerusalem and the West Bank by individuals or groups suspected of having ties to the former Kach group. Aliases such as \\"The Committee for the Safety of the Roads\\", \\"The Sword of David\\" and \\"The Repression of Traitors\\" have been used. The US government claims that these are all aliases of \\"Kach\\". In 2002, a Kahanist group known as \\"Revenge of the Toddlers\\" claimed responsibility for a bombing attack at Tzur Baher, an East Jerusalem secondary school for Arab boys, that wounded seven. The group also claimed responsibility for the 2003 bombing of a Palestinian school in Jaba that injured 20 and it was also thought to be linked to the 2002 Zil Elementary school bombing.The Israeli- Palestinian war: escalating to nowhere By Anthony H. Cordesman, Jennifer Moravitz 2005 pg. 159Israelis Kill Five Palestinians in Gaza Strip New York Times April 10, 2003 In the United States, Kahanist groups and organizations are largely inactive, and the bulk of their supporters have emigrated to Israel over the years. Kahane Net, the Jewish Defense League and B'nai Elim (formed by former JDL activists) are occasionally associated with Kahanism. Non-Jewish support James David Manning, chief pastor of ATLAH World Missionary Church, has endorsed aspects of Kahane's ideology.

The CPI (ML) also supported the communist movements of Vietnam and Cambodia.Red Patriot, 7 April 1975 They also expressed some support for the Gang of Four faction in China.\\"Political and Pressure Groups\\", Magill magazine, 1 October 1977.

CPI (ML) Pamphlet, 1975. The CPI (ML) supported armed struggle for the reunification of Ireland and initiated the Spirit of Freedom Committee to work with Irish republicans. Other groups created by the party were the Workers and Unemployed Movement and the Communist Youth Union of Ireland (Marxist-Leninist). In the early 1980s, the CPI (ML) was a major force in the students' union movement, with member Brendan Doris becoming president of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), while members Tommy Graham and Brian Stone became president of the College of Technology (Bolton Street) Students' Union in successive years. Tommy Graham is the current editor of History Ireland. Later years With the collapse of socialism in Albania, the CPI (ML) opened up relations with the Workers Party of Korea and signed the 1992 Pyongyang Declaration. General Secretary Rod Eley visited North Korea in 1999. In 2003 CPI (ML) was disbanded, following a long period of passivity. Upon dissolution, the general secretary of CPI (ML) was Rod Eley.

Davis Jr. (born September 7, 1938) is an American former professional basketball player who played two seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was a starter on two NCAA Final Four teams at the University of Cincinnati. Early life Davis was born in Vanceburg, Kentucky, the son of Ralph E. Davis Sr., a self-employed businessman, and Anna Louis (Plummer) Davis. He played basketball at Lewis County High School in Vanceburg. He scored 1,810 points for the Lions and averaged 26.4 points and 18 rebounds per game as a senior. He was an all-district selection for three years. As a senior in 1956 he was named second team all-state by Louisville Courier-Journal as he led the Lions to the Eastern Kentucky Conference title. He was also an honor student. College career Davis attended the University of Cincinnati, where he was a three-year starter for the Bearcats and coach George Smith. As a sophomore in 1957‚Äì58, he averaged 7.9points per game as the Bearcats posted a 25-1record and won the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) title led by fellow sophomore and future Hall-of-Famer forward Oscar Robertson and future longtime NBA player Connie Dierking. As a junior in 1958‚Äì59, Davis started at point guard alongside Carl Bouldin and averaged 15.5 points (second to Robertson), 4.4 assists and 2.0 rebounds as the Bearcats were again MVC champions and Davis was named All-MVC. The 26-4 Bearcats advanced to the NCAA Final Four, where they finished in third place. As a senior in 1959‚Äì60, Davis posted averages of 13.7 points (again second to Robertson), 4.4 assists and 2.0 rebounds per game while shooting 50 percent from the field as again the Bearcats won the league crown. Davis was named All-MVC and was also named second-team All-American by Converse. The Bearcats went 28-2, again advancing to the Final Four and again finishing third. Davis' 1,093 career points ranked sixth in Cincinnati history upon his graduation in 1960. NBA career Davis was drafted in the third round (17th overall) of the 1960 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals. As a rookie in 1960‚Äì61, he played in 73 games, averaged 16.6 minutes, 2.4 assists and 1.2 rebounds per game as a reserve guard for the 33-46 Royals. On April 26, 1961 he was drafted by the Chicago Packers in the NBA expansion draft. For the 1961‚Äì62 season, in 77 games Davis' playing time increased to nearly 26 minutes per game as he posted career-high averages of 10.4 points, 3.2 assists and 2.1 rebounds per game for the 18-62 expansion team. In November 1961, the Packers had traded Davis to the St. Louis Hawks in a multi-player deal, but the trade was rescinded by NBA Commissioner Maurice Podoloff. In 1962 he was officially traded to the St. Louis Hawks, but he did not play and his NBA career ended after two seasons. Personal life In 1981, Davis was inducted into the University of Cincinnati Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was inducted into the Greater Cincinnati Basketball Hall of Fame. In December 2010, Lewis County High School held a ceremony to retire Davis' number. Davis is retired and lives in Reading, a suburb of Cincinnati.

It excludes injuries sustained as a result of genetic or congenital disorder. It also excludes those resulting from birth traumas such as hypoxia or conditions such as foetal alcohol syndrome. It encompasses both traumatic and non-traumatic (or atraumatic) injuries. Pediatric acquired brain injury (PABI) is the number one cause of death and disability for children and young adults in the United States.\\" and effects most children ages (6-10) and adolescent ages (11-17) around the world. The injury can be traumatic or non-traumatic in nature, and most patients never return to normal after suffering from the injury.There are many different symptoms such as amnesia, anhedonia, and apraxia. Currently there isn‚Äôt a cure for the injury. PABI effects the family of the patient also, because the families of the patient will need to adapt to the new changes they will experience in their child. It is recommended that the families decide to gain as much information as they can about the injury and what to expect by going to different program events and meetings. Traumatic injuries could include a blow to the head; gunshot; stabbing; crushing and excessive vibration / oscillation. This can be caused by shaking or sudden deceleration. Traumatic injuries might but do not necessarily have to involve an open wound or penetration of the skull or of the meninges - an 'open head‚Äô injury. Non- traumatic injuries could include those caused by illnesses, such as tumours, encephalitis, meningitis and sinusitis. They could also be caused by infections such as septicaemia; events such as anoxia and hypoxia occasioned by strangulation or near drowning, lead toxicity, and substance misuse.  Symptoms and signs  Brain Scan Some symptoms that result from an acquired brain injury are amnesia, anhedonia, and apraxia.  Amnesia  \\"Childhood amnesia is the inability to remember one‚Äôs own childhood.\\" Researchers found that some everyday activities such as speaking, running, or playing a guitar, cannot be described or remembered.  Anhedonia  A child that is diagnosed with anhedonia would lack interest in some usual activities, such as hobbies, playing sports, or engaging with friends. It's very essential for a child to be able to enjoy fun childhood activities because it can help them build a social life, and easily interact with others. Not being able to do these things at a young age will only make it harder to adapt as the child gets older.  Apraxia  \\"Apraxia is the inability to execute learned purposeful movements, despite having the desire and the physical capacity to perform the movements.\\" In this case, the child could have still have the memory of doing a usual activity such as riding a bike, but still not be able to accomplish the movement. Prevalence and impacts The prevalence of ABI amongst school- aged children in the UK is estimated to be in the region of 1 in 30, based on admissions to A & E, although some professionals consider it to be much higher, as a child can be admitted to A & E with another more urgent injury, which is considered to be of overriding concern at the time. It can be tempting to assume that an injury acquired in childhood is likely to have a more positive long term outcome than one acquired during adulthood. It could be assumed that a child or adolescent could have a better chance of developing compensatory strategies whilst still at the stage where significant development and learning is taking place. If the injury is in any way significant this is often not the case. The inherent ‚Äòplasticity‚Äô of the brain can occasionally mean that areas damaged beyond healing can relocate their function to other undamaged areas (the so-called ‚ÄòKennard principle‚Äô ) and there are documented cases where this has indeed happened. However, it is frequently the case that the functions associated with the damaged areas never fully develop and these deficits can present as significant disabilities or difficulties in later life. A significant proportion of the prior learning and the development of skills which has already taken place within an adult's brain can often be retained post injury. However, a brain at the earlier stages of development, if damaged, might never develop the capacity to learn those skills, leading to subsequent difficulties that could manifest themselves physically, socially, emotionally and educationally. Neurocognitive Problems Delayed physiological responses post-TBI can lead to neurodegeneration in various parts of the brain in both chronic and severe cases in children. The parts of the brain that have been proven to be affected include: the hippocampus, amygdala, globus pallidus, thalamus, periventricular white matter, cerebellum, and brainstem. As a result, this can lead to behavioral and cognitive problems in child development. Behavioral changes have been characterized as \\"externalizing\\" and \\"internalizing\\" problems. Externalizing problems include different forms of aggression, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The most common of these problems result from changes in attention and focus, such as ADHD. Internalizing issues include psychiatric problems such as short-term and long-term depression, anxiety, personality disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several variables can determine the outcome of behavioral problems in children post-TBI. For example, children that are already suffer from behavioral issues before injury are more likely to develop long-term cognitive problems. Another important factor is the severity of the injury, which can be a predictor of how long behavioral symptoms last and if they will increase over time. Statistically about 54% to 63% of children develop novel psychiatric disorders about 24 months after severe TBI, and 10% to 21% after mild or moderate TBI, the most common of which is personality change due to TBI. The symptoms may last for 6 to 24 months on average. Development of PTSD is common (68%) in the first few weeks post-injury with a decline in the course of 2 years. In cases of severe TBI about one third of children develop depressive disorder. Children with severe TBI also have some effects on working memory, visual immediate memory, and more prominent consequences in intellectual functioning, executive functioning (including speed processing and attention), and verbal immediate and delayed memory. Some recovery is observed during the first 2 years post- injury. Children with moderate TBI only show some decline in attention and problem solving, but larger effects in visual immediate memory. The superior frontal lesions correlate with the type of outcome, but more importantly, subcortical network damage may affect the recovery due to the lesions in white matter tracts. Children with severe TBI are at higher risk for not achieving developmentally appropriate gains and not catching up with peers at school due to the crucial stage of learning at which their neural networks are disrupted by the injury. Behavior In children and adolescents that have an acquired brain injury, the cognitive and emotional difficulties that come about from their injury can negatively impact their level of participation in home, school and other social situations. This puts the patient at a disadvantage because they won't nearly as social, or able to participate in a school setting as an ordinary child would. Involvement in social situations is important for the normal development of children as a means of gaining an understanding of how to effectively work together with others. Group work is a huge factor is academics today, and the child's ability to work within groups will be ineffective. Furthermore, young people with an acquired brain injury are often reported as having insufficient problem solving skills. This has the potential to hinder their performance in various academic and social settings further. It is important for rehabilitation programs to deal with these challenges specific to children who have not fully developed at the time of their injury. Potential general effects The effects can range from the relatively mild to the catastrophic but all will, to some degree, affect the child's ability to function within an educational and / or social setting. Educational attainment and quality of life indicators for young adult survivors of childhood acquired brain injury are significantly lower than those of an uninjured peer group. Because a child's brain is a ‚Äòwork in progress‚Äô, deficits caused by an injury sustained at one age might not become apparent until much later, as the damaged areas become relevant to the child's expected developmental milestones. This is known as the 'sleeper effect' and where adults observing the child are unaware either of the injury itself or of the potential effects of an ABI, this can often lead to a misattribution of the failure to achieve academically and socially as ‚Äòlaziness‚Äô, ‚Äòteenage tantrums‚Äô and ‚Äògoing off the rails‚Äô. It is evident that damage to specific areas of the brain can result in whole areas of knowledge, skills and abilities being lost, sometimes irrevocably. However, it is also often the case that although some cognitive abilities can be left intact, (including the ability to retrieve, process and manipulate information) and much prior learning can remain, a child can be prevented from developing academically and socially because of other, more functional, deficits. Potential social disadvantage There are many ways in which a child with an ABI can become socially disadvantaged and alienated from his or her peers following an injury and the following are only indicative of the problems that might follow reintroduction to their peer group. A common sequela of brain injury is a much reduced ability to process information and therefore to respond to it promptly. This can mean that a child is unable to keep up with the conversational flow of a group of friends and can be slower than the rest of the group to pick up on jokes and ‚Äòbanter‚Äô, leaving him/her feeling frustrated and left behind. However caring and well meaning, the friends can also find it difficult to accommodate this new slowness into their usual give and take, resulting in the affected child being alienated and left out. Another effect often seen as a result of damage to the vulnerable frontal lobes of a child's brain is ‚Äòdisinhibition‚Äô or a reduced ability to inhibit an impulse to say or do something long enough to calculate whether it's the correct or appropriate thing to say or do. Research shows that adolescence is the time when the frontal lobe areas of the brain - the areas that govern the ability to manage one's behaviours - develop enough to allow a child to begin to ‚Äògrow up‚Äô and start to inhibit their initial impulses. Disinhibition can lead to a child saying apparently hurtful or aggressive things to peers, leading to antagonism and embarrassment. It can also be the case that because of this, a child with an ABI will be less able to inhibit their responses to other provocations, such as adult authority, resulting in apparent ‚Äòbad‚Äô behaviour, leading their friends (or their friends‚Äô parents) to view them as unsuitable companions. Disinhibition can also lead to sexually harmful behaviour, particularly when coupled with a lowered sense of risk and danger and a child with a brain injury can often become vulnerable to exploitation by peers or by strangers. A reduced ability to access and to process language and therefore to ‚Äòword find‚Äô appropriately can result in an increased inclination to use a more readily accessible word - such as a swear word or a more aggressive word - and this can obviously alienate and concern friends, who could interpret this as anger or aggression. Potential emotional effects Everything we are, everything we are able to do and everything we feel is governed by the functioning of our brain. What we grow to see as fundamentally ‚Äòme‚Äô is a product of our brain and the experiences that have shaped it. When a child experiences a brain injury, its effects could alter his or her academic abilities, likes and dislikes, friendship groups, talents and skills, plans for the future, relationships with parents and siblings, physical prowess - everything that made the child the person they knew themselves to be. The dissonance between the self-image pre injury and the new one post injury can be experienced as a real trauma, as the child tries to come to terms with the new ‚Äòme‚Äô, the ‚Äòdeath‚Äô of the old one and the limitations possibly imposed by the effects of the injury. The loss of academic or sporting status, the indifference or antagonism of their peer group, the curtailing of their developing independence because of understandable parental worry, could all be experienced by a brain injured child or adolescent as almost a bereavement. It is not unusual for a brain injured child to experience feelings of worthlessness, depression and loss. Family relationships could also suffer as a result of the injury, as parents struggle to come to terms with the same feelings of bereavement of their plans and hopes for their child, for their family unit and for the life they lived together before the injury. Siblings also could find it hard to come to terms with the loss of the brother or sister they knew and loved and with the amount of time, attention and emotional energy their parents have expended on the injured child. Potential misattribution of effects A childhood acquired brain injury can have a huge variety of effects on the child, at different times during the development of their brain function. Depending on how well informed another person is about the injury and about the nature of brain development, it can often be easy to ascribe aspects of a child's behaviour (or ‚Äòpresentation‚Äô) to the wrong underlying reason. It is, for example, common for parents and teachers to misread the effects of a cognitive impairment for a physical issue and a physical problem for a ‚Äòbehavioural‚Äô one. An example of this could be a child who has great difficulty in ‚Äòinitiating‚Äô a task or in sequencing elements of a simple task. When the child fails to respond to what appears to be a straightforward instruction, for example ‚Äòput away your art work then go over there and get changed for PE‚Äô, and is found still to be sitting at his desk five minutes later, the teacher might reach the conclusion that he is lazy or defiant. Similarly, a child who has a visual impairment as a result of her injury could be mistaken for being clumsy and uncoordinated or just thoughtless, when she knocks over the milk jug or for being scatterbrained and inattentive when she neglects to complete the math problems written on the right hand side of the board.  Pathophysiology  The pediatric brain undergoes dramatic changes and significant pruning of neural networks throughout development. Whereby the areas for primary senses and motor skills are mostly developed by age 4, other areas, like the frontal cortices involved in higher level reasoning, decision-making, emotion, and impulsivity continue to develop well into the late teens to early 20s. Therefore, the patient's age and brain developmental state influence what neuronal systems become most affected post-injury. Key structural features of the pediatric brain make the brain tissue more susceptible to the mechanical injury during TBI than the adult brain: a larger water content in the brain tissue and reduced myelination results in diminished shear resistance after injury. It has also been shown that more immature brains have an enlarged extracellular space volume and a decreased expression of glial aquaporin 4 leading to an increased incidence of brain swelling after TBI. Along with a delayed decrease in cerebral blood flow, these unique features of the developing brain can mediate further secondary damage, through hypoxia, excitotoxicity, free radical damage, and neuroinflammation after the primary injury. Even properties of these secondary events differ between the developing brain and the adult brain: (1) in the developing brain, the overexpression and activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) leads to an increased calcium influx and an increased capacity for excitoxicity when compared to the adult brain and (2) the developing brain has lower glutathione peroxidase activity and a decreased ability to maintain stores of glutathione peroxidase, therefore the developing brain is more vulnerable to oxidative stress than the adult brain. Damage to the developing brain, by any of the above mechanisms, can disturb neuronal maturation, leading to neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination.  Training  There are many different ways to \\"train\\" the children diagnosed with Pediatric Brain Injury. The training mainly tests their brain, to see exactly what's wrong with the patient, and what areas need to be focused on for improvement.  AIM Program  \\"AIM is a 10-week, computerized treatment program that incorporates goal setting, the use of metacognitive strategies, and computer-based exercises designed to improve various aspects of attention.\\" \\"During the initial meeting with the child, the computer program leads the clinician through an intake procedure that assists in identifying the nature and severity of the child‚Äôs attention difficulties and then facilitates the selection of attention training tasks and metacognitive strategies tailored to the needs of the child.\\" The clinician's role is to select the specific, presenting mental areas that are impaired, as well as to modify the tasks and strategies in response to improvements of the patients‚Äô overtime. This is a helpful way to figure out what problems the child/adolescent is facing, while also helping them to gradually improve their injury.  Parent‚Äôs Assistance for Patients  \\"Investigators have established that interventions for pediatric BI should target the family because changes in one family member will affect the entire family system.\\" \\"During rehabilitation, caregivers often receive skills training to improve their ability to care for their child after their brain injury. Family realignment and adjusting the child's environment are two major ways parents can make the distresses of the injury easier on their child. Some beneficial ways parents can realign their household are applying consequences to minimize problem behaviors, increasing the amount of positive communication between parents and child with injury, and establishing positive routines that will instill meaning into the child's day-to-day life.

His teams had 1028 career wins, making him the 56th winningest baseball coach in NCAA baseball and the seventh-highest winner among coaches in NCAA Division II. Career A native of East Alton, Illinois and a graduate of Roxana High School, Collins entered Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) as a student just before the school initiated intercollegiate athletics. As a junior at SIUE, he became a member of Harry Gallatin's first Cougar basketball team in 1967‚Äì68 and a vital member of Roy E. Lee's inaugural baseball team in 1968, returning to play for both teams as a senior. His baseball play earned SIUE Baseball Player of the Year honors in 1969 and resulted in his being the first SIUE student-athlete to be drafted to play professional baseball. Collins was a 12th round pick of the St. Louis Cardinals in the June, 1969 Major League Baseball draft as a first baseman and outfielder. After two seasons with six clubs in the Cardinal organization, Collins returned to SIUE, becoming an assistant coach for Roy Lee. Collins spent two seasons as Lee's assistant, then moved to Lewis and Clark Community College as assistant to coach Arnold Copeland. In 1979, Collins returned to SIUE, replacing the retiring Roy Lee as the Cougars head coach. Over the following 34 seasons, Collins' Cougars built a record of 1,028-766-7. In Collins' first thirty years as the Cougar coach, the school continued as the strong Division II program built by Coach Lee, earning fourteen trips to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship tournament and advancing to the Division II College World Series five times. In 2009, the Cougars began the transition to NCAA Division I, joining the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). In the team's first year of eligibility, the Cougars qualified for the 2012 OVC Tournament. Having seen the team through its transition to Division I, in July 2012, Collins stepped down as the Cougar's head coach, assuming new duties as SIUE's first Director of Development for Intercollegiate Athletics. He retired from the university in February 2014. Collins earned his bachelor's degree in Physical Education in 1970 and added a master's degree in counselor education in 1973, both from SIUE. Collins is one of seven individuals who will be inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall of Fame in January 2019.

Being the motivated man that he was, Caliver also managed to then earn his M.A. from the University of Wisconsin in 1921. In 1930, he earned his Ph.D. in Education from Columbia University‚Äôs Teacher‚Äôs College. He was the FIRST black person in the city to earn a Ph. D. and the first to earn such degree in the field of education. Career While at Fisk, Caliver worked a variety of positions until he finally was invited to be the Dean of the University in 1927. Three years later, Caliver was appointed to the new position of Senior Specialist in the Education of Negroes in the U.S. Office of Education by President Herbert Hoover.Robert Booker: City boasts long roll of black achievers : Knoxville News Sentinel When F.D.R was elected President two years later, he kept his post and became a member of F.D.R.‚Äôs ‚Äúblack cabinet‚Äù. [6]During Caliver‚Äôs time in Cabinet, he was very motivated by the inequity in the education of blacks and whites and set out to raise national awareness, particularly in the rural South. He traveled furiously to accurately document the lack of funding for public schooling. During his tenure in the U.S. Office of Education, he published numerous articles, bulletins, and pamphlets on current topics relating to African American education and assembled conferences and committees on these matters. A few of his most famous articles titled, ‚ÄúThe Education of Negro Teachers‚Äù and ‚ÄúSecondary Education for Negroes.‚Äù In his quest to achieve higher education for African-Americans, Ambrose Caliver also created a nine part radio series, broadcast on NBC, that highlighted the history and achievements of his fellow African-Americans. The series, ‚ÄúFreedom Peoples‚Äù, occurred from 1941 to 1942 and was the first substantial program in mass media that focuses solely on the lives and history of the African-American people. The series included Inventions, which highlighted contributions by African-American inventors, Steal Away which used slave spirituality to show the capacity of African-Americans to turn hardships and pain into beauty and art, W.C. Handy, which follows the story of the beginning of the blues movement, and War Work, which shows the contributions of African-Americans to World War I and World War II.Radio Fights Jim Crow National studies Ambrose Caliver performed many duties during his tenure in the U.S. Office of Education, but perhaps the most influential work that he did was the studies he had compiled on a national scale. During his time in office he notably headed the National Survey of Teacher Education, the National Secondary Education Survey (1932), the National Survey of the Vocational and Educational Guidance of Negroes (1939), and the National Survey of the Higher Education of Negroes. He compiled the National Statistics of the Education of Negroes from 1933-1934 and again from 1935-1936. These works changed the face of black education on a national scale, bringing to light the common fact that there was an overwhelming lack of secondary education for African-Americans. Ambrose also served as an adviser for a number of national and international projects, including the U.S. Displaced Persons Commission (1949). (A displaced person is the same as a forced migrant, meaning one who is forced to leave his/her own country.) He also worked as the president of the Adult Education Association whose primary focus was in advancing and promoting adults to seek higher education, and was the organizer of the NACEN (National Advisory on the Education of Negroes) in which he dies during his term in 1962.Caliver, Ambrose (1894-1962) Ambrose Caliver was born in‚Ä¶  bigdog4542002 on Xanga Recognition During the eighth conference of the Prairie view educational Conference in 1937 aimed to ‚Äúdo for Texas what Caliver had done for the country‚ÄùPage 22 of higher education in texas The conference was the most important discussion on black higher education in Texas and cited Caliver‚Äôs 1932 study of black secondary education, along with Caliver‚Äôs study of black rural education in 1935.Page 23 of higher education in texas In 1930, Ambrose was appointed Senior Specialist in the education of Negroes in the U.S Office of Education by President Hoover.
