Classification  Post-traumatic arthritis is a form of osteoarthritis and the former can occur after the latter. However, post- traumatic arthritis can also occur after the development of chronic inflammatory arthritis. Generally, post-traumatic arthritis is classified in two groups: post-traumatic osteoarthritis and post-traumatic inflammatory arthritis. = Post-traumatic osteoarthritis = Post-traumatic osteoarthritis is the most common variation of post-traumatic arthritis. Between 20 and 50% of all osteoarthritis cases are preceded by post-traumatic arthritis. Patients having post-traumatic osteoarthritis are usually younger than osteoarthritis patients without any previous physical injuries. = Post-traumatic inflammatory arthritis = Less common is post-traumatic inflammatory arthritis, accounting for between 2 and 25% of all post-traumatic arthritis cases. There are reports about a connection between previous physical injury and inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis.  Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of post-traumatic arthritis are similar to the ones occurring with osteoarthritis. General symptoms are stiffness, swelling, synovial effusion, pain, redness, tenderness, grinding, instability and intra-articular bleeding of the injured joint. As a result of this symptoms, post-traumatic arthritis often comes along with the loss of ability.  Risk factors  Since post-traumatic arthritis usually occurs after injuring a joint, the risk of having post-traumatic arthritis after such an injury is significant higher. Risk factors which increase the danger of getting post-traumatic arthritis are being overweight and physical activity. The prevalence of post-traumatic arthritis is much higher when doing heavy work and overusing the injured joints. Examinations also revealed that a body mass index (BMI) increase of five units results in a 35% higher risk of post- traumatic arthritis. It is reported that genetics do have an influence on the prevalence of post-traumatic arthritis. According to newer examinations, the sex of the patients may also have an influence on post-traumatic arthritis, since females are affected by post-traumatic arthritis more frequently than males.  Pathogenesis  The process of post-traumatic arthritis can be divided into three phases: immediate, acute, and chronic. = Immediate phase = This phase usually begins a few seconds after the injury; it is characterized by cell necrosis, collagen rupture, swelling of the cartilage, hemarthrosis, and the loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). = Acute phase = In this phase, acute post-traumatic arthrosis emerges. Matrix degradation, leukocyte infiltration, inflammatory mediators, deficient lubricants, and apoptosis can occur. Typically, the acute phase comes hours after the injury. = Chronic phase = The chronic phase occurs months or years after the trauma. Typical symptoms are joint pain and dysfunction.  Diagnosis  Post- traumatic arthritis is diagnosed with the help of a patient's medical history. Additionally, radiographic imaging can assist in diagnosing post-traumatic arthritis.  Management  It is not possible to cure the acute post- traumatic arthritis in order to prevent a chronic post-traumatic arthritis. There are many different options to manage chronic post-traumatic arthritis. = Lifestyle = Since being overweight is a risk factor for post-traumatic arthritis, lifestyle changes that help manage body weight are important in the treatment and prevention of the condition. Lifestyle changes and weight loss often involve educating the affected person about how to practice a healthy lifestyle. = Therapeutic measures = Physical therapy may help reduce pain and other symptoms of post-traumatic arthritis. The efficacy of massage therapy and manual therapy are not yet proven. = Medication = Post- traumatic arthritis is treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For more moderate symptoms, paracetamol is also used. Another medical treatment approach is the injection of cortisone or corticosteroid into the affected joint. = Surgery = If medications, lifestyle changes, and physical therapy are not enough to reduce the symptoms, especially the pain, surgery and other such interventions for managing post- traumatic arthritis are available. In many cases, joint replacement or cartilage resurfacing are recommended. As clinical studies have demonstrated, such surgical methods can be effective at reducing symptomatic pain and the costs associated with management of the condition.  Epidemiology  About 12% of all osteoarthritis cases in the United States are classified as post- traumatic osteoarthritis. This means that over 5.6 million people are affected by post-traumatic osteoarthritis only in the United States. Females are more often affected than males. Post-traumatic arthritis costs the US health care system approximately 3.06 billion (0.15%) of total health care costs each year.

Hopkins is best known for her career as a biophysicist and research chemist at American Cyanamid along with research in the Polaroid Corp Emulsion Coating and Analysis Laboratory. She also pursued a career working as an attorney with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) following her time as a chemist.  Early life and family  Esther Arvilla Harrison was born on September 18, 1926, in Stamford, Connecticut, to Esther Small and George Burgess Harrison. Her mother migrated from Society Hill, South Carolina, to New Rochelle, New York, at the age of 12 (1901) to move north and work as a maid for a New Rochelle family. Small was the first member of her family fully freed from slavery. She was also the first member of family to graduate from high school and to own a home. While working as a chauffeur in Stamford, Connecticut, she married George Burgess Harrison, who was also employed as a chauffeur. George Harrison was raised in East Orange, New Jersey where he attended high school, but dropped out to work as a janitor and chauffeur. Esther Harrison was born in 1926 and along with two brothers one older and one younger. The Harrison family battled poverty, but Esther spent most of her time at the public library and the Stamford theater. Her parents also provided her with piano lessons even when facing financial adversity. Throughout middle and high school, Esther played the piano at her church and was president of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA).  Education  Esther began kindergarten at the age of 3, passing an early enrollment test to enter school. She succeeded in the classroom, especially in the subjects of math and chemistry. She attended Hart Elementary School and Burdick Junior High School, both in her hometown of Stamford. Upon graduating 21st in her class from Stamford High School in 1943, Esther Harrison had her sights set on attending medical school and becoming a doctor. Despite being told to consider a career as a hairdresser, by a neighbor at the local YWCA, Esther had her mind set on medicine. After graduating from high school, Harrison had sights set on attending Yale University, although the school was not coed in 1943. She graduated from Boston University in 1947 with a B.A. in chemistry. She was rejected from Boston University's medical school due to the limited availability of two seats for African American students. Alternatively, she attended Howard University where she received her master's degree in organic chemistry in 1949. She later earned a second master's degree (1962) and Ph.D. (1967) in chemistry at Yale University, while carrying out chemical research for American Cyanamid. Her dissertation research focused on the effects of the release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in fireflies.  Career  After graduating from Howard University, Esther Hopkins began teaching chemistry at Virginia State College from 1949 to 1952 before deciding to pursue research. She was offered a position to work with the New England Institute for Medical Research in 1955, where she was an assistant researcher in biophysics until 1959. After this research stint, she worked as a chemist at the American Cyanamid's research lab back at home in Stamford. She earned both her second M.S. and Ph.D. in chemistry from Yale while working at American Cyanamid as a research chemist. Upon completion of her Ph.D. program, Hopkins was hired as a supervisory research chemist with the Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1967. There she led the Emulsion Coating and Analysis Laboratory, checking the chemical composition of film coating uniformity. Hopkins attended the National Science Foundation's Double Blind Symposium in 1975, which was a conference that focused on the challenges that minorities, the disabled, and women face and illuminate the underrepresentation in STEM fields. This combined with personal experiences as an African-American female, sparked her interest in law and patent work. While working for Polaroid, she attended Suffolk University Law School where she received her J.D. degree with a concentration in patent law in 1976. Hopkins left her Polaroid lab in 1989 and began working as the deputy general counsel at the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. She retired in 1999 from the Massachusetts DEP, but continued to work in her community, becoming the first African American elected to the local Framingham Board of Selectmen.  Personal life  Esther married John Mitchell in 1955, who was pursuing a doctorate at Boston University when they met. They had a daughter named Susan who died in early adulthood due to diabetes complications. The marriage ended a few years later. Esther moved back to Stamford in 1959, where she met and married Ewell Hopkins in 1959, a local minister and social worker. Together they had one son, Ewell Hopkins Jr.. Esther was married to Ewell for 42 years before his death in 2001. Today she resides on Martha's Vineyard.

Dove (born October 17, 1962) is an American researcher who specializes in identifying birds that have gotten trapped in airplane engines, known as bird strikes. She is currently the Program Manager for Feather Identification Lab in the Division of Birds at the National Museum of Natural History. Her work helps promote wildlife safety, as well as pave the way for the development of preventative measures that will decrease the chance of wildlife impacting airplanes. She has published over 40 articles on her research so far. Early life Carla J. Dove was born on October 17, 1962 in Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States. From an early age, she was involved in outdoor activities, in part because she grew up near George Washington National Forest. Her early hobbies lead her to become interested in wildlife, and later helped fuel her passion for birds. Education and early career Dove graduated from Broadway High School in 1981. She was a first-generation college student, who went on to pursue multiple degrees within her field. In 1983, she earned an associate degree from the National Resources Program at Lord Fairfax Community College. Dove transferred to the University of Montana where she found her passion for birds. She earned a work-study grant in the zoological museum as a curatorial assistant where she learned to work in research collections and skin birds. In 1986, she earned a BS degree in wildlife biology. After earning her degree, she worked in a cancer research lab for a few years in Maryland before finding a job at the Natural History Museum. Dove accepted a temporary position in the Division of Birds at the National Museum of Natural History as a museum technician in 1989. There she became an apprentice to Roxie Laybourne, assisting with her work on the identification of bird species from the microscopic characteristics of downy feathers. In addition to her position as a technician and her work with Roxie Laybourne, Dove enrolled in George Mason University in 1989 to pursue a master's program. In 1994 she earned her MS degree in biology. Her thesis was on the microscopic structure of feathers in North American plovers. Later that year, the U.S. Air Force accepted a research and training proposal that allowed Dove to focus on her research with a salaried position. Dove later re- enrolled at George Mason University to continue her education, completing her PhD in environmental science and public policy for her dissertation on the microscopic characters of Charadriiformes (a type of shorebird) in 1998. Research and publications Dove began working with birds during her temporary position at the National Museum of Natural History in the Division of Birds. From there she transitioned to her current position as program manager for the Feather Identification Lab. Using forensic methodologies, she is able to identify bird species from leftover fragments in the field of ornithology. These fragments range from the macroscopic level (feathers, beaks, color, size, pattern, feet) to microscopic fragments (blood, tissue samples). The lab is funded through agreements between the Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and the Smithsonian Institution. Reporting and identifying wildlife strikes is of critical importance to promoting the safety of wildlife and the prevention of impacts with aeroplanes. This research has led to the creation of an Air Force database which forecasts bird movements as well as creating bird hazard warnings which are given to pilots. Engineers are able to design windshields and engines that are safer. Additionally, the data is used to manage habitats on airfields. This information is used in military and civil aviation to promote a safer environment for human and wildlife alike. In addition to identifying the remains of birds that have impacted with aeroplanes, her skills have been used in a variety of other cases as well. Around 2013, her help was requested to identify what bird species were being eaten by giant Burmese pythons living in the Florida Everglades. Her knowledge has led her to become an expert in her field internationally, and thus often collaborates with many scientists and organizations over the course of her career. She often works with researchers of ecology, anthropology and evolutionary biology. She has been a consultant to the US Air Force, US Navy, FBI, US Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Division, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, in addition to various airplane engine manufacturers.

She served as Director of the Center for Layered Polymeric Systems from its founding in 2006 until her death in 2010.  Education  Hiltner received a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry from Reed College in 1963 and went on to receive a Physical Doctorate in Physical Chemistry from Oregon State University in 1967.  Personal life  In 1999, she married Eric Baer, who was the Chairman of the Department of Macromolecular Science at Case Western Reserve University at that time. She died on September 6, 2010 at age 69 after battling illness.  Career  = Case Western Reserve University = After receiving her PhD in 1967, Hiltner began working as a research associate at Case Western Reserve University. During her first year as a research associate, she worked with chemistry professor Irvin M. Krieger. After her first year as a research associate, she worked in Eric Baer's laboratory. In 1971, Hiltner became a senior research associate in the Department of Macromolecular Science.1DP 89:- Biographical Sketch, 1983, Case Western Reserve University Archives Hiltner made history in 1974 when she became an assistant professor of macromolecular engineering and the first female engineering faculty at Case Western Reserve. Later, in 1979, Hiltner was appointed an associate professor in the Macromolecular Science Department, a position she held until 1983.7PI 75:- Resume, 21 March 1983, Case Western Reserve University Archives In 1981, Hiltner founded the Center for Applied Polymer Research (CAPRI), which was an organization that encouraged collaboration in research across disciplines, particularly in applied polymer science, and was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Hiltner became a full professor of the Macromolecular Science Department in 1983. In 1984, Hiltner was one of the authors of a proposal by the University of Akron and Case Western Reserve University to create an Advanced Technology Application Center in Polymers. This proposal was accepted and the Ohio Controlling Board approved a $4.1 million grant for the two universities. The universities decided to name their program the Edison Polymer Innovation Corporation (EPIC) after Hiltner suggested including the word \\"innovation,\\" eventually leading to the acronym EPIC. The universities stated that the primary goal of EPIC was to \\"develop new materials and research technology that shows promise in rejuvenating the state's economy.\\" Case Western Reserve coordinated its share of the work through CAPRI (which Hiltner was director of at the time) and researched polymer blends, polymer alloys, membranes, coatings, and lightweight composites. In its first few years, EPIC worked with corporations such as B.F. Goodrich, Firestone, and Goodyear. EPIC also patented a bandage to promote faster healing and helped form the Polymer Container Corporation in Akron, Ohio and NanoFilm in Valley View, Ohio. Currently, EPIC is one of the world's largest associations for polymer research and provides a wide range of services to companies, including business assistance, research and development, and design and process improvement.Prestegaard, Dean M.; Wolf, Adina Swirski; Iannone, Donald T.; and Austrian, Ziona, \\"An Assessment of the Ohio omas Edison Program\\" (1998).

Anne Hiltner was the principal investigator for this project and Eric Baer was the co-principal investigator. Hiltner and Baer generated micro- and nano- layered composite structures to study and characterize for degradation, while BPRC studied the degradation of kinetics from soil tests. The results from the research at BRPC helped guide the development of the composite structures being produced by CAPRI. In 1998, CAPRI collaborated with the Center for Research of Macromolecules at the former Joseph Fourier University (now a part of the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes). This U.S.-France collaboration focused on developing new composite materials with novel interactive electrical and mechanical properties, with Eric Baer as the principal investigator and Anne Hiltner as the co-principal investigator. Baer and Hiltner contributed their expertise in microlayering multiplying technology and materials processing and the French investigators contributed their experience with nano-scale technology to this project. Hiltner was named the Herbert Henry Dow Professor of Science and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University in 2004. In 2006, Hiltner secured funding from the NSF to found the multimillion-dollar Center for Layered Polymeric Systems (CLiPS) at Case Western Reserve University, which she would be the director of until her death. According to the NSF award, CLiPS aims to \\"create a broadly integrated program of research and education through the vehicle of a unique microlayering and nanolayering processing technology developed at Case Western Reserve University.\\" Current partners of CLiPS include the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Southern Mississippi, Northwestern University, Kent State University, and the Naval Research Laboratory, all of whom are under the leadership of the current director, Eric Baer. There are also several other affiliate universities and high schools involved with CLiPS. In addition to her polymer science work at Case Western Reserve, Hiltner also was a member of the Women's Center Executive Committee in 2001. This committee helped build the foundation for the Flora Stone Mather Center for Women by creating a position description for the full-time director of the Center and making a business plan for the Center's activities and identifying sources of supporting revenue.7PA3, Campus News 15 November 2001, Volume 13, Number 29, page 1, Case Western Reserve University Archives = Memberships and professional activities = Hiltner was involved in several societies, including the American Chemical Society (ACS), the American Physical Society, the Society of Biomaterials, the Society of Plastic Engineers, and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering.1DP 89:- Resume, 9 February 1979, Case Western Reserve University Archives Hiltner was quite involved in the American Chemical Society, serving as an Alternate Councilor in 1978, being a member of the Executive Committee in the Division of Polymer Chemistry from 1979 until 1981, and being a PMSE Fellow in 2006.

She was the top-rated juvenile filly in England in 1929 when she won three of her five races, namely the Champion Breeders' Foal Plate, Buckenham Post Produce Stakes and Bretby Stakes. In the following year she won the 1000 Guineas and Midsummer Stakes as well as finishing fourth in the Epsom Oaks and third in the Champion Stakes. All but one of Fair Isle's wins came at Newmarket Racecourse. As a broodmare, the best of her foals was the Queen Anne Stakes winner St Magnus. Background Fair Isle was a small, \\"frail-looking\\" bay mare bred in England by her owner Lord Derby and trained during her racing career by Frank Butters at the Stanley House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Both of Fair Isle's parents were also bred by Lord Derby. Her sire Phalaris was an outstanding sprinter who went on to become the most influential stallion of the 20th Century. His dam, Scapa Flow, also produced Fair Isle's full-brothers Fairway and Pharos. Racing career Lord Derby, who bred and owned Fair Isle =1929: two-year-old season= Before she raced in public Fair Isle attracted some attention and was reported to be highly regarded by her owner and trainer. On her racecourse debut at Royal Ascot in June the filly contested the Queen Mary Stakes and showed some promise in running fourth behind Qurrat-al-Ain. At Goodwood Racecourse a month later she appeared somewhat unlucky when beaten a short head by Ann Gudman in the Ham Produce Stakes. She recorded her first success in the ¬£1,000 Champion Breeders' Foal Plate at Derby Racecourse, coming home five lengths clear of her rivals at odds of 2/5. At Newmarket in October Fair Isle took the Buckenham Post Produce Stakes and then won the Bretby Stakes from the favourite Fair Diana, leading her to be described as \\"the best filly\\" of the year in England. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's leading two-year-olds, Fair Isle was rated the best filly, four pounds behind the top colt Diolite. =1930: three-year- old season= On 9 May, ridden by Tommy Weston, Fair Isle started the 7/4 favourite ahead of Qurrat-Al-Ain and seventeen other opponents for the 117th funning of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Despite the unusually unpleasantly cold and windy conditions, the race attracted a large crowd which included the King. The favourite caused some concern by sweating profusely before the race, but started well and settled behind the leaders as Silver Mount set the early pace. Weston sent the filly into the lead a furlong out and a \\"tremendous struggle\\" ensued as first Qurrat-Al-Ain, then Sister Clover and finally Torchere launched strong challenges. Fair Isle displayed \\"doggedness\\" and \\"superb battling qualities\\" to prevail by a short head and a neck from Torchere and Sister Clover. Following her win at Newmarket, Fair Isle was made favourite for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. On her arrival at the course on the day before the race she became highly agitated and refused to eat her usual oats, having to be fed instead on a mixture of stout and eggs. She led the field approaching the final turn but failed to stay the distance and finished fourth behind Rose of England. In July she won the Midsummer Stakes over one mile at Newmarket, carrying 130 pounds to victory in what was described as the most impressive performance of the meeting. The filly was then dropped back to sprint distances and started favourite for the King George Stakes over five furlongs at Goodwood but ran unplaced behind the colt Stingo. On her final appearance, Fair Island finished third behind Rustom Pasha and Grace Dalrymple in a strongly contested edition of the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October. Fair Isle earned a total of ¬£9,423 in 1930, taking her career winnings to ¬£13,219. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Fair Isle an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. At the end of her racing career, she was described as \\"a fine miler at her home course of Newmarket, but a nervous filly,unable to be travelled\\". Breeding record Fair Isle was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Lord Derby's stud. She produced at least three foals between 1933 and until her death in 1943: *St Magnus, a bay colt, foaled 1933, sired by Sansovino. Won Queen Anne Stakes in 1938. Later a successful breeding stallion in South Africa. *Scepter'd Isle, bay colt, 1936, by Bosworth. Failed to win a race. *Motherland, bay filly, 1937, by Gainsborough. Failed to win a race. Pedigree *Fair Isle was inbred 3 √ó 4 to St. Simon. This means that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of her pedigree.

His repertoire also included writing about Boko Haram's movement in West Africa, as well as their territory, strategies and beliefs, and most importantly, terrorist attacks. Arrest and Trial Abba was arrested en route from a press briefing in the Cameroonian city of Maroua, after having met with a local governor there on July 30, 2015. He was taken to the nation's capital, detained, and refused an attorney until October 19, nearly three months after the arrest. One news report also notes that Abba's legal statement was not recorded until November 13. This is illegal, as per both the English Common Law and the French Civil Law, legal systems followed in regions of Cameroon. Abba's trial began on February 29 of the following year, where the Court charged him of ‚Äúnon-denunciation of terrorism‚Äù, ‚Äúlaundering of the proceeds of terrorist acts‚Äù, and ‚Äúapologizing for acts of terrorism‚Äù. The military tribunal acquitted Abba from this last one. Due to an anti-terrorism law that reintroduced in 2014, some organizations feared that Abba could face the death penalty. On April 6, the Militar Prosecutor requested the death penalty. However, he changed his request days later for life imprisonment. Nearly two months afterwards, on April 24, he was sentenced to ten years of incarceration and fined 55 million Central African francs, as per his lawyer, Cl√©ment Nakong. Abba appealed this sentence, according to his lawyer. After months of jail time, he was summoned to an appeals court on August 17 and spoke his defense, which did not overturn the Court's previous sentencing. Release On December 22, 2017, Abba was released from the Yaound√© prison in which he had been held for almost 29 months. His release was met with relief and pride by the journalists and press freedom advocates worldwide. Awards and recognition On December 16, 2017, Abba was honored as an International Press Freedom Awardee by the Committee to Protect Journalists, at their annual convention in New York.

Spectroscopy is a technique used to measure the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. Her areas of expertise encompass fields such as vibrational spectroscopy, combined instrumental techniques, computerized spectroscopy, and environmental spectroscopy. She developed new techniques to solve problems like identifying contaminants in gasoline, analyzing the makeup of new plastics, and analyzing environmental problems such as pollution. During her career, Grasselli Brown has striven to bridge the gap between research and practical applications between industry and academia. She is considered one of the foremost contributors to infrared and Raman spectrometry of the 20th century.  Early life  Grasselli Brown was born in 1928 to Hungarian immigrant parents Nicholas and Vera Gecsy. She grew up in a Hungarian neighborhood in the Buckeye Road area in Cleveland, Ohio during the Great Depression. Her parents valued education and encouraged her to receive a college education in spite of economic and family difficulties. Around 1946, her father opened a business in Elyria, Ohio making sand cast aluminum parts. The foundry eventually failed and the family went bankrupt. Her brother Robert died from Hodgkin's lymphoma. While she was in college, her parents divorced.  Education  Grasselli Brown attended Harvey Rice Elementary School, Alexander Hamilton Junior High and John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio. At John Adams, she was in a college track program and planned to major in English in college. However, when she took her first chemistry class, she fell in love with the subject. Her high school chemistry teacher told her if she majored in chemistry, he would be able to get her a scholarship to his alma mater, Ohio University, which he did. Grasselli Brown graduated from John Adams High School in 1946, and attended Ohio University from 1946 to 1950. She worked in the chemistry department as an assistant and in the library. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She was the only female chemist in her class and received her Bachelor of Science summa cum laude in 1950. In 1958, she received her Master of Science in Chemistry from Case Western Reserve University. Grasselli Brown has received thirteen honorary degrees from various institutions including Ohio University (1978), Clarkson University (1986), Michigan Technology University (1989), Wilson College (1994), Case Western Reserve University (1995), Notre Dame College (1995), Kenyon College (1995), Mount Union College (1996), Cleveland State University (2000), Kent State University (2000), Ursuline College (2001), Youngstown State University (2003), and University Pecs, Hungary (2002).  Career  = Standard Oil (BP America) = After graduating from Ohio University in 1950, Grasselli Brown was offered a job position at Standard Oil (now BP America) in Cleveland as a project leader. From 1950-1978, she worked closely with an instrument called an infrared spectrometer. This device is used to measure the absorbance, emission, and reflection of infrared light interacting with a molecule and also measures the vibrations of atoms to identify functional groups. During her time at Standard Oil, Grasselli Brown used the infrared spectrometer to examine the concentration of materials, and sought to find industrial applications for it. As a project leader, she analyzed the formulations of World War II German airplane fuels to understand how the German planes were able to extend their flight ranges. She also consulted with the coroner's office in Cleveland to analyze unknown samples at crime scenes. In 1978, she became the manager of the analytical science laboratory, working there until 1983. In 1983, she became the director of the technological support department, working there until 1985 when she became the first female director of corporate research from 1985-1988. Grasselli Brown retired in January 1989 as the company's highest ranking female employee. = Post- retirement = From 1989-1995, Grasselli Brown worked as a Distinguished Visiting Professor and Director of Research Enhancement at her alma mater, Ohio University. She has also served as a chair of the Board of Trustees, chair of the Ohio Board of Regents, a Foundation Board Trustee for nine years, and a member of the Cutler Scholars Board of Governors. She has served on numerous committees and boards such as the National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Analytic Chemistry (1982-1984), the Energy Research Advisory Board of the U.S. Department of Energy (1987-1989), the visiting committee of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (1988-1991), and the Smithsonian Institution's exhibition advisory board (1990-1994). She chaired the U.S. National Committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry from 1992-1995. Grasselli Brown edited the international journal, Vibrational Spectroscopy. She is a member of the American Chemical Society, Coblentz Society, Federation of Analytical Chemistry and Spectroscopy Societies, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was the president of the Society for Applied Spectroscopy in 1970. She is active in promoting women's careers as a member of the International Women's Forum and National Research Council's Committee on Women in Science and Engineering. She is an avid supporter of women in the workplace and defends part-time work for women, equal salaries, and corporate child-care facilities. Grasselli Brown has given over a hundred talks at scientific conferences, one hundred seminars for graduate students, and over five hundred lectures to the general public. She continues to be widely requested as a speaker and consultant on industrial and environmental problems. She travels to Eastern Europe to teach the use of spectroscopy for soil, air, and water pollution issues. = Civic involvement = Grasselli Brown serves on the boards of numerous non-profit organizations such as the Cleveland Hungarian Development Panel, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Great Lakes Science Center, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Breakthru, the Holden Arboretum, Martha Holden Jennings Foundation, Musical Arts Association of the Cleveland Orchestra, One Community, IdeaStream, the Cleveland Scholarship Programs, Inc., and the Northeastern Ohio Science and Engineering Fair.  Personal life  Grasselli Brown has been married twice, to coworker Robert Grasselli (1957-1985) and to coworker Glenn Brown (1987-). Brown had two children from his previous marriage, Robin and Eric; they now have three grandchildren. Jeanette continues to use the name Grasselli since it is the name she is known by professionally.

Overview  Throughout the 10th-11th centuries the Georgian Orthodox Church come into possession of vast land holdings, turning it into ‚Äústate within a state‚Äù and clashing with the royal authority. In 1089, David IV became the King of Georgia and began to actively reform the country. In 1103 he convened the \\"Ruis-Urbnisi Church Council\\" at which he purged the clerical hierarchy of his opponents. The aim was the subjection of the church to state power, which was necessary for David given his plans of centralization and the reordering of church affairs. He gave unprecedented power to his friend and advisor George of Chqondidi. The office of the powerful Archbishop of Chqondidi was merged with that of Mtsignobartukhutsesi, chief adviser to the king on all state issues, and the new office of Chqondidel-Mtsignobartukhutsesi introduced direct royal authority into the church. The new chancellor also was given judicial powers and influence in both domestic and foreign affairs. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families. Ruis- Urbnisi Council adopted a special Code (Dzeglistsera lit. \\"pillar-writing\\"). It's believed that the author of the \\"Code\\" is Arsen Iqaltoeli, the translator of the \\"Great Nomocanon\\". It condemned Armenian Miaphysitism in stronger terms than ever before.  Sources  * Synod of Ruis-Urbnisi (1103), ed. E.

Located on Grand Avenue in the Grand Lake District, Ordinaire had its grand opening in September 2013. Ordinaire only sells natural wine, produced from organic grapes with minimal chemical and technological intervention. Owner Bradford Taylor opened Ordinaire while pursuing a Ph.D at the University of California, Berkeley with a dissertation on the sense of taste in early 20th century modernist literature. Taylor is also an organizer of an annual natural wine festival in Oakland called Brumaire, which has held events at Ordinaire. In addition to selling and serving wine, Ordinaire serves small plates and periodically partners with chefs to open as a pop-up restaurant called Bistro Ordinaire. Food and wine critics have praised Ordinaire for its selection of wines and hip yet unpretentious atmosphere. Amid a wave of interest in natural wine in the United States, Ordinaire has helped to establish Oakland as a natural wine hub. The shop has been described as an important site for natural wine culture within the East Bay, the San Francisco Bay Area, the West Coast, and the United States as a whole. Ordinaire and natural wine Ordinaire exclusively stocks and sells natural wine. Owner Bradford Taylor modeled Ordinaire after the caves √† manger‚Äîsmall natural wine shops that serve food‚Äîhe encountered while living in Paris, particularly Le Verre Vol√©, Le Chateaubriand, and Le Baratin. \\"Natural wine\\" does not have a precise formal or legal definition; however, the term is generally accepted to mean wine produced from organically farmed or biodynamic grapes, without the use (or at least, minimal use) of filtration or additives (except for preservative sulfites, which are still often avoided). Taylor has said \\"there's something productive about how nebulous the term 'natural' is, how it opens itself up to debate every time it comes up,\\" and: Ordinaire has helped to promote natural wine in the Bay Area and the United States generally, and has become an Oakland destination for tourists. Chaney Kwak of The Guardian cited Ordinaire in an article arguing that Oakland was becoming a \\"New Brooklyn\\" and a \\"creative capital to rival\\" San Francisco. According to Jordan Michelman at Sprudge, there is \\"no one true home for natural wine in America ... But there are certain addresses that help define the culture here, and among them there's none more important on the west coast than that of Oakland's Ordinaire. ... [Taylor's] vision and influence at the helm of Ordinaire has helped define natural wine in America.\\" Taylor has called the Bay Area natural wine scene \\"really nascent, in its early stages especially compared to New York or Paris,\\" but has also said that Ordinaire's proximity to other natural wine bars has \\"made Oakland an organic- and natural-wine destination for people around the United States and overseas.\\" Luke Tsai of the East Bay Express said Taylor was \\"doing God's work in helping dispense with the notion that wine shops are all stuffy, intimidating places frequented only by the rich.\\" History Taylor opened Ordinaire while he was a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley, writing his dissertation on the sense of taste in modernist literature, or specifically, on \\"the concept of taste in early 20th century literature, as it toggles between an aesthetic sensibility and a more gustatory, more physical sense of eating.\\" Taylor and his wife Nicole Betenia rented the building, a 3,000-sq ft former gym, and began renovations in October 2012. The shop was originally going to be named The Red Whale, but was renamed shortly before opening when Taylor received a cease-and-desist letter from a coffee business with the same name. The name Ordinaire was chosen after the French term vin ordinaire, which refers to everyday, \\"ordinary\\" wines that skip bottling to be served by winemakers among their friends, typically in a bistro setting. Ordinaire had a soft opening in August 2013 and its grand opening in September. The shop is located on Grand Avenue in the Grand Lake District, a neighborhood of Oakland located at the northwest corner of Lake Merritt. Taylor chose the location because it was less expensive than many of the city's other, better-established commercial districts; he also said he \\"thought it was ridiculous that this part of Oakland didn't have a shop that was an alternative to Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.\\" At the time Ordinaire opened, Taylor said that he and the staff \\"didn't know what the fuck we were doing\\" and that there was \\"a sum total of zero days of service experience between the entire staff.\\" At the time of opening, Taylor said, most patrons were unfamiliar with natural wine, and so the store sold \\"a bunch of conventional stuff just to subsidize the kinds of wines we wanted to drink.\\" By 2017, Ordinaire carried about 400 bottles in its cellar and, according to Taylor, had become \\"a producer-centered shop, so we try to buy as many cuv√©es as we can from each winemaker we support\\"‚Äîsomething wine writer Pamela S. Busch said shows \\"a certain level of support and loyalty on the buyer's part,\\" but \\"also requires the consumer to actively participate and think about what they are drinking.\\" Link is restricted to readers 21 years of age or older and requires input of birthdate for age verification. As of 2017, Taylor was living in Chicago and working to open a new shop with tastings but no bar component, which \\"won't be called Ordinaire. There's only one of those.\\" Taylor later announced that the Chicago shop will be called Diversey Wine. Since Taylor's departure to Chicago, Ordinaire has been managed by Quentin Jeanroy, with help from Alex Leopold, Kara Fowler, and Diego Perez. =Brumaire Natural Wine Festival= Along with Josh Eubank (Percy Selections), Quinn Kimsey-White (Psychic Wines), and Matt Coelho (Woods Beer), Taylor helps organize the Brumaire Natural Wine Festival, an annual Oakland- based natural wine festival that began in 2016. Brumaire was inspired by wine- tasting salons and festivals in Europe and has featured wines from California, France, Italy, and Spain. Events at Brumaire have been hosted at Ordinaire itself, with other events hosted at nearby bars and restaurants. By its third year in 2018, Brumaire hosted 51 wineries and 500 attendants, with 400 people on a wait list. Food and Bistro Ordinaire Ordinaire serves small sides for wine and food matching like cheese, charcuterie, and sardines. Ordinaire periodically opens as a pop-up restaurant called Bistro Ordinaire. The first Bistro Ordinaire pop-up opened in 2014 under the direction of Chris Kronner, who was in the process of moving his burger restaurant KronnerBurger from San Francisco to Oakland. Rather than his signature burger, Kronner served French cuisine and other fare. Kronner's Bistro Ordinaire won acclaim from Zagat, the East Bay Express, and Oakland magazine, whose Ethan Fletcher said that Kronner \\"caused a minor riot among Oakland foodies.\\" Bistro Ordinaire returned in 2017 with Kosuke Tada, a chef Taylor met in Paris, serving three-course, prix fixe French-style meals. Ordinaire partnered with the Oakland restaurant Camino for an annual lunch event called Piqnique Ordinaire. For several years, Ordinaire partnered with the nearby pizzeria Boot & Shoe Service to serve pizza at the bar. In January 2018, Ordinaire discontinued the partnership after Boot & Shoe's owner, Charlie Hallowell, was accused of sexual harassment by 17 former employees. In an announcement on Facebook, Taylor wrote \\"[c]hange will only come if corporate officers and investors are economically threatened and the current modes of production are broken. ... Remember that the food and wine community that we cherish and enjoy is not built out of abstract ideas. It is built out of humans.\\" Janelle Bitker of the East Bay Express noted the moral quandary facing restaurant patrons, who may fear that boycotting a business reported for sexual harassment could harm employees more than abusive owners; according to Bitker, Ordinaire had taken \\"a significant stand that boycotting ‚Äî as customers, suppliers, and business partners ‚Äî is the answer.\\" Reception Within a year of its grand opening, Ordinaire received positive reviews in Eater San Francisco, San Jose Mercury News, SF Weekly, Oakland Local, Wine & Spirits, The San Francisco Examiner, and Saveur. In December 2013, Eater named Ordinaire one of the 19 \\"hottest\\" wine bars to open in the United States (plus one in Montreal) in the preceding year. Ordinaire has been listed as one of the best wine bars in the United States by Thrillist (in 2014), Bon App√©tit (in 2015), and Food & Wine (in 2017). In 2018, Esquire named Ordinaire one of the 21 best bars in the United States. Jordan Michelman wrote in the wine blog Sprudge: Local news site Berkeleyside recommended Ordinaire as a natural wine merchant, noting \\"[y]es, it has a young and hipster-y vibe, but there's zero snobbery,\\" and called it \\"one of our country's greatest wine bars.\\" Pamela S. Busch wrote for The San Francisco Examiner that Ordinaire was worth visiting from San Francisco: \\"I'd come back here even if it was a hole-in-the-wall ‚Äî but it is not. Ordinaire is sophisticated without being pretentious, and this carries over to the ambiance. I wish it was closer to, if not in, San Francisco, but I get that Oakland needs to have wine bars of this caliber as well. No matter where you live in the Bay Area, Ordinaire is worth the trip.\\" Saveur editor Chris Cohen praised the selection, atmosphere, and affordability, writing \\"I usually dislike drinking wine out‚Äîsomething about seeing a wine listed for triple what I would pay in a store rubs me the wrong way. Ordinaire does things much more civilly: they're also a retail operation, and for $10 corkage they'll open anything in the shop for on-premises consumption.\\" Esther Mobley at the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that domestic and foreign natural wines were well- represented in Ordinaire's selection, but \\"[i]f it all sounds too crunchy- granola for you, there's also excellent normal-tasting wine here: Cabernet from Corison; Champagne from B√©r√®che et Fils and Laherte Freres champagne.\\" Adding that Ordinaire had \\"great\\" wines at a variety of price points, Mobley continued: \\"In the spirit of La Verre Vol√©, Ordinaire is spare, unpolished, even a little disheveled: Open boxes lie along the walls; magazines are piled on the bench of a wooden piano. It's relaxing, like you're in someone's living room. Pours are not stingy, and unsolicited top-offs are not uncommon.\\" Marissa A. Ross, the wine columnist for Bon App√©tit, is an avowed fan of Ordinaire. In her 2017 book Wine. All the Time.: The Casual Guide to Confident Drinking, Ross wrote \\"I trust my favorite wine shops so much you would assume I was of blood relation to their owners. Places like Domaine LA, Lou, or Ordinaire know me better than I know myself.\\" In an article on natural wine for Bon App√©tit co-written by Ross and Belle Cushing, the two opined: \\"A natural wine bar‚Äîwhether it's Ordinaire in Oakland or Sub Rosato in Richmond, VA‚Äîis a modern version of Cheers, with hand-harvested pinots instead of pints. And even if no one knows your name (yet), you might recognize some labels on the wall‚Äîa sign that you're among friends.\\" See also *Natural wine *Organic wine *Biodynamic wine *California wine *The Alley ‚Äî a piano bar on Grand Avenue across the street from Ordinaire References External links * OrdinaireWine.com ‚Äì official website * * \\"Introducing Ordinaire\\" ‚Äì an article by owner Bradford Taylor for the UC Berkeley English Department at the time of Ordinaire's opening, via the Internet Archive Category:Wine bars Category:California wine Category:Drinking establishments in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Culture of Oakland, California Category:Tourist attractions in Oakland, California Category:2013 establishments in California Category:Restaurants established in 2013 Category:Organic food ","title":"Ordinaire (wine bar)"},{"id":"56958052","text":"Squalidus japonicus is a species of cyprinid fish found in Japan and the Korean peninsula.

His career as an artist started in 1968 by participating in a government-funded carving program. Working with the primary medium of fossilized whale bone, Ashevak created approximately 250 sculptures in his lifetime, and explored themes of shamanism and Inuit spirituality through playful depictions of human figures, angakuit (shamans), spirits, and Arctic wildlife. In 1970, the Canadian Eskimo Art Council held the Centennial competition in Yellowknife. Ashevak's sculptures won third prize in that competition, and he became a recognizable artist after his solo exhibition at the American Indian Art Centre in New York in 1973. Unlike other Inuit primitivist carvings, Ashevak's work abandoned cultural references and adopted a modern expressionistic style, which visually appealed to a broader audience than collectors of Inuit art. An extensive collection of Ashevak's sculptures went on solo or group exhibitions at commercial galleries around the world, including Franz Bader Gallery at Washington, D.C., Lippel Gallery in Montreal, the Upstairs Gallery in Winnipeg and the Inuit Gallery in Toronto. Ashevak's works were also widely traded on the auction market. Despite his short and tragic passing ‚Äî he died in October 1974 from a house fire, Ashevak was crucial to the development of Inuit sculpture by visualizing an imaginative world with supernatural beings and shamanistic practices.  Early life  Ashevak was born in 1940 in the Kitikmeot Region, of the central Arctic of Nunavut. Like many Netsilik youths, he lived a traditional Inuit life by acquiring hunting skills that were necessary to support himself in later life. However, Ashevak grew up at a time when the establishment of wage-earning settlements rapidly replaced the Eskimo lifestyle and economy. In the past, Netsilik people lived in small communities and worked as nomadic hunters. Since they moved off the land to Spence Bay (Taloyoak), they were forced to adopt a southern-style economy such as living in a house and having a stable job. Ashevak and his wife Doris moved into the settlement in 1968. During that time, Abjon Bromfield, the Arts and Crafts officer at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories received a shipment of two carvings from Spence Bay. These Inuit carvings were highly appreciated in Ottawa and inspired people's interest in purchasing more sculptures from the region. Therefore, a carving program was funded by the government in Spence Bay, and sculptor Algie Malauskas was hired to teach Inuit people some fundamental sculpture techniques. Ashevak soon joined the program because he could no longer support his family by hunting, and carving was one of the well-paid alternatives to earn a livelihood. Ashevak's official entrance into the art world was in 1970, where he participated in the Centennial competition in Yellowknife, held by the Canadian Eskimo Art Council. Ashevak's sculptures, Bird and Drum Dancer won third prize and an honourable mention respectively. In 1972, Avrom Isaacs collected Ashevak's works to organize a solo exhibition at the Inuit Gallery in Toronto. The show was financially successful in which about 30 pieces of Ashevak's sculptures became trendy among the public and sold well. However, this exhibition did not make Ashevak famous. His reputation was firmly established after the exhibition at the American Indian Art Centre in New York in 1973.  Career  In 1968, Karoo Ashevak settled in Taloyoak where his career began through an arts and crafts program sponsored by the government. His style evolved into the well-known \\"expressionistic style\\" in the Kitikmeot area in the early 1970s. His works are inspired by stories told to him in his childhood by his father. Many of his sculptures have wide noses, gaping mouths, and uneven eyes. His art is admired for this originality and abnormal appearance. While some people praised his work, others considered it too grotesque. The majority of his artistic production occurred from 1971 to 1974. During this time, he was unknown in the art market, nonetheless, he held several exhibitions where his work appealed to the majority and sold in mass amounts. He was first noticed in Yellowknife when he entered the Centennial competition in 1970 organized by the Canadian Eskimo Art Council. It was not until his late artistic career that he gained recognition. He is now acknowledged as an important artist in Canadian Inuit art. He was not exclusively recognized until spring of 1972 when Avrom Isaacs used Karoo's sculptures in a one-man exhibition at the Inuit Gallery in Toronto. Despite its success, it did not make him famous he was mainly known to those associated with Eskimo art. Finally, in January 1973, his exhibition at the American Indian Art Centre in New York established his local fame and overall reputation in the eastern U.S. and Canada. This marked the height of his career, just a year prior to his death.  Media  In the 1970s, Ashevak favoured and used predominantly aged whale bones as his medium. During his artistic years, whale bones would be imported to the community through charter planes from Somerset Island because this material was sparse while demands were higher than the inventory. They were not readily available in Spence Bay and many other carvers were seeking it for their artistic production. Historically, bones were used in Taloyoak to make tools and weapons. It was not until the settlement began its carving production that bone was used as the main medium, with whale bone being the material used for the first carving produced. Both the prehistoric Thule people and the later colonialist European whalers left mass amounts of whale bone. These aged bones experienced inconsistent and prolonged exposure from Arctic conditions. This altered their qualities and features, such as their density and colour. Whale bones needed to be aged for approximately 50 to 100 years before it is qualified for carving. If the material is partially aged or dried, it may smell or shrink while working with the material. Whale bone is an inconsistent medium that varies in colour from a white to a cream, to brown, and to nearly black. Moreover, they have a range from very dense to extremely fragile bone consistency. Bones may also transform from one density to another, which makes the material difficult to work with. For example, sometimes bone can become extremely hard to the point that it is nearly impossible to carve. Additionally, they may crack or split before, during, and after carving. Cracks that occur during the production process can be integrated into the final piece, however, splits that appear after carving often destroy the piece. His medium choice could be a result of the insufficient amount of materials for sculpting in the community or a liking for light materials rather than media such as stones or ivory. Even though Ashevak used fossilized whale bone as his primary medium, he would incorporate local materials, such as stone, caribou antler and baleen, and walrus ivory, as additional supplements. Ashevak first chooses his idea for his sculpture before he selects the medium or media that he would use. He took advantage of the preexisting shapes of the material and manipulates the bone in order to illustrate his ideas and the work's theme. Also, he tended to reassembled and fashioned different pieces taken from different parts of the whale to conform to his design concept, rather than carving from a solid piece of bone. For example, he inserts whale baleen as the eyes and mouths.Maria Von Finckenstein, \\"The Art of Survival,\\" in Hidden in Plain Sight: Contributions of Aboriginal Peoples to Canadian Identity and Culture, ed. David R. Newhouse, Cora J. Voyageur, and Dan Beavon (Toronto: University of Toronto Press Incorporated, 2005), 79.  Ashevak and the art market  According to Leon Lippel, Ashevak's sculptures evoked an overwhelmingly affirmative response at his own time. Between 1972 and 1974, the artist had several successful exhibitions, and his works sold very well on the art market. Ashevak's sculptures were universal in message and appeal, which was strikingly different from most Inuit art. Max Wheitzenhoffer from the Gimpel- Wheitzenhoffer gallery stated that he \\"never looked at Ashevak‚Äôs pieces as Eskimo art.\\" Inuit sculptures followed a narrative tradition by depicting legends, events or social activities that were well known among Inuit communities. In contrast, Ashevak's sculptures abandoned this illustrative tradition. Each of his pieces portrays an individual being with no cultural references to particular myths, stories or events. Therefore, Ashevak's work could speak to the audience who did not have any knowledge of the Inuit culture and attract the audience based on its purely aesthetic values. There were two distinctive characteristics of Ashevak's early exhibitions. First, his sculptures were strongly appealing to non-Inuit art collectors, including those who did not regularly collect. Second, people were astonished by Ashevak's work and reacted immediately with tremendous enthusiasm. Ashevak became a recognizable figure in Canada and the United States shortly after his exhibitions at the Inuit Gallery of Toronto (1972) and the American Indian Arts Centre in New York (1973). It normally took a while for the audience to embrace a new artistic style, but they fell in love with Ashevak's work at once.  Works and shamanism  Ashevak's sculptures present a fantasy of spirits and supernatural beings bursting with powerful emotions. His figures embody wide eyes, gaping mouths, distorted body features and incised lines, which are directly related to Inuit religion (shamanism). Angakuit (shamans) are people with special powers that enable them to act as a mediator between the temporal world and the spiritual world. Shamanism is based on the animistic belief that a spirit could exist in every being and take different forms. Some spirits are friendly to human beings, and they function as helping spirits to assist angakuit performing supernatural tasks. In contrast to the helping spirits, evil spirits attack or eat humans, and they would bring misfortune and disasters to the community. Angakuit could protect people from evil spirits by acquiring helping spirits that are frequently seen in polar bears, birds and walrus.Asen Balikci, The Netsilik Eskimo (Prospect Heights, Ill: Waveland Press, 1989), 198. Ashevak portrayed various helping spirits in animal forms such as Bear (1973), Flying Walrus (1972), and a mystical four- legged creature with wings. Another favourite subject of Ashevak's sculptures are birds. Some of them have prey in their mouths, while others embody unusual features such as human arms (1972), or experience a human-bird transformation. Birds are associated with the angakkuq magical flights. In the Netsilik tradition, angakuit could be transformed into birds, and travel to all regions in the cosmos. During their magical journeys, angakuit fly into the sky, the land of the dead, and even to the homes of ancient Inuit deities. Ashevak depicted these shamanistic flights through his sculptures of Flying Figure (1971) and Shaman (1973), where the angakuits‚Äô bodies are represented in a flying position. Ashevak untitled most of his works, but one of the very few sculptures which had a title was directly related to shamanism. In the Inuit culture, one needs to take an apprenticeship to become a angakkuq. The angakkuq candidate needs to receive formal training from an elder, which helps him gain skills and powers that are necessary to fulfil his future position. By the end of the practice, an elder angakkuq would transmit his power to the young angakkuq by placing his hands on the young shaman's head. Ashevak's work, Coming and Going of the Shaman (1973) represents the transformation of powers between two angakuit. This sculpture has two heads of different sizes that share one body. The angakkuq with the larger head is disappearing as he passes his powers to the angakkuq with the smaller head. Ashevak's choices of subjects also came from dreams, childhood stories and hunting scenes. Dream was a crucial element of Inuit culture, especially in the Netsilik community. Ashevak's sculpture, Drum Dancer was inspired by his dream of a man with three arms. Other visual elements in Ashevak's creations included varying sizes and shapes of eyes. According to the shamanistic belief, certain spirits acted as the angakkuq eyes, and they could fly over long distance and report to the angakkuq what they had seen. Moreover, Ashevak's use of incised lines was related to the Thule culture. In his sculptures, Bird of 1970 and 1971, incised lines are used to depict the skeleton of the birds, which is a typical characteristic of shamanism.  Personal life  Ashevak was known for having a distinctive personality among the Inuit artists by being openly expressive about his emotions. It was uncommon for Inuit adults to display their feelings because they highly valued the idea of Ihuma, which was the ability of emotional restraint. Ihuma was a significant indigenous personality, and the grown-ups exercised Ihuma by hiding their joy or anger in front of the public. However, Ashevak freely vented his emotions, and sometimes he even displayed aggressive and antagonistic behaviours. Ashevak enjoyed the creative process of carvings, and he took enormous pride in his work. Although the artist was aware of the market value of his sculptures, he priced them accurately by himself. Carving was the primary resource of Ashevak's income, but money was not the only factor to inspire his continuous creations. Ashevak's favourite part of sculpture was to apply finishing touches, which gave the final piece distinctive details. Ashevak respected the originality of carvings, and he became irritated when other sculptors copied his works since he did not know how to deal with the imitators. In August 1974, Ashevak's life started to come to a tragic end. His adopted son, Lary, was killed by dogs. On October 19 of the same year, Ashevak and his wife Doris both died in a fire that destroyed their house.  Achievements  Ashevak established a well-known reputation in his community and the nearby area of Uqsuqtuc, otherwise recognized as Gjoa Haven, during his artistic career. His work inspired a whole generation of Kitikmeot carvers. Although he only created about 250 sculptures during his short artistic career, his works have been included in multiple exhibitions and continue to be widely collected as well as traded on the art market and during auctions. They are also included in many corporate and museum collections. He executed solo exhibitions in Toronto, Montreal, and New York. When he was first officially noticed in 1970 during the Centennial competition in Yellowknife, he won third prize and honourable mention for his entries of Bird and Drum Dancer, respectively. This was the beginning of his successful career. Ashevak's early exhibitions between 1972 and 1974 had very successful outcomes as many works were sought after and sold even though he was not well- known yet. Two features that make these exhibitions stand out is the type of purchaser and the audience reaction. The sculptures were popular amongst Eskimo and non-Eskimo art collectors as well as people who normally do not collect Eskimo art. The audience were also immediately captivated by his work, especially in exhibitions at the Inuit Gallery in Toronto and the American Indian Arts Centre in New York. Theatrical producer, Max Weitzenhoffer, ranked Ashevak as one of the top contemporary Canadian sculptors because he viewed Askevak's work apart and unique from the other Inuit artists‚Äô production. He believes that they are universally accepted and appeal to a mass majority. Scholar, George Swinton, compared him to Henry Moore who is a well-known English artist famous for his sculptures.

She fled to the United Kingdom in 2010.  Early life and education  Mahmoud was born in Wau, Sudan and raised as a Sunni Muslim. In primary school art class, she drew a picture of Allah, which is considered forbidden by most Muslims, and her teacher punished her for it. Mahmoud was disgruntled by the fact that she did not enjoy the same rights as boys and men, that she couldn't draw or sculpt what she wanted, or keep a dog as a pet, that she was not allowed to ask critical questions, and that she could not learn about evolution. Mahmoud studied ecology at the University of Khartoum, and worked for the Science Students Association. At university she came across a professor who opposed the Omar al-Bashir regime; he had just been released from jail where he had been tortured for teaching the theory of evolution. This revelation shocked her and made her feel like she 'didn't exist in Sudan as woman, as a scientist'. ‚ÄúThese incidents made me gradually refuse Islam until I completely renounced it and became an atheist.‚Äù This made life even more difficult for her, because under Sudanese law, apostasy could be punishable by the death penalty. Mahmoud resolved that she no longer wanted to live under Sharia in Sudan, and eventually fled to the UK in 2010.  Activism  = Sharia interview controversy = Nahla Mahmoud on Islamic hate speech and apostasy culture in the UK. Mahmoud became a spokesperson for the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain (CEMB). In this capacity she appeared in a short (1 minute, 39 seconds) televised interview on Channel 4's 4thought.tv in January 2013 to give her perspective on \\"What does Sharia law have to offer Britain?\\". She recounted how she grew up living under Sharia in Sudan, where she was ‚Äòalways dealt with as a second-class citizen, always brought up to believe that I am an incomplete human being [who] needed a man as a guard.‚Äô Mahmoud found it astonishing that Britain, the country she had fled to escape Islamic rule, maintained a similar system of sharia courts, arguing that ‚ÄòEveryone should have equal rights and live under one secular law.‚Äô This interview led her to be targeted by an Islamist hate campaign, led by Salah Al Bander, director of the Sudan Civic Foundation and a former LibDem councillor in Cambridge City Council, who called Mahmoud a ‚ÄòKafira‚Äô (unbeliever) on a Sudanese Arabic website. He stated that ‚ÄòI will not forgive anyone who wants to start a battle against Islam and the beliefs of the people‚Äô. When mosques and Sudanese newspapers took up the campaign against her, Mahmoud received numerous death threats and both she and her family in Sudan were harassed; her brother over there was physically attacked. Even the official Facebook page of the Sudanese Armed Forces called Mahmoud an infidel and apostate. The local LibDem leader, Spencer Hagard, who investigated Al Bander, saw no fault in his behaviour, and even regarded him more highly than before. Mahmoud filed a complaint with the police, but received no protection, and instead got the suggestion to keep quiet about her views. = Ex-Muslim rights = Nahla Mahmoud and Maryam Namazie discuss apostasy in Sudan and the Meriam Ibrahim case (2014). At the Secular Conference 2014, Mahmoud highlighted the aggression from Islamists faced by ex-Muslims, critics of Islam, atheists of all backgrounds, and anti-traditional liberal Muslims, commenting that it was \\"really scary\\" that a 2011 Policy Exchange survey found that 34% of British Muslims aged 16 to 24 supported the death penalty for apostasy. She rebuked the regressive left attitude of some Westerners who dismiss any kind of criticism of Islam as 'islamophobia', and ignore Islamic intolerance in the spirit of 'multiculturalism'. Mahmoud has estimated that during the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, there have been between 120 and 170 Sudanese citizens who have been convicted for apostasy, most of whom repented to avoid a death sentence. Mahmoud appeared in Among Nonbelievers (2015), a Dutch documentary on HUMAN about the situation of ex-Muslims worldwide. = Environmentalism = Mahmoud is an environmentalist who is passionate about nature, and received training as an ecologist. In her 2013 research paper \\"Climate Change and Violent Conflicts in East Africa\\" for the Evelyn Oldfield Unit, she sought to \\"[question] the traditional analyses of conflicts, which rely primarily on ethnic, religious, and cultural explanations since these do not take account of the increasingly obvious link between the growing scarcity of renewable resources and violent conflict in the three East African countries [Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. Shortages of cropland, fresh water, woodland, pasture and marine resources cannot be ignored.\\"  References  Category:British human rights activists Category:British secularists Category:British former Muslims Category:Former Muslim critics of Islam Category:English atheists Category:English ecologists Category:English environmentalists Category:English women writers Category:Former Muslims turned agnostics or atheists Category:Sudanese former Muslims Category:Sudanese women writers Category:Sudanese emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:British critics of Islam Category:Opposition to Islam in the United Kingdom ","title":"Nahla Mahmoud"},{"id":"56958326","text":"Edward Schweiger was an Anglican priestswvic, Merino & Henty Church of England, South Western Victoria, Australia in the first half of the 20th century.

Background The operation divided the battalion into three groups: * \\"Romeu Grouping\\"-1st Company of Commandos- Captain Ant√≥nio Ramos * \\"Bombox Grouping\\"-2nd Company of Commandos- Captain Matos Gomes * \\"Centauro Grouping\\"-3rd Company of Commandos- Captain Raul Folques After embarkation of the Battalion of Commandos onto a Large Landing Craft (LDG), which was then escorted by two LFDs the unit landed in Gantur√© and attended a briefing in Bigene. The Operation The operation began at 11:50pm north. The first contact with the forces of the PAIGC was triggered by the Bombox Group after initial aerial bombardment by Fiat G.91 aircraft. At 5:30am on 19 May, the column's head reached the route that supported the Cumbamori base, the main objective of the operation. The Bombox Group passed north of the road, the Centauro Group occupied positions to the south and the Grouping Romeu was installed in the rear, in a small town. At 8:00am and 8:00pm, air strikes were conducted by Fiat G.91 fighter-bombers, which destroyed the base's bunkers, and the guerrillas munitions were on fire for a period of time. At 9:05am the Bombox Group performed the initial assault, causing the first contact with the PAIGC forces. This fighting took place from the 14th and 10th, when the commander of the operation ordered the Centauro Group to support a rupture of contact between its forces and those of the PAIGC. It was an operation of great difficulty, because the fighters on both sides were very close to each other. The Centaur Group commander was wounded. At 14:30, the Commando Battalion began to move to the collection base, and at 6:20pm its first elements arrived in Guidaje. On 20 May the battalion left Guidaje for Sinta, on foot, leaving there their wounded and the military who were not in conditions to continue the march. In Sinta, the battalion embarked on an LDG to return to Bissau. Aftermath During the operation, the Battalion suffered ten troops killed, twenty-two troops seriously wounded, and three troops missing, estimated to have caused sixty-seven deaths, among which, according to information later obtained in Senegal, a Cuban physician and surgeon and four Mauritanians.

Before the conclusion of the campaign, Romania joined the Allies after King Michael's Coup. These engagements were a part of the naval Black Sea campaigns. Background As during the first 1941 campaign, the 1942 campaign and the 1943 campaign, the Soviet Navy sent submarines against the Axis supply lines along the western coast of the Black Sea: at the beginning of the year however the Soviet Navy possessed only 16 operative submarines.Richard Compton-Hall,Richard Compton-Hall, Submarines at War 1939‚Äì45, 2004, p.127 German U-boats of the 30th U-boat Flotilla operated on the eastern sites of Black Sea, attacking Soviet targets. The Romanian Navy employed the newly built submarines NMS Marsuinul and NMS Rechinul but without scoring success. It also inherited five CB-class midget submarines left by Italy, however only two of them were operable by July 1944 and were not used in offensive action. Engagements * On 16 January, U-20 torpedoed and sunk the Soviet tanker \\"Vaijan Kutur‚Äôe\\" (7602 GRT) off Cape Anakria. After the war, the tanker was raised on 6 October 1945, to return in service only in 1954 until 1975. * On 17 January, Soviet submarine L-23 was sunk by German submarine chaser UJ-106. * On 17 February, Soviet submarine ShCh-216 was sunk by German submarine chasers UJ-103 and UJ-106. * On 31 March, German submarine U-9 was attacked in Fedosia harbor by 18 Il-2 attack aircraft, suffering damage from strafing fire and bomb explosions. The submarine commander operated the 20mm AA gun himself and was wounded in the process. Two aircraft were claimed as hit by gunners. * On 5 April, German submarine U-23 was attacked by two Soviet patrol boats. The Germans believed to have sunk one of the attackers during the resulting surface battle but Patrol Boat SKA-099 was only damaged. * On 7 April, the Soviet barge \\"Rion\\" (187 GRT) sunk due to a mine laid by German submarine U-20 off Poti on 27 February. * On 18 April, the Soviet submarine L-6 was sunk by convoy escorts after a failed attack on the Romanian merchant \\"Alba Julia\\" (5700 BRT). Romanian sources claim the submarine was sunk by the Romanian gunboat NMS Sublocotenent Ghiculescu aided by the German submarine chaser UJ-104,Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, Glorie »ôi dramƒÉ: Marina RegalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, 1940‚Äì1945, Ion Cristoiu Publishing, 2000, p. 139Nicolae Koslinski, Raymond StƒÉnescu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ in al doilea rƒÉzboi mondial: 1944‚Äì1945, FƒÉt-Frumos Publishing, 1996, p. 364 while other sources indicate the German vessel as solely responsible for the sinking. * On 25 April, German submarine U-18 endured a friendly-fire attack from a German BV-138 flying boat, suffering minor damage. * On 11 May, German submarine U-9 suffered minor damage due to depth charges from a Soviet escort vessel off Yalta. On the same day the submarine attacked a Soviet convoy, scoring a torpedo hit on the Soviet torpedo boat Shtorm. The later was not sunk but damaged and had to be towed in port. On the same day, Soviet submarine L-4 torpedoed and damaged the German tanker \\"Friederike\\" (7327 GRT) off Costanta. * Between 11 and 12 May, Romanian submarine NMS Marsuinul suffered extensive friendly-fire attacks from German and Croat Anti-submarine forces, before heading to Soviet waters to attempt attacking ship traffic. While suffering no damage, multiple Soviet attacks with depth-charges and aircraft forced the submarine to sail back without any offensive actions. Marsuinul at sea * On 12 May, German submarine U-24 torpedoed and sunk Soviet patrol boat SKA-0367 off Poti. On the same day, Soviet submarine A-4 finished with torpedo the already damaged (by air attack) German transport German \\"Geiserich\\" (712 GRT) south- west of the Crimea.https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/5808.html A-5 on uboat.net * On 27 May, German submarine U-24 fought a surface battle with two Soviet patrol boats off Poti, suffering 1 man killed and two wounded. * On 29 May, German submarine U-23 torpedoed and sunk the Soviet tug \\"Smelyj\\" (71 tons) off Babushery. * On 19 June, German submarine U-20 torpedoed and sunk the unescorted Soviet passenger ship \\"Pestel'\\" (1850 GRT). Soviets claimed the vessel was sunk within the territorial waters of Turkey while the escort was waiting to meet her. * On 27 June, German submarine U-20 sunk the Soviet landing craft DB-26 with gunfire and demolition charges. * On the same day, Romanian submarine NMS Rechinul suffered minor damage after depth charges were launched by Soviet submarine chasers. Other attacks during this second (and last) mission of the submarine caused no damage but prevented her to achieve victories. * On 27 June, German submarine U-19 torpedoed and sunk the Soviet barge \\"Barzha\\" (No 75) (app. 1000 tons) off Tuapse. The barge was empty and towed alongside another one by Soviet tug Verzhilov while under escort of patrol boats and flying boats. * On 20 July, Soviet submarine ShCh-209 sunk the Turkish sailing vessel \\"Semsi Bahri\\" (26 GRT) with gunfire off Bosporus. * On 5 August, Soviet submarine ShCh-215 sunk the refugee ship Mefkure (52 GRT) with gunfire and torpedoes, killing 305 Jewish refugees.

The ship had been part of an escorted convoy and Soviets believed she was carrying soldiers.https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/5046.html Barzha ShCh-215 on uboat.net * On 20 August, Soviet aircraft accomplished a large raid inside Costanza harbor, sinking U-9 and heavily damaging U-18 and U-24 (both were unable to sail as consequence of the damage and were scuttled to prevent capture when Romania joined the Allies). * On 24 August, Soviet submarine ShCh-215 torpedoed and sunk the Bulgarian sailing vessel \\"Vita\\" (180 GRT) off Cape Emine.https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/5046.html ShCh-215 on uboat.net Engagements after Romania joined the Allies *On 1 September, German submarine U-23 fired three torpedoes into the harbour of Costanza. While a Romanian destroyer was claimed as hit, in reality the only damage was suffered by Romanian tanker Oituz (2,686 GRT), which sank at her moorings. The vessel was later refloated and declared a total loss.https://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ship/3344.html Oituz on uboat.net *On 2 September, the Soviet Fugas-class minesweeper T-410 Vzryv was sailing alongside the Romanian Admiral Murgescu off Costanca when she was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine U-19, being the last Soviet vessel sunk by a U-boat in the Black Sea. The Soviets accused the Romanian Navy (by the time allies) of complicity with the enemy because the Romanian minelayer was not attacked. This was later cited as justification for the seizure of the Romanian fleet.https://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ship/3346.html BTSC-410 Vzryv (No 25) on uboat.net *On 11 September, after running out of fuel and with no harbor open to them, the crews of U-19, U-20 and U-23 scuttled their boats off Turkey, ending the German naval presence in the Black Sea. Outcome The German anti-submarine capabilities in 1944 effectively neutralized the threat of Soviet submarines in the Black Sea.John F. O'Connell, Submarine Operational Effectiveness in the 20th Century: Part Two (1939‚Äì1945), 2011, p. 201 On the other hand, a combination of heavy Soviet anti-submarine actions prevented the 2 newly built Romanian submarines to achieve successes, while the 30th U-boat Flotilla was effectively eliminated by the combined effect of an air raid on Costanta on 20 August and the following King Michael's Coup (negating the survived U-boats a safe harbor and forcing their scuttling).

It was initiated through a series of discussions between Warren Neidich and Mathieu Copelands in 2010 in Paris and New York City. But the series of instruments for its production, like the role of the roll of dice, the picking of cut up names out of a hat and the rules of engagement, see below, came later through discussions between Warren Neidich and Eric Angles. These were further formulated when the program was initiated and programmed by artist friends Elena Bajo, Eric Angl√®s, Jakob Schillinger, Nathalie Angl√®s, and Warren Neidich, offering \\"an experimental and contradictory artistic and curatorial approach\\", notably a set of rules, defining when, where, and who by, artistic interventions would take place. The project was established in the loaned storefront of a luxury condominium development at 211 Elizabeth Street. Being close to the New Museum, and two blocks from Prada and Armani, Exhibition spoke not only to the current economic climate, following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, but the problems of art treated as a (luxury) commodity. About Exhibition, Artist Diana Artus wrote: \\"The most important principle was that only one exhibition will be shown, during which time it will be in continuous development, as new people ‚Äì artists, curators, and others known by the initiators ‚Äì are invited to participate\\", she also wrote that \\"a fundamental aim was to provoke differences of opinion, rather than placate them.\\" Exhibition (211) exhibited over 50, and up to 100 artists, including: Boshko Boskovic, Mathieu Copeland, Loretta Fahrenholz, Donna Huanca, Sean Raspet, Alexis Knowlton, Liz Magic Laser, David Levine, An Te Lieu, Jen Liu, Jason Loebs, Emily Mast, Amy Patton, Georgia Sagri, Alexandre Singh Mark Tribe, and B. Wurtz. Although each artist's work was not specifically identified due to the rules of adaptation and evolution involved in their participation.  Rules  The approach, guided by a set of rules, became integral to the forms and conversations that pursued. Elena Bajo, Eric Angl√®s, Jakob Schillinger, Nathalie Angl√®s, and Warren Neidich discussed many potential artists to be invited, the names of which were then put into, and subsequently drawn from a hat. The artist would then be invited to space and asked if they would work with the concept and requirements: * 1. The artist is drawn from a hat. * 2. The artist works in one of six areas determined by a roll of dice. * 3. The artist could then decide to add to, modify or clear out the section before going on. * 1. The work is not for sale and belongs to no one. * 2. The work is an intervention upon interventions. * 3. The work can be modified, parasitized and destroyed. On May 12, 2009, Kemi Ilesanmi described Exhibition for Art 21 Magazine: \\"at least every three days, there is a new artist intervention, and while they can make whatever manner of changes inside the space, artists may not remove their own art works afterwards.\\"'' The approach of Exhibition echoed the cut-up technique by Bryon Gysin and William S. Burroughs, which is also visible in Warren Neidich's own artistic practice. > The method is simple. Here is one way to do it. Take a page. Like this page. > Now cut down the middle and cross the middle. You have four sections: 1 2 3 > 4 ... one two three four. Now rearrange the sections placing section four > with section one and section two with section three. And you have a new > page. Sometimes it says much the same thing. Sometimes something quite > different--(cutting up political speeches is an interesting exercise)--in > any case you will find that it says something and something quite definite. > Take any poet or writer you fancy. Heresay, or poems you have read over many > times. The words have lost meaning and life through years of repetition. Now > take the poem and type out selected passages. Fill a page with excerpts. Now > cut the page. You have a new poem. As many poems as you like. As many > Shakespeare Rimbaud poems as you like.  Topics and discussions  Reflecting on the standard exhibition format, where \\"under the right light and organized by a strict aesthetic, the works displayed and valued are typically individual, finished objects\\", Diana Artus explained that exhibitions are therefore generally complicit with capitalism: \\"extolling the rules of a market society\\". Contrasting to this Exhibition worked against this system, \\"when an exhibition diverges from this format, the result is revealing not only art's continual complicity with capitalism, but also how, and with what consequences, the notion of such a ritual could be reconfigured\\". As a summary of the type of engagement between the collaborators in Exhibition Artus said at the end of her article: \\"The notion of striving in a competitive world is reinterpreted in such a way that is promising: not only are we struggling against each other, but ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì for each other.\\" In an important dialogue between the founders, published by Art Lies, Elena Bajo further mused on the problem of capital explicit in exhibition formats: \\"Perhaps limiting actions to a specific site, which is free of rent, and creating a temporary time-frame of six months and a set of rules in which chance and conversation play a significant role frees us from the dangers of capitalistic assimilation that beset most large cultural institutions that rely on private funding.\\" \\"What is beyond doubt is the amazing density of heady conceptualizing and self-reflexive musing this echo chamber has been injecting into our daily conversation.\\" said Eric Angl√®s, emphasizing that the social engagement became the most important factor, \\"what might at first glance look like a theater of freedom and constraint, the rehearsal of a tired dialectic between an artist/curator enforcing the law and an artist/Houdini dancing her way out of those shackles, is far more immediately and compellingly an experimental site where each one of us present in this space is made to decide, over and over again, how to face one other.\\" Given the complexity of the project, little documentation remains. Warren Neidich discussed the question of the archive \\"when this experiment closes on the last day of August, what traces will be left for future audiences now transformed into historical readers? Is having a physical archive a complete contradiction to the spirit of the project? Or is it a form of generosity?\\" References External links * Exhibition 211 on Blogspot Category:Art exhibitions in the United States Category:Art in New York City Category:2009 in New York City ","title":"Exhibition 211"},{"id":"56958555","text":"The Old Bank of England, Fleet Street, London The Old Bank of England is a public house at 194 Fleet Street, where the City of London meets the City of Westminster.

The film's script was written by Aleksandr Mindadze and was based on the final part of the trilogy by Ukrainian writer Yevgeny Gutsalo, novel Planet Parade. Party primary contest 42nd Venice International Film Festival. Plot The film takes place in the USSR in 1984. Six forty-year-old men are cut off from ordinary life by draft for military reservists, the last one at their age. They represent a cross-section of the Soviet society of that time: an astronomer, a butcher from a shop, a factory worker, a loader, an architect, and a trolleybus driver (elected as people's deputy). Some of them know each other due to previous guerrilla assemblies and are friendly with each other, but by their own admission rarely spend time together ‚Äî the reasons include work, mundane everyday life which leaves little time for leisure and, in general, differing interests and values. During the military exercises, their artillery battery, having successfully completed the task, was destroyed by the enemy, and the heroes, as ordered by the command, are seemingly dying. Thus, until the end of assembly, they remain in reserve for a few more days. Having missed the train to the city at the station, the heroes, having become \\"spirits from the other world\\", decide to finish the war game. After leaving the training field of battle, the men begin a transcendental journey: they get to a city populated by only beautiful and solitary women. Having sailed across the river from this temptation, the detachment spends the night on the island and, taking the traveling chemist with them, end up in a retirement home, where by a clerk's mistake they are taken for a team of technicians from the repair construction office. In the retirement home, the feeble-minded old lady mistakes Herman Kostin for her son Fedya, who disappeared during the war. By the will of the circumstances, Herman-Fedya is forced to play this role for several hours, during which he sums up the not very pleasant aspects of his life. Late in the evening, seven travelers with all the elderly inhabitants are trying to observe the mysterious planet parade.

She reared butterflies and moths from eggs and her work contributed to understanding of the Lepidoptera life cycle. The summer form of the Polygonia c-album butterfly species, known as the comma, is named hutchinsoni in her honour.  Early life  Born as Emma Sarah Gill in 1820, she married Thomas Hutchinson, the vicar of Grantsfield near Kimbolton, in 1847 and spent most of her life in Herefordshire. Hutchinson's interest in butterflies and moths started when her young son captured a swallow-tailed moth.  Scientific practice  Hutchinson devoted much of her life to the study butterflies and moths, the insect order Lepidoptera. She became known during her lifetime for her skills in rearing butterflies and moths from eggs. She bred the pinion-spotted pug moth for 31 years. Her work contributed to a better understanding of the life cycle of Lepidoptera. She corresponded with well-known entomologists such as Edward Newman, Henry Doubleday, William Buckler, and Henry Tibbats Stainton. In the Victorian era entomology was fashionable and natural history societies were well attended. Hutchinson's 1879 book Entomology and Botany as Pursuits for Ladies went on to become a popular scientific publication. In it she encouraged women to study butterflies instead of just collecting them. In 1881 her letter on the possible decline of the Polygonia c-album butterfly species, known as the comma, was published in The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation. Hutchinson had studied the habits of the comma for 50 years and put forward the thesis that its decline in Kent was due to the burning of the hop vine after harvest, destroying the larvae and pupae. Hutchinson participated in efforts to reintroduce the comma to parts of England, including Surrey, by collecting comma larvae and pupae in Herefordshire and introducing them into the wild elsewhere. But Hutchinson was convinced that these efforts were hindered by naturalists who collected adult butterflies as specimens for their collections.  Legacy  In 1937 Hutchinson's collection of 20,000 butterflies and moths was exhibited in the Natural History Museum. Hutchinson's notebooks are held in the library of the Herford Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club. The summer form of the Polygonia c-album butterfly species, known as the comma, is named hutchinsoni in her honour.

She served in the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia during her entire career, and may be remembered in the Calendar of saints on September 24. Early life Alexander was born shortly after the American Civil War on St. Simon's Island, Georgia to former slave Daphne Alexander and her husband James Alexander (known by his nickname Aleck). Her birth date was not recorded, and she later gave various different dates, in part because she feared that she would be forbidden to continue to work in her final years as too old (later diocesan records list it as 1878 and her death certificate lists 1880).http://deaconessalexander.georgiaepiscopal.org The various women named Anna Alexander in the 1870 census for Georgia all have different parents. The 1880 U.S. census for Brunswick in Glynn County, Georgia shows a white Anna Alexander as 11 years old (and with parents Martha and Charles Alexander). Her father Aleck was the personal servant and aide of his master, Pierce Mease Butler (1810‚Äì1861), who owned several plantations inherited from his grandfather, founding father and U.S. Senator Pierce Butler. Aleck Alexander had learned to read and write (despite state laws to the contrary) from Butler's wife, the British actress Fanny Kemble. Alexander later wrote that her part-Native American paternal grandmother had received her freedom after nursing Pierce Mease and his brother John Mease, before they assumed their grandfather's surname in order to inherit his plantations.http://gaepiscopal.org/docs/deaconessalexanderletter.pdf Her parents had married in 1841 and Anna became their eleventh and last child. Her maternal grandmother was from Madagascar, and her mother was the result of a rape by a white overseer. Fanny Kemble became estranged from her husband after witnessing such activities at his plantations, particularly by that overseer. She wrote the anti-slavery Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, published in 1863 and which helped influence British public opinion against the Confederate cause. The Alexander family soon moved to Pennick, Georgia to take advantage of land south of the Altamaha River previously held by poor whites who had moved further south to Florida to obtain land under the Southern Homestead Act of 1866. Her father became a carpenter-builder and a community leader. In addition to building his own family's houses, and helping others learn that trade, Aleck Alexander helped build a school for the community and used his own land as an experimental farm. Career Anna first taught at the public school in Pennick. Later, she moved to Darien, Georgia, at the mouth of the Altamaha River, where her sister Mary founded a school affiliated with St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church, and all three sisters taught. Anna also visited Brunswick, Georgia and St. Athanasius' Episcopal Church. In 1894, with the cooperation of the Brunswick priest, Anna founded a mission in Pennick, while still teaching at Darien during the week, making a 40 mile round trip by boat and foot. The mission faltered when Anna accepted a position at St. Paul's Normal and Industrial School (as well as enrolled in the new teachers college there) in Lawrenceville, Virginia. In 1897, she returned to Pennick and revitalized the mission. The congregation was renamed Church of the Good Shepard, and Alexander also started a school. She supported herself by taking in sewing, and managed to buy property in 1902, where her brother Charles Alexander and other men then erected a church. In 1907, bishop Cleland Kinloch Nelson addressed the second annual meeting of the diocese's council of colored churchmen, held at the Church of the Good Shepherd. He described Alexander as a \\"devout, godly and respected colored woman\\" and consecrated her as a deaconess. She became the first and only African-American deaconess. She worked in Altamaha River area for the rest of her life, teaching not only academic subjects, but also moral values. Her Sunday School students always donated pennies to those worse off then themselves. When an earthquake devastated Tokyo-Yokohama in Japan in 1923, Alexander's mission diverted their own building funds to aid the overseas victims, donating more proportionally to assist other needy people than any other church in the diocese.https://www.episcopalrevivalingeorgia2017.org/deaconess-alexander The diocese of Georgia split in 1907 and Nelson chose to associate with the new Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta. His successor in the Diocese of Georgia, Frederick Focke Reese, excluded African-Americans from church government in the diocese, and extended almost no diocesan financial support to African- Americans. This forced Alexander and others to make do, as well as seek support from outside the diocese, including from the Episcopal Board of Missions.http://gaepiscopal.org/docs/1910MissionsReport.pdf During the bad crop years of the late 1920s through the Great Depression, Alexander continued to work in her hardscrabble community, whose members built the current wooden church building in 1928. In 1934 only 2 of the 30 students could pay the nickel per week school fee. Alexander became the agent for governmental and private aid for both black and white residents, and enlisted neighbors of both races to help. Before his death, Reese recognized her decades of service. During the summers of her last decade, Alexander cooked for Camp Reese, the then-new (and now former) Diocesan summer camp on St. Simons Island, and brought small groups of African-American boys and girls ‚Äì who were formally barred as campers but could enjoy the area. In her later years, Alexander worked alongside other deaconesses, including Madeline Dunlap of Chicago. Legacy Alexander died on September 24, 1947 and was buried at the cemetery at Camp Reese. In 1998, she was recognized as a saint by the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia and its Bishop Henry Louttit, Jr.. Her diocese began advocating for larger recognition in the Episcopal Church. In 2004, she was reinterred at Good Shepherd Church in Pennick, which she had founded and where she had worked for many years, although now visiting priests only hold services twice a month. The General Convention of the Episcopal Church, meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah preliminarily recognized Alexander's service as a deaconess and teacher in 2015. A short documentary released by the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia in 2018 explains her life. Also in 2018, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry visited Pennick, Georgia and recognized her ministry. She was the winner of the \\"Golden Halo\\" in Lent Madness 2018, an educational tool hosted by Forward Movement Publications featuring the saints of the calendar of the Episcopal Church.

Temperament traits Temperament traits are known to be traits in which explain the behavior and actions of an animal and can be described in the traits responsible for how easily an animal can be approached, handled, milked, or trained. Temperament can also be defined as how an animal carries out maternal or other behaviors while subjected to routine management. These traits have the ability to change as the animal ages or as the environment in which the animal lives changes over time, however, it is proven that regardless of age and environmental conditions, some individuals remain more aggressive than others. Aggression in cattle can arise from both genetic and environmental factors. Aggression between cows is worse than that between bulls. Bulls with horns will bunt (push or strike with the horns) in which can cause more damage overall. In humans, most aggressive behaviors of cows include kicking, crushing and/or blunting.  Types of aggression  There are many types of aggression that are seen in animals, particularly cattle, including maternal, feed, comfort influencing, pain induced, and stress induced aggressiveness. =Maternal aggression= There are many components to maternal behavior that are seen in cattle, including behavior that allows proper bonding between mother and baby, nursing behavior, attentiveness and how mother responds to offspring. This maternal behavior is often seen in cattle during lactation as a prey species, this triggers the maternal instinct to protect their young from any threat and may use violent aggressive behaviors as a defense mechanism. During lactation in prey species, including cattle, a reduction in fear responsiveness of the dam to novel and potentially dangerous situations facilitates the expression of defensive aggression in protection of the young. It has also been proven however that aggression is not only performed in the protection of the offspring, but it can be directed to the offspring, in which could be directly related to fear. =Feed aggression= This is commonly seen in cattle due to high stocking densities which could potentially decrease the amount of space each cow has, as well as limit their ability to have access to feed, even impacting the ruminal environment. It is proven that supplying feed and water to cattle that are housed together may be heavily associated with feed aggression and aggressive actions towards others cows and within loose-housed cattle, feeding places are noted to have the highest amount of aggressive behaviors. =Comfort induced aggression= These are aggressive behaviors associated with lack of comfort, inadequate lying space or time in which the physical environment fails to provide the animal. Cow comfort plays an important role in the well being as well as maximizing production as an industry. Within many intensive production systems, it is very common to see limited space for resting, which can be associated with negative behaviors as not providing the appropriate space for the animal reduces resting and lying behavior, increasing irritability and the potential to act in aggressive behaviors. Although not all production systems provide limited space and time for lying, uncomfortable stalls are also known to be a major problem when it comes to lying behavior in cattle. Decreasing the quality of resting area for cows will decrease resting time, and increase the likelihood of stress, abnormal and aggressive behaviors as the deprivation of lying/resting behaviors is proven to affect responses within the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis which is associated with chronic stress in the animal. Not only lying time and space act as important regulators of comfort induced aggression, but other environmental factors may play a role in the comfort of an animal. Temperature has been shown to be a factor that influences the behavioral interactions between cattle, and it has been found that, by providing cows with the proper cooling environment or as heat could decrease aggressive interactions as cattle will have been shown to engage in aggressive behavior in order to gain access to a shaded and cattle with access to more shade are known to show reduced physiological and behavioral responses to heat. =Stress induced aggression= These are behaviors caused by some sort of stressor that can lead to aggressive advances towards themselves or other individuals. A stressor is an object or event that can cause a real or perceived threat internally or externally to an animal. Stressors are common in farm animals such as dairy cows as they live in a complex environment where there are many stressors including novel objects (new objects such as handlers, food, or group mates), social stimuli (different environments, new individuals), or restraint (physical restraint, moved to cubicles, transported). Dairy cows specifically have been known to be very sensitive to new, unfamiliar events or objects such as being around an unfamiliar person, or presented with a novel food item. Stress has extreme negative impacts on growth and reproduction in cattle, as the pituitary- adrenal system is very sensitive to different environmental stressors such as inadequate space, feed, poor quality housing, new objects or individuals, or new living/housing system =Pain induced aggression= Pain is defined as an effective state and can only be truly measured indirectly in both humans and animals, that may present some challenges in decision making regarding pain management. Many things can result in pain including dehorning, tail docking, handling, castrating, mastitis, lameness, confinement, transportation Lameness is a common issue seen in cattle, and may occur in facilities with poor management and housing systems, and inadequate handling skills. It is because of this issue that many cows find themselves spending a lot of time lying down, instead of engaging in both aggressive (head butting, vocalizing, pushing) and non aggressive behaviors (licking, walking) due to the pain.  Preventions  Techniques such as low stress handling (LSH) can be used as it provides silence, adequate restraint methods can help minimize stress levels in the animals. Flight zones should be considered when handling or moving cattle, as they have a blind spot and may get spooked easily if unaware if there is an individual around. Providing environments for cows in which minimize any environmental stressor can not only improve the wellbeing and welfare of the animal, but can also reduce aggressive behaviors. Regular examinations (physical and physiological) should be done to determine the condition of the cow, which could show signs of cuts, or lesions, as well as the secretion or hormones inside the body such as cortisol. Cortisol can be measured through blood sampling, urine, saliva or heart rate to indicate stress level of animal. Assessing for lameness, as well as giving proper treatment depending on severity/location can include antibiotics, Using proper treatment/prevention for pain when lameness is examined, as well as procedures such as tail docking, dehorning, castrating, mastitis lameness etc. The primary treatment in lame cows is corrective hoof pairing, which provides draining of abscesses, fixing any structural issue with the hoof, and reducing weight baring problems, however if lesions are seen in cattle, antibiotics or other measures may have to be taken to reduce further infection/irritation. Setting breeding goals can be a potential way to select for desired temperamental traits, further decreasing the risk of raising aggressive cattle. Before this method of selection can be entirely accurate and safe, however, some tests should be done, such as behavior and temperament tests.

It was co-written and presented by comedian and writer Victor Lewis-Smith. It ran for six episodes. Premise The series was set in the Frank Bough Memorial Zip Injury Wing at St. Reith's Hospital for Distressed Broadcasters, a BBC-owned hospital. One of its residents is an apparent caricature of Lewis-Smith, who lies immobilised in a \\"comic coma\\" after a motorcycle crash. In an attempt to stimulate his brain, the hospital staff play old BBC programmes to him via a TV monitor plugged into his life support machine - but for some unexplained reason, he also starts playing the programmes back, albeit with his warped sense of humour. This effectively makes him a one-man transmitter, which the BBC plan to use as an economical replacement for their current staff and equipment. Meanwhile, inside Lewis-Smith's body, Lewis-Smith himself embarks on a guided tour of his own bloodstream in a miniature taxi, accompanied by an annoying taxi driver who doubles as a narrative linking device in-between sketches. Regular sketches The opening to each episode involves a spoof BBC Two ident, which often involves the COW Globe ident from 1985-1991 in some way shape or form. =The I-Spy Book of...= A humorous guide on Lewis-Smith's own take on the world, presented as a visual equivalent of an I-Spy Book. Subjects include animals, fairgrounds, teenagers and the police. =Something To Cheer You Up= Taking place during the hospital scenes, Lewis-Smith's wife brings him something to cheer him up while he's unconscious, often related to the sketch which is due to follow or has just followed. She then follows it up with an anecdote, often related to how the item came into her possession. =Kith & Kin= This sketch is a spoof documentary on the lives of two people with the same last name. Those featured were Bertrand and Jane Russell, Henry and Windy Miller, Thora and Douglas Hird (sic), Norman and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Siegfried and Vidal Sassoon, and Queen Elizabeth II and Barbara Windsor. Each sketch contains an appearance by a Melvyn Bragg expy called Mervyn Briggs. =The Secret Life of Television= Like Kith & Kin, this sketch is a spoof documentary supposedly going behind the scenes of television. Subjects include eccentrics, The Black and White Minstrel Show, Hogmanay programmes, table tennis and interlude films. A similar sketch was previously featured in Lewis- Smith's contributions to TV Hell. =You're The Star= A parody of You've Been Framed!, this sketch features clips starring Lewis-Smith's co-writer Paul Sparks and Lewis-Smith's friend David Dallison, in which they fake humorous injuries accompanied by a voiceover of Lewis-Smith's impression of Jeremy Beadle. This sketch was previously featured in Lewis-Smith's contributions to TV Hell. =The Singing Telegram= Played by the Square Pegs, the Singing Telegram are a barbershop quartet who sing a melody to the tune of Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby that often begins with \\"We're The Singing Telegram...\\" and is often related to the sketch due to follow or has just followed. =Mr. Lobley's Latest Invention= Another one of the residents of St. Reith's is Mr. Lobley, who often attempts to describe to the Nurse his latest idea of an invention which he plans to complete when he leaves. Often, the Nurse isn't that impressed by the idea, so she attempts to kill or injure him in some way until the Consultant interferes. Like the Something To Cheer You Up sketches, these take place during the hospital scenes. =The Magical Voice of Frank Sinatra= A series of spoof advertisements, advertising albums by Frank Sinatra that include songs focusing on various topics, like university dropouts, dyspepsia, feminism, the working classes and Alzheimer's. =Revenge= This series of sketches involves Lewis-Smith mocking various musicians by dubbing over the soundtrack of their performances with his own soundtrack of badly played (on purpose) songs. Those mocked included Nigel Kennedy, James Galway, John Williams, The Swingle Singers, Julian Lloyd Webber, Roger Whittaker and Jimi Hendrix. A similar sketch was also featured in Lewis-Smith's later series TV Offal. =The BBC Big Band's Old TV Theme Tunes= Each episode contains a musical interlude by the BBC Big Band, who perform various classic TV show theme tunes from the Music Therapy Room in St Reith's. The theme tunes included The Money Programme, Nationwide, The Saint, The Baron, Danger Man and Tomorrow's World. =My Alter Ego Must Lash Out= The show would close with Lewis-Smith's trademark of prank calling various places, such as the Monopolies Commission, a branch of McDonald's in Moscow or the Belgian Consulate, with initial good graces, before becoming more and more rude as the conversation continued, with the credits often rolling below or beside the footage of the call.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of March-June 79 as the colleague of Lucius Junius Caesennius Paetus.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 189, 215 A shadowy and enigmatic figure, many of the facts of Ruso's life have been debated by the experts. It is not disputed that Ruso was the son of the homonymous consul of 53. However, the existence of a Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus, attested by an inscription found in Pisidian Antioch, complicates matters. At first, the consensus accepted Hermann Dessau's explanation that the two were the same man, and the inscription from Antioch merely demonstrated that Ruso had a polyonomous name, despite that the inscription also attested to a governorship of the combined province of Cappadocia-Galatia that had to be dated to the years 104 to 109. Dessau further identified this man as the husband of Dasumia, and thus great-grandfather of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. This was the accepted consensus until the 1980s when Eric Birley published a paper wherein he voiced doubts he had for 25 years with this identification.Birley, \\"The Enigma of Calvisius Ruso\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 51 (1983), pp. 263-9 Ronald Syme built upon Birley's arguments, and proposed that the inscription from Antioch referred to a younger half-brother of Ruso, named Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus, the ancestor of Marcus Aurelius. Syme also proposed that the younger brother, Ruso Julius Frontinus, was the son of a sister of the prominent consular, Frontinus, explaining the similarities of name.Syme, \\"P. Calvisius Ruso. One Person or Two?\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 56 (1984), pp. 173-192 Syme also proposed that the older son, Calvisius Ruso, had married a Dasumia, basing his reasoning on the fragmentary text of the Testamentum Dasumii; however, subsequent research and discoveries have weakened the possibility of a connection with Calvisius Ruso. That there were two sons of the consul, one the nephew of Frontinus, has since been widely accepted -- but not unanimously. Gennite DiVita-Evrad, in a paper published a few years after Syme's, argued that our Calvisius Ruso was the one who married Frontinus' sister, and thus Ruso Julius Frontinus was his son.Di Vita-√âvrard, \\"Des Calvisii Rusoles √† Licinius Sura\\", M√©langes de l'Ecole fran√ßaise de Rome; Antiquit√©, 99 (1987), pp. 281-33 Based on the lack of evidence for these personages, one cannot easily decide which surmise is closest to the truth.

History Francis Joseph Botting was born in London and trained as a builder. He emigrated to South Australia aboard Buckinghamshire arriving in March 1839. He joined with his brother Frederick Henry Botting (c. 1810 ‚Äì 1873) in constructing some of Adelaide's earliest buildings, including a merchant's office and warehouse, which later became the Blenheim Hotel, and the first wharf and wharf building in Port Adelaide, under architect Prescott. The two brothers lived on the islands of Spencer's Gulf 1844‚Äì1846 during the financial slump. =Auctioneer= In May 1856 Botting joined Wicksteed, Townsend & Co., auctioneers, (John Bentham Neales, Frederic Wicksteed and William Townsend), which became Wicksteed, Botting, Townsend & Co., then Townsend, Wicksteed & Kay with just those two and William Kay.

He has worked with water as a sculptural material since 1994. After attending art school in Sweden, Tillinghast began his art career in California where he created charcoal drawings. These drawings became increasingly minimal and geometric. The carefully developed detail seen in these earliest works carries over to the precision and attention to detail seen in his metal works. His works can be found in the permanent collections of the Albright-Knox Gallery, the John Michael Kohler Art Center in Wisconsin, the Museum of Fine Art in Santa Fe, Portland State University, and the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art in Arizona. Background Tillinghast began making geometric box-like constructions that initially appeared as singular objects but later incorporated water. His focus was no longer just with space and line, but also light and liquid. This has resulted in an ongoing series of sculptures, installations, paintings, and projects in which water is the primary subject and medium. Tillinghast has created site specific fountains, wishing wells, and rain machines that explore the social, civic, and pedestrian relationships that people and communities have with water. His work also explores the history every culture has around the meaning of water. His small paintings on paper created with found vintage postcards of various bodies of water embody post-modernist deconstruction, found-object art, vernacular photography, and minimalism.

His books include the two-volume San Francisco: A History of the Pacific Coast Metropolis (1913), and Journalism in California (1915). He was also a founding member and treasurer of the Commonwealth Club of California. Young was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and at age 16 ran away from home and enlisted in the Navy. His parents organized his release while he was on his first cruise, and he then spent four years working in a Philadelphia store. He then moved out west, first to Arizona, then San Diego, where he became business manager and later an editor of the San Diego Union. In 1873 he went to Washington, D.C. for four years, where he was city editor of the Washington Chronicle. He moved back to California in 1877, joining the Chronicle in April of that year. After covering the 1877‚Äì78 session of the California legislature for the Chronicle, he was appointed managing editor. He authored several books and articles on economics, history, and journalism.

Job matching and job competition: Are lower educated workers at the back of job queues? European Economic Review, 39(9), pp. 1717-1731. Moreover, with Martin Lindeboom and Gusta Renes, van Ours finds important differences between the effectiveness of search channels: whereas employment offices are effective in matching unemployed workers, advertisements are effective for employed workers, and informal search channels are effective in both cases.Lindeboom, M., van Ours, J.C., Renes, G. (1994). Matching Employers and Workers: An Empirical Analysis on the Effectiveness of Search. Oxford Economic Papers, 46(1), pp. 45-67. Finally, comparing labour and job turnover, van Ours, Daniel Hamermesh and Wolter Hassink find that most mobility is not to new nor from destroyed jobs but rather into and out of existing jobs, firms with declining employment hire a lot and firms with expanding employment fire a lot, worker turnover is much larger than job turnover, and simultaneous hiring and firing exists. Hamermesh, D.S., Hassink, W.H.J., van Ours, J.C. (1996). Job Turnover and Labor Turnover: A Taxonomy of Employment Dynamics. Annals of Economics and Statistics, 41-42, pp. 21-40. = Research on unemployment benefits, unemployment insurance and active labour market programmes= Another area of van Ours' research are the economics of unemployment insurance, benefits and active labour market policies. In the Netherlands, van Ours, Gerard van den Berg and Jaap Abbring find that reductions of unemployed persons' benefits for failing to meet search requirements are effective in raising individual re- employment rates.Abbring, J.H., van den Berg, G.J., van Ours, J.C. (2005). The Effect of Unemployment Insurance Sanctions on the Transition Rate from Unemployment to Employment. Economic Journal, 115(505), pp. 602-630.Van den Berg, G.J., Van der Klaauw, B., van Ours, J.C. (2004). Punitive Sanctions and the Transition Rate from Welfare to Work. Journal of Labor Economics, 22(1), pp. 211-241. This finding is also substantiated by van Ours' research with Rafael Lalive and Josef Zweim√ºller on Switzerland, wherein warnings and enforcement are found to increase unemployment outflows both towards employment and out-of-the labour force and actual benefit reductions lower the quality of post-unemployment jobs in terms of duration and earnings. Moreover, stricter monitoring of eligibility requirements reduces the unemployment durations of the non-sanctioned as well as their earnings.Lalive, R., van Ours, J.C., Zweim√ºller, J. (2005). The Effect of Benefit Sanctions on the Duration of Unemployment. Journal of the European Economic Association, 3(6), pp.1386-1417.Arni, P., Lalive, R., van Ours, J.C. (2013). How Effective Are Unemployment Benefit Sanctions? Looking Beyond Unemployment Exit. Journal of Applied Econometrics, 28(7), pp. 1153-1178. Further research by van Ours with Lalive and Zweim√ºller on Austria has highlighted the role of behavioural responses by the unemployed to changes in their financial incentives, e.g. increases in unemployment durations in response to higher benefit replacement rates.Lalive, R., van Ours, J., Zweim√ºller, J. (2006). How Changes in Financial Incentives Affect the Duration of Unemployment. Review of Economic Studies, 73(4), pp. 1009-1038.Boone, J. et al. (2007). Optimal Unemployment Insurance with Monitoring and Sanctions. Economic Journal, 117(518), pp. 399-421. Additionally, research with Milan Vodopivec on Slovenia also finds that reducing the potential duration of unemployment benefits increases unemployment outflows but doesn't affect the quality of job matches in terms of wages, contract type or match duration.Van Ours, J.C., Vodopivec, M. (2006). How Shortening the Potential Duration of Unemployment Benefits Affects the Duration of Unemployment: Evidence from a Natural Experiment. Journal of Labor Economics, 24(2), pp. 351-378.Van Ours, J.C., Vodopivec, M. (2008). Does reducing unemployment insurance generosity reduce job match quality? Journal of Public Economics, 92(3-4), pp. 684-695. Analysing the impact of ALMPs in Switzerland, van Ours, Lalive and Zweim√ºller find some evidence that temporary subsidised job may reduce unemployment duration, whereas training and employment programmes don't.Lalive, R., van Ours, J.C., Zweim√ºller, J. (2008). The Impact of Active Labour Market Programmes on the Duration of Unemployment in Switzerland. Economic Journal, 118(525), pp. 235-257. By contrast, van Ours and Graversen find mandatory activation programmes in Denmark to be very effective with regard to reducing unemployment duration, possibly because more intensive contacts between the unemployed and public placement services.Graversen, B.K., van Ours, J.C. (2008). How to help unemployed find jobs quickly: Experimental evidence from a mandatory activation program. Journal of Public Economics, 92(10-11), pp. 2020-2035. Finally, van Ours and Jan Boone find evidence suggesting that labour market training is effective in reducing unemployment, whereas public employment services and job subsidization aren't.Boone, J., van Ours, J. (2009). Bringing Unemployed Back to Work: Effective Active Labor Market Policies. De Economist, 157(3), pp. 293-313.Van Ours, J.C. (2004). The locking-in effect of subsidized jobs. Journal of Comparative Economics, 32(1), pp. 37-55. = Research on unemployment, part-time work, education, age and employment protection= Other research on labour economics by van Ours has dealt with topics such as the relationship between unemployment,Nickell, S., van Ours, J. (2000). The Netherlands and the United Kingdom: A European unemployment miracle? Economic Policy, 15(30), pp. 135-180.Van den Berg, G.J., van Ours, J.C. (1996). Unemployment Dynamics and Duration Dependence. Journal of Labor Economics, 14(1), pp. 100-125. part-time work, education, age, employment protection. Analysing the relationship between unemployment, labour market institutions and labour market reforms with Mich√®le Belot, van Ours show that particular combinations of labour market institutions are effective in terms of lowering unemployment rates.Belot, M., van Ours, J.C. (2001). Unemployment and Labor Market Institutions: An Empirical Analysis. Journal of the Japanese and International Economies, 15(4), pp. 403-418.Belot, M., van Ours, J.C. (2004). Does the recent success of some OECD countries in lowering their unemployment rates lie in the clever design of their labor market reforms? Oxford Economic Papers, 56(4), pp. 621-642. Investigating the effects of working hours on satisfaction with Alison Booth, van Ours finds that neither men's nor women's life satisfaction is affected by their hours of work, though men's hours-of- work satisfaction is highest for full-time jobs and that of women is highest for part-time jobs of any size, in line with theories linking family happiness with work patterns conforming to traditional gender identities.Booth, A.L., van Ours, J.C. (2008). Job Satisfaction and Family Happiness: The Part-Time Work Puzzle. Economic Journal, 118(526), pp. 77-99. Booth, A.L., van Ours, J.C. (2009). Hours of Work and Gender Identity: Does Part-Time Work Make the Family Happier? Economica, 76(301), pp. 176-196. In research with Lenny Stoeldraijer, van Ours finds no evidence of an age related pay-productivity gap in Dutch manufacturing.Van Ours, J., Stoeldraijer, L. (2011). Age, Wage and Productiviy in Dutch Manufacturing. De Economist, 159(2), pp. 113-137. Studying the educational attainment of second-generation immigrants in the Netherlands together with Justus Veenman, they conclude that differences in the level of education of their parents are driving the differences in educational attainment between second-generation immigrants and native Dutch people.Van Ours, J.C., Veenman, J. (2003). The educational attainment of second-generation immigrants in The Netherlands. Journal of Population Economics, 16(4), pp. 739-753. Finally, another important research finding of van Ours' work with Belot and Boone is that employment protection may be welfare-improving, though the optimal level of employment protection is mediated by labour market features such as workers' relative bargaining power and wage rigidities (e.g. minimum wages).Belot, M., Boone, J., van Ours, J.C. (2007). Welfare-Improving Employment Protection. Economica, 74(295), pp. 381-396.

She is known for her work in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention, health care access and health equity for minority individuals and committees. Likewise, one of her most major accomplishments was being the founding director of the Health Equity Institute at San Francisco State University. She has been a teacher and researcher, as well as a leader in both teaching and governmental positions.  Life and education  Cynthia G√≥mez is a third generation Mexican American. She was born in Long Beach, California, on September 9, 1958. Her parents, Lilly Gonzales and Augustine U. G√≥mez, are both of Mexican descent. She moved to a small village in Ecuador at the age of six because of her father's job at a tuna cannery, where she learned how to speak Spanish, and then later lived in Puerto Rico from 1968 to 1975. Afterwards, she moved to Boston, where she received her B.A. in psychology from Boston University in 1979. She then also received her Master of Education degree (Ed.M.) in Counseling and Consulting Psychology at Harvard University in 1982 and then her PhD in Clinical Psychology at Boston University in 1990. In 1991, she then moved to San Francisco to work as a researcher at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California at San Francisco, the city where she currently resides today. She is bilingual as she speaks both Spanish and English, and has a Puerto Rican accent which she says is a source of confusion for people. She has been known to utilize her Latina background to be a leader and role model for the students she teaches as well as her colleagues. Her leadership skills have been noted by National AIDS Fund president and CEO Kandy Ferree. She started her career with the idea of becoming a child psychologist but later moved to public health, with a strong focus on equal opportunity and championing disadvantaged groups due to her Latina heritage. She has advocated for the improvement of health for these underserved groups, which include imprisoned women, gay men, lesbian women, and people of color, in ways such as contacting and advising groups that work to help them. One such group included a community health center in Boston that G√≥mez worked with during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic which provided care for these underserved groups.  Work and service  Before starting her work in HIV, G√≥mez worked in community health settings for 12 years. This included being the director of the Children's Mental Health Services of the Southern Jamaica Plain Health Center in Boston. Other positions she held in community settings included her first professional job at the Upham's Corner Health center as a community outreach worker and mental health counselor, as well as being a psychology intern at the Cambridge Child Guidance Center, a psychotherapist and mobile crisis team therapist at the AtlantiCare Medical Center, and also a clinical psychology fellow at the Harvard Medical School Massachusetts Mental Health Center. These positions were all in Massachusetts, many of which were in the Boston area. She has numerous awards from American Psychological Association (APA), notably the 2016 APA Presidential Citation, and Distinguished Contribution to Ethnic Minority Issues Award from APA Div. 44 (Society for the Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity). This award, given every year to psychologists for their extraordinary work, was given to G√≥mez for her work on HIV/AIDS prevention, as well as for advocating for underserved groups and communities when it comes to healthcare. G√≥mez has served on the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS under both the WJ Clinton and GW Bush administrations; the Center of Disease Control and Prevention's HIV and STD Advisory Council; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Advisory Committee on Women's Services; and the Institute of Medicine's Committees on Prisoners and Research, and on Lesbian Health. Furthermore, she also was part of the first California Public Health Advisory Council and the first California Office of Health Equity Advisory Committee, in 2007 and 2013 respectively. She was appointed to the CA Public Health Advisory Council by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the state's governor at the time. G√≥mez served on the American Psychological Association Committee on Psychology and AIDS and on the Board of Professional Affairs. In 1997, after her time working as a researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, she began working there as an assistant professor at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), and in 2002 became the co-director of CAPS until she left in 2006 to create the Health Equity Institute at San Francisco State University. Over time, G√≥mez has also written and co-written numerous scholarly papers and has given many presentations all over the world regarding problems dealing with HIV and AIDS, women's health and health equity.  Health Equity Institute  G√≥mez founded the Health Equity Institute at San Francisco State University in 2006. Her work has focused on gender, culture and sexual health, the development of prevention interventions and the application of science to community practice. The organization's guiding principles are: equality and justice framework; multi-disciplinary approaches; community-scientist collaboration; and translational, implementation and effectiveness research. The organization seeks to eliminate the preventable disparities in health, especially those caused by political carelessness and socioeconomic status. Likewise, Dr. G√≥mez and the rest of the organization utilize psychology, anthropology, biology, sociology, media, medicine, political policy, economics, and ethics in order to study the mechanisms that lead to inequalities and injustice in order to help people cope with those risks and lobby for political policies beneficial for social justice. By working with communities, health departments, institutions, and scientist the studies yield more complete answers to complicated issues. Lastly, Dr. G√≥mez focuses on closing the gap between just prevention techniques and effective, well established treatment practices. Projects that the organization tackles include adding a community garden program to a local elementary school in a predominantly black neighborhood. This way the children can have fresh fruits and vegetables that they are lacking.

She is an emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales.  Early life  Skyllas-Kazacos was born as Maria Skyllas in Kalymnos, Greece, in 1951 and emigrated to Australia in 1954. She is the oldest of four siblings. She attended Fort Street Girls High School in Sydney, before beginning a degree in industrial chemistry at the University of New South Wales. She graduated with first class honours and the University Medal in 1974. She completed her PhD in 1978 at the UNSW School of Chemical Technology on the topic of the electrochemistry of molten salts. Career After finishing her PhD, Skyllas received a CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellowship and joined Bell Laboratories in the US for her post-doctoral work. While completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Bell Labs, Skyllas did research on solar energy and focused on the liquid junction solar cell. She researched ways of depositing thin films. She received a patent for a new method of electrodepositing thin films of cadmium selenide. Since Bell labs had to service Bell Telephone Company, Skyllas also did work on batteries. While assisting on experiments with a problem of lead-acid batteries, she discovered soluble lead(IV) ions in the charging and discharging reactions of the lead- acid batteries. She published a paper on this discovery in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society. After giving a poster presentation in Australia on the same subject, she was awarded the Bloom-Gutmann Prize for the best young author under 30. After leaving Bell Labs, Skyllas went back to Australia and accepted a position as a Queen Elizabeth II Fellow in the School of Physics at the University of New South Wales. In 1982, aged 31, she became a professor in chemical engineering and industrial chemistry. Skyllas married Michael Kazacos, who is also a scientist, and they have three children. At the University of New South Wales, Skyllas-Kazacos and her research team began working on vanadium compounds. She discovered that highly concentrated pentavalent solutions can be prepared indirectly from tetravalent ions, which is more soluble, combined with scraping of the carbon electrode that made the vanadium oxidation-reduction reactions reversible. Skyllas with her research team then patented the vanadium redox battery in 1988.

It was unveiled at the 2015 Dubai Motor Show. The name of the car, Fenyr, comes from the word Fenrir, the name of a monstrous wolf in Norse mythology. The production of the car was originally planned to be up to 25 units per year, a drastic increase from the limited 7-car total production run of its predecessor. However, this was later changed to a total of 100 vehicles (and 10 launch editions).  Specifications  Rear view = Powertrain = The Fenyr SuperSport is powered by a 3.8 litre twin-turbocharged flat-six engine developed by Ruf Automobile, having a maximum power output of at 7,100 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm.

In 1998, UNESCO designated the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France as a World Heritage site, including the three main churches of Bordeaux : the basilica of St. Severinus, the basilica of St Michael and the St. Andrew's cathedral.  History  = Ancient origins = The basilica is built upon a Christian necropolis dating to the 4th century CE. The epitaph of Flavinus was engraved beneath a representation of a chrism on the lid of a sarcophagus dating to between 365 and 385 CE, testifying to the Christian presence in Bordeaux to Late Antiquity. This epitaph was extracted during an excavation of the necropolis in 1909. Today, it is housed in the Museum of Aquitaine in Bordeaux. = Foundation legends = Named after the fourth bishop and patron saint of Bordeaux, the history of the basilica begins with the founding of the Abbey of Saint Severinus in the 4th century CE. Saint Severinus, born in the Levant, arrived in Bordeaux in the 4th century CE and met Bishop Amandus. Gregory of Tours tells the story in his work In Gloria Confessorum: \\"the Bishop Amandus who governs the church of Bordeaux has a dream one night in which the Lord says to him, 'Lift up and go meet my servant Severin...', and now Saint Severin was coming to meet him. Approaching one another, they greeted each other by name, threw themselves in each other's arms, prayed, kissed and entered the church singing psalms\\". Thus Severinus became bishop of Bordeaux. Another legend involving the basilica is that of the Oliphant of Roland (nephew to Charlemagne and famous for his death at Roncevaux) being placed on the altar by the emperor while carrying the remains of the valiant knight. The famous Song of Roland recounts this: \\"Vint a Burdeles, la citet de... Desur l‚Äôalter seint Sevrin le baron Met l‚Äôoliphan plein d‚Äôor e de manguns: Li pelerin le veient ki la vunt\\". A Great Step in the Way of Compostela in the Middle Ages, the pilgrims are invited to pass by Saint Severinus to contemplate this relic.  Architecture  Entrance = Mid-5th century = Despite the legends surrounding the founding of the church, the presence of an early religious building is attested to in the mid 5th century CE. It was probably a temple or an oratory. It disappeared in the 9th century due to Viking invasions. = 11th‚Äì13th centuries = At the beginning of the 11th century, the canons of the basilica decided to commence a major reconstruction. It has the shape of a robust Romanesque church in the basilical form. Frequented by pilgrims on the Ways of Saint James of Compostela, the canons led the travelers up to the choir and down into the crypt so that they could see them. During this period, the basilica was the scene of an investiture ceremony consecrating access to power over the County of Bordeaux, especially by the Dukes of Aquitaine. During the course of the 11th through 13th centuries the nave and the choir were built. In the 13th century, the canons ordered the construction of the southern entry which is surmounted by a porch with a belfry built in the Renaissance style. They also built a monumental Gothic entrance for the necropolis. The entrance consists of a large bay flanked by two blind arches and is decorated with fourteen carved statues representing the twelve apostles and two female statues representing the Synagogue and the Church. The church has three tympana: the main one is decorated with scenes from the Resurrection and the Judgement; the left has a representation of the holy women who visited the tomb; and the right depicts the arrival of Saint Severinus according to Saint Amand's dream. The five-sided porch that leads to it was built later. = 14th‚Äì18th centuries = The 14th and 15th centuries mark the construction of several chapels. One of them was the Chapel of Madonna of the Rose which was dedicated to the Virgin. It contains an altar that was consecrated by Archbishop Pey Berland in 1444. It was designed in the flamboyant Gothic architecture reminiscent of that found in late-15th-century Normandy and England. Twice in 1566 and 1698, parts of the church's vault structure collapsed causing serious damage. At the beginning of the 18th century, the architect Jean-Baptiste Augier was charged with rebuilding and bracing them with pillars equipped with stone belt courses. During this repair, he ordered that the floor be backfilled because of its considerable unevenness (nearly three meters). These repairs led to the burial of the crypt and a major modification of the ground of the western porch which dated to the 11th century. = 19th century = A cross-sectional view of the Basilica of Saint Severinus in 1850. Though the Basilica of Saint Severinus was spared during the French Revolution, it was headed for a century of profound changes in the 1800s. In the late 1820s, the western fa√ßade was restored by order of the Saint Severinus Building Council. To accomplish this the council hired architect Pierre-Alexandre Poitevin to create a neo- Romanesque fa√ßade. The construction of the porch gate hides the Romanesque porch. Sculptor Dominique Fortun√© Maggesi (1801-1892), an artist from Carrara who would go one to the greatest sculptor in the history of Bordeaux, was chosen to decorate the fa√ßade. He adorned the entrance with statues of Saint Severinus and Saint Amand whose encounter is depicted on the tympanum.He also carved statues of Saint John and Saint Peter which adorn the balustrade on the upper floor. This was done to give homogeneity to both the fa√ßade and Romanesque bell tower of the basilica. In 1840, the Basilica of Saint Severinus was listed in the Inventory of Historic Monuments (). Following this classification, its choir was completely reorganized and a new marble altar was made.. Arcades were opened and two chapels were dedicated: one to Saint Fort and other one to the Sacred Heart. They were built on the north side of the basilica. The painter and glassmaker Joseph Villiet signed the stained glass windows of the nave that he created which depict scenes from the bible as well as the history and legends that surround the basilica.

Medieval furnishings  Like many churches, the Basilica of Saint Severinus was largely stripped of its medieval furnishings. Despite this, some elements remain such as a number of alabaster altar pieces from the 15th century. One of them, dedicated to the life of the Virgin, remains in the Chapel of the Madonna of the Rose. Another is the one at the main altar which depicts the story of Saint Severinus and the legend of the Staff of Saint Martial. The church has also retained an ornate 15th-century episcopal pulpit that still has its armrests, backrest and dais. This is a very significant item as it is reserved for the new archbishop of Bordeaux who must take an oath on the relics of Saint Severinus before he is nominated. The choir still houses thirty-two of the forty-seven stalls from the 15th century. These stalls were intended for the chapter. They are decorated with images of saints, prophets and satirical scenes. The Basilica of Saint Severinus has a number of well-maintained medieval statues. Among them, are the 13th-century Our Lady of Glad Tidings, the 14th-century alabaster Madonna of the Rose and one of Saint Martial. Even though Roland's Oliphant (mentioned earlier) was still in the basilica as late as the 17th century, it disappeared before the Revolution.  Crypts  = Church crypt = Crypt containing the sarcophagus of a saint. The original crypt was located in a 5th-century building. Its later use as a funerary basilica is attested to by the presence of sarcophagi which supposedly contained the remains of early bishops. In 1635, the Carolingian apse in the basilica was removed to allow for the creation three recesses for the sarcophagi and the cenotaph of Saint Fort. At the time, this martyr was the object of a cult that lasted until recently. In fact, every May 16 mothers led their sons to the grave of Saint Fort to get \\"fortified\\". = Archaeological crypt = The archaeological crypt is a vestige of early Christian cemetery and is one of the oldest in Bordeaux. It was situated between Place des Martyrs de la Resistance and Rue Juda√Øque. According to tradition, the necropolis at Saint Severinus was consecrated by Christ and seven bishops. The tradition also states that many of the rulers of Roncevaux are buried there. This would explain why this place was a magnet for pilgrims in the Middle Ages. From 1909 to 1910 excavations were conducted south of the church by Paul Courteault. In part of the necropolis superimposed graves were discovered that dated from the 4th to 13th centuries. In the late 1950s and then from 1964 to 1969, Raymond Duru campaigned to get the crypt open to the public. Thanks to his efforts, it has been publicly accessible since the 1980s.  Today  The basilica has benefited from restoration in recent decades. The roofs were redone, as were upper parts of the basilica. The chapels of Madonna of the Rose and Saint John as well as choir were restored. In 2005, the Gothic entrance benefitted from a restoration funded by the city of Bordeaux and Historic Monuments. During this restoration, that traces of the original polychrome were discovered. This import discovery allows one to imagine the entrance in its original state.

Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= K2-229b is a relatively Earth-sized planet, first identified using the transit method, where a planet passes in front of its host star and blocks a tiny fraction of its light. When the planet was first discovered, only its radius was known. It was determined to be 1.165 , or about 16.5% larger than Earth. A planet of this size is most likely rocky with a solid surface, like Earth itself. However, radial velocity measurements using the HARPS spectrograph revealed that K2-229b was far denser and more massive than initially expected. The planet has a mass of 2.59 and an extremely high density of about 8.9 g/cm3, giving it about 91% more surface gravity than Earth. The unusually high mass and density of K2-229b indicates a Mercury-like composition dominated by an iron core taking up about 70% of the planet's mass.  mass = 0.837 Due to its extremely tight orbit, K2-229b is one of the hottest planets yet found. It has an equilibrium temperature of , hot enough to melt iron. The day side has an even higher temperature in excess of . =Orbit and Rotation= K2-229b has one of the shortest orbital periods known, with one full orbit taking just 0.584 days (14 hours) to complete. The planet orbits its host star at a distance of 0.012888 AU, nearly 100 times closer in than Earth. For comparison, our Solar System's innermost planet, Mercury, takes 88 days to orbit at 0.39 AU. K2-229b has an orbital eccentricity of 0 and is most likely tidally locked with its host star. =Host star= K2-229b orbits the orange dwarf star K2-229, which is about 79% the radius and 84% the mass of the Sun, with a temperature of 5185 K and an age of about 5.4 billion years. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.5 billion years old. K2-229 has a visual magnitude of 10.985, too faint to be seen without a telescope. It is noted for being extremely active. Formation, composition, and conditions The discovery of the high mass and density of K2-229b was unexpected. \\"When we saw this planet that was Earth-sized, we thought it would have an Earth-like composition. But it turns out it's more like Mercury\\", astrophysicist Jessie Christiansen, who was not part of the team which discovered K2-229b, told Newsweek. The unusual Mercury-like composition of K2-229b is believed to offer insight into how it and other high-density, Mercury-like planets could have formed. There are multiple hypotheses on how K2-229b became so dense, with one stating that much of the planet's atmosphere was eroded away by stellar radiation from its nearby, active star. Another hypothesis suggests that K2-229b was formed when two planets in the system collided, much like the theory on how the Moon was created from a collision between Earth and another planet. As of March 2018, all these theories are still in play, and there is not enough evidence to either prove or refute them. Researchers also noted K2-229b's position in its planetary system. \\"Interestingly K2-229b is also the innermost planet in a system of at least 3 planets, though all three orbit much closer to their star than Mercury. More discoveries like this will help us shed light on the formation of these unusual planets, as well as Mercury itself\\", commented Dr. David Armstrong, one of the members of the team from the University of Warwick's Astronomy and Astrophysics Group which discovered the planet. K2-229b is noted for being quite similar to Mercury, with about the same core- mass fraction of 68 %. However, the former is far closer to its host star and is more susceptible to mantle evaporation than the latter. With a day side temperature of over 2,330 K (assuming it is tidally locked with its host star), K2-229 is expected to have at least a thin atmosphere of silicate vapor created from the high temperatures on the star-facing side of the planet. Despite the high activity of K2-229, the planet is not expected to completely lose this atmosphere. If K2-229b has a magnetic field it can resist atmospheric erosion, meaning that mantle evaporation is extremely unlikely to have resulted in the planet's iron-rich composition. That, and K2-229b is estimated to only lose 1.3√ó10‚àí5 per year, too little to remove any more than a few percent of its total mass over its lifetime.

Set in a series of unnamed postwar European locales, the story follows a government commissioner going on vacation to a resort town with his wife. The commissioner makes a detour from the planned route in order to investigate an old, unspecified injustice. He conducts an ominous investigation, visiting a local landmark and traveling to an isolated rural factory, eventually finding himself in an overgrown yet empty field. Described as both puzzling and profound by critics, the novella has been noted for its bewildering lack of particulars about setting. Though the Holocaust is never mentioned by name, most reviews suggest the unspecified past injustice is tied to the genocide Kert√©sz survived as a young man.

The American Revolution (1776‚Äì1783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia, \\"the 14th American Colony\\". At the beginning, there was ambivalence in Nova Scotia over whether the colony should join the Americans in the war against Britain. Largely as a result of American Privateer attacks on Nova Scotia villages, as the war continued, the population of Nova Scotia solidified their support for the British. Nova Scotians were also influenced to remain loyal to Britain by the presence of British military units, judicial prosecution by the Nova Scotia Governors and the efforts of Reverend Henry Alline.  Context  In Nova Scotia a number of former New England residents objected to the Stamp Act 1765, but recent British immigrants and London- oriented business interests based in Halifax, the provincial capital were more influential in keeping the colony loyal to the crown. The only major public protest was the hanging in effigy of the stamp distributor and Lord Bute. The act was implemented in both provinces, but Nova Scotia's stamp distributor resigned in January 1766, beset by ungrounded fears for his safety. Authorities there were ordered to allow ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps.  1775‚Äì1778  At the outbreak of the American Revolution, many Nova Scotians were New England-born and were sympathetic to the American Patriots. This support slowly eroded over the first two years of the war as American Privateers attacked Nova Scotian villages and shipping to try to interrupt Nova Scotian trade with the American Loyalists still in New England. During the war, American privateers captured 225 vessels either leaving or arriving at Nova Scotia ports. In June 1775, the Americans had their first naval victory over the British in the Battle of Machias. In response to this defeat, in July 1775, the British sent from Halifax two armed sloops to Machias to capture the rebels. American privateer Joseph O'Brien captured these two British vessels on 12 July 1775 in the Bay of Fundy. The following month American privateers from Machias executed their third consecutive victory in the region by raiding St John. Naval battle off Cape Breton (1781) In retaliation for the American victories at Machias and St. John, the British executed the Burning of Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine) in October 1775. The following month, in November 1775, the American Patriots retaliated by ships Hancock and from Marblehead conducting the Raid on Charlottetown (1775) and Canso, Nova Scotia where they took five prizes. (In the raid on Charlottetown, the privateers also sought revenge against Nathaniel Coffin, the Loyalist who cut down the Liberty Tree in Boston.) The first year of the war ended with the American privateer Raid on Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. In 1775, rebellion began to ferment within Nova Scotia. Governor Legge began to target prominent Protestant dissenters of the St. Matthew's Church: John Fillis and judge William Smith and John Frost (minister). The Governor also targeted judge Seth Harding (judge) from the Liverpool Township and he left on October 1775 and did not return. According to Cahill, as a result of \\"instances of non-legal repression and petty tyranny, such as the summary dismissals of Judge Smith and Justice Frost, had ended with the recall of Governor Legge [to London] in January 1776.\\" A small number of Nova Scotians went south to serve with the Continental Army against the British; upon the completion of the war these rebels were granted land in the Refugee Tract in Ohio. In 1776, there was also armed rebellion such as the Maugerville Rebellion (1776). The other attack was by land and led by Jonathan Eddy who led the Battle of Fort Cumberland. According to historian Barry Cahill, this rebellion led the Nova Scotia government to \\"use the formal law in sedition trials for an essential aspect of the official response to the American Revolution.\\" The government arraigned dissenters John Seccombe and jailed Timothy Houghton for sedition (incitement to rebellion). Malachy Salter was convicted of sedition in 1777. At the end of 1776, there were two significant American attacks on Nova Scotia. One of these assaults was by sea and led by John Paul Jones in the Raid on Canso (1776). In 1776, John Allan led the Maliseet to challenge the loyalists on Indian Island, New Brunswick to join the rebel cause.

G. (John Gordon). 1876. In 1776, two American privateers took four vessels at Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia and took the people of the hamlet prisoners. In March 1777, in the first American Navy encounter with the British, the British ran the American vessel aground in the Battle off Yarmouth (1777) and the privateers escaped to find protection among the local village. The crew found support and the inhabitants of Yarmouth sheltered the American privateers from the British navy until they made their escape back to New England. The engagement between the American privateers and local militia was one of several in the region. On 2 May 1777, in the Minas Basin Captain Collet ordered the capture the American privateer schooner Sea Duck, under the command of John Bohannan. He had the vessel taken to Windsor. In June, the American Patriots launched the St. John River expedition. In July 1777, HMS Amazon captured the privateer Active off of Cape Sable Island. In August 1777, the British raided Machias. The following year, in April 1778 the American privateers again attacked Liverpool. On 9 August, Privateers attacked Cornwallis at present-day Kentville, which resulted in the British building Fort Hughes in the area. The fort could hold 56 soldiers. In 1778, the British schooner Hope also destroyed a privateer ship at Canso. Seven Patriots escaped but were later captured near Halifax. Prisoners were returned from Halifax to Boston on the Swift in September 1778. The Cartel Silver Eel took prisoners to Boston in October 1778. 1779, Maugerville was raided again by Maliseets working with John Allan in Machias, Maine. A vessel was captured and two or three residents' homes were plundered. In response, a blockhouse was built at the mouth of Oromocto River also named Fort Hughes (New Brunswick) (named after the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Sir Richard Hughes). In June 1779, the British troops at Windsor captured 12 American privateers in the Bay of Fundy, where they cruised in a large boat, armed, plundering the vessels and the inhabitants. In 1779, American privateers returned to Canso and destroyed the fisheries, which were worth ¬£50,000 a year to Britain.  1779‚Äì1782  In 1779 the British from Halifax adopted a strategy to seize parts of Maine, especially around Penobscot Bay, and make it a new colony to be called New Ireland. It was intended to be a permanent colony for Loyalists and a base for military action during the war. Fort George (Castine, Maine) ‚Äì British fort built to protect New Ireland In early July 1779, Francis McLean left Halifax and led a British naval and military force into Castine's commodious harbor, landed troops, and took control of the village. He began erecting Fort George on one of the highest points of the peninsula. Alarmed by this incursion, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sent the Penobscot Expedition to lay side to the fort and reclaim the territory. The siege started on July 25 and lasted three weeks until the arrival of British commander George Collier who crushed the American expedition. (The British held New Ireland, the planned loyalist homeland, until the end of the war. Instead, the British divided Nova Scotia and named the new Loyalist homeland New Brunswick.) At the end of 1779, the British at Halifax experienced some significant losses. In December 1779 the schooner Hope wrecked near the Sambro Island Light on the Three Sisters Rocks. Captain Henry Baldwin and six other crew were killed. Weeks later, 170 British sailors were lost when two vessels ‚Äì North and St Helena ‚Äì were wrecked in a storm when entering Halifax harbour. On 10 July 1780, in the Battle off Halifax, the British privateer brig Resolution (16 guns) under the command of Thomas Ross engaged the American privateer Viper (22 guns and 130 men) off Halifax at Sambro Light. In what one observer described as \\"one of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering\\", the two privateers began a \\"severe engagement\\"Simeon Perkins Diary. Thursday 13 July 1780 during which both pounded each other with cannon fire for about 90 minutes. The engagement resulted in the surrender of the British ship and the death of up to 18 British and 33 American sailors. In May 1781, the local Nova Scotia militia defeated American privateers in the Battle off Cape Split. The British and French also clashed in the Naval battle off Cape Breton. Finally, the privateers returned in the Raid on Annapolis Royal (1781). In the final year of attacks on Nova Scotia, the American privateers fought in the Naval battle off Halifax and the Raid on Lunenburg (1782).Salem Gazette, p. 11, 18 July 1782; Boston Post, 15 June 1782; and Hunt's Magazine, February, 1857, as cited by  Defence regiments  84th Regiment (1st battalion), 4 January 1780, shipwrecked off Cape Breton, Nova Scotia by Robert Pollard (1784)Naval Chronicle. Vol. 11, p. 447 To guard against American privateer attacks, the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) (2nd battalion) was garrisoned at forts around Atlantic Canada. Fort Edward (Nova Scotia) in Windsor, Nova Scotia was the Regiment's headquarters to prevent a possible American land assault on Halifax from the Bay of Fundy. Also raised in Nova Scotia were the Royal Fencible American Regiment and the Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment. The King's Orange Rangers defended Liverpool, the second largest settlement in the colony. The Hessians also served in Nova Scotia for five years (1778‚Äì1783). They protected the colony from American privateers, such as when they responded to the Raid on Lunenburg (1782). They were led by Baron Oberst Franz Carl Erdmann von Seitz. There were 5000 British troops in Nova Scotia by 1778.  Naval defence  In terms of naval force, along with issuing letters of marque for different privateering vessels, in 1776 the Government also retained the armed schooner Loyal Nova Scotian (8 guns, 28 men).p. 399 On Nov. 26, 1776, under the command of John Alexander, the Loyal Nova Scotian re-captured the privateer Friendship. In 1778, the vessel was ordered to Lunenburg and then retired. By 1779, Nova Scotia's naval defence had four vessels: a frigate (32 guns), sloop of war (18 guns), armed schooner (14 guns) and another armed schooner (10 guns). These ships were named Revenge (18 guns,50 men, Captain Jones Fawson; Captain James Gandy), Buckram (8 guns, 20 men, Captain Archibald Allardice) and the armed schooner Insulter (Captain John Sheppard), all acting under government orders. There were numerous other privateers supported by local villages: Enterprise (Liverpool), Hero (100 men, 16 guns, Captain Bailey, Chester), Arbuthnot, The David, Mowatt, Lady Hammond, The Fly, Sir George Hammond, Lancaster, Dreadnought (Captain Dean of Liverpool), The Success, The Lively, the sloop Howe, and the ship Jack. In 1778, Nova Scotians ships had taken at least 48 prizes and four recaptures. Between 1779 and 1781, they captured 42.  Treaty of Watertown  In 1776, the Mi'kmaq signed the Treaty of Watertown, agreeing to support the American Patriots against the American Loyalists. Three years later, on 7 June 1779, the Mi'kmaq \\"delivered up\\" the Watertown treaty to Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin and re-established Mi'kmaw loyalty to the British. After the British resounding victory over the American Penobscot Expedition, according to Mi'kmaw historian Daniel Paul, Mi'kmaq in present-day New Brunswick renounced the Watertown treated and signed a treaty of alliance with the British on 24 September 1779.

The population of St. John's Island (present-day Prince Edward Island), small compared to Nova Scotia, was only about 1215 in 1774. Nova Scotia has been described as a 'shield' to the other two colonies, stopping much unrest from the American colonies from reaching them. St. John's Island during the time has been described as \\"a model colony\\". At the outbreak of the American Revolution, Phillips Callback was in charge of St. Johns Island. Thomas Gage began recruiting men to help defend Quebec against American attack; however, his efforts were hindered by a group of American revolutionaries living in Pictou, Nova Scotia. A group of about 150 American soldiers set out to attack ships bringing arms to the British. Though they failed in their attempt, they arrived in Pictou, and from the Americans living there learned about recruiting efforts, and attacked Charlottetown. They threatened to set fire to the town but Callback convinced them to spare the town. Callback and Thomas Wright (the surveyor of the island) were taken prisoner. The two hostages were eventually released, and made it back to the island on May 1, 1776. After the attack, an armed brig was sent to guard St. John's Island, and a militia was raised. The brig left when arrived in September 1776. A fort was planned to better defend the town then Fort Amherst could. After Eddy's raid, the militia (which had only existed as 20 men previously) was raised to 80, and named The Loyal Island of St. John Volunteers. In 1778, five companies under Timothy Hierlihy were sent to better garrison the island. At the troops arrival, Callback was ordered to disband the \\"superfluous and expensive\\" militia. He ignored the orders. The feasibility of attacking St. John's was considered by the French navy. The Island, despite perceived danger, served mainly as a stopping point for British troops on their way out from Quebec, and British troops bringing captured privateers back. A group of 200 Hessians en route to Quebec spent a year on the Island. Work on the fort continued until Patterson (the governor) arrived in 1780. He saw the five companies and 8,000 pounds which had been spent on fortifications as a colossal waste of money. Work was halted and the companies returned. Throughout the war, the Island was highly loyal, and endured few attacks. In 1765, Newfoundlands population was around 15,000, consisting largely of Irish immigrants. As it was not technically a colony, Newfoundland did not pay the Stamp Act 1765 or Townshend Acts taxes. Despite having minor problems with the British government, the island \\"preserved a tone of exemplary loyalty.\\" The island maintained nearly no defenses, and as such, Esek Hopkins was sent to attack Newfoundland. In September 1776, a group of several privateers took three or four ships, and plundered about ten others. In 1777, was captured, and several months later retaken. The following year, many other ships were attacked, particularly by . Upon the arrival of Richard Edwards, many privateers were defeated, and by 1779, very few were left. Edwards ordered cannon distributed to allow towns to defend themselves against attack. In early 1780, at Mortier, a privateer was repulsed by the town. That same year, a fleet, led by Edwards, of nine ships, captured six privateers. Fourteen were captured the next year. Several companies were raised, and several hundred soldiers left to fight with British troops. Both islands had minor food shortages, particularly after a fire on St. Johns burnt 35 houses, and many stores of food. The fishing industries in both were reduced to \\"low and miserable state[s],\\" and the general population of both decreased as well. An outbreak of robberies occurred as people needed various resources. A riot occurred in 1779 on St. John's, in which one person was killed.  Loyalist settlements  About 20,000 Loyalists fled to Nova Scotia during and after the American Revolution. Most came from the state of New York.Neil MacKinnon. This Unfriendly Soil: The Loyalist Experience in Nova Scotia, 1783-1791. McGill-Queen's Press. 1986. The three largest settlements being Saint John River Valley, Digby, Nova Scotia and Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Cape Breton was a separate colony as received 3150 Loyalists. Ile St. Jean received 300 Loyalist refugees. The British returned New Ireland to the Americans and the territory in Maine entered the control of the newly independent American state of Massachusetts. Those from New Ireland settled St. Andrews, New Brunswick. With the Loyalist homeland gone, Nova Scotia was divided to accommodate the Loyalists: both New Brunswick and Cape Breton were created as separate colonies for the Loyalists (Cape Breton returned to Nova Scotia in 1820). There are many Loyalists who settled in Halifax and were buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia), including a number of Black Loyalists who have unmarked graves. Numerous British soldiers became Loyalists and their regiments settled in various communities across Nova Scotia. The Royal Fencible American Regiment settled in Wallace, Nova Scotia. The Second Battalion of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) settled in Municipality of East Hants, particularly at Kennetcook, Nova Scotia. There were three Regiments that settled Digby, Nova Scotia: New Jersey Volunteers, the Royal Garrison Battalion and the Loyal American Regiment. Black Pioneers settled in Brindley Town, (now Acaciaville, Nova Scotia). The Black Pioneers settled at Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia.

K. Rowling and published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The novel was released on 18 September 2018.  Background  Lethal White is preceded by The Cuckoo's Calling, The Silkworm, and Career of Evil; there are tentative plans to follow it with at least five more stories. Rowling announced the completion of the manuscript on 23 March 2018, after approximately two years of writing, and the book was released on 18 September 2018. Lethal White follows the private detective Cormoran Strike and his partner Robin Ellacott. The story begins with a Prologue following immediately after the conclusion of Career of Evil detailing events taking place at Robin's wedding reception. Plot At Robin Ellacott's marriage to Matthew Cunliffe, Cormoran Strike's capture of the Shacklewell Ripper the night before is already widely known, except by Robin. When Strike tells her that he had been trying to contact her during the week, she realizes that Matthew had deleted Strike's messages, which results in a serious row between the new spouses. Before Strike leaves, Robin accepts his offer of working as a salaried partner in the detective agency. One year later, Strike has grown his detective agency to the point where he needs to hire more investigators. He receives an unsolicited visit from Billy Knight, a young man with a history of mental illness who claims to have witnessed a murder and the burial of the body in woodland some years before, but is unable to provide any details before he runs out of Strike's office. While trying to establish Billy's identity, Strike meets Billy's older brother Jimmy and Jimmy's girlfriend Flick, radical left-wing activists who claim Billy is unstable and unreliable. Strike's meeting with Jimmy draws the attention of Jasper Chiswell, the Minister for Culture, whom Strike knew from investigating the combat death of his son Freddie. Chiswell has been blackmailed by Jimmy and hires Strike to investigate; he identifies Geraint Winn, the husband of a political enemy, as Jimmy's likely partner. Chiswell does not reveal what he is accused of, but claims that what he did was legal \\"at the time\\". Robin then goes undercover in Chiswell's office to carry out surveillance on Geraint, whose wife has a neighboring office, although the undercover assignment places more strain on her marriage. She meets Chiswell's family who works for him: daughter Isabella; illegitimate son Raphael; and second wife Kinvara. By bugging Geraint's office, Robin discovers that Geraint has been embezzling money from his wife's charities, and Chiswell uses this knowledge to stop Geraint's blackmail. Chiswell summons Strike and Robin to a house that he keeps in the city for business, perhaps intending to fire them, but on arrival, they find Chiswell's body, apparently dead from suffocation and an overdose of anti-depressants. The Metropolitan Police rule his death a suicide, but Isabella is convinced that Kinvara is responsible, again hiring Strike to investigate. Strike believes that the mysterious blackmail is connected to Chiswell's death and eventually learns that Chiswell and Jack Knight, Jimmy and Billy's late father, built gallows for export before the European Union banned the export of torture and execution equipment from member states. Two of these gallows were sold to Zimbabwe, where one was stolen by rebels and used in the murder of a British teenager. The gallows could be traced to Chiswell because Billy had carved the nearby White Horse of Uffington into it. Meanwhile, Robin continues to struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder a year after her encounter with the Shacklewell Ripper, while Matthew continues to interfere with her work. But Robin separates from Matthew and moves out when she finds proof that he has been having a long-term affair throughout most of their relationship. She intends to seek a divorce when she can afford it and moves in first with her friend Vanessa Ekwensi, then with Strike's friends Nick and Ilsa Herbert. Strike counsels her, drawing on his own experience of losing a leg. Strike's ex-girlfriend Charlotte Ross, now married and pregnant, reappears and unsuccessfully pursues Strike. Strike learns that Chiswell wrote Kinvara out of his will and bequeathed everything to his ten-year-old grandson, while allowing Kinvara only to live on the family estate for the rest of her life. However, Chiswell carelessly omitted certain items from the will, including a diamond necklace that is the family's last item of real value, meaning that legally such items may be Kinvara's. Strike suspects there are other items of value Chiswell overlooked. He is drawn to a supposedly-worthless painting titled Mare Mourning and discovers that it may be a lost George Stubbs artwork depicting a mare mourning a foal that died of lethal white syndrome. If its provenance were to be established, it would probably be worth over ‚Ç§20 million. Strike can then identify Chiswell's killer: Raphael, who had had never been accepted by the family but had worked for an art dealer. Raphael had tipped off Flick about a cleaning job at Chiswell's, expecting that she would find out about the gallows sales and tell Jimmy, who then demanded 50% of the profits. Raphael also seduced and conspired with Kinvara to kill Chiswell; when Flick learned that Chiswell had inadvertently found out about the affair and also had begun to investigate Mare Mourning, Raphael killed Chiswell at once. Kinvara confesses, but Raphael sends Robin texts purporting to be from Matthew, luring her into a trap. He keeps her alive to interrogate her about the investigation before disappearing; Robin stalls for time by outlining everything in detail, even describing his un-executed plan to kill Kinvara. Strike realizes Raphael's duplicity when he notices that the text messages to Robin came from a disposable mobile phone used in the blackmail case. The police trace the phone and raid the houseboat on which Raphael has Robin, arresting him just as he has decided to terminate her and flee. In the aftermath, Strike, Robin and Isabella meet Billy to discuss the \\"murder\\" he witnessed. Isabella and Strike reveal that Billy was drugged by Freddie and Jimmy. Billy then saw Freddie choke a young Raphael until he passed out, followed by the burial of a small horse that Freddie had killed in a separate act of cruelty, which Strike's crew has dug up. Strike and Robin then leave together. Characters * Cormoran Strike ‚Äì A war veteran who was honourably discharged after losing half of his leg in a bomb attack.

Life Adela was the daughter of Lambert II of Louvain and Uda of Lorraine (also called Oda of Verdun), daughter of Gothelo I of Lorraine. Before 1060, Adela of Louvain, married Otto I, Margrave of Meissen, Count of Weimar. After Otto‚Äôs death in 1067 Eckbert I, Margrave of Meissen attempted to repudiate his own wife, Immilla of Turin in order to marry Adela and secure his hold on the mark of Meissen. Eckbert died in 1068, and the following year, Adela married Dedi I of Lusatia. Dedi also tried to claim the mark of Meissen through marriage to Adela, and rebelled against Henry IV of Germany when Henry refused to invest Dedi with this property. Lampert of Hersfeld depicted Adela as the driving force behind Dedi‚Äôs rebellion, calling her a ‚Äúmost ferocious wife‚Äù (saevissima uxor). Lampert, Annales, a.1069, p. 107; trans. Robinson, Lampert, pp. 118-9; Patzold, Die fr√ºhen Wettiner, pp. 18-20, 97.

Early years (1841‚Äì81) Nicolas Joseph P√©raldi was born on 18 March 1841 in Ajaccio, Corsica. He earned a licence in law and became a notary in Ajaccio on 28 July 1866. He became president of the Chamber of Notaries of Ajaccio. He was elected municipal councilor in August 1870, second on the list. After the fall of the Second French Empire he was confirmed in the municipal administration on 10 September 1870. He was reelected municipal councilor on 22 November 1874. P√©raldi was made Mayor of Ajaccio on 28 March 1876. He was mayor during the 16 May 1877 crisis. His appointment as mayor was revoked by decree on 26 June 1877. He was reinstated as mayor on 23 December 1877. He was again elected municipal councilor on 13 January 1878, and was appointed Mayor of Ajaccio on 25 June 1878. He was named a Knight of the Legion of Honour by decree of 26 July 1879. He was elected to the General Council of Corsica in August 1880. In 1881 Bonapartists loyal Victor, Prince Napol√©on, removed Peraldi from his office as mayor. Deputy (1881‚Äì85) P√©raldi was elected to the legislature on 2 September 1881 on the second ballot by 6,850 votes against 5,771 for M. Cun√©o d'Ornano. He represented the Ajaccio-Sart√®ne constituency. He sat on the left, voted consistently with the Opportunist Republicans majority, supported the L√©on Gambetta and Jules Ferry ministries, and voted for credits for the Tonkin Campaign.

In the senate he abstained on the vote over the expulsion of the princes in June 1886, voted for reestablishment of the district ballot, for the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press. He abstained from the vote on the procedure to be followed in the senate against General Boulanger. He served in the congress committee and then the committee on petitions.

Given the slim margin of defeat, P√©raldi protested to the Senate's 4th bureau, claiming various irregularities in the poll, but on 5 July 1894 the Senate ruled in favour of H√©brard. P√©raldi did not run for reelection in the triennial renewal of 4 January 1903, or in the by-elections of 15 February 1903 and 18 September 1904.

It was the first manufacturer of faience in the Nordic countries. It is especially rememberred for its bishop-bowls and tray tables but has also produced decorative tiles for several historic buildings. History On 27 November 1722, Frederick IV granted a consortium a royal license to establish a faience manufactury in Copenhagen with a monopoly on the production of faience with blue decorations. The factory was located at the corner of Store Kongensgade and present-day Fredericiagade and variously referred to as Delf's Porcelins Fabrique or Hollandsch Steent√∏js Fabrique. One of the founders was Rasmus √Üreboe. The first director of the factory was Johan Wolff. He was succeeded by Johan Ernst Pfau (c. 1685-1752) in 1728. Christian Gierl√∏f (1706-86), a brewer, took over the factory in 1749. He was soon faced with new competition, both from Jacob Fortling's Kastrup V√¶rk on Amager, an enterprise in Schlesvig and especially a faience manufactury established by Peter Hofnagel in √òsterbro. Hofnagel had previously owned Herreb√∂ Faience Manufactury in Norway. The factory in Store Kongensgade struggled up through the 1760sm culminating with the termination of its monopoly on faience with blue decorations in 1769. It closed before 1779. Products Punch bowl from the factory on display at Frederiksborg Castle A characteristic product from the faience factory in Store Kongensgade was so-called bishop-bowl, a type of punch bowl designed in the shape of a mitre (bishop's hat) and used for serving an alcoholic drink known as \\"bishop\\". The factory is also known for its tray tables. The porcelain has usually blue but manganese violet decorations are occasionally seen. More everyday items and tiles were also produced at the factory. Legacy The tiles in the Queen's Pancake Kitchen at Frederiksberg Palace (1735) and on the staircase in the Hermitage in J√¶gersborg Dyrehave north of Copenahgen (1737) came from the factory in Store Kongensgade. A tray table (1749-1771), a punch bowl (1740) and a Plateau (1726) from the factory are on display in The David Collection in Copenhagen.

She currently studies nucleon structure and quantum chromodynamics with her research lab at the University of Michigan. The Aidala group's work involves international collaboration to study spin-spin and spin- momentum correlations in a variety of subatomic particles. Her experiments use the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Main Injector at Fermilab, and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In 2017, she was selected to serve on a National Academy of Sciences committee to assess the justification for a domestic electron ion collider facility in the United States. In addition to researching subatomic particle structure, she is working on a foundational physics project deriving the standard mathematical frameworks for Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics from physical assumptions. Aidala has participated in numerous outreach activities, including Saturday Morning Physics and coordinating physics demonstrations for elementary and middle school students. In 2013, she wrote an essay about her career path, which was published in the book \\"Blazing the Trail: Essays by Leading Women in Science\\".

The site and its discoveries have been referenced in the gaming press. The site started out as part of a blog but was reworked and relaunched as a wiki in 2010. The reworked site is considered by Edge to be a major catalogue of unused video game content. History The Cutting Room Floor was started by Robert Flory in 2002 as part of a blog. It mainly focused on Nintendo Entertainment System games and was occasionally updated. In the late 2000s, Alex Workman, better known as Xkeeper, reworked the site into a wiki, which launched on 2 February 2010. The site has since specialised (Kotaku described them as \\"routinely responsible\\" for it) in what gaming media (including Edge) have likened to video game archaeology: its members analyse video game code and content using various tools (such as debuggers and hex editors) and if something interesting is found, an \\"uncover\\" starts. According to Xkeeper, the site's members co- operatively analyse their findings to work out how to use content. The site's goal is to catalogue \\"as many deleted elements as possible from all sorts of games\\". In December 2013, Edge considered The Cutting Room Floor to be the largest and best-organised catalogue of unused video game content. Around this time, the site had 3712 articles. In June 2016, Xkeeper said that the website has largely avoided copyright issues. Amongst the more noted discoveries are the secret menus in the Mortal Kombat games, and The Legend of Zelda prototype (which was \\"extensively\\" catalogued and a The Cutting Room Floor moderator GoldS considers the site's most important article). The Cutting Room Floors community are reported to have paid 700 dollars for an unreleased Nintendo DS Tetris prototype. A coding error in Super Mario Bros. that changed the behaviour of the Spiny eggs also made the gaming press. In May 2018, Kotaku and Eurogamer reported on a Pok√©mon Gold and Silver prototype and its assets that had been discovered and documented on the website.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 Ewing Mountain, a range extending across the area, includes Devil's Den on the west and Chestnut Knob on the east. Raven Cliff, a unique geological site on the north., is the home of ravens, ospreys and other birdlife. The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access Boundary of the Devil's Den ‚Äì Ewing Mountain wildland in the Jefferson National Forest as identified by the Wilderness Society.The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 3 miles east of Cripple Creek, Virginia, between Va 602 on the west and south, and Va 94 on the east and Va 642 on the north. Trails and roads into the area include: *Ewing Mountain Road, FS 49780 *Cripple Creed Rd., FS 49710 *Raven Cliff Horse Camp Road, FS 4052B *Barker Road, FS 49790 *Tate Road, FS 667 *Virginia Highlands Horse Trail, FS 337, 82 m *Mikes Gap Trail, FS 4504, 2.9 miles *Ewing Mountain Trail, FS 4502, 2.11 miles Decommissioned Trails: *Ponderosa Trail, FS 4600, 1.93 m *Collins Cove Trail, FS 302, 1.04 m The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Map 786. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Devils's Den-Ewing Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Cripple Creek and Austinsville. Natural history The area contains part of the Raven Cliff special biological area, with sensitive karstlands, a dry calcareous forest and habitat for flora such as the Carolina saxifrage and fauna such as ravens, ospreys, peregrine falcons, and wood ducks. Karst features around the Raven Cliff and lower part of Cove Creek contain disappearing streams, sinkholes, and reappearing streams. Karst sites are of interest because of the biological communities they contain. Cripple Creek, a tributary of the New River, is a candidate for state scenic river designation. It contains cool water fish such as smallmouth bass, bluegill, and rockbass. There are large areas of Catawba rhododendron pink-colored flowers in the spring. Topography The dominant feature of the area is Ewing Mountain, a long ridge with a maximum elevation of 3038 feet. Other peaks include Devil's Den, 3153 elevation; Chestnut Knob, 3366 feet elevation; and Raven Cliff at 2241 feet. Mikes Gap is on the north side of Ewing mountain with an elevation of 2844 feet. These formations rise above Cripple Creek on the north at 1975 feet elevation. The area contains two relatively remote areas, one on the west by Devil's Den and the other on the east near Chestnut Knob. The Devil's Den- Ewing Mountain wildarea surrounds 400-acre Collins Cove, a private land holding in a pastoral valley with a few buildings. Forest Service management In a review of the area in 1999, the Forest Service recognized the 4,234 semi-primitive core area, but it was not included in its roadless inventory. Later the Forest Service raised concerns that the area no longer had a semi-primitive core because of development in the inholding at Collins Cove. Inclusion in the roadless inventory would have limited road construction, reducing the negative environmental impact of roads. There have been two recent logging projects in the area. In 2003, the Cripple Creek- Grouse Timber Sale was approved for 99 acres of clear-cutting with the construction 2.3 miles of new road and development of 3.2 miles of other roads. The sale was completed in 2009. In 2008 the forest Service approved the Fry Hill timber project with 162 acres of which 32 acres were within the Devils Den-Ewing Mountain area.

Founder of the organization Ilenshil-Polio, which later became the Israeli Association for Children with Disabilities (ILAN) and the Israel Sports Center for the Disabled, she was recognized with the in 1988, for her contributions to Israeli society. Early life Betty Vivian Zimmerman was born on 3 June 1912, in London, Ontario, Canada to Bessie Z. (n√©e Sickind) and Alexander Zimmerman. Her mother, died upon Zimmerman's birth and her father, traveled often as a salesman. She was raised by an aunt and uncle in Ontario and began a modeling career in Toronto. For a period prior to her marriage, she lived in New York City as worked as a buyer for a fashion company. On 30 June 1935 in Hamilton, Ontario, she married Samuel Dubiner, a toy manufacturer. In Canada, the couple were active in Betar and were involved in the Canadian League for a Free Palestine. Activism In 1949, Sam opened a plastics factory in Israel and the couple moved permanently to Tel Aviv in 1950. He branched out his industrial development, opening a factory which produced boxes and containers for shipping exported goods. Dubiner designed containers for his company and received a US patent on one of her designs. Almost immediately upon their arrival, the couple enrolled in an ulpan for an immersion in Israeli culture and language. At the school, they learned of transit tent-camps and when a winter storm upended the temporary shelters, the Dubiners drove to the camps and transported refugees to safer housing. With the outbreak of the polio epidemic in 1950, Dubiner created the first volunteer organization in Israel, establishing Ilenshil-Polio to assist in the treatment of victims of the disease in 1952. She was responsible for bringing the polio vaccine to Israel, as well as orthopedic braces to assist in rehabilitation. Holding fundraisers and recruiting volunteers, Dubiner established training centers for the treatment and therapy of victims and resource outreaches for their families. As head of the organization, Dubiner initiated an annual March of Dimes campaign in 1958 to raise funds for Ilenshil-Polio, which was later renamed Israeli Association for Children with Disabilities (ILAN). ILAN spread throughout the nation and by 1988 was operating in 70 locations. Hosting summer camps and sporting events for paralyzed children, Dubiner and Gershon Huberman conceived of a plan to build a permanent facility. In 1960, she drove for the creation of the Bella and Samuel Spewack Sport Center in Ramat Gan to serve as a recreational and therapeutic center for disabled children and adults. The center was originally named after the benefactors who donated the royalties from their show Kiss Me, Kate to fund the building of the center. During the Six-Day War in 1967, Dubiner, at the request of the government helped recruit hoteliers and householders to provide lodging to the pilots engaged in the campaign. As the government feared their base housing would become a target, it was necessary to find safe shelters away from the military facilities. In 1988, Dubiner was the recipient of the , in recognition of her work on behalf of the disabled community of Israel. That same year, the Montreal-based Canadian branch of ILAN established a home for disabled young adults in Jerusalem and were raising funds to build a kindergarten near Haifa. After her husband's death in 1993, Dubiner edited thirteen books on the history of Israel's development. An avid collector, she had clipped newspaper articles since her days in Canada. She donated her collection, \\"the most comprehensive archives of the history of Israel\\" to Ariel University. Death and legacy Dubiner died on 15 February 2008 in the neighborhood of Nahalat Yitzhak, in Tel Aviv, Israel. She was buried in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery. In March 2008 a memorial was held for Dubiner with dignitaries, ILAN staff, and volunteers, to honor her contributions to the development of programs for disabled citizens in Israel.

The documentary explores the positives and negatives of taking psychostimulant medications, such as Adderall‚Äîthe main focus of the documentary. The film is a series of interviews with college students and working adults who are prescribed stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), along with parents who touch on the difficulties raising children with ADHD and interviews with professionals commenting on the use of stimulants. Those interviewed include former player for the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars Eben Britton, and neuroscientist Anjan Chatterjee. The film‚Äôs executive producers were Maria Shriver and Christina Schwarzenegger; its world premiere was at the SXSW film festival in 2018.  Plot  The documentary begins by introducing the interviewees, giving some background and how they are associated with Adderall or stimulant medications. The film interviews people from different backgrounds and phases in life, from college students and children, to former NFL players, to psychologists. While the health professionals discuss the history of stimulant use and their opinions, other interviewees speak of their personal experience with the medications. There are also some family members that speak of noticeable changes caused by the medications. = Cast and synopsis= Jasper Holt is a college senior who has been taking Adderall since his ADHD diagnosis at the age of six. He attended a private school that he says recommended medication. His mom was worried that the medication would hinder his creative side, but he is still very much into art. Holt says he was embarrassed for taking the medication when he was in high school, and is trying to lower his dosage to eventually stop taking it. Delaney is a college junior who was prescribed Adderall. She describes it as \\"Rx gold\\" that \\"sews up\\" your life. Her standpoint is that she needs it to hold her life together, she claims that other people had tutors in high school to prepare for the standardized tests, and her parents couldn't afford tutors so she resorted to Adderall. She says she uses it to give her a leg up in comparison to other students. Rahiem is a high school student who was diagnosed with ADHD when he was very young. He was prescribed Adderall and forewarned of the effects if he did take his medication. His mother was mostly interviewed; she said she saw a noticeable improvement in his behavior when he takes his medication. Eben Britton is a former NFL player who was prescribed Adderall. He speaks of his experience with the medication as a user who abused it. He admits that he didn't believe he had ADHD, it was just an easy way to have an open access to the drugs in order to enhance his performance and deal with the pain from his injuries. His wife stated that when he started on the medication everything seemed great, he had the time and energy to be a husband and an NFL player, but as time went on he began to overuse the medication. He claims he is addicted to the medication just to be the best in a very competitive environment. Blue Williams is an artist manager, who takes Adderall on occasion. He was diagnosed as a child with ADHD, but his mother did not let him take any medication as she wanted him to adapt to the world. Now as an adult he chooses to use medication on days where he has a lot going on. He states that in modern-day life, there are many distractions that come with technology, and young adults interpret these distractions to believe that they have ADHD, which then leads to their diagnosis and medication. = Health professionals = Corey Herbert is a physician who practices in New Orleans. He speaks on the topic of stimulants and compares patients like Raheim who need the drugs and others who have slightly less severe cases. Wendy Brown is a political theorist from UC Berkeley, who discusses reasons college students and adults may resort to stimulants. She states that the world is a hypercompetitive environment, from students trying to get into the best schools to workers being pushed to work many hours, where many don't know how to cope or how to stay on top with using medication to enhance their performance. Martha Farah is a cognitive neuroscientist from the University of Pennsylvania. She discussed the history of psychostimulant medication, and some of the controversies as well. She mentioned the incorrect belief that medication will make the consumer smarter, and claimed this theory was wrong. Anjan Chatterjee is the chair of neurology of the University of Pennsylvania. He addresses the differences in the use of drugs from his generation to the current generation. He explores the history of stimulant usage. He also discusses the pros and cons of medication usage, and the improper use of drugs. Matthew Piskorz and Lucas Siegel are the co-founders of Alternascript, a company that creates supplements. Their ideology is that if students are trying to get ahead by taking prescription drugs, then there should be legal supplements others can take to level the playing field.  Reception  David Ehrlich reviewed the documentary for IndieWire, writing that the film \\"never finds its focus\\", describing the director as approaching the topic with the \\"reactionary zeal of a local TV news segment\\" in a comprehensive but \\"myopic\\" look at the use of prescription amphetamines. Ehrlich says Klayman uses \\"scare-mongering tactics\\", and he criticizes the filming technique as a \\"tired attempt to conflate ADHD with a video game aesthetic and a pixelated cartoon of a skeleton drowning in little blue pills\\". Devon Frye writes in ADDitude Magazine that the documentary is a \\"heavy-handed\\" and \\"biased portrait of stimulant use in America\\", in which Klayman demonstrates \\"little interest in showing both sides of the story\\" while focusing on medication users who \\"openly admit to taking the drugs to get ahead in a culture that constantly demands more\\". Frye states that the film explores questions that are worthy, but fails to deliver answers to those questions by focusing on unsympathetic characters and by relying on \\"jarring animations and repetitive interviews\\". Reviewing the documentary for Variety magazine, Owen Gleiberman calls the film \\"urgent\\" and \\"eye-opening\\". Gleiberman writes that the connections made by the movie's thesis \\"may strike some as too speculative for comfort\\", but they can \\"fire up your perceptions enough to burn through the cumulative effects of advertising\\". Justin Lowe, film critic for The Hollywood Reporter, writes that some of interviewees have interesting stories, but the \\"talking-head experts\\" and the animated and archived film sequences are sluggish. He states that the film relies heavily on anecdote but is light on data and documentation, and fails to make its case.

They started a trip after performing the military service together, a trip that the IDF soldiers normally perform after completing the military service.  History of the group  On the day of the Jewish New Year (Rosh HaShanah), Gili, one of the three friends, stayed in a house that belonged to the Chabad Lubavitch Chassidic movement, which was located on the island of Ko Samui, in the Kingdom of Thailand, together with more than 1,500 Israeli tourists. Gili was amazed to see the tremendous number of Israeli backpackers who traveled to poor countries every year, and that was when the idea was born of using this valuable human resource to make the world a better place.  Activities of the group by country  = Africa =  Ethiopia  In March 2017, Heroes for life expanded its voluntary activity to the nation of Ethiopia. The first delegation went there in March, and stayed in the country two weeks. In that expedition, the volunteers worked with kids. The activities included the teaching of English, mathematics, dental health, and music. They also participate in the renovation of a shelter that was located near the city of Gondar, in the northern region of Ethiopia. Besides the program of the volunteers, the delegation also counted with a dentist that provided dental care for the children of the shelter, that needed medical assistance. The expedition counted with the cooperation of a local Ethiopian NGO, and also the collaboration of the Israeli NGO Eden.  South Africa  In March 2018, the backpackers arrived in South Africa and stayed there two weeks to perform humanitarian work and educational activities with the poor children of the city. The volunteers taught them arithmetic, music and English. The backpackers contributed to the renovation and improvement of the living conditions of the children, collaborating in agricultural projects and painting residential buildings. In addition to working with the children of the neighborhood, the weekends are dedicated to volunteer work with the South African Jewish community. = America =  Argentina  Every year in December, the backpacker volunteers organize an expedition to the neighborhood of San Fernando in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The mission of the volunteers last two weeks, and during that period of time they are concentrated in performing several educational activities with the kids of the neighbourhood. Every expedition is formed by a group that has between 20 and 25 volunteers. The work of the volunteers is divided in to teams, the shift of the morning is dedicated mainly to carry out several projects of painting and restoration, that are designed and executed by the backpacker volunteers (for instance: the delegation of the year 2015 built a dining room for the children of the neighbourhood) in second place, the shift of the afternoon is dedicated to teach the kids several themes like: English, mathematics, music, personal values, and dental care. One of the principles of the group is the continuity of work made by every delegation, each expedition works with the same kids than the previous delegations, creating a beautiful and valuable link with the local population. The volunteer missions in the Argentinian Republic, started in the year 2015, with the coming into the country of the team Oz, and in 2017 it was the third time that the project had place in the quarter. Besides the activities performed with the kids of the neighbourhood during the week, the weekends are dedicated to strengthen the bons with the local Jewish community in Argentina. This activity has place together with the Maccabi movement in Argentina, and is directed to the youth of the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. The name of the team Oz, is dedicated to the memory of the sergeant Oz Mendelovic, who died in the Gaza strip during the military operation Protective edge].http://embassies.gov.il/buenos- aires/NewsAndEvents/Pages/Heroes-for-Life-in-Argentina.aspx  Brazil  25 Israeli backpackers on their trip after the army, most of them veterans of the IDF combat units, decided to volunteer in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,and teach local children English and mathematics and renovate the community institutions as part of the Heroes for Life program. One of the volunteers, Lior Tabib, is a former Israeli Air Force officer who lost his friend, the captain Tal Nachman in 2014 in Gaza. The two had planned to travel together through South America, and Lior decided to join the delegation in memory of his friend. Captain Nachman was killed in a fire during operations at the Gaza border four years ago, when a soldier from the Givati reconnaissance battalion accidentally shot him after mistaking him for a terrorist. At the beginning, Lior and his colleagues worked in the favela of Cantagalo, and recently moved to another location in a community center in the neighborhood of Pavuna, which is on the outskirts of the city and surrounded by favelas. Every day, Lior and his friends teach classes in different subjects for local children with the help of members of the Jewish community in the city, who serve as interpreters. The volunteers are also helping to renovate the community center in the neighborhood. Heroes for Life was founded in 2013 by three officers from the Duvdevan unit who, while traveling through the Far East, encountered that many Israelis visited third world countries, and they realized the potential to use that human resource to present the nation of Israel. in a positive way through the volunteer work. The organization is chaired by the former commander of the Air Force General Eliezer Shkedi. The only condition to join a delegation of Heroes for Life is to volunteer first with the organization in a youth village in Israel for three days. The team is called \\"Danielle\\" in honor of Danielle Sonnenfeld, a national service volunteer who worked with children with cancer at the Schneider Medical Center, and who died in a traffic accident three years ago. The founder of the organization is named Gili Cohen. In addition to Brazil, there are delegations that go every year to countries such as: India, Nepal, South Africa, Guatemala, Mexico, Argentina and Ethiopia.  Guatemala  In September 2018, the NGO will expand its volunteer activity to the nation of Guatemala. The first delegation will travel there in September 2018 and the mission will last two weeks. In this expedition, the volunteers will work with children. The activities will include the teaching of English and mathematics, dental health and music. They will also participate in the renovation of a shelter that is located near Guatemala City.  Mexico  In September 2018, the organization will expand its voluntary activity to the nation of Mexico.

The work of the volunteers lasts two weeks and is dedicated to several activities such as teaching English, mathematics, music and dental care. In second place, the activities are carried out to renew and improve the living conditions of the children, as well as various agricultural projects, buildings and residential structures are painted. The expeditions of the volunteers to India began in 2014. One of the principles of the organization is the continuity, for that reason each delegation works with the same children as the previous expeditions. In addition to the activities with the children in the suburbs of the neighborhood during the week, the weekends are dedicated to volunteer work with the local Jewish community. The purpose of these activities is to strengthen the connection with these communities through cultural exchange, in this way the volunteers learn about the way of life of the community and enjoy the flavors and colors of India. The name of the expedition is Danielle, in memory of the IDF sergeant Danielle Pomerantz, who died during the military operation \\"protective edge\\", which took place in the Gaza Strip.  Nepal  In October 2017, the organization expanded its volunteer activities to the nation of Nepal. The first delegation departed there in October and remained two weeks in the country.

The term device neutrality is closely connected to net neutrality, and shares a correlation. Net neutrality is a concept that ensures equal access to the internet and Device neutrality is a concept that ensures equal access to applications. In order to achieve an Open Internet, it is necessary that all Internet access layers remain open for competition, i.e., not only the network access layer (which is the focus of net neutrality), but also the application and operating system access layers (which is the focus of device neutrality).  History and effects  The concept was first proposed in Italy in 2014. Member of the Italian Parliament Stefano Quintarelli proposed a bill which states that users should be free to access content and use the applications they wish, provided they are legal, they do not impair safety and security, and they are not in violation of other laws or court orders. A limitation of this freedom by device manufacturers should be examinable on the grounds of anti consumeristic behaviour. A similar proposal was made by ARCEP, the French regulator for electronic communications, in February 2018. The Android operating system supports installation of third party software on the devices beyond the Google Play store, albeit with complications and hurdles for the user, whereas Apple Inc. restricts the third party installation of applications. After a long and in depth-examination and approval by all committees of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate, at the verge of the final vote, some articles in mainstream press argued the proposed bill had potential to ban the use of iPhones in Italy while international news outlets and commentators held a less dramatic stand . In an October 2016 letter from Apple‚Äôs General Counsel to Spotify, Apple threatened to remove Spotify‚Äôs app from the App Store for advertising free trials to its own customers. Apple decreed: ‚ÄúWhat a developer cannot do is seek to use its iOS app as a marketing tool to redirect consumers outside of the app to avoid in-app purchase‚Äù. In 2019 the presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has embraced Device Neutrality calling for a structural separation of the Apple Computer's app store from the device manufacturing business to allow app installation from other sources, like competing App stores. In Jan. 2020 a group of 53 consumer rights and privacy advocacy organizations signed an open letter to Google asking for the right to completely uninstall preinstalled applications. In Aug. 2020 Apple pulled off the popular Fortnite game by Epic Games from the App Store in retaliation for Epic's refusal to remove an in-app purchase capability alternative to Apple's own payment system which exacts a 30% toll from all payments. Epic denounced Apple's behaviour launching the #FreeFortnite campaign with a parody of the famous 1984 advertisment video that featured Apple as the new Big Brother, and initiating a legal action against what they deem anti-competitive restrictions on mobile device marketplaces .

The Special Chancellery participated in the two years prior to and during the French Invasion of Russia in 1812. The Special Chancellery operated under the Minister of War. The Minister of War at the time, Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, created the Special Chancellery in 1812. The Special Chancellery‚Äôs mission was to gather intelligence on the political activity, military activity, and economy of European states that were a potential enemy of Russia, particularly France. Its operations focused on strategic intelligence, operational and tactical intelligence, and counterintelligence. The Special Chancellery is known to be the birth of counterespionage in Russia. History Barclay de Tolly began organizing the program for the Special Chancellery in 1810 when he received the appointment of Minister of War. He had served for years in the Russian army and Alexander deemed him a more experienced and tactical military strategist than his predecessor, General Alexander Arakcheev. As a result, Tsar Alexander appointed him as the Minister of War on the 18th of January, 1810, when relations between Russia and France began to increase in tension. Through Barclay de Tolly‚Äôs experience as a Field Marshal on the battlefield, he identified the need for Russia‚Äôs military to have timely and accurate intelligence on the enemy‚Äôs intentions, movements, and capabilities. The same month Barclay de Tolly was appointed the Minister of War, he sent Alexander an outlined proposal for an intelligence program that would consist of high ranking Russian military officers to be sent to Russian embassies in Europe under the guise of military attaches to collect and send intelligence back to headquarters in St. Petersburg. Tsar Alexander accepted the proposal, and the organization for the group that came to be known as the Special Chancellery began. Organization As a covert organization with classified missions, the Special Chancellery was a small group. The entire organization consisted of Barclay de Tolly as the Minister of Defense, a director of the Special Chancellery or aide-de-camp, three expeditors, a translator, and seven intelligence agents. When Barclay first began organizing the Special Chancellery in 1810, he appointed Colonel Alexei Voyeikov to be his aid-de- camp. During the war of 1812, Barclay de Tolly became the supreme Commander of the 1st Army of the West, the major army that was Napoleon in Russia. He appointed Voyeikov, who had been in the Russian military since 1799, to handle the intelligence coming in from the agents in Europe. However, in 1812, he was dismissed and Colonel Arseny Zakrevsky took his position. Special Chancellery Intelligence Officers Barclay de Tolly sent military officers to various Russian embassies in Europe with the official status of being attaches. Barclay de Tolly had seven officers operating under his command: Lieutenant Alexander Chernyshyov, Lieutenant G.F. Orlov, Colonel F.V. Teil Von Seraskerken, Colonel R.E. Renin, Lieutenant P.I. Brozin, Lieutenant P.H. Grabbe, and Major V.A. Prendel. Chernyshev had the most responsibility as he headed the Russian intelligence operations in Paris, Orlov and Renin were both stationed in Berlin, and Brozin was in Madrid. Teil Von Seraskerken was in Vienna, Grabbe collected intelligence in Munich, while Prendel was stationed in Dresden. Special Chancellery Operations in France As a Russian military officer who had gained recognition for his military exploits, Alexander Chernyshyov seemed to be the most qualified officer to represent the Special Chancellery in Paris, France. In Paris, Chernyshyov created an extensive network within French nobility, maintain relationships with nobles such as Carolina, the Queen of Naples and Napoleon‚Äôs own sister. Chernyshyov himself had a network of spies in the French government and military that provided him with bi-weekly reports on topics such as troop activities, locations, and strengths. His most famous informant was a French soldier named Michele, who had been an informant for Russia since 1804. Michele and the other informants would give Chernyshyov a report every 2 weeks for a lump sum, which Chernyshyov would translate and send to St. Petersburg for Barclay de Tolly to brief Tsar Alexander. Chernyshyov would also provide profiles of Napoleon‚Äôs top generals in the reports in addition to the intelligence on the French troops.

Here, the Pacific Plate is being subducted underneath the North American plate and the rate of subduction changes from west to east from 7.5 cm/yr to 5.1 cm/yr. The Aleutian subduction zone includes two prominent features _,_ the Aleutian arc and the Aleutian trench. The island arc was created via volcanic eruptions from dehydration of the subducting slab at ~100 km depth. The trench is a narrow and deep morphology that occurs between the two converging plates as the subucting slab dives beneath the overriding plate.500x500px  Geological history  The Aleutian island arc formed ~50-55 ma as a result of Kula plate subduction under the North American Plate before the Pacific plate arrived. There are three stratigraphic units of the Aleutian island arc: volcanic rocks from ~55-33 ma, marine sedimentary rocks from ~23-33 ma, and sedimentary and igneous rocks from ~5 ma-present. Volcanic rocks from ~55-33 ma include sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and breccia that are all volcanic, and they are mixed with pillow lavas in a complex way. Debris flows and turbidity currents transported igneous materials from volcanic source to shallow marine basins. The majority of the volcanism occurred between ~ 56-34 ma along the island arcs. 700x700px  Island arc  The Aleutian island arc crust in Alaska is ~25 km thick, and has a volume of ~2300 km3 per kilometer of the arc. Seismic reflection and refraction surveys indicate that the composition of the Aleutian island arc is not similar to the composition of continental crust. Relatively high p-wave velocities indicate mafic rocks are present and this is verified in the geology of the crust. In the upper crust, there is ~6 km of basaltic andesite, while the middle crust is composed of 5 km-thick mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), and 19 km- thick tholeiitic residue in the lower crust. Continental crusts usually have silicic upper crust and reflective lower crust, but these features are not found in the Aleutian arc.  Magmatism  There are 40 active volcanoes in the Aleutian volcanic arc from the Mt. Spurr in mainland Alaska to Buldir Island in the far west Aleutian islands. The list of volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc could be found here. The eastern end of the volcanic arc on the Alaska Peninsula lies on Mesozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, with trace amounts of Paleozoic rocks intruded by Mesozoic batholiths. Most of the Aleutian Islands are composed of sedimentary rocks from granitic and metamorphic rocks from Oligocene-Miocene. There are Quaternary volcanoes on the north of the Aleutian Islands structural axis, which is composed of andesite mostly, mixed with olivine basalt to rhyolite. The eastern Aleutian volcanoes have more silicic magma while the western Aleutian arcs lack the sial magma.  Trench  = Formation = The Aleutian Trench formation is associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American plate. The horizontally-curved shape of the trench is due to the change in direction of the North American plate around ~5- 2.6 my, resulting in the movement of the Pacific Plate to the northwest. A hypothesis suggests that the northward movement of the Pacific Plate ended ~66-56 my, and the underthrusting of oceanic crust created the Aleutian trench. And yet other more complicated hypotheses exist. There are two hypotheses in the mechanism of the trench formation: tensional and compressional. The tensional hypothesis suggests that island arc loading caused the oceanic crust to create downward faulting. In other words, the trench was a part of oceanic crust once, but faulted down at depth due to the loading of island arc. The compressional hypothesis suggests that mantle convection or drag prevented oceanic crust from reaching isostatic equilibrium, because the imbalance was not adjusted in a relatively short amount of time. As a result, deformation and plastic flow of magma released from open fractures on the concave-side of arc, drags the crust and mantle to deeper depths, and further inhibits vertical rise of magma, creating a trench. = Sedimentation in eastern Aleutian trench = There is a high supply of sediment from turbidity currents, slumps, and creeps into the eastern portion of the Aleutian trench. The sediments accumulated here were originally part of the Alaskan Abyssal Plain. The maximum depth of the trench is 2 km, and the deposition at the maximum depth has been 10 times faster than the abyssal plain. As a result, there is a sediment wedge that is 20‚Äì30 km wide and 1 km thick has been created over ~0.6 my. These sediments are mostly Mesozoic in age, characterized by a consolidated trench deposit grading from sandstone, sandstone and shale, to abyssal turbidity sediments. The most recent addition of a high volume of sediment fill is due to Pleistocene glacial erosion.  Seismicity  Most of the major crustal faults found in the overriding Aleutian island arc are pre-Pleistocene, although precise dating has not been achieved. Along the megathrust, there were 4 earthquakes that were greater than magnitude 8 in the Aleutian subduction zone within the past 75 years : M= 8.2 Shumagin Islands in 1938, M= 8.6 Andreanof Islands in 1957, M= 9.2 Good Friday in 1964, and M= 8.7 Rat Islands in 1965 . Tremor and slow-slip earthquakes have also been observed in the Aleutian subduction zone. The low frequency earthquake (LFE) hypocenters associated with these processes are located near Kodiak Island, Shumagin Gap, Unalaska, and the Andreanof Islands, down-dip of these great megathrust events, where the two converging plates are thought to be at least partially locked. The thickness of sedimentation in the trench does not have a correlation with presence of tremor. For example, there is ~1 km-thick late Quaternary-Holocene sediment underneath Kodiak, and ~ 200 m-thick sediment underneath the Andreanof Islands. Kodiak Island had LFE epicenters at depths of 45‚Äì60 km while Andreanof Islands had epicenters at ~60‚Äì70 km depths. However, tremor does seem to occur at a specific depth related to the age of the subducting plate. The age of the subducting plate is older towards west (Andreanof Island) where LFEs occur at greater depths (~75 km) than in the east where the plate is younger (~45 km near Kodiak Island). This may be because the depths at which the hydrous minerals release water and produce tremors are greater when the plate is older, colder, and subducting faster.

She was named after Tellus, the Earth goddess. Design and Construction On March 10, 1911 it was reported that a new company \\"The Wabana Steamship Company\\" (Wabanas Dampskibskompani) with a capital of NOK 1,500,000 was registered in N√∏tter√∏y with the purpose of transporting ore between Newfoundland and Europe. The new company was a subsidiary of the Nova Scotia Steel Company and was managed by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen. Two ships were leased to conduct the operations (SS Tellus and SS Themis) by the newly formed company for a period of 10 years. The ship was laid down in 1910 at William Doxford & Sons shipyard in Pallion. The vessel was launched on 31 January 1911 (yard number 417), and the sea trials were held on 8 March 1911 with the ship being able to reach speed of . After completion of her sea trials, the ship was delivered to her owner on the same day. On 10 March 1911 Tellus departed from Newcastle for Narvik where the ship was scheduled to take a load of iron ore for delivery to Philadelphia. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Tellus was assessed at 7,395 GRT, and 12,925 DWT which made her the largest ship in Scandinavia at the time. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 412 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After completion Tellus loaded 11,000 tons of Swedish iron ore from the Kiuna-Luossavaara mines in Narvik and departed for her maiden journey on March 18, 1911 to Philadelphia, arriving there on April 6. The cargo was assigned to the Warwick Iron & Steel Co. of Pottstown. The vessel departed from Philadelphia on May 6 and proceeded to Wabana, a mining site for the Nova Scotia Steel Company. After loading iron ore in Newfoundland, the ship departed Wabana on June 6 for Rotterdam. Tellus continued serving the Wabana-Rotterdam route through the end of 1913 during the open navigation period around Newfounland, usually April through November. During winters, the ship was either chartered in North America to move iron ore from Wabana to Philadelphia, or to transport other cargo along the East Coast of the USA, or was engaged in iron ore shipping from Narvik and Kirkenes area to Rotterdam. The ship experienced several accidents throughout her career. During her March 1912 trip from Narvik to Philadelphia with a cargo of iron ore she ran into some ice fields and experienced rough weather throughout her journey, arriving in Philadelphia on March 16 with some damage about the decks. After unloading the ship continued on to Tampa where she took on 7,900 tons of phosphate rock and departed on March 30 for Hamburg. On May 1 Tellus grounded at the entrance to the Hamburg harbor but was able to get off with assistance of 4 tugs. On February 19, 1913 she went into Trondheim with a propeller damage, sustained possibly after hitting a submerged wreck in the water. The work was challenging since due to the size of the ship she could not fit into drydock or even the repair yard. The ship's nose had to be submerged to expose the propeller which then could be changed with the use of the repair yard crane. The ship returned in service by mid-March. On November 17, 1913 she departed Philadelphia for Rotterdam with the largest grain cargo transported by a ship at the time. She could only load half of her cargo at Girard Point and had to get the other half at Port Richmond. Her cargo measured 51,132 quarters or 450,000 bushels of wheat. On April 5, 1914 Tellus again departed Rotterdam for Wabana. The journey took almost 4 weeks and the ship came into Wabana on April 29 leaking and with a damaged propeller which were probably caused by a collision with an iceberg. The vessel proceeded to St John's next day to conduct emergency repairs. After the start of World War I Tellus could no longer be involved in her ore trade, as the main consumer of her cargo was Germany. She became a tramp ship and was chartered for any cargo that she could carry. On August 31, 1914 Tellus departed Norfolk carrying 10,394 tons of coal as cargo and 2,486 tons in bunkers to Piraeus. From Piraeus the ship sailed to New York City via Almeria where together with other Wilhelm Wilhelmsen's ships she was chartered by Barber Line. The vessel loaded a cargo of food supplies and copper for an Italian customer and left New York on November 20, 1914. She had to stop at Gibraltar for a British inspection where the ship was ordered to unload all copper before being allowed to proceed to Genoa on December 23. After her return to New York in April 1915, Tellus went to South America, visiting ports of Montevideo and Buenos Aires before returning to Boston on July 21, 1915. Tellus departed New York for Vladivostok on August 21, 1915 with 11,500 tons of general cargo (most of it were military supplies for Russia), and passed through the Panama Canal on September 2. The vessel called at Comox on October 3 to replenish her bunkers before departing in the early morning on October 5 taking course to Muroran and from there on to Vladivostok. On her trip to Japan Tellus ran into several storms which severely slowed her down and depleted her coal reserves forcing the ship to call at Nemuro. After replenishing her coal bunkers, the ship left Nemuro early on November 17 heading to Muroran, but ran aground in stormy weather on Kaigara-jima sustaining significant damage to her bottom. Most of her cargo was unloaded and saved using lighters but due to the ship being stranded in isolated position she was not refloated until January 22, 1916 and towed to Hanasaki for repairs. Tellus then continued to Hakodate arriving there on February 4, 1916. After undergoing major repairs, the ship departed Hakodate on March 28, 1916 arriving at Shanghai on April 2. Sometime around April 1916 the ship was sold to Ole Wikborg, an owner of a marine insurance company Wikborgs Assuranceselskab based out of Drammen. The ship was renamed Elizabeth IV and after finishing repairs and transfer was chartered to transport sugar from East India to Europe. The ship loaded 11,173 tons of sugar in Pasuruan on Java and departed for Marseilles on July 28, 1916. The ship was under command of Captain Henrik Berg and had a crew of 46 men. Elizabeth IV called at Colombo on August 9 taking 1,400 tons coal in her bunkers, and transited through the Suez Canal on August 31. =Sinking= Elizabeth IV sailed from Port Said around 18:30 on 31 August 1916 for the final leg of her trip to Marseilles. On September 6, around 11:00 she passed by Cape Bon, and observed three patrol boats, that were thought to be British. At this point the course was changed to pass about 20 miles west of Sardinia's southern tip, and from there the course was to be set straight to Marseilles. At around noon on September 8, 1916 in an approximate position an unknown submarine (later to be determined to be German submarine ) was sighted on the vessel's portside. About 3 minutes later, the submarine hoisted an Austrian flag, and Captain Berg ordered an All Stop. About a minute later, a warning shot was fired from the submarine across the bow. Elizabeth IV came to a stop, and a boarding party from the submarine came on board. Once they learned the ship was heading to France, they ordered the crew to abandon ship, the lifeboats were lowered, the scuttling charges were placed on the ship's starboard side and were ignited. At around 13:45 the charges exploded, and the ship immediately began to list on her starboard side and sank bow first at 14:05. The crew was provided with directions on how to get to Capo Falcone on Sardinia, about away. At around 16:00 the lifeboats were sighted by Greek steamer Petritzis who took the crew on board and safely landed them at Savona in the morning of September 10.

He was most probably a vassal of the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga, and his capital was likely located at Podana (modern Bodhan); his successors moved the capital to Vemulavada.  Rule over Sapadalaksha  A Vemulavada inscription states that Vinayaditya ruled over the Sapadalaksha country, which could not be governed by others. The Sanskrit term \\"Sapadalaksha\\" (or \\"Savalakhkhe\\" in vernacular, literally \\"125,000 [villages or revenue units]\\") has been used to describe several distinct regions in the early medieval Indian records, including the Sapadalaksha area in present-day Rajasthan. Some scholars, including Kolluru Suryanarayana and N Venkataramanayya identify the Sapadalaksha of the Vemulavada inscription with the Sapadalaksha of present-day Rajasthan. According to this theory, Vinayaditya probably accompanied his overlord Dantidurga during the Rashtrakuta campaigns against the Gurjara-Pratiharas, and controlled a part of Rajasthan during the Rashtrakuta occupation of that territory. The Vemulavada inscription also credits Vinayaditya with conquering the reputedly inaccessible Chitrakuta fort, although other records of the dynasty, such as the Vikramarjuna Vijayam and the Parbhani copper-plate inscription, do not mention this conquest. According to Venkataramanayya, it is possible that the conquered fort was the modern Chittor Fort (originally called \\"Chitrakuta\\"), located in the ancient Sapadalaksha region. However, other scholars, including Madhusudan Dhaky and Jaisetty Ramanaiah, identify the Sapadalaksha of the Vemulavada inscription with Kosavalam Savalakhe, a historical region in present-day Telangana. This region was centered around Podana (modern Bodhan), which was probably Vinayaditya's capital. The Vemulavada inscription states that Vinayaditya had his elephants bathed in a reservoir filled with oil, at Podana. Pampa's Vikramarjuna Vijayam similarly states that he had 500 elephants bathed in several dirghikas (ponds) filled with oil.  Purported conquests  The Kollipara copper-plate inscription attributed to Vinayaditya's son Arikesari I portrays him as a great conqueror, but this inscription is of doubtful authenticity. It states that Vinayaditya subjugated several kingdoms including Turushka, Yavana, Kashmira, Kambhoja, Magadha, Malava, Kalinga, Ganga, Pallava, Pandya, and Kerala. These claims of conquests are grossly exaggerated, and other records of the dynasty ignore these supposed conquests. It is possible that Vinayaditya participated in the military campaigns of his overlord Dantidurga, whose Ellora Dashavatara cave inscription credits the Rashtrakuta king with defeating the kings of Kalinga, Malava, and other kingdoms.  Successors  Vinayaditya had two sons, Arikesari I and Biragriha; Arikesari succeeded him on the throne.

Plot This novel centers around NUMA (National Underwater Marine Agency) crew leaders Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. Nighthawk is an advanced unmanned aircraft that has been in space three years collecting data. On its return to earth it defies its controllers who are guiding it to a safe landing and it presumably crashes into the ocean. NUMA is requested by the National Security Agency (NSA) to help find and recover Nighthawk. The NSA sends one of its agents to assist and she, Austin and Zavala attempt to find Nighthawk. The Russians and the Chinese also seek to find and recover the craft, as well. This adventure takes Austin, Zavala and others from NUMA off the coast of Ecuador and in the mountains of Peru. As Austin and Zavala search for Nighthawk, more of the story of the importance of what is inside this craft comes to light and why the stakes are so high that it be found quickly. They are to find the future of the world depends on their success. Austin meets a man named Urco, who is trying to study the Chachapoya people. He later, once NUMA uncovers the Nighthawk, was a spy nicknamed \\"The Falconer\\" who wanted to \\"turn the world back to the stone age\\". He is foiled, but it explodes partially over the Pacific ocean which causes plenty of things to break. After this, both a couple Russians who were helping to steal the Nighthawk and the NUMA crew are found on a Caribbean island, now friends.

In this image, Rainbow is at 36¬∞ 14' N and 34¬∞ 5' W. The Rainbow hydrothermal vent field is a system of ultramafic- hosted hydrothermal vents located at 36¬∞14'N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). It was discovered in 1994 from temperature readings of ten high-temperature black smokers at a depth of approximately , where fluids can exceed . The site is shallower and larger in area than many other vent fields along the Azores section of the MAR with an area of . Located southeast of Faial Island, it is a popular geochemical sampling and modeling site due to close proximity to the Azores and definitive representation of serpentinization from hydrothermal circulation and synthesis. Vent geology, biology, and fluid content make Rainbow comparable to other hot hydrothermal vents of the Azores such as Lucky Strike and Menez Gwen. However; chlorinity, metal concentration, and pH distinguish it from neighboring vent fields. As a hot, ultramafic-hosted vent field, pH levels of fluids are extremely low with much H2 and CH4 generated from water interactions with mafic igneous rocks. Though not actively considered for development, Rainbow lies within the MoMAR (Monitoring of the Mid Atlantic Ridge) survey area for a marine observatory. Discovery and expeditions ROV JASON, operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.Rainbow has had a number of visits since its initial discovery in 1994. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), submersibles, and Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) probes have been deployed to sample, characterize, and explore the vent field. * Rainbow was first identified in 1994 from TOBI side- scan sonar and CTD data on the HEAT Cruise, which returned bathymetric geomorphology of the Rainbow Massif. * Premier fluid sampling occurred during the FLORES cruise in 1997, also sampling Azores MAR sites Menez Gwen and Lucky Strike. * The area was surveyed in greater detail in 2001 on the IRIS cruise, marking a debut in magnetism, gravimetry, and water sample data from the ROV Victor 6000. Some vent fluid and gas sampling was also performed on the IRIS cruise of 2001. * In 2002, the SEAHMA 1 cruise was conducted to sample geology and biology at the Azores triple junction where the African, Eurasian, and North American plates meet. * On the MoMARDREAM cruises of 2007 and 2008, the ROV Victor and submersible Nautile were used in collecting a variety of geological samples. During the MoMARDREAM cruises, a total of 29 dredges (14 from 2007, 15 in 2008) were collected. * Fluid sampling was also performed on the KNOX18RR cruise in 2008, with samples collected by the ROV Jason. * 2009 saw the first Portuguese journey to the Rainbow massif from the EMEPC/LUSO/2009 Expedition to study Azores vent biology. * In 2012, trace metals were assessed from numerous field studies of the MAR using the R/V Knorr and ROV Jason II. Geologic setting Rainbow is located on a massif at depth, shared with two fossil (mostly inactive) vent sites Ghost City and Clamstone. As a slow-spreading ridge at approximately 2.2 cm/yr, extensive faulting has uplifted gabbro and peridotite and exposed ultramafic rock to cold seawater. Faulting may also be responsible for magnitude 3 - 3.5 earthquakes observed in hydroacoustic data, suggesting that the region is tectonically active. Unlike high-temperature basalt systems, this ultramafic setting is associated with a positive magnetic anomaly; postulated to come from magnetite precipitation. The active Rainbow site exhibits numerous active and inactive chimneys at serpentinized peridotite outcrops, distinguishable from sediment cover either by protruding from sediment or at a scarp. Chloride concentrations from vent fluids suggest a common heat source for the site, though the location and geometry of heat sources is unknown. Hydrothermal circulation Due to the extensive faulting at the Rainbow massif, cold ocean seawater is able to permeate deep into the seafloor. Water circulates down a fault line, actively reacting with various sediment and rock layers until it is warmed by an underlying heat source. When warmed, it can undergo a phase transition - often resulting in dramatic changes to fluid chemistry. Super- heated vent fluids then rise and are ejected from the seafloor, where a dramatic drop in temperature from cold-water mixing can cause some fluid chemicals to precipitate out and form chimneys. With relatively little basalt within a kilometer of the vent field, most reactions influencing the vent fluids during hydrothermal circulation come from differing degrees of serpentinization and veining of peridotites. Olivine-rich rocks such as troctolites undergo significant alteration, being partially replaced by serpentine and magnetite. There is evidence of high-temperature serpentinite alteration on some samples with pre-existing serpentinite, demonstrating overprinting of serpentinites with higher iron content. Mylonic peridotites at the vent field show plastic deformation then overprinted by serpentine and chlorite. Rainbow exhibits very acidic vent fluids (pH ~2.8) from hydronium ions released from numerous ultramafic rock interactions during vent circulation. Fluids also contain a number of organic carbon molecules, from alkanes and phenol to complicated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) and biogenic fatty acids. These organic carbon molecules suggest organisms living within the vents, harnessing chemosynthetic reactions to metabolize. Serpentinization reactions occur with hydrothermal circulation causing water to react with hot iron-containing minerals, releasing H2 gas and transforming the base rock. Serpentinization may also be responsible for a significant amount of methane produced at Rainbow. Vent fluids are known to travel many kilometers northeast from their associated vents, depositing any unreacted elements to the seafloor far away from their source. Phase separation An example of phases for a material. When vent fluids reach a high enough temperature, they may become gaseous and lose chlorine before leaving through a vent chimney. Phase separation can occur when seawater is heated to a high enough temperature it will form a second phase. At pressure below the critical point (298 bar, 407 ¬∞C for seawater), the seawater boils and produces a vapor phase. At pressure above the critical pressure a saline brine forms as the second phase. In the subsurface, gravitational forces can lead the two phases to separate. Waters circulating deep within Rainbow rise to a high enough pressure or temperature so that they react with the rock and chemical constituents are dissolved into or precipitate out of the vent fluid. Chemical concentrations in the fluid are further modified when it undergoes phase separation because volatile constituents are concentrated in the vapor rich phase and metal ions in the brine. Phase separation carries great significance for chlorine, an abundant element in seawater with few reactions outside of phase separation, and is often normalized to assess thermodynamics within a ridge system. Depending on the chemical stability of the elements, water entering the seafloor will therefore exhibit different chemical characteristics when it comes back out. At Rainbow, phase separation is a suggested cause for particularly high concentrations of chloride, trace elements, and hydronium, as they differ greatly from similar MAR vents like Logatchev. Furthermore, Rainbow vent fluids have the highest concentrations of many elements found at the Azores vents, such as hydrogen, transition metals, and rare earth elements (REE). Due to the extreme endmember pH, chloride is hypothesized to act as a dominant cation and therefore forms many weak complexes with other elements at high temperatures. These complexes become unstable when pH rises or temperature decreases, therefore releasing many transition metals and REEs. Observed endmember fluid samples taken at different vent sites are of very similar manganese and magnesium concentrations, which suggests a common heat source for the vents. There may, however, be many heat sources at Rainbow considering the complex faulting tectonics, and extensive amounts of gabbro and peridotite. Vent Field biology An example of shrimp, crabs and mussels that could be at the Rainbow Vent field. Rainbow has been a long-lived environment for microbial life, with a great diversity of archaea and bacteria at the vent field. Microbes are known to utilize energy from H2 gas and H2S oxidation, with some chemotrophs belonging to the Asgard archaea tree. The Asgard archaea are a very recent discovery with a theorized ancestry in evolution between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Some of the biogenic alkanes found within vent fluids are suggestive of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria or archaea. However, there is also abundant evidence of abiotic production of organic and inorganic molecules at Rainbow, such as methane and carbonate, which may have been supportive of early life. Due to the hot temperatures, low pH, and longevity of the vent activity, there is a strong case for life to originate at sites similar to the Rainbow Massif. Regarding macrofauna, the Rainbow Massif has been supportive of many kinds of decapods and mollusks, such as Alvinocarididae and Bathymodiolus respectively, feeding where nutrient-rich vent fluids interact with the cold bathypelagic waters. Rainbow exhibits fossils of many kinds of vesicomyid and thyasirid shells. Fossils have been dated at other sites on the Rainbow massif, with Ghost City containing gastropod and clam remains that are aged at nearly 111,000 years old. Shell-rich carbonates have been found at Clamstone, which may be as old as 25,000 years. Human uses and preservation Rainbow, as with all other deepwater vent systems, is a location of highly-specialized biology and sensitive geological structures. Due to its significance as an accessible and examplar ultramafic system, Rainbow is a very popular site for scientific expeditions involving intrusive long-term monitoring, environmental manipulation, and geological sampling. It is also the only vent field on the MAR which has been visited by tourists.Stephan Lutter. \\"Rainbow - A Potential MPA\\". http://mobil.wwf.de/fileadmin/fm-wwf/Publikationen- PDF/Rainbow_Heisse_Tiefseequellen.pdf Due to some veining processes, ore extraction and mining are another activity than may upset ecosystems of the massif. Rainbow has a tricky history regarding preservation, as the site is within the OSPAR Maritime Area and just outside of Portugal's exclusive economic zone similarly to another vent field, Saldanha. Portugal was unable to distinguish Rainbow as residing off of the extended Azores shelf region - therefore rendering it unqualified for OSPAR protection as a High Seas location. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lobbied for Rainbow's protection in 2005 and as of 2006, Rainbow is listed by OSPAR as protected marine nature preserve with an MPA size of 22.15 km2.

It premiered on Showtime on April 22, 2018.  Plot  Senator Paley (Dylan Baker) visits Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) in prison, asking for help in discerning what Saul is doing in Russia. Dar looks at the flight manifest and quickly recognizes that Saul and Carrie are organizing a covert operation. Dar then gives him advice on how to track down Saul's task force stateside, which leads them to Clint (Peter Vack). Janet (Ellen Adair), the Chief of Staff to Senator Paley, threatens Clint with legal action. Clint confesses that Saul and Carrie are in Russia to exfiltrate Simone (Sandrine Holt), who is indeed alive. Janet urges Paley to relay this information to the Russian ambassador (Elya Baskin) to sabotage the mission, thereby ending Keane's hopes to salvage her administration. Paley, visibly conflicted, does nothing while Janet is seen talking to the ambassador herself. Saul (Mandy Patinkin) and Carrie (Claire Danes) sit down for a diplomatic meeting with representatives from the SVR (state intelligence agency) and the GRU (military intelligence agency). Saul insists on the presence of Yevgeny Gromov (Costa Ronin) before proceeding ‚Äî a pretense to lure Gromov away from Simone. When Gromov shows up at the meeting, a team led by Anson (James D'Arcy) storms the safehouse where Simone is being kept, but are forced to retreat after being ambushed by guards. Saul declares the mission a failure, but Carrie is determined to devise a new plan before leaving. She observes dissension between the SVR's General Yakushin and the GRU's Colonel Mirov during the meeting, and wonders how her team can exploit the tense relationship. Sandy (Catherine Curtin) discovers that General Yakushin (Misha Kuznetsov) of the SVR is hiding $300M in various U.S. banking institutions. President Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) gets the news that the Supreme Court has rejected the dismissal of four of her Cabinet secretaries. With that, the Cabinet has the sufficient votes to invoke the 25th Amendment. Vice President Warner (Beau Bridges) arrives at the Oval Office to personally relieve a stunned Keane of her command. General Yakushin meets with Saul, livid that his bank accounts have been emptied of funds. Saul tells Yakushin that he will return the money in exchange for Simone Martin. When approached by Yakushin, Mirov (Merab Ninidze) falsely denies any knowledge of Simone or her whereabouts. Yakushin responds by sending 30 heavily armed, masked men to GRU headquarters where Simone is being held in an upstairs suite. Chaos and violence ensues as the SVR starts forcefully clearing out the building en masse; Carrie and Anson gain entry clothed like the masked men from the SVR. Carrie accesses the balcony of Simone's suite via a ledge from a nearby window. Simone holds Carrie at gunpoint but Carrie convinces Simone to come with her, making her understand she is now a massive liability to the Russians who will consider her expendable. Yevgeny sees \\"Simone\\" taken away by Anson and orders the car to be followed, but is actually duped by Carrie wearing Simone's scarf and a black wig. The real Simone, wearing a blonde wig, safely escapes in another car with Bennet (Ari Fliakos).

Life and career McNeely was drafted into the Army in November 1967 when he was 21, and served in combat in the Vietnam War. He was there for fourteen months and was part of the 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, where he attained the rank of sergeant, and earned a Bronze Star Medal. While there, he bought an inexpensive Nikon camera, started taking pictures and ended up running the Army photo lab. When he returned to the United States, he enrolled in a summer workshop at Aspen, Colorado, under the tutelage of professional photographers Nathan Lyons, Bruce Davidson, Cornell Capa and Paul Caponigro. This would be the only formal training he would receive, as he moved to California to follow the campaign trail of George McGovern, impressed with McGovern's opposition to the ongoing war in Vietnam. It was also around this time that he struck up a friendship with Hunter S. Thompson. Following McGovern's defeat to Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election, McNeely pursued his career in photojournalism, with a further high point coming in 1973, as his photographs of the Nixon impeachment case were published in Time. McNeely was then appointed official campaign photographer for vice presidential nominee Walter Mondale, and after Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as President, McNeely kept his position as Mondale's official photographer. In 1980, when Carter and Mondale lost the election to Reagan and Bush, McNeely stepped away from the world of politics and went into the private sector as a photographer, working freelance for magazines such as Time and Newsweek. In January 1992, former Carter White House staffers who had been working on the campaign trail of Bill Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas, contacted McNeely if he would be interested in covering it as well. McNeely was reluctant to do so, and suggested they hire a younger photographer, which they did. When Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination, McNeely thought that he had made a mistake in not taking the job. The next day, he was contacted again by the same people to tell him that the situation with the other photographer was not working out, so the job was re-offered to him. He had only an hour to decide, and afterwards, he would be a part of the campaign staff up until Election Day. He returned to the White House the following year, after Clinton's victory in the election. An example of McNeely's work, shot in his trademark black and white film, of Clinton meeting with former President Richard Nixon, 1993. In November 1995, McNeely's photographs became a source of political leverage in the wake of the first federal government shutdown later that month. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated during the ongoing disagreements over the budget, and a delegation consisting of Clinton, Vice President Gore, Speaker of the House Gingrich and Majority Senate Leader Dole amongst others flew aboard Air Force One to the funeral. Gingrich complained that he was not able to discuss the budget and was sent to the back of the plane, so he shut down the government in retaliation. McNeely remembered that he had taken pictures of Clinton and Gingrich together on the flight back to Washington, and showed them to Press Secretary Mike McCurry, who saw the potential in outsmarting Gingrich. McNeely made multiple prints of the perceived incident and left them in the media briefing room in the West Wing, where they were taken by journalists. Once the photographs were published, the press criticized Gingrich for his false claim. Around the same time, McNeely realized that he had been, unwittingly, a witness to a small part of the Clinton‚ÄìLewinsky scandal. When Clinton met with staff members in a meeting, he gestured to the photographer to take a picture of him and the intern. McNeely did so, and thought nothing of it, but after additional information had become widely known, he surmised that Lewinsky had performed oral sex on the President earlier that day. While McNeely had previously been granted unprecedented access to the White House, he was barred in the fallout of the scandal, as the Clintons were worried that the photographs could be subpoenaed by Ken Starr (although some of which eventually made it into the hands of the independent counsel). He was also excluded from meetings with lawyers in fear that he might testify on what he had heard, and frustrated over the focus of the President's personal life, quit the position in September 1998, citing a desire to be with his family. In October 2000, McNeely published his first photobook, The Clinton Years, the first time a book was published with the subject still in office, and as such, the White House also had a say in what photographs were used. However, as the book was printed at a press in mainland China, it had been held up when authorities realized that there was a photograph of Clinton meeting with the Dalai Lama. They confiscated the entire press run, threatening to destroy the books unless the offending photograph was removed, but they relented at the last minute and the book was released. In the same year, McNeely was the official campaign photographer for Hillary Clinton's successful senate campaign, and also followed Democratic, Republican and third party presidential nominees around the country, in a project entitled Politics 2000.

Passing gas through the hydrate stability zone at southern Hydrate Ridge, offshore Oregon. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 241(1-2), 211-226.. Southern Hydrate Ridge has been the site of numerous submersible dives with the human occupied Alvin submarine, extensive visits by numerous robotic vehicles including the Canadian ROV ROPOS, Jason (US National Deep Submersible Facility), and Tiburon (MBARI), and time-series geophysical studies that document changes in the subsurface distribution of methane.

Green star marks the location of Newport Oregon.  Geological background  The geologic history of the Southern Hydrate Ridge has been reconstructed through seismic imaging, which provides constraints on the origin of methane ice deposits found in this region. Hydrate Ridge is in a region where faults along the Cascadia Margin transition from seaward-verging to landward-verging. This fault reorientation corresponds to the transition from sedimentary accretion to subduction in this active accretionary margin. Seaward-verging thrust faults characterize the ridge deformation front, extending down to ~7 km beneath the summit. Initiation of the uplift of Southern Hydrate Ridge is predicted to have initiated about 1 million years agoChevallier, J., Tr√©hu, A., Johnson, N., Bangs, H., & Jack Meyer. (2005). Seismic sequence stratigraphy and tectonic evolution of southern Hydrate Ridge. Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program: Scientific Results,204, .. = Sedimentary characteristics = Clay-rich sediments have been found at the Southern Hydrate Ridge. These sediments are from Pleistocene to Holocene in age, and composed of 29% smectite, 31% illite, and 40% (chlorite + kaolinite) on average. Underlying the Pleistocene-Holocene strata is the late-Pliocene- early-Pleistocene accretionary material, composed of 38% smectite, 27% illite, and 35% (chlorite + kaolinite). A thick permeable zone of coarse-grained turbidites underlies the sediments. Located along the Cascadia accretionary marginPhilip, B., Denny, A., Solomon, E., & Kelley, D. (2016). Time‚Äêseries measurements of bubble plume variability and water column methane distribution above Southern Hydrate Ridge, Oregon. Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems,17(3), 1182-1196., sediment build-up in this region is driven by two subduction-related processes: #Scraping of sediments off of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate onto the overlying North American plate, and #Underplating of subducted sediments onto the overlying plate. Continuous duplexing and underplating of sediment has caused thickening of sediments through uplifting. Furthermore, compaction and dewatering in this region has led to increased local pore pressure. Methane Ice at Southern Hydrate Ridge  Methane ice at Southern Hydrate Ridge has been found within the shallow sediments, and more rarely exposed on the seafloor. Because Southern Hydrate Ridge is located on the upper continental slope, the regional hydrate stability zone (RHSZ), which is controlled by the sediment pore pressure and temperatureBangs, N. L., Musgrave, R. J., & Tr√©hu, A. M. (2005). Upward shifts in the southern Hydrate Ridge gas hydrate stability zone following postglacial warming, offshore Oregon. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 110(B3)., is very shallow. As organic material in the sediments is utilized by microbes, producing methane saturation within the sediment pores, methane ice forms within the RHSZ . The base of the RHSZ marks the transition from methane-ice- rich sediment, to clay sediments. Due to the impedance contrast between RHSZ and the underlying sediments, the depth of RHSZ can be detected using seismic imaging techniques. = Associated microbially-mediated carbonate formations = Methane hydrate formation is associated with extensive authigenic carbonate. These carbonate deposits are associated with the local chemosynthetic communities such as sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, mussels, vesicomyid clams, snails and tube worms (although tube worms are not observed at Southern Hydrate Ridge)Boetius, & Suess.

At Southern Hydrate Ridge, in addition to a gentle rampart of authigenic carbonate cobbles that rims the main seep site, there is a 60-m tall massive carbonate deposit called the Pinnacle. Uranium-thorium dating of carbonate material from the Pinnacle indicates that the Pinnacle is between ~ 7,000 and 11,000 years old Teichert, B. M.

This area is characterized by multiple sites of venting. which is thought to reflect different fracture networks. While active venting may maintain open fracture networks, fractures may also be filled by hydrates when there is no venting. As venting reactivates, a new fracture system may be created. While temporal and spatial variations in venting have been observed at this seep site, the local venting rate has been found to varyi over six orders of magnitude: the controls are still not well understood. New instrumentation at this site, including cabled multibeam sonar systems developed by the University of Bremen, now image the entire seep area of Southern Hydrate Ridge, scanning for plumes every two hours. An overview sonar and quantification sonar at the main study site \\"Einsteins Grotto\\", are providing new insights into the temporal, spatial and intensity of the plumes and quantification of methane flux from this highly dynamic environment. = Significance = Release of methane from marine seep sites into the atmosphere may have been a factor for past climate warming events, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM).Katz, M.

Scientific investigation  Since the discovery of methane seeps and novel microbial and macrofauna at Hydrate Ridge in 1986, the Southern Hydrate Ridge has become an extensive study site. Currently, it is one of the study sites under the OOI Regional Cabled Array. Infrastructure, including a diverse suite of instruments, was installed and became fully operational in 2014. Sensors that are currently at this site include : *Pressure Sensor measures the pressure exerted by the overlying water column at the seafloor and is installed to study the impacts of lunar tides on methane release. *Current Meter measures the current velocity and temperature of the water using acoustic signals. *Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measures the current velocity of the water profile in the region using acoustic signals. This instrument is installed by the OOI for understanding the local fluxes of heat, mass and momentum. An example of such application is the study of bubble plume evolution over timePhilip, B., Kelley, D., Solomon, E., & Delaney, J. (2016). Monitoring methane emissions at Southern Hydrate Ridge using an OOI Cabled Array Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler.

Sex-hormonal agents may be either steroidal or nonsteroidal in chemical structure and may serve to either enhance, inhibit, or have mixed effects on the function of the sex hormone systems. Sex-hormonal agents are used in medicine for a variety of purposes including hormone therapy (e.g., menopausal hormone therapy, androgen replacement therapy, transgender hormone therapy), antihormone therapy (e.g., androgen deprivation therapy, estrogen deprivation therapy), and hormonal contraception, among others. Types and examples =Androgen receptor (AR) modulators= * Androgens and anabolic steroids (AR agonists) ** Examples: testosterone, androstanolone (dihydrotestosterone), prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone), nandrolone (nortestosterone), methyltestosterone, metandienone (methandrostenolone), oxandrolone, stanozolol, danazol * Selective androgen receptor modulators (AR mixed agonists/antagonists) ** Examples: enobosarm (ostarine; GTx-024, MK-2866), andarine (GTx-007) * Antiandrogens (AR antagonists) ** Examples: cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, spironolactone, flutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide =Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators= * Estrogens (ER agonists) ** Examples: estradiol, estrone, estriol, estetrol, conjugated estrogens (Premarin), ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (stilbestrol), chlorotrianisene * Selective estrogen receptor modulators (ER mixed agonists/antagonists) ** Examples: tamoxifen, clomifene, cyclofenil, raloxifene, toremifene, lasofoxifene, ospemifene, bazedoxifene * Antiestrogens (ER antagonists) ** Examples: fulvestrant, ICI-164384, TAS-108 (SR-16234), ZB716 (fulvestrant-3-boronic acid), ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) =Progesterone receptor (PR) modulators= * Progestogens and progestins (PR agonists) ** Examples: progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethisterone (norethindrone), levonorgestrel, drospirenone, dydrogesterone * Selective progesterone receptor modulators (PR mixed agonists/antagonists) ** Examples: mifepristone, ulipristal acetate, telapristone (CDB-4124), vilaprisan (BAY-1002670) * Antiprogestogens (PR antagonists) ** Examples: aglepristone, onapristone (ZK-89299) =Indirect sex-hormonal agents= Drugs that indirectly influence sex hormone systems, such as antigonadotropins like GnRH analogues and prolactin releasers (e.g., D2 receptor antagonists), progonadotropins like GnRH agonists, and steroidogenesis inhibitors like aromatase inhibitors and androgen synthesis inhibitors, are also sex-hormonal agents.

Her research has been adopted and used to directly inform safety policy by Government Departments of Sport and Health, health promotion and injury prevention agencies, and peak sports bodies both within Australia and internationally. Her injury prevention research has been applied to falls in older people, road safety, workplace safety and injuries in children.  Education  Finch graduated from Monash University, Melbourne in 1983 with a BSc (Hons, 1st Class) majoring in statistics. In 1985 Latrobe University awarded her a MSc in Statistics. In 1995 she was awarded a PhD in Mathematical Statistics from Monash University for a thesis titled: Fasting plasma glucose distributions and their implications for the diagnostic criteria for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in Pacific populations. At high school Finch was interested in disease prevention. As an undergraduate student she realised this interest could be combined with her strong mathematics and statistics skills which led to her career as an epidemiologist and biostatistician.  Career  Finch began work as a Researcher at the Monash University Accident Research Centre training in injury research from 1992 until 1997 and continued from 2001-2003 within the Monash University, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine. From 2003 to 2006 Finch was Professor and Director, NSW Injury Risk Management Research Centre, University of New South Wales and then held the position of Research Professor, School of Human Movement and Sport Sciences, University of Ballarat until 2010. In 2010 she returned to Monash Injury Research Institute as Research Professor and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Principal Research Fellow in the Australian Centre for Research into Injury in Sport and its Prevention (ACRISP). ACRISP is one of only nine centres worldwide recognised as International Research Centres for Prevention of Injury and Protection of Athlete Health and supported by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Finch became the Robert HT Smith Professor and Personal Chair at Federation University, Ballarat, Australia in 2013. In December 2017 she was appointed Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) at Edith Cowan University, Perth, Western Australia. Finch has held positions as a sports injury prevention adviser to the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, the Australian Sports Commission, Sports Medicine Australia, Sport and Recreation Victoria, Department of Human Services (Victoria), the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, The Australian Football League and other national and state sports bodies. She is a continuing Board Member, Sports Medicine Australia, since 2015, a Member of the Concussion Advisory Group for World Rugby, since 2014, a Member of the Victorian Government Sports Injury Prevention Taskforce from 2011 to 2013 and a Member of the National Sports Safety Framework Committee in 1996,1997 and 2003. Funding for Finch's research has come from the NHMRC, Australian Research Council, VicHealth, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the US and Canadian National Institutes of Health, Australian Federal and State government departments for health and sport and from peak sports bodies including the International Rugby Board, F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the Australian Football League and Cricket Australia. Finch has worked to improve community safety in sport and to drive significant change around children's and women's sport and in the Australian school system, to improve safety equipment and training methods in individual sports and to create a database for sports injuries. The work of Finch and her teams has led to government departments of health and peak sport bodies recognising that they have a duty of care to everyone, not just the elite athletes and that sports safety is their business as well. Finch is a Senior Associate Editor (Injury Prevention) for the British Journal of Sports Medicine and the Injury Prevention and Health Promotion BJSM Series and a member of the Editorial Boards of the international journals: Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, Injury Epidemiology and Sports Medicine. She has published over 250 articles.  Awards  Finch was awarded the 2015 International Distinguished Career Award by the American Public Health Association's (APHA) Injury Control and Emergency Health Services (ICEHS) Section. The award recognised her \\"outstanding dedication and leadership in injury/violence prevention and control and emergency health services internationally with contributions and achievements that have a significant and long term impact on the field\\". In January 2018 Finch was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), \\"for distinguished service to sports medicine, particularly in the area of injury prevention, as an educator, researcher and author, and to the promotion of improved health in athletes and those who exercise.\\"  Projects  Projects Finch has been involved with include: = NoGAPS = Carried out from 2010 to 2013, NoGAPS (National Guidance for Australian football Partnerships and Safety) was a NHMRC Partnerships Project which aimed to develop, deliver, implement and evaluate new evidence-based guidelines for exercise training programs to prevent lower limb injuries in community Australian football. It aimed to identify factors that affect the application of evidence-based injury prevention interventions into practice in community sport, and to find evidence for the effectiveness of an evidence-based exercise-training program for lower limb injury prevention in community Australian football. The project involved partnerships with the Australian Football League, Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, NSW Sporting Injuries Committee, JLT Sport, a division of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Australia Pty Ltd; Department of Planning and Community Development - Sport and Recreation Victoria Division; and Sports Medicine Australia - National and Victorian Branches (SMA). = Preventing Australian Football Injuries through eXercise (PAFIX) project = Finch was the project leader of the 2015 PAFIX study which followed 18 community-level Australian football clubs in Western Australia and Victoria through an entire season aiming to understand and prevent knee injuries in community Australian football. The large scale PAFIX project was unique in its use of a multi-level approach to understand the cause and prevention of knee injuries in community Australian football. Published results provide information to assist coaches and sports clubs to implement injury prevention programs. Data was also collected during the project focusing on concussion with the aim to understand and prevent head injuries within a community Australian football setting. = Helmets and headgear = Since the mid 1990s Finch has carried out studies relating to use of helmets for both pedal and motor cyclists. In 2013 Finch jointly published results of a study of associations between helmet use and brain injuries amongst injured pedal- and motor-cyclists. The study was carried out at the University of New South Wales, School of Risk and Safety Sciences under funding by an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Grant: Pedal and Motor Cycle Helmet Performance Study. The project partners were: the Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure and Transport, NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW RTA), Transport Accident Commission Victoria, NRMA Motoring and Services, NRMA-ACT Road Safety Trust and DVExperts International. Finch has also been involved in research into the efficacy and methods of improvement of protective headgear in rugby union, rugby league, and Australian rules football. = Child safety = Finch's research has also encompassed several aspects of child safety including vehicular safety restraints, parent/caregiver supervision and water safety. = Fall prevention in older adults = Finch has been involved in research around falls prevention and implementation of fall prevention strategies in older people.

The first tests of the halo were carried out in 2016 and in July 2017. Since the 2018 season the FIA has made the halo mandatory on every vehicle in Formula 1, Formula 2, Formula 3 and Formula E as a new safety measure. Outside from FIA sanctioned series, some open-wheel racing also utilises a halo, such as IndyCar Series, Super Formula, and Australian S5000 Championship. The IndyCar halo is used as a structural frame for the aeroscreen.  Construction  The system consists of a bar that surrounds the driver's head and is connected by three points to the vehicle frame. The halo is made of titanium and weighed around in the version presented in 2016, then rose to in 2017. The system is not developed by the teams, but is manufactured by three approved external manufacturers chosen by the FIA and has the same specification for all vehicles. In a simulation performed by the FIA, using the data of 40 real incidents, the use of the system led to a 17% theoretical increase in the survival rate of the driver.  History and development  The FIA for development examined three fundamental scenarios ‚Äî collision between two vehicles, contact between a vehicle and the surrounding environment (such as barriers) and collisions with vehicles and debris. Tests have shown that the halo system can significantly reduce the risk of injury to the driver. Moreover, in many cases the system was able to prevent the helmet from coming into contact with a barrier when checked against a series of accidents that had occurred in the past. During the study of the last case it was found that the halo is able to deflect large objects and provide greater protection against smaller debris. Halo system at the Spark SRT05e. The halo for the Gen2 car consists of LED lights that indicate the level of power mode the car is in (blue for ATTACK MODE and magenta for Fanboost). In August 2017 the Dallara F2 2018, a new Formula 2 car, was presented and was the first to install the halo system. The SRT05e Formula E car presented in January 2018 had a halo. In November 2018, the 2019 FIA Formula 3 car, which was unveiled in Abu Dhabi, installed the halo too. = Alternative systems = As an alternative to the halo system, Red Bull Racing developed the \\"aeroscreen\\". The design, which was similar to a small fairing, did not receive much interest from the FIA. After the drivers had expressed their opposition to the introduction of the halo system, the FIA developed the \\"shield\\", a polyvinyl chloride windscreen based on the airbrush concept. In 2019 the aeroscreen was adapted to utilise the halo as a structural frame for use in IndyCar. Sebastian Vettel was the first and only driver to try the shield. During the free practice for the 2017 British Grand Prix, he completed a lap with the new system before ending the test early. He complained of distorted and blurred vision that prevented him from driving. Its introduction was subsequently excluded, as there was no guarantee that the issues with the shield could be solved in time for the 2018 season. = Reception = The system has aroused some criticism, including that of Niki Lauda, who claimed that this system distorts the \\"essence of racing cars\\". The system has also proved unpopular with fans, who have said that it is visually unappealing, against the concept of open-cockpit racing, and obstructs the driver's vision. Other former drivers, including Jackie Stewart, welcomed the system and compared it to the introduction of seat belts, which had been similarly criticised, but then became the norm also on road cars.

Both Makino and Leclerc credited the halo for possibly saving their lives, and Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff, who had criticised the halo earlier in the season, admitted that it had proved itself following Leclerc's incident.

O'Sullivan has described it as \\"very much a Catholic working class family song\\". Writing in The Guardian, Bob Stanley considered \\"We Will\\" to be \\"a song of resigned melancholy about how to get through a personal crisis by appreciating things such as kicking a ball, visiting distant relatives, eating corn flakes\\". The Times writer Pavel Barter wrote in 2017 that the song \\"introduced a form of kitchen-sink observational drama usually lacking in pop music\\". Upon release, Peter Jones of Record Mirror considered the song \\"less infectious\\" than O'Sullivan's first hit \\"Nothing Rhymed\\", but described it as \\"unmistakeably Gilbert, with that mixture of naivety and power\\".

Narrated from the point of view of Pappy Pariah, the book tells the story of Bob Honey, a supposed international assassin who kills elderly people with a mallet. Atria Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published the novel on March 27, 2018. Inspiration In several interviews, Penn said that he was inspired to write the novel in response to current political movements including the Parkland survivors working to change gun laws. Although readers can draw connections to modern events and figures, Penn claims that the book is about morality and modern American culture.  Plot  With no formal plot, it is not entirely clear if Honey's life story, recounted through Pariah, is supposed to be true or a figment of Honey's delusional mind. Honey lives in a quiet street in Woodview, California. Since his divorce, he has a hard time connecting with other people and annoys his neighbors with his lawn mowing. Honey complains of the incessant marketing of modern society and never-ending news cycles. His ex-wife, who drives an ice-cream truck around his neighborhood, is now happily married to her divorce lawyer. Honey now longs for a young woman named Annie described as \\"Effervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare.\\" Honey is a former septic tank salesman who becomes an assassin. He tries to be more social, throwing a barbecue for his neighbors. His job as a contract killer for a secretive government program takes him around the world. The off-the-books government program instructs him to target elderly citizens and others who drain resources in a consumption-driven society. His adventures include a trip to New Orleans to help Katrina victims. He travels to Baghdad, Beirut, South Sudan, and other locations for sewage emergencies. Honey also submerges himself into the Pacific Ocean in a quest to find sea life. An investigative journalist starts asking questions about him, causing Honey to start making changes in his life. He is threatened by an ever-invasive media and possible assassination attempts from his mysterious controllers. The book includes an epilogue featuring a poem that touches on current events ‚Äî the Las Vegas mass shooting, North Korea, and Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, and the #MeToo movement. Honey also writes a threatening letter to the US President \\"Mr. Landlord\\" in which he advocates for the President's assassination. He declares, \\"You are not simply a president in need of impeachment, you are a man in need of an intervention. We are not simply a people in need of an intervention, we are a nation in need of an assassin [...] Tweet me bitch, I dare you.\\" The lengthy epilogue poem ends with Honey killing the investigative journalist with his mallet and running away to parts unknown.  Characters  *Pappy Pariah ‚Äì Born in the fictional town Summerton Feathers, Iowa in 1960, Pappy Pariah is the author of the audiobook version of Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff. Pappy is both the narrator of the book and the pseudonym for Sean Penn who claimed to have met Pappy in Florida. Pappy claims to have written articles for mainstream American news outlets under a pseudonym himself, but this is his first novel. When he was 13, he suffered from severe appendicitis and says this medical event was the source of his inspiration to become a writer *Bob Honey ‚Äì The title character. He is described as an angry, divorced middle-age man with a variety of jobs: sewage specialist, carnival carny, Jehovah's witness, government operative, and assassin. Bob is alienated by a media-saturated society, and has a hard time getting along with other people, especially since his divorce. The 56-year-old character has \\"an ultra-violent skepticism toward the messaging and mediocrity of modern times\\" *The Landlord ‚Äì Bob Honey writes a scathing letter to the landlord described as, \\"the violently immature seventy-year-old boy-man with money and French vanilla cotton candy hair\\". When asked about the \\"Trumpian\\" Landlord character, Penn has maintained that it is up to the reader to interpret the metaphors he develops in the book.  Release  A portion of the novel was first published as a free Audible book, listing Pappy Pariah as the author and Penn as just the narrator of the audio book. Initially, Penn denied being the author of the book, insisting instead that it was written by an author he had met in a bar in Key West, Florida. In press junkets to promote the novel's release, Penn has stated his wish to quit acting and become a full-time novelist.  Reception  Bob Honey was met with generally negative reviews, with several critics decrying the writer's undisciplined style. Mark Athitakis writing for The Washington Post was critical of the book, observing that the satire was not humorous and the writing incoherent with overuse of alliteration. Writing for the National Review, Jonah Goldberg had not yet read the book but commented on excerpts, characterizing the formulaic prose as \\"4 parts alliteration, 1 part wry masturbation references.\\" Goldberg's comments were based on a review and quotes provided by Claire Fallon of HuffPost who herself was highly critical of the book, going so far as to announce that \\"Sean Penn The Novelist Must Be Stopped\\". It was featured in Michael J. Nelson's and Conor Lastowka's podcast series 372 Pages We'll Never Get Back, a program which analyzes literature they deem to be of poor quality (the former jokingly referred to it as the actor's magnum opus). On Cracked.com, Mark Hill called it \\"the worst novel in human history,\\" observing that \\"Penn writes like he's looked up every single word in his thesaurus except \\"dictionary.\\" The novel was also criticized for racist and misogynistic content. In The Guardian, Sian Cain called Bob Honey \\"repellent and stupid on so many levels.\\" Penn has defended portions of the book concerning the Trump presidency and the Me Too movement as being \\"taken out of context: 'I think, we're in a sad state where fiction is attributed to opinion ... where fiction can't be just read as it is.' \\" Several media sources have interpreted \\"Mr. Landlord\\" as an obvious allegorical reference to Donald Trump. According to the BBC News, \\"Critics were keen to pick up on Mr Landlord, a character that could be a thinly veiled dig at Donald Trump. He is described as a 'violently immature 70-year-old boy-man with money and French vanilla cotton candy hair'.\\" Novelist Salman Rushdie praised the novel, saying \\"It seems wrong to say that so dystopian a novel is great fun to read [...] I suspect that Thomas Pynchon and Hunter S. Thompson would love this book.\\" Travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux also came out in favor of the book, calling it \\"Comic, cauchemaresque, crackling with life [...] Bob Honey is a hero of our Trumpian times reflected in the cracked mirror of Penn's prose. I loved that it defied the critics who are, as always like eunuchs in a harem observing the creative act but unable to do the same.\\" Trevor Noah, on Comedy Central's The Daily Show, described the book as \\"a strange story that seems like a metaphor for real life.\\" Penn told Marc Maron in his podcast, WTF, that the novel Bob Honey was a way for him to combat negativity and societal burnout the actor had been dealing with. \\"It was an exercise in avoiding defeat,\\" he told Maron. \\"It's kind of 'operating world humor,' because I felt like a surgeon whose patient was inevitably going to die every day. And I thought, let me go practice this in an alternate reality form which got me away from the news for a while.\\"  Sequel  A sequel was released on September 10, 2019, with the title Bob Honey Sings Jimmy Crack Corn, published by Rare Bird Books, as it directly continues off the events of the first novel, seeing Bob Honey, hunted by the authorities, head to Washington, D.C. to directly confront the Landlord.

The store offers a collection of existing and custom Buddhist statuary items and has been operating free meditation classes since 2009. The gift shop is best known for its role in the development of the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, Delta Beta Tau, at San Diego State University (SDSU).  History  The store was founded in 1998 by an elderly couple in the Campus Plaza Shopping center near San Diego State University (SDSU), in the same plaza as a Thai restaurant also owned by the couple. When the original owners planned on retiring in 2009, they asked the founders of Dharma Bum Temple to take over Buddha For You. The founders were reluctant to take on running the store, but agreed hoping it would assist with their temple work and create revenue for the temple. After Buddha For You was acquired by Dharma Bum Temple, the temple set up free meditation classes at the shop. The shop was not profitable but its free meditation classes became popular among college students from the nearby college campus of SDSU, with students eventually starting a meditation club on campus as a result. In 2011, the store moved to another building in the same plaza, which was done in the style of a pilgrimage. Over 150 people joined the move, which was led a Tibetan lama chanting Om mani padme hum as volunteers carried the store inventory into location by foot. In September 2015, SDSU students who regularly attended the meditation classes at Buddha For You began a Buddhist college fraternity at the suggestion of store co-owner Jeffrey Zlotnik. The co-ed fraternity, Delta Beta Tau, became the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States. In 2017, the gift shop moved again, consolidating into the first floor of Dharma Bum Temple, which had moved locations, and transferred its status to a non-profit.

There is a lot of variation in prokaryotic genome size, with the smallest free-living cell's genome being roughly ten times smaller than the largest prokaryote. Two of the bacterial taxa with the smallest genomes are Prochlorococcus and Pelagibacter ubique, both highly abundant marine bacteria commonly found in oligotrophic regions. Similar reduced genomes have been found in uncultured marine bacteria, suggesting that genomic streamlining is a common feature of bacterioplankton. This theory is typically used with reference to free-living organisms in oligotrophic environments.  Overview  Comparison of genome sizes across select organisms Genome streamlining theory states that certain prokaryotic genomes tend to be small in size in comparison to other prokaryotes, and all eukaryotes, due to selection against the retention of non-coding DNA. The known advantages of small genome size include faster genome replication for cell division, fewer nutrient requirements, and easier co-regulation of multiple related genes, because gene density typically increases with decreased genome size. This means that an organism with a smaller genome is likely to be more successful, or have higher fitness, than one hindered by excessive amounts of unnecessary DNA, leading to selection for smaller genome sizes. Some mechanisms that are thought to underlie genome streamlining include deletion bias and purifying selection. Deletion bias is the phenomenon in bacterial genomes where the rate of DNA loss is naturally higher than the rate of DNA acquisition. This is a passive process that simply results from the difference in these two rates. Purifying selection is the process by which extraneous genes are selected against, making organisms lacking this genetic material more successful by effectively reducing their genome size. Genes and non-coding DNA segments that are less crucial for an organism survival will be more likely to be lost over time. This selective pressure is stronger in large marine prokaryotic populations, because intra-species competition favours fast, efficient and inexpensive replication. This is because large population sizes increase competition among members of the same species, and thus increases selective pressure and causes the reduction in genome size to occur more readily among organisms of large population sizes, like bacteria. This may explain why genome streamlining seems to be particularly prevalent in prokaryotic organisms, as they tend to have larger population sizes than eukaryotes. It has also been proposed that having a smaller genome can help minimize overall cell size, which increases a prokaryotes surface-area to volume ratio. A higher surface-area to volume ratio allows for more nutrient uptake proportional to their size, which allows them to outcompete other larger organisms for nutrients. This phenomenon has been noted particularly in nutrient depleted waters.  Genomic signatures  Genomic analysis of streamlined organisms have shown that low GC content, low percentage of non-coding DNA, and a low fraction of genes encoding for cytoplasmic membrane proteins, periplasmic proteins, transcriptionally related proteins, and signal transduction pathways are all characteristic of free- living streamlined prokaryotic organisms. Oftentimes, highly streamlined organisms are difficult to isolate by culturing in a laboratory (SAR11 being a central example).  Model organisms  = Pelagibacter ubique (SAR11) = Pelagibacter ubique are members of the SAR11 clade, a heterotrophic marine group which are found throughout the oceans and are rather common. These microbes have the smallest genome and encode the smallest number of Open Reading Frames of any known non-sessile microorganism. P. ubique has complete biosynthetic pathways and all necessary enzymes for the synthesis of 20 amino acids and only lack a few cofactors despite the genome's small size. The genome size for this microorganism is achieved by lack of, \\"pseudogenes, introns, transposons, extrachromosomal elements, or inteins\\". The genome also contains fewer paralogs compared to other members of the same clade and the shortest intergenic spacers for any living cell. In these organisms, unusual nutrient requirements were found due to the streamlining selection and gene loss when selection occurred for more efficient resource utilization in oceans with limited nutrients for uptake. These observations indicate that some microbes may be difficult to grow in a laboratory setting because of unusual nutrient requirements. = Prochlorococcus = Individual Prochlorococcus cell Prochlorococcus is one of the dominant cyanobacteria and is a main participant in primary production in oligotrophic waters. It is the smallest and most abundant photosynthetic organism recorded on Earth. As a cyanobacteria, they have an incredible ability to adapt to environments with very poor nutrient availability, as they maintain their energy from light. The nitrogen assimilation pathway in this organism has been significantly modified to adapt to the nutritional limitations of the organisms‚Äô habitats. These adaptations led to the removal of key enzymes from the genome, such as nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, and often urease. Unlike some cyanobacterial counterparts, Prochlorococcus is not able to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2). The only nitrogen sources found to be used by this species are ammonia, which is incorporated into glutamate via the enzyme glutamine synthetase and uses less energy compared to nitrate usage, and in certain species, urea. Moreover, metabolic regulation systems of Prochlorococcus were found to be greatly simplified. = Nitrogen-fixing marine cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) = Cyanobacteria blooms on a lake Nitrogen-fixing marine cyanobacteria are known to support oxygen production in oceans by fixing inorganic nitrogen using the enzyme nitrogenase. A special subset of these bacteria, UCYN-A, was found to lack the photosystem II complex usually used in photosynthesis and that it lacks a number of major metabolic pathways but is still capable of using the electron transport chain to generate energy from a light source. Furthermore, anabolic enzymes needed for creating amino acids such as valine, leucine and isoleucine are missing, as well as some which lead to phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. This organism seems to be an obligate photoheterotroph that uses carbon substrates for energy production and some biosynthetic materials for biosynthesis. It was discovered that UCYN-A developed a reduced genome of only 1.44 Megabases that is smaller but similar in structure to that of chloroplasts. In comparison with related species such as Crocosphaera watsonii and Cyanothece sp., which employ genomes which range in length from 5.46 to 6.24 megabases, the UCYN-A genome is much smaller. The compacted genome is a single, circular chromosome with ‚Äú1,214 identified protein-coding regions‚Äù. The genome of UCYN-A is also highly conserved ( >97% nucleotide identity) across ocean waters, which is atypical of ocean microbes. The lack of UCYN-A genome diversity, presence of nitrogenase and hydrogenase enzymes for the TCA cycle, reduced genome size and coding efficiency of the DNA suggest that this microorganism may have symbiotic lifestyle and live in close association with a host. However, the true lifestyle of this microbe remains unknown.  Alternative cases of small genomes  = Bacterial symbionts, commensals, parasites, and pathogens = Bacterial symbionts, commensals, parasites, and pathogens often have even smaller genomes and fewer genes than free-living organisms, and non-pathogenic bacteria. They reduce their \\"core\\" metabolic repertoire, making them more dependent on their host and environment. Their genome reduction occurs by different evolutionary mechanisms than those of streamlined free-living organisms. Pathogenic organisms are thought to undergo genome reduction due to genetic drift, rather than purifying selection. Genetic drift is caused by small and effective populations within a microbial community, rather than large and dominating populations. In this case, DNA mutations happen by chance, and thus often lead to maladaptive genome degradation and lower overall fitness. Rather than losing non-coding DNA regions or extraneous genes to increase fitness during replication, they lose certain \\"core\\" metabolic genes that may now be supplemented by their host, symbiont, or environment. Since their genome reduction is less dependent on fitness, pseudogenes are frequent in these organisms. They also typically undergo low rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Variation in genome sizes of viruses, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes = Viruses = Viral genomes resemble prokaryotic genomes in that they have very few non-coding regions. They are, however, significantly smaller than prokaryotic genomes. While viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, viral genomes are considered streamlined due to the strong purifying selection that occurs when the virus has successfully infected a host. During the initial phase of an infection, there is a large bottleneck for the virus population which allows for more genetic diversity, but due to the rapid replication of these viruses, the population size is restored quickly and the diversity within the population is reduced. RNA viruses in particular are known to have exceptionally small genomes. This is at least in part due to the fact that they have overlapping genes. By reducing their genome size, they increase their fitness due to faster replication. The virus will then be able to increase population size more rapidly with faster replication rates. = Eukaryotes - birds = Genomic streamlining has been used to explain certain eukaryotic genome sizes as well, particularly bird genomes. Larger genomes require a larger nucleus, which typically translates to a larger cell size. For this reason, many bird genomes have also been under selective pressure to decrease in size. Flying with a larger mass due to larger cells is more energetically expensive than with a smaller mass.

Club career A native of Belait in west Brunei, Hariz attended St. James' School in Kuala Belait. A youth international since 2015, he began playing club football with the under-17 side of Tabuan Muda that played in the 2016 Brunei Premier League. His first club goal came when he scored the matchwinner against Rimba Star on 2 April. That goal helped Tabuan U17 finish in third place, with 18 points from nine matches. They also made it all the way to the semi-finals of the DST FA Cup where they were beaten by Najip I-Team in a feisty encounter. Hariz moved up to the 'A' team of Tabuan Muda for the 2017 Brunei Super League season. He played regularly for Takao Fujiwara's boys and contributed four goals in that season, including the leveller in a fortunate 2‚Äì2 draw against Lun Bawang on 9 July. Tabuan Muda 'A' finished the season in sixth place. Fresh after his inclusion to the full national team, Hariz was snapped up by Brunei's professional club DPMM FC in February 2018 after a trial. He made his debut at home against Albirex Niigata (S) in a 1‚Äì3 loss on 7 August later that year. After making four appearances for the Gegar Gegar men, Hariz was left out of the 2019 DPMM FC roster altogether. He joined Kasuka FC since then.  International career  Hariz's first international tournament was the 2015 AFF U-16 Youth Championship hosted by Cambodia in July‚ÄìAugust. He scored a consolation in the 66th minute against Vietnam in the second group game which Brunei lost 1‚Äì6. He appeared in all five matches as Brunei finished bottom of their table. He was pushed into a higher age category a month later at the 2016 AFC U-19 Championship qualification matches that were held in Myanmar. Brunei only retained five players from the squad that went to Laos for the 2015 AFF U-19 Youth Championship a month ago. Appearing against Vietnam and Hong Kong, Hariz suffered a 0‚Äì5 drubbing in both games. Exactly two years later, Hariz travelled with Tabuan Muda 'A' to Myanmar for the 2017 AFF U-18 Youth Championship. After a thrilling 2‚Äì3 win over the Philippines, heavy defeats by Vietnam, Myanmar and Indonesia curtailed the Young Wasps' progress to the knockout phase. The following November, Hariz was back on board for the 2018 AFC U-19 Championship qualification games to be played in Paju, South Korea. In the first match against Indonesia, he directed a header into his own net for the second goal in a 5‚Äì0 loss. This was followed by a 0‚Äì11 whitewash by the home team. Brunei fared better in the next match against neighbours Malaysia when the Young Wasps managed to frustrate their opponents right until the 76th minute. Blocking an attempt at goal, Hariz unfortunately deflected Zafuan Azeman's shot which looped past Abdul Mutalip Muhammad to give Malaysia a 1‚Äì0 win. Despite the setbacks, Hariz never lost heart coming into the final game against Timor-Leste. Getting the nod to start the game by Fujiwara, Hariz netted a fine goal in the 34th minute to level the match after Danilson had given Timor-Leste the lead. The match ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw after further goals by Hanif Aiman Adanan and Danilson from the penalty spot. Due to his performances in the local league as well as in his international appearances, Hariz earned a callup to the Brunei national team for the 2017 Aceh World Solidarity Tsunami Cup organised by Indonesia in December. Had the tournament be classified as full 'A'-international matches as previously planned, his second-half appearance against Indonesia would have made Hariz the first Bruneian international that was born after the millennium.

It is named for the Dutch botanist Marius Jacobs.. Trees in Lithocarpus are commonly known as the stone oaks and differ from Quercus primarily because they produce insect- pollinated flowers. Description Lithocarpus jacobsii grows as a tree up to tall with a trunk diameter of up to . The brown bark is smooth or lenticellate. The coriaceous leaves are unusual and distinctive because of their cordate base that often seems to clasp the stem on a short petiole. The oblong leaves can be quite large, measuring up to long and are glabrous and the same color on both the upper and lower sides (concolorous), with prominent secondary veins below and a looping marginal vein. The infructescence can be quite long with numerous clusters of fruit scattered along the rachis. The fruits are generally in clusters of 3 (and up to 10).

Plot Stanley Duke works in advertising, and had been married to an actress, Nowell. He is now married to Susan, with whom he has a complicated relationship, seemingly because of her mother, Lady Daly. His son, Steve, suffers a mental breakdown, and Stanley takes him to two psychiatrists. The first, Dr. Collings, is female and too liberated for Stanley; and the second, Dr. Nash, seems to be more interested in drinking than helping his son. A doctor's suggestion that all women are mad becomes an increasing obsession with Stanley (in parallel with Steve's increasing insanity) culminating in outbursts of offensive misogynistic bigotry. Various ironic episodes of middle-class London life - including a successful dinner party; a less successful drunken evening with Nowell's second husband; Stanley's removal from his job; and others - all drive continuing reassessments of the characters. The ending floats a possibility that all women are in fact terrifyingly sane. Reception Marilyn Butler for the London Review of Books says that Amis \\"has created a world in which only men appear to communicate with one another, and their favourite topic is their dislike of women\\"Women and the Novel by Marilyn Butler.

She opened her own screen-printing workshop in 1937, first creating floral designs but later adopting a more abstract or strip-based approach. Many of her designs were used for commercial production by the L.F. Foght textile company. Foght taught at the Danish Arts and Crafts School until 1970. Early life and education Born on 11 December 1902 in Copenhagen, Helga Foght was the daughter of the book dealer Villiam Rudolf Foght (1866‚Äì1951) and Dagmar Elise Kirstine Clausen (1875‚Äì1951). After being trained as a housekeeping teacher, she worked as a secretary at Askov H√∏jskole, a folk high school, where she met Margrethe Christiansen (1895‚Äì1971) and Charlotte Rud (1906‚Äì1993) who were both intent on improving coverage of sewing and textile arts at the school. As a result, in 1934 she decided to improve her own competence in embroidery by taking a course in decorative art at Kunsth√•ndv√¶rkerskolen, the Danish Arts and Crafts School. In fact, the school arranged for her to study embroidery at the Haandarbejdets Fremme textile establishment. She was also introduced to the new technique of calico printing in which she became particularly interested. She improved her knowledge of the subject by taking a course on screen printing in Berlin. At the Danish Arts and Crafts School, she also learnt woodblock printing under Marie Gudme Leth. Career In 1937, Foght established her own studio where she worked with woodblock for smaller patterns and screen printing for covering cloth breadths of up to about one metre. After producing her own designs for a number of years, she began to collaborate with L.F Foght, a commercial textile establishment which was run by her father's cousin, himself an accomplished designer. This proved useful for her artistic development as she was able to experiment with more efficient approaches to pattern making, colour and materials. Foght teamed up with a number of designers and architects to decorate restaurants and other large interiors with her curtains, upholstery and other fabrics. They were well suited to the Functionalist furniture of the times. Her designs became more rhythmical and less naturalistic than those taught at the Arts and Crafts School, eventually becoming almost entirely abstract, while displaying intricate detail. As a teacher (1952‚Äì70), she encouraged hundreds of students to experiment with new designs, colour combinations and materials. She also played an important part in Denmark's cultural sector, serving in a number of administrative positions where she emphasized the importance of developing textile arts. She contributed journal articles on the subject, especially in connection with calico print and arranged hundreds of exhibitions throughout Denmark. Helga Foght died in Gentofte on 23 November 1974. Awards Helga Foght received a number of grants and scholarships for her work. In 1951, she received a gold medal at the Milan Triennial IX, while in 1970, she was honoured as a Knight of the Dannebrog for her pioneering contributions to Danish textile art.

After the death of Franco, Spanish society as a whole was not politically active, especially compared to other Western European countries, due to Francoist Spain's sheer length (36 years); citizen political affiliation was very low.Fernando Garc√≠a de Cort√°zar y Jos√© Manuel Gonz√°lez Vesga (1993). Breve Historia de Espa√±a, Madrid: Alianza, , p. 627. There were some demonstrations, especially demanding the amnesty of political prisoners; however, the protests never were a threat to the political stability of Spain. The political and social unrest was concentrated in the Basque Country and in Navarre (due to the repression of Basque nationalism) and, to a lesser extent, in Catalonia.Carlos Elordi. ¬´El largo invierno del 76¬ª. Memoria de la transici√≥n. Dep. Legal B-30.728-1995. However, the uncertainty regarding the continuity of the Francoist State boosted political activism, leading to the configuration of a debate on the political future of Spain in which there were essentially two options, with the possibility of a \\"Francoism without Franco\\" () being rejected early on: * Rupture (): essentially, this would mean fully breaking away from the Francoist state and everything that it represented, with immediate measures aimed at democratization, such as: a referendum on the form of the state (monarchy or republic), a full amnesty for those imprisoned for political motives, the recognition of Basque, Catalan and Galician national identities, or the total secularization of the state, which would mean abolishing the Concordat of 1953. * Reform (): This was the option that would eventually triumph, since it was the path supported by the Spanish institutions, particularly figureheads such as King Juan Carlos and Adolfo Su√°rez. It was based on a \\"pact\\" or \\"agreement\\" with the Francoist statesmen, in order to gradually transition from an autocratic government towards a parliamentary monarchy while maintaining social peace and public order. It would eventually gain the support of the PSOE and the Communist Party.Memoria de la Transici√≥n. El Pa√≠s. 1995. Dep. Legal B-30.728-1995. p√°g. 111.

They competed in the FA Cup between 1884 and 1888. History Founded in 1870 and nicknamed the Churchmen, the club's origins lay in connection with the recently built St Luke's Church on Parliament Street. Their regular home ground on Peet Street was situated just north of the church; they also staged some important games at the County Cricket Ground. They moved to the Vulcan Ground in 1890. St Luke's were one of the founder members of the Derbyshire Football Association in 1883. By the 1880s, they were entering the Derbyshire, Sheffield & Hallamshire and Birmingham Senior Cup competitions. In the 1884‚Äì85 Birmingham Cup, they recorded a 13‚Äì1 away victory over Sawley Rangers. In November of that season, they lost 3‚Äì1 to the recently formed Derby County in a Derbyshire Cup tie at the County Ground; 3,000 people watched what was both the latter's first competitive match and their first home win. The club took its name from St Luke's Church St Luke's entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1884-85, and were drawn against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the first round. After drawing 1‚Äì1 at Wolves' Dudley Road ground in front of a crowd of 3,100, St Luke's won the replay in Derby 4‚Äì2. In the second round, they lost 1‚Äì0 against Walsall Swifts. They played in the FA Cup for the next three seasons but lost in the first round on each occasion. In 1885-86, Wolves gained revenge with a 7‚Äì0 win. In 1886-87 they faced Walsall Town, drawing 3‚Äì3 at home but losing 6‚Äì1 in the replay at The Chuckery. In their final appearance in 1887-88, St Luke's lost 3‚Äì2 to local rivals Derby Junction, who went on to reach the semi- finals of the competition. Qualifying rounds were introduced the following season, and St Luke's were subsequently unsuccessful in reaching the competition proper, reaching the 2nd qualifying round twice and the 3rd qualifying round on one occasion. Along with other local amateur clubs, St Luke's struggled to compete for players and support following the emergence of Derby County, and particularly once the latter became a founder member of the Football League in 1888. St Luke's joined the Combination as a founder member for the 1890‚Äì91 season, but they failed to complete their fixtures and their record was expunged;. They scratched their Derbyshire Cup tie and the following season, 1891-1892, scratched before the draw of the first round. On St. Luke's demise, (Derby) St. Luke's Sunday School took the decision to shorten their name from 1892-1893.Derby Daily Telegraph A cul-de-sac called Olive Street was built across the site of their former ground.

Life His nisbah (al-Maghribƒ´) and the name Ma·π£ƒÅl suggest a Berber origin. He was born in the town of Lukk in the Cyrenaica. From his father, he learned falconry and veterinary science, which enabled him to assume a military post in the Fatimid capital Cairo. Details of his military career are not known, but by 1144/45 he had risen to the point where he was entrusted with the leadership of the government by Caliph al- Hafiz. He was not given the title of vizier, however, which had been vacant since the ouster of Ridwan ibn Walakhshi in 1139, but instead was titled \\"supervisor of affairs\\" (nƒÅ·∫ìir fi'l-um≈´r) and \\"supervisor of the public interests\\" (nƒÅ·∫ìir fi'l-ma·π£ƒÅli·∏•). When al-Hafiz died in October 1149, his 16-year-old son al-Zafir succeeded him. Al-Zafir, who was more interested in the pleasures of the court than exercising governance, appointed Ibn Masal, despite the latter's advanced age, as his vizier. Ibn Masal received the customary titles of the Fatimid viziers, al-Sayyid al- øAjal (\\"most noble master\\"), Amƒ´r al-Juy≈´sh (\\"commander of the armies\\"), and al-Mufa·∏ç·∏çal (\\"the preferred one\\") or al-Af·∏çal (\\"most superior one\\"). He was quickly successful in calming the quarrels between the Turkish cavalry (Ray·∏•ƒÅnƒ´) and the black military slaves by distributing money and promising to take care of their future welfare. He was soon after confronted with the rebellion of the governor of Alexandria, Ibn al-Sallar, who had entertained hopes of becoming vizier himself. Following the appointment of Ibn Masal, together with his stepson Abbas, Ibn al-Sallar marched on Cairo to seize the vizierate. When al- Zafir learned of Ibn Sallar's intentions, he called upon assistance from the grandees of the realm in support of Ibn Masal, but they proved unwilling to. In the end, the Caliph provided Ibn Masal with funds to raise an army for action against Ibn al-Sallar. Ibn Masal assembled a force of Lawata Berbers, of blacks, of Bedouin Arabs and of native Egyptians, but despite a first success in the field, he was soon forced to leave Cairo in December 1149 for Upper Egypt, to recruit more men, while Ibn al-Sallar took over the city. Ibn al-Sallar sent his stepson Abbas with an army against Ibn Masal and his ally, Badr ibn Rafi, who had tried unsuccessfully to rally resistance among the Arab tribes of the Nile Delta. The two armies met in battle at Dalas in the province of al-Bahnasa on 19 February 1150, in which Ibn Masal was defeated and killed. Abbas brought his severed head back to Cairo as a token of victory. His vizierate had lasted only about 50 days. This was the last time a Fatimid caliph would exercise that right, as with Ibn al-Sallar's coup the vizierate became the object of fierce contest between rival strongmen, and the last Fatimid caliphs were reduced to mere figureheads.

It stars Charlie Plummer, Andy Garc√≠a, Taylor Russell, AnnaSophia Robb, Beth Grant, Molly Parker and Walton Goggins. The film was released on August 21, 2020, by Roadside Attractions. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot Adam Petrizelli is a high school senior whose father left him and his mother Beth. Beth now dates Paul, whom Adam dislikes. He makes plans to go to culinary school in the fall. In school, Adam sees a hippie girl, Rebecca in the hallways, and he appears to be the only one who sees her. He goes to chemistry class where he begins to hear voices, see what looks like a black cloud surrounding the class, and Rebecca speaking to him. Everything in the room appears to him as though it is floating, and Rebecca tells him they need to go. In the chaos, Adam accidentally knocks over a vial of acidic chemical that burns his partner‚Äôs arm. He falls to the ground and experiences an apparent psychotic break, while the school security guard has to hold him down. Adam is diagnosed with schizophrenia and is expelled from school. He enters a medical trial to treat his condition, but he continues to hear voices‚Äîmost notably a deep threatening voice‚Äîand has three frequent visions: Rebecca, who acts as the positive voice; Joaquin, the best friend; and \\"The Bodyguard\\", a man in a jumpsuit who appears whenever Adam is feeling threatened. Paul has also hidden the knives in the house for safety. Beth and Paul take Adam to transfer to St. Agatha‚Äôs Catholic School. They meet Sister Catherine for an interview, which Adam sees as the whole room being on fire. Adam is accepted to the school, but his condition is not made known immediately. After the interview, Adam goes to the bathroom. He finds the school‚Äôs valedictorian, Maya Arnaz, making a secret transaction with another student, Ted, as she has been tutoring him in secret. They see Adam, and Rebecca and Joaquin appear to comment on Maya as she approaches Adam. She just tells Adam not to say anything about what he saw, and he agrees. Maya later approaches him again, and the visions can see that he is attracted to her. She explains that she helps the other students as a side hustle, keeping it secret from the staff. After she leaves, Adam takes his meds to keep the visions from continuing to pester him. With his grades already failing into his second week of school, Adam seeks Maya out for tutoring help. She even meets Beth and Paul to make it legitimate, and they agree to pay her to help Adam. He takes Maya to see his room where they exchange banter and she samples some of his cooking before they get to work in studying. Beth later drives her home. Adam‚Äôs grades improve, and as he continues to take the pills, he keeps the visions at bay. He even gets back to cooking, which makes Beth happy. He also visits Father Perez at the school for confession, even though he doesn‚Äôt consider himself a religious person. One morning, Adam wakes up to peace and quiet, thinking things are turning around for the better. To celebrate his improvement, he invites Maya to hang out, which she accepts. While they are out, one of the bullies from Adam‚Äôs old school recognizes him with his friends. When the bully mocks Adam and tries to touch Maya, she slaps him hard across the face before he and the others just leave. When Maya asks Adam what that was about, he only tells her that he got expelled from his last school over a fight. Adam tries to hang out with her again and later goes to try and find her at her house and comes to a poorer neighborhood where he meets her father and two younger brothers. Adam cooks them dinner, but when Maya comes home, she thinks he‚Äôs doing it out of charity and lashes out at him. After he apologizes, Maya tells him how she got caught and is worried about making extra money. He promises to help keep her as his tutor and still get paid. Maya brings Adam to a big kitchen to test out his cooking. His food proves too spicy for Maya, but when he tries it, he thinks it‚Äôs fine. It turns out that a side effect of the pill affects his taste, as well as a number of other unpleasant things. This prompts Adam to start throwing away the pills into the front yard as Beth thinks he is still taking them. Making things harder is that Beth and Paul announce that they are having a baby. Adam hears the deep voice express insecurity over a new kid that might be more normal, as well as seeing his mom appear as a distorted image. This also makes the visions come back to annoy him. It almost causes him to have another psychotic break at school, but he walks out even as Maya follows and tries to find out what‚Äôs wrong. Adam takes Maya to an outdoor screening of her favorite movie, Never Been Kissed. Towards the end, Rebecca and Joaquin try to encourage Adam to make his move, but the deep voice starts to prey on his insecurity. He inadvertently grabs Maya‚Äôs hand, but she wants to know what is going on with him. He admits to having insecurity over his mom having another kid with Paul, but after he apologizes, he asks Maya to prom, even though she‚Äôs against the idea of it. She accepts, and they have their first kiss. His work gets so much better that he writes an essay that is accepted to be read at graduation. Adam finds Paul writing an email and finds it suspicious. When he gets to school, Sister Catherine tells him that they learned about his condition and the incident at his last school, and instead of an expulsion, they are just suspending him temporarily. Adam thinks Paul sent them this in the email and he lashes out at him. Suspension also means he can‚Äôt go to prom, but he defies everyone‚Äôs orders and goes anyway. He picks Maya up and is amazed by how she looks, but even as they dance and try to have a good time, Adam is plagued by the deep voice, as well as Sister Catherine finding him and trying to kick him out. As things start to blur around him, Adam pushes the nun to the ground and runs away. He runs to the top bleachers and falls over the ledge when he sees the black cloud surrounding him. Adam is taken to the hospital and wakes up to see Beth and Paul. Maya soon shows up, but Adam becomes too overwhelmed by the presence of the visions, so he starts to yell at Rebecca and The Bodyguard to go away, then starts yelling at everyone to leave as he breaks down. He is later expelled from St. Agatha‚Äôs and placed in a psych ward. Father Perez visits him despite an earlier encounter where Adam was rude to him when he tried to offer advice. After Father Perez says that he was not aware of what Adam was struggling with, Adam apologizes for his behavior, and agrees to join Father Perez in prayer. Beth visits Adam in the hospital and gives him a printed copy of the email that Paul sent to St. Agatha‚Äôs. Contrary to what Adam thought, Paul was expressing his support for his stepson and thought suspending him was cruel, saying that they must show more care for Adam‚Äôs condition. Realizing how much Paul cares about him, Adam runs to catch up with him and Beth, and he hugs Paul for the first time, making it clear that he will be better in accepting him as a new father figure. On graduation day, Beth and Paul take Adam to the ceremony, where, despite Sister Catherine‚Äôs attempt to speak up, Father Perez shows support for Adam. The deep voiced black cloud tries to get Adam, but he gathers the courage to address the student body calmly. He recites his essay in which he discusses both his condition and battle with schizophrenia, declaring that he now knows that his life will not be defined by his illness. After he leaves the auditorium, Maya runs to catch up with him. Adam apologizes to Maya for not telling her the truth about his illness from the beginning, at which point they express their love for each other. Joaquin then encourages Adam to kiss Maya, and he finally does. Adam gets accepted to the culinary school he wanted to go to, and becomes a good big brother to Beth's and Paul‚Äôs child. Paul also shows more dedication to Adam, even seeming to notice when Adam is hearing the voices in the closet.

Club career  While playing for Inter, Bel came to notice for her physical attractiveness and was declared the most beautiful player at the 1985 Brazilian Cup. She was described as \\"an icon of sensual femininity in football\\". She was also a skilful attacker, often likened to the male player Renato Portaluppi who was also from Porto Alegre and wore the number 7 shirt. Bel was pictured on the cover of Placar on four separate occasions. In 1987 Inter abolished their women's team and Bel played futsal for local teams called Bruxas and Chimarr√£o. In 1994 she transferred to Torino of the Italian Serie A, where she was provided with a car and lodged with Antonella Carta. She returned to Brazil for personal reasons after only three months, when an affair with the club president Roberto Goveani \\"got complicated\\". Her final season of club football was in 2001 with Gr√™mio. International career Bel was named as part of Brazil's squad for the 1995 South American Women's Football Championship in Uberl√¢ndia. She scored in the team's 15‚Äì0 win over Bolivia. With the national team she was a reserve to Roseli de Belo and Pretinha. Following a dispute with the team's chief of delegation Rosilene Gomes, Bel was not selected for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup in Sweden. Personal life A year after retiring from football, Bel gave birth to her son Luiz Felipe. She was treated for breast cancer in 2017, while working as a physical education teacher in Florian√≥polis. In July 1995 Bel posed nude for Playboy (Brazil). The publication had originally approached her when she was 17 years old, but at that stage she rejected the offer to appear nude and wore a bikini.

Bamboo tallies continued to be used in China up until the 1960s.Charm.ru Bamboo tallies by Vladimir Belyaev with notes from Fran√ßois Thierry and Sam Leung. Retrieved: 28 March 2018. Bamboo tallies were issued by local business and trading firms, exchange-offices, merchant guilds or associations, as well as playhouses, other producers include the Jiheyi Society (a local producer of rice), the Deyuan Society (a local manufacturer mats), and the Xuyichang candy shop. The first bamboo tallies from this region were actually manufactured during the Southern Song dynasty, but the modern bamboo tallies were only produced in the aftermath of the Taiping rebellion which devastated the local economy. Bamboo tallies were originally produced by mat-manufacturers of Xushuan in 1877 under the Guangxu Emperor as \\"emergency money\\" and had a nominal value of 100 w√©n. These early bamboo tallies were at first just meant to be used between their suppliers and customers from the countryside but then began to circulate on the entire market which was not prohibited by the local authorities at the time due to the economic situation of the region. From 1895 the local governments of these regions began to officially condone and later issue these bamboo tallies themselves.About the bamboo-money in the region of Suzhou (Jiangsu) by Fran√ßois Thierry.

Several factors such as the Kuomintang takeover of China and subsequent Japanese invasion of China meant that these tokens would remain a popular medium of exchange as these events negatively affected the local economy.  Manufacture  Bamboo tallies were manufactured from bamboo from coastal China; to make these tallies, the skin of the bamboo was removed and then the stalk would be cut into rectangles that would have a hole drilled at the top. On the obverse side the denomination of the bamboo tally was placed and in uncommon cases the date of issue using the sexagenary cycle while on the reverse side an inked serial number (sometimes using Chinese numerals and sometimes using Arabic numerals) along with the name of the issuing bank of merchant would be placed. The sides of the bamboo tallies would often be inscribed with the manufacturing company and anti-counterfeit measures such as the statement \\"not compensated if lost\\" (Â§±Âéª‰∏çË£ú, shƒ´ q√π b√π b«î) and warranty marks are known as shing hao. After the tally was fully inscribed the bamboo would be lacquered in transparent light red to improve the durability of the tally.

The pharmacy chain is owned by the Finnish company Oriola Oyj-KD, which is listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Kronans Apotek has 326 pharmacies across Sweden, and over 65,000 customer visits per day. Kronans Apotek is Sweden's third largest pharmacy chain with more than 300 stores from Trelleborg in the south to Malmberget in the north. As of April 8, 2013, Kronans Apotek AB operates as a subsidiary of Oriola Oyj. Oriola is also a pharmaceutical wholesaler and also markets supplies. Since 2013, the company operates pharmacy operations under the name of Kronans Apotek. Kronens Apotek has a turnover of around 7 billion SEK a year. In Sweden, Laastari has begun to work with Kronans Droghandel Apotek. A company named ICT has previously handled the customer service to Kronans Apotek, which, through its owner early in 2013, bought the chain Medstop with 69 pharmacies. After deregulation, Kronans Apotek expanded their supply chain to include retail stores. This resulted in existing retailers expanding their supply chain upstream, as did Apoteket Hj√§rtat, who now have their own supplier, Apo-Pharma. Through the agreement between Tamro AB and Kronans Apotek, a number of pharmaceutical companies undertake to distribute drugs on the Swedish market only through one of these companies. Nowadays, the association has been handed over to the Crown's drug distribution in Gothenburg, purchasing and reselling the drugs at the price determined by the association.  Corporate affairs  Pharmaceuticals are delivered mainly to pharmacies from the wholesalers Tambro AB and Kronans Apotek, These two companies trade in pharmaceuticals, known as single-channel distribution. Wholesalers in Sweden, two companies hold licenses to supply medical goods to pharmacies, Kronans Droghandel (KD) and Phoenix. Both wholesalers hold a market share of approximately 50%. = Sales = In November 2017, total sales increased by more than 400% compared with the same period last year. The number of visits also doubled in comparison with the previous year. History = Early history (1700s-1959) = Apoteket Strutsen in Gothenburg was run by the pharmacist Franz Martin Luth in the early 1700s. In 1907, Gustaf Bernstr√∂m became the owner of Kronans Apotek, and he also had a decisive influence on the pharmacy Lejonet between 1908 and 1920, when the sister who widowed Vitus Anderson formally stood as the owner of the pharmacy. In 1959 a consortium owned by the company Kronans Droghandel was bought. = Growth (1960-2009) = In 1964, sales in Kronans Apotek amounted to 31,3 million SEK, of which 28.0 million SEK were to pharmacies. Following the initialization of the apothecary in 1971, Kronans Droghandel continued with the distribution of pharmaceuticals to state-controlled Apoteket, later Apoteket AB. When the drug supply investigation in 1969 submitted its report these were: Apotekernes Droghandel AB, Kronans Droghandel, Apoteksvarva Vitrum Apotekare, Astra Distribution and AB Pharmaceutical Distribution. = 2009-present = The company was owned 80% by Oriola, and 20% by Kooperativa F√∂rbundet KF. As of November 2012, Kronans Droghandel is owned 100% by Oriola-KD. In 2013, Oriola-KD acquired a Swedish pharmacy chain Medstop, Medstop and Kronans Droghandel were merged into a single pharmacy chain, Kronans Apotek. The purchase meant that the market share was 21% and comprised 290 pharmacies. It also meant that the addition of KD helped boost the company's distribution wing to represent some 72% of Orion's total revenue. That company remained separate from Oriola. In September 2017, Kronans Apotek was nominated for Svenska Designpriset along with at least 4 apps. On January 1, 2018, Kronans Apotek will replace old plastic bags with new ones with 100% recycled plastic LDPE.

In 1881, it was joined by the Central Massachusetts Railroad, which paralleled it from west of Beaver Street to the Fitchburg Cutoff. Both railroads had Clematis Brook stations located on the east side of Beaver Street. The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) gained control of the Central Massachusetts in 1887, followed by the Fitchburg in 1900. By 1904, Clematis Brook was served by a single station between the two lines; similar consolidation of nearby Waverley, Belmont, and Hill Crossing came later. In 1952, the B&M; abandoned the duplicate Central Mass tracks during a grade separation project at Waverley. After the track consolidation, the Central Mass Branch diverged from the Fitchburg mainline just west of Clematis Brook. By the time the MBTA began subsidizing service in 1965, Clematis Brook was no longer served by the single Central Mass Branch round trip (which was discontinued in 1971). Like nearby Beaver Brook station, Clematis Brook was only served by a handful of rush hour trips. The two stations were closed in June 1978, along with Winchester Highlands station on the Lowell Line, due to poor ridership. No remains of the station are present.

The group was set up to focus on younger voters. Background BeLeave was set up as a \\"youth-focused pro-Brexit campaign\\" by Darren Grimes, at the time a 22-year- old fashion student and part-time shop worker. Grimes was reported as working from Vote Leave's office and was invited to appear on several TV and radio programmes arguing for Britain to leave the EU. When Vote Leave was close to its ¬£7m spending limit, Vote Leave emailed Grimes with offers of financial help, to which Grimes replied asking that the money be spent on Facebook ads to be placed by AggregateIQ. Vote Leave sent ¬£675,000 in this way to AggregateIQ, without the money ever passing into the hands of Grimes or BeLeave. BeLeave had no significant income or expenditure apart from this. BeLeave was described as a \\"Vote Leave Outreach Group\\" on the official Vote Leave webpage. Referral to the Electoral Commission  In March 2018 former BeLeave activist Shahmir Sanni claimed that BeLeave was used by Vote Leave to exceed legal spending limits. It was claimed that Vote Leave, the official campaign in favour of leaving the European Union in the Referendum, illegally used BeLeave as a channel for a payment of ¬£675,000 to AggregateIQ, a Canadian company which worked on pro-Brexit projects, requiring that BeLeave spent the money in this way. Vote Leave would have exceeded its campaign spending limit of ¬£7m had it spent the money itself. =Electoral Commission findings= On 17 July 2018, the Electoral Commission published the conclusions of its investigation into the campaign spending of Vote Leave and found that Vote Leave and Grimes had broken electoral law. Vote Leave was fined ¬£61,000. Grimes, representing BeLeave, was fined ¬£20,000, the maximum permitted individual fine, for exceeding its spending limit as an unregistered campaigner by more than ¬£660,000 and delivering an inaccurate and incomplete spending return. High Court of Justice findings against the Electoral Commission and BeLeave On 14 September 2018, the High Court of Justice found against the Electoral Commission, stating that its advice to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes had been incorrect, but confirming that the overspending had been illegal. =Appeals= Vote Leave, which claimed they would not have paid BeLeave without the advice, initially appealed against their fine, but withdrew the appeal in March 2019.https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/vote-leave-withdraws- appeal-against-16051284 Darren Grimes, who also began an appeal against his fine, did not withdraw in March 2019. On the 19th of July 2019, in the Central London County Court, Grimes successfully appealed the ¬£20,000 fine levied for breaking electoral law in the lead up to the Brexit referendum, and the fine from the Electoral Commission was quashed. Judge Marc Dight said, \\"even if Grimes had committed the offence, it would not have justified the fine of ¬£20,000, the maximum possible under current law.\\" The Electoral Commission said: ‚ÄúWe are disappointed that the court has upheld Mr Grimes‚Äôs appeal.

In nature it is mainly found in fungi of the Fusarium species. The Fusarium species belongs to the most prevalent mycotoxin producing fungi in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, therefore making them a considerable risk for the food crop production industry. The fungi are abundant in various agricultural products (cereal crops) and their further processed products (malt, beer and bread). \\"The Fusarium species invade and grow on crops, and may produce nivalenol under moist and cool conditions\\". The symptoms observed after being affected with nivalenol are \\"feed refusal, vomiting, gastroenteric and dermal irritation or necrosis and immunological dysfunction\\", as well as haematotoxicity, resulting in a low leukocyte count.  History  In the period of 1946-1963 several cases of intoxication due to the ingestion of Fusarium infected grains (Scrabby grain disease) were reported in Japan, Korea and India. There have been no reports of lethal cases and only mild symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. In these incidents F.graminaerum could be isolated which hints at a nivalenol or deoxynivalenol contamination. In the same period two outbreaks involving over 100 cases were reported in India and China. These outbreaks were also non-lethal. A well documented and acute outbreak in India in 1987 affected around 50,000 thousand people. Several Fusarium toxins under which nivalenol (0.03‚Äì0.1 mg/kg in 2 of 24 samples), deoxynivalenol (0.34‚Äì8.4 mg/kg in 11 of 24 samples) and acetyldeoxynivalenol (0.6‚Äì2.4 mg/kg in 4 of 24 samples) were found in rain- damaged wheat used for bread production. There were again no lethal cases and reported symptoms were abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool and vomiting. These cases show that the main emerging danger of nivalenol comes from Fusarium infected cereals and is mainly via the route of digestion of uncontrolled wheat or other grains which is further processed or does enter the food chain via another route. = Waeponization and other instances of Nivalenol poisoning = Nivalenol as well as deoxynivalenol and T-2 toxin have been used as biological warfare agents in Laos and Cambodia as well as in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union has been alleged to have provided the mycotoxins and to have used them themselves in Afghanistan. All three compounds could be identified in the vegetation at affected sites, whereas T-2 toxin could also be found in urine and blood samples of victims. The best documented use of trichothecenes in warfare is the yellow rain controversy, this describes a number of attacks in Southeastern Asia as well as Laos and Afghanistan, which used a ‚Äúyellow rain‚Äù as described by witnesses. The toxins were delivered as what has been described as a cloud of yellow dust or droplets. An article by L. R. Ember published in 1984 in Chemical Engineering News describes the use of trichothecene mycotoxins as biological weapons in Southeast Asia in a very detailed manner. In it reports of survivors and eyewitnesses as well as prisoners of war and soviet informants can be found together with information on the presence of soviet technicians and laboratories. This led to the conclusion that these toxins have been used in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan. The Russian government however refuses to give a statement on these pieces of evidence. Furthermore, it has been shown that samples taken on the location of attacks contain these toxins, while sites that have not been attacked do not show any signs of toxins in them. Even though it remains questionable if all witness reports are reliable sources of evidence, the symptoms recorded are typical for intoxication with trichothecenes. There was a number of ways in which trichothecenes were weaponized, such as dispersion as aerosol, smoke, droplets or dust from aircraft, missiles, handheld devices or artillery. = Safety guidelines in the food industry = In 2000 a scientific opinion on nivalenol was issued by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). A temporary tolerable daily intake (t-TDI) of 0‚Äì0.7 ¬µg/kg bw per day was issued after evaluation of the general toxicity as well as the haematoxicity and the immunotoxicity. This t-TDI was reaffirmed by the SCF in 2002. In 2010 the Japanese Food Safety Commission (FSCJ) issued a t-TDI of 0.4 Œºg/kg bw per day. Between 2001 and 2011 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) collected data from 15774 nivalenol occurrences in 18 European countries to be assessed. This led to the establishment of a TDI of 1.2 ¬µg/kg bw per day. Nivalenol was in this studies not found to be genotoxic, but well haematotoxic and immunotoxic.  Structure and reactivity  Nivalenol as part of the family of mycotoxins has the common structure which all members of this toxin family have. This includes the basic structure of a cyclohexene and a tetrahydropyran ring connected at C6 and C11. Additionally an ethyl-group connects the tetrahydropyran at C2 and C5 and a keto group is attached at the cyclohexene at C8. The epoxide group, responsible for the reactivity for most parts, is attached at C12 and C13 in the tetrahydropyran. Only the remaining groups at positions C3, C4, C7, C15 vary for the different mycotoxins. In case of nivalenol each of the four remaining groups is a substituted hydroxyl group which add up to the reactivity in presence of hydrophilic compounds or subgroups respectively thanks to their polar characteristics. In acidic medium the keto group is capable of reacting with a proton promoting polarity and reactivity as well. But altogether the epoxide group is crucial for the reactivity of the molecule.  Available forms  Nivalenol, deoxynivalenol and T2-toxin are the three structural and similar synthesized mycotoxins naturally appearing in fungi (e.g. Fusarium).  Synthesis  Synthesis pathways of nivalenol and deoxynivalenol The synthesis of nivalenol is a 16 step process. It can differ in step 11 to step 14 depending on the order in which the reaction controlling trichodiene synthases TRI1, TRI13 and TRI7 are catalyzing. Famesyl pyrophosphate is used as starting compound for the synthesis of nivalenol. Its cyclization reaction to trichodiene is catalyzed by terpene cyclase trichodiene synthase (Tri5). This reaction is followed by several oxidation reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (encoded by TRI4). Thereby hydroxyl groups were substituted to the carbon atoms C2, C3 and C11 and one oxygen was added to C12 and C13 facilitating the formation of an epoxide group. This results in the intermediate isotrichotriol. In a further reaction trichotriol was gained through a shift of the C11 hydroxyl group of the isotrichotriol to the C9, similar the double bond shifted from C9=C10 to C10=C11. Trichotriol reacts in a non-enzymatic cyclization reaction to its isomere isotrichodermol. In the reaction the hydroxyl group on the C2 of the cyclopentane binds to the C11 of the cyclohexene forming a tetrahydropyran ring. The shifted OH-group at C9 is lost during the reaction. An acetyltransferase (encoded by TRI101) catalyzes the acetylation of the C3 OH-group of isotrichodermol forming isotrichdermin. Isotrichodermin is converted to 15-decalonecitrin due to a substitution (encoded by TRI11) of one hydrogen by one hydroxyl at C15 which is then acetylated under help of TRI3. The same substitution and following acetylation reactions occur at C4 again under the control of TRI13 and TRI7. TRI1 in F.sporotrichiodies further catalyzes the addition of a fourth OH-group at C8 and a fifth OH-group at C7 at which then the hydrogen is eliminated and a keto group forms. In a last step an esterase controlled by TRI8 catalyzes the deacetylation at C3, C4 and C15 resulting in the end product nivalenol. A partly alternative synthesis can occur when the catalysts TRI1 and TRI13, TRI7 are used in opposite order. Then the addition of the hydroxyl groups at C7 and C8 controlled by TRI1 are happening with calonectrin as reactant. In this reaction 7,8-dihydroxycalonectrin is formed. It further reacts spontaneously to 3,15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol via elimination of a hydrogen and formation of a keto-group at C8. The addition of a hydroxyl group at C4 controlled by TRI13 occurs and is acetylated under the help of TRI7. This yields 3,4,15-triacetylnivalenol (3,4,15-triANIV) from which it is than again the same synthesis as described above.  Mechanism of action  Nivalenol causes a change in a number of different biological pathways. The most well known and probably important, is the NF-Œ∫B pathway. NF-Œ∫B is a transcription factor that can be found in almost all human cells, and regulates the expression of its target genes by binding to specific motifs on the genomic DNA on regulatory elements. In vitro tests have shown, that nivalenol can change the expression of cytokines, which are important controller molecules of the immune system. Nivalenol induced the secretion of IL-8, a mediator of inflammation. When treated with an NF-Œ∫B inhibitor, IL-8 secretion was lowered. Another important factor influenced by nivalenol is MCP-1/CCL2, this cytokine plays a role in the mobility regulation of mononuclear leukocyte cells. Nivalenol causes CCL2 secretion to be lowered, and thus the mobility of monocytes to be reduced. This explains part of the immunosuppressive nature of nivalenol. Again, this effect is reduced by NF-Œ∫B inhibition which shows, that nivalenol and NF-Œ∫B interact to influence the cell. It was shown that while deoxynivalenol induces the secretion of chemokines, which are also immunorelevant messenger molecules, nivalenol does inhibit their secretion. Nivalenol also upregulates the expression of proinflammatory genes in macrophages, displaying a mixed effect on different cell types. It does so even at cytotoxic levels. Another mechanism of cytotoxicity of nivalenol is the apoptotic cytotoxicity showing that nivalenol is more toxic than its often co-occurring mycotoxin partner deoxynivalenol, and does so by causing DNA damage and apoptosis. Nivalenol is also known to influence human leukocyte proliferation. It has been shown that nivalenol can change proliferation rates of human leukocytes in a dose dependent manner. Lower concentrations are known to enhance leukocyte proliferation, while higher concentrations decrease proliferation in a dose dependent manner.  Metabolism  Structure of de-epoxynivalenol Nivalenol in mice is not only metabolized through the liver but also, for a lesser part through microbial detoxification in the intestines. Thereby especially the epoxide group as most toxic part of the molecule is degraded. This happens by eliminating the oxygen of the epoxide group resulting in a double carbon- carbon bond between C12 and C13. This double bond is nonpolar and very stable leading to a less reactive form of nivalenol called de-epoxynivalenol. The de- epoxinated nivalenol gained is therefore much less toxic, same as every de- epoxinated trichodiene, and can be segregated into the urine without having much toxic effects anymore (nearly non-toxic). In the urine of tested mice and pigs 80% of the de-epoxidated compound and only 7% of the actual nivalenol were found showing a high metabolising rate of the trichodienes. Thereby a low concentration of nitrogen in low proteins and urea were observed whereas the cholesterol concentration was observed to be higher than normal. This suggests that nivalenol is present and later degraded in the liver as the liver is responsible for the segregation of cholesterol into the bloodstream. The higher amount of cholesterol in the blood leads then to a higher amount of filtered cholesterol by the kidneys and eventually to an increased concentration in the urea. The lowered concentration of amides is assumed to be caused in the degradation process of the reactive epoxide group. Therefore, the epoxides are often found to react with amides or amide groups by adding a hydroxyl group at a primary or secondary amine. As a consequence the epoxide group is degraded and less nitrogen is present for the synthesis of proteins or urea.  Adverse effects  Nivalenol did not yet find usage in medical treatments, and therefore it does not have known adverse effects besides the toxic effects described. It is however worth noting that it could be interesting for investigation due to its immunosuppressive effects.  Effects on animals and Efficacy  As nivalenol is a mycotoxic product of certain Fusarium species it is often found in infected wheat and grain. As unprocessed wheat and grain product are often used as feed for livestock animals these are at a higher risk of nivalenol intake. Toxicity studies in swine that received a dose of 0.05 mg nivalenol/kg body weight twice daily showed no lethal effects. Most nivalenol was secreted with the feces and did not reach the bloodstream despite the fact that there was still nivalenol upstage over the intestines after 16 hours of feeding. There were further no nivalenol metabolites found in feces or urine within the first three days. After a week of exposure to 2.5 or 5 mg nivalenol kg bw twice a day a microbiological adaptation was seen as nivalenol metabolites (de-epoxidated nivalenol) could be found in feces and urine. In rats and mice nivalenol showed to be toxic with adverse effects of growth retardation and leukopenia already noticed at lowest doses of 0.7 mg/kg bw per day. Lethal doses were dependent on the route of administration/intake of nivalenol. As nivalenol is normally taken up with feed the LD50 of oral administration which is 38.9 mg/kg bw per day in mice and 19.5 mg/kg bw per day in rats can be used as standard. The LD50 of intravenous, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous (SC) is between 7 and 7.5 mg/kg bw per day.  Toxicity, indications and side effects  The toxicity of nivalenol in humans is for the most parts unknown yet, but it was investigated in mice, rats and hamster cells. Thereby the toxicity was divided in the following topics: acute/subacute, subchronic, chronic and carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity studies and studies on reproduction, immunotoxicity/hematotoxycity and effects on nervous system. = Acute/subacute toxicity = The oral LD50 of nivalenol was found to be 38.9 mg/kg bw in mice whereas the intraperitonal, subcutaneous and intravenous routes of exposure gave LD50 values of 5‚Äì10 mg/kg bw. In mice already within 3 days the most deaths occurred after oral exposure through marked congestion and haemorrhage in intestine, in acute toxicity also lymphoid organs are included. Nivalenol given over time periods of 24 days in lower doses (ca. 3,5 mg/kg bw) showed significant erythropenia and slight leukopenia. = Subchronic toxicity = The subchronic toxicity was tested by feeding mice with a daily dose of 0 to 3.5 mg nivalenol/ kg bw for 4 or 12 weeks. The observations after 4 weeks were reduced body weight and food consumption. The reduction in body weight can be explained by statistical decrease in organ weight in thymus, spleen and kidneys. Whereas the consumption time was less for female mice in comparison to male mice. After 12 weeks the toxin consumption resulted in reduction of relative organ weight in both males and females. Hereby only the liver was affected and no histopathological changes were observed. = Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity = Female mice were fed with different doses of nivalenol (0, 0.7, 1.4 or 3.5 mg nivalenol /kg bw) for one or two years to investigate whether nivalenol is chronic toxic and/or carcinogenic. Also during this study a decrease in body weight and feed consumption was observed. The absolute weight of both liver and kidney was decreased through the two highest doses. The mice fed for one year with nivalenol (also with the lower doses) were affected with severe leukopenia whereas the mice fed for two years had no differences in count of white blood cells. Also \\"no histopathological changes including tumours were found in liver, thymus, spleen, kidneys, stomach, adrenal glands, pituitary glands, ovaries, bone marrow, lymph node, brain and small intestines with or without Peyer's patch\\". The lowest doses (0.7 mg nivalenol /kg bw) inhibited the growth and caused leukopenia. \\"A no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be derived from these studies. IARC (1993) concluded that there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity of nivalenol in experimental animals. No human data were available. The overall conclusion was that the carcinogenicity was not classifiable (group 3)\\". = Genotoxicity = It was found that nivalenol effects the genes of Chinese hamster V79 (CHO) cells by slightly increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange. The DNA was damaged in CHO cells as well as in mice. In mice (given 20 mg nivalenol /kg bw orally or 3.7 mg /kg bw ip) the DNA of kidney, bone marrow, stomach, jejunum and colon was damaged. The DNA of the thymus and liver was not effected. In organs with DNA damage no necrotic changes were found upon histopathological examination. It can be concluded that an adequate evaluation of the genotoxicity is not allowed based on the available data. = Developmental toxicity and studies on reproduction = For developmental and reproduction studies pregnant mice were injected with different amounts of purified nivalenol on days 7‚Äì15 of gestation and for one additional study with mouldy rice containing nivalenol. The studies showed that the toxin is embryotoxic in mice. No evidence of teratogenicity was given. \\"The LOAEL in reproduction studies with nivalenol given by oral exposure was stated to be 1.4 mg/kg bw given in the feed throughout gestation and 5 mg/kg bw when given by gavage on days 7‚Äì15\\". Data from other species and on reproductive effects in adult males and females are not provided yet. = Immunotoxicity/haematotoxicity = Acute toxicity of nivalenol induces bone marrow toxicity and toxicity of lymphoid organs. Long-term exposure may result in erythropenia and/or leukopenia. In mice it was also observed that nivalenol increased the presence of serum IgA, \\"accompanied by immunopathological changes in kidneys analogous to human IgA-nephropathy\\". The blastogenesis in cultured human lymphocytes, proliferation of human male and female lymphocytes stimulated with phytoheamagglutin and pokeweed and immunoglobulin production induced by pokeweed, are inhibited by nivalenol. The effects of nivalenol are in the same range as same doses of deoxynivalenol, whereas the T-2 toxin are 100 fold more toxic. An additive effect is gained by combination of nivalenol with T-2 toxin, 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol or deoxynivalenol. = Effects on nervous system = About the nervous system no data has been provided yet.

Origins and personal life Schroyer grew up on a farm in Wolfsville, Maryland. As a boy scout, he became a naturalist. In college, Schroyer guided wilderness trips and nature tours as a part-time job. Education Schroyer studied physics and geology at Antioch College in Ohio and was a co-op worker at the General Motors Institute. Serving as a lab assistant to C.F. Kettering, Schroyer was impressed by Kettering's view that overly literal theory was a detriment to contextual innovations. During his junior of college, Schroyer studied physics and philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. In 1959, he graduated from Antioch College with a degree in philosophy. Graduate work After graduating from Antioch, Schroyer received a fellowship to study philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, where e became interested in the study of philosophies of history. He received his doctorate from the New School. His dissertation Alienation and the Dialectical Paradigm focused on the historical creation of a critical science and philosophy. Teaching career In 1969, Schroyer was asked to join the graduate faculty of the New School, where he taught critical theory. During this time, he published The Critique of Domination: The Origins and Development of Critical Theory that was nominated for a National Book Award in philosophy and religion. As editor of the journal Telos, Schroyer helped get critical theory diffused more broadly. But after an extended research in the spin offs of the New Left, the editorial board declined to open a new communications section documenting these innovations ‚Äì Schroyer dropped out of the journal. In 1973, Schroyer was appointed professor of sociology-philosophy in the School of Environmental Studies at Ramapo College. Schroyer organized six semester-long lecture series at Ramapo college on the subjects of \\"Ecological Futures,\\" \\"Counter Movements in Science,\\" \\"Authoritarianism or Democratization,\\" \\"Thinking Globally - Acting Locally, Promises of the Earth Summit,\\" and \\"World Sustainability,\\" as well as a later symposium on \\"The Relevance of Gandhi After 9/11.\\" TOES (The Other Economic Summit) In 1990, Schroyer served as the overall program coordinator for \\"The Other Economic Summit\\" (TOES) in Houston, Texas in 1990. In 1997, he replaced Ward Morehouse as chair for Denver, Colorado. After the G-7 meeting in Denver, Schroyer helped form with Stephen Marglin an Economic Visions group at TOES. Schroyer again served as chair at the 2004 Brunswick summit. Publications Schroyer's books include critical discourse of corporate sustainable development and documentation of real sustainability practices. His work also documents the regenerations of intrinsic capacities of unique ecologies and cultures. In The History of Scarcity: Consequences and Planetary Costs of Globalization, Schroyer adopted an alternative interpretation of these historical realities from Karl Polanyi's critique of Karl Marx's theory of the source of human misery. Polanyi asserts that \\"The disintegration of the cultural environment of the victim is the cause of degradation, not economic exploitation\\" (The Great Transformation). Undermining socio-cultural institutions subordinates them to the logics of wider market forces. Of course, economic exploitation exists and the powerful will impose it. Polanyi derives this hypothesis from his analysis of how the new social technologies of classical economics were applied to aggressively destroy subsistence capacities in England and the colonies. Once the concept of scarcity is central to economic theory it becomes much easier to imagine the human situation as dependent upon \\"nature-like\\" economic forces and to impose wider wage-labor regimes upon livelihood centered habitation. Ivan Illich uses Polanyi's view to form a prophetic hypothesis about the history of the west as a 500-year war on subsistence - the history of scarcity. Scarcity is the condition that justifies the dis-valuing of all traditional socio-cultural forms. The hierarchies and hollowing out of political capacities and creation of social scarcity results in the collapse of social bonds that create loneliness and isolation. This also applies to the conditions leading to the 2016 U.S. election. As a participant in Ivan Illich's retreats in Germany, Penn State, and Oakland, Calif. that focused on dimensions of the history of scarcity Schroyer benefited from the wisdom of Wolfgang Sachs, David Cayley, Frederique Apffel-Marglin, Jean Robert, et al. Discovery and discourse in India As a member of International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, a non-governmental, international solidarity organization based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Schroyer helped facilitate gatherings of indigenous leaders in Quebec and south-east Asia. At the Bangalore, India conference in 2000, Siddhartha, from Fireflies Ashram, invited him to bring activists, scholars and students to India to encounter grassroots actions and models for alternatives in south India. From this beginning in 2000 Schroyer founded the Ramapo India semester study abroad program. In 2004 Schroyer brought Ramapo students and activists to the World Social ForumWorld Social Forum in Mumbai, built around the slogan 'Another World is Possible'. At Fireflies Ashram, participants engaged in public dialogues about transformative innovations in India such as the ongoing Gandhian legacy, commons actions, alternative economics and inter-religious discourse. Participation in these discourses and visits to many communities revealed that encountering people in their own worlds changes perceptions and structures of feeling. These encounters were expressed in the following presentations: Schroyer gave a talk titled \\"On Economic Alternatives\\" to the Indian Institute of Journalism & News Media (IIJNM), Bangalore, India in 2008 and another talk to the Indian Institute of Science Campus in Bangalore that same year, titled \\"The Fall of Western Certitudes and the Relevance of Ivan Illich\\". On March 31,2009, Schroyer presented a paper \\"Compassion and Confrontation\\" at the University of Madras, Chennai, India. Re-inhabitations on Ikaria Island, Greece Tula Tsalis and Schroyer led three summer trips with students and activists down the Aegean islands from Lesvos, to Chios, to Samos, Ikaria and Patmos going from units of the University of the Aegean for introductions to Greek history and the problems of the islands. This was a background for work in Ikaria. Schroyer and his wife, Tula Tsalis, helped start an Ikarian Regeneration Project as a response to the imposed \\"austerity\\" programs on Greece and Ikaria island and investigated how Ikarian's can protect their public assets (‚Äòcommons‚Äô), such as forests, water systems, and community solidarity. Realities of the island were interpreted in their participation in the International Commons Conference at the Heinrich Boll Foundation in Berlin Germany (2010) and Schroyer's paper 'Beyond Western Economism' presented at the European Urban Anthropology Conference at the University of Peloponnese in Corinth, Greece (2010). Participation in civic education in America The 2009 Economics of Peace International Conference co-convened by the Praxis Peace Institute in Sonoma, California included Schroyer's participation. Pope Francis proposed worldwide dialogues about the credibility of the progress narratives and advocates putting scientific knowledge and techno-economic development into the context of a wider Integral ecology. Schroyer joined this discourse in Ramapo College's Symposium on Pope Francis's Laudato Si whose discourse is convergent with some of Ivan IIlich's views. (2015) Schroyer helped create the Community Action Network in Warwick, NY in November 2016 in response to Donald Trump's policies. The forum on \\"Can We Save the Constitution or Can the Constitution Save Us\\" in Middletown, N.Y. in 2017 was convened to assess threats to the United States Constitution. The forum argued that citizens should be prepared for a constitutional crisis.

Hive tools come in multiple variants and styles, and is intended as an all-in-one tool for beekeepers. Hive tool is the third most essential tool for the beekeeper after the beekeeping veil and bee smoker. There are two types of hive tool in common use - the standard hive tool and J-type hive tool. The standard hive tool has a box levering edge and a frame levering edge. The J-type hive tool also has a box levering edge, but on the other side is a j-hook and a small notch either type may have a small possibly tapered hole which is intended for removing small nails like a claw hammer. The other job of the hive tool is to lift frames when the hive is propolized. J-type tool should be used in a specific way ‚Äì the J goes into the bee space and the notch rests on the hive wall or the frame behind to provide lift. It is recommended not to use the J-hook under the lugs of the frames ‚Äì it will not fit and may break the lugs off the frame. Using an ordinary chisel or screwdriver instead may result in damage to equipment or to beehive. Because an ordinary tool may cause excessive damage, it might not be worth the trouble when using these tools to inspect the hive. This is especially true in the case where a beekeeper is using these tools directly to manipulate materials.  Uses  The hive tool is used for mainly two things: * Prying things apart * Scraping things off The beekeeper will use it throughout hive inspections. Here are some uses: * Prying off the cover of the beehive glued with propolis Dadant Catalog - Tool page - https://www.dadant.com/catalog/tools/tools * Prying boxes apart stuck together with propolis * Loosening frames from the hive body * Removing burr comb, bridge comb or brace comb. * Scraping off propolis or debris from parts of the hive * Removing the lid off a bee packageHow Do I Install Packages of Bees? Dadant - https://www.dadant.com/learn/install-package-bees/ * Dislodging bee stingers from the skin without squeezing the venom sac.Bee Stings - HoneyBeeOnline - https://www.honeybeesonline.com/bee-stings/  Variants  =Standard= The standard hive tool is made of a plate piece of metal bend at 90¬∞.Best Hive Tool? - Bee Culture - https://www.beeculture.com/best-hive-tool/ = J-Hook = The J-Hook variant describes any type of hive tool that utilizes a curved hook at either end. The hook is in the same plane as the prying part and is thus, normally flat. The hook is used primarily for prying the hive frames loose while reducing potential damage done to both the frame and comb. It is traditionally a flat tool. = Frame Grip = Operating very similarly to a pair of pliers, the frame grip can act as an alternative to a J-hook hive tool. Commonly used on more aggressive hives, the frame grip hive tool allows quick and efficient inspection of the hive frames. It can alternatively be used as a nail puller.

He was recruited by Peter the Great, who sought to introduce Western ideas and technology into Russia. He moved to Moscow where he established a school and later established a naval academy in Saint Petersburg. Farquharson had a profound effect on the intellectual life of Russia, not only by introducing mathematical ideas but by helping to create the first generation of explorers, surveyors, cartographers and astronomers. Early life Henry Farquharson was born around 1675 at Milton, Whitehouse in West Aberdeenshire, the son of John Farquharson. From 1691 he studied as Milne bursar at Marischal College in Aberdeen and by 1695 he was Liddel mathematical tutor there. In April 1698 he was introduced to the tsar of Russia, Peter the Great, probably by the Marquess of Carmarthen. The tsar was at this time on a tour of Europe to learn from Western ideas and technology. In particular he was interested in creating a modern Russian navy. Peter the Great recruited Farquharson for a new mathematics and navigation school that he planned to found in Moscow. Moscow Sukharev Tower Farquharson sailed on the Royal Transport with Stephen Gwyn (d.1720) and Richard Grice (d.1709) and they arrived in Archangel by June 1698. After their arrival in Moscow they lived in the house of an English merchant Henry Crevett and tutored a few paying students whilst they waited for the tsar to follow through with his promises of patronage. By January 1701 a government decree had established the Mathematics and Navigation School. By June the school moved to the Sukharev Tower, a repurposed city gate and a Moscow landmark until its demolition in the 1930s. The school taught arithmetic, trigonometry, navigation, astronomy and surveying. Within a few years there were 500 pupils at the school, and by 1715 1200 specialists are thought to have graduated from the school. The school also held music and amateur stage performances on holidays and Sundays. At first Farquharson lectured in Latin until he learned Russian. He belonged to the quasi-masonic Neptune Society which met in the Sukharev Tower and was headed by the tsar himself. The tsar was fascinated with astronomy and would correspond with Farquharson about eclipses, as well as supplying him with as many instruments and book as he requested. In addition to teaching, Farquharson also performed practical duties. He proposed a direct road from Moscow to the new city of Saint Petersburg via Novgorod and led the surveying work himself. St Petersburg In 1715 Peter the Great founded the St Petersburg Naval Academy at Kilkin's House, on the site where the Winter Palace now stands. Farquharson was appointed senior professor of mathematics and although the academy had a president and director, he was in de facto charge of the institute. He created a broad curriculum including not only mathematics and navigation but drawing, fencing, artillery and fortification. In the ten years after its founding 215 cadets graduated from the academy, many went on to complete their training in foreign naval service. Farquharson was connected to the European scientific elite. He corresponded with Leibniz and the Royal Society about Russia as well as scientific topics. He believed to have translated as many as 38 scientific works into Russian including Euclid's Elements and Henry Brigg's Arithmetic logarithmica. Farquharson was also a talented cartographer, producing a bronze engraving of Mercator's map of America and led the creation of a hydrographic atlas of the Caspian Sea. By the end of his life, Farquharson had reached the level of brigadier in the Russian table of ranks, a sign of the high respect in which he was held. He died in St. Petersburg on 19 December 1739 and was probably buried in St. Sampson's cemetery.

He invented the game during a holiday in Romania, despite him not having seen the movie it was based on. Indiana Jones II was released as a free sequel in 1987. It was notable for allowing the player to control the menu, which despite slow rendering and item selection was exceptional for the industry. Fuka promoted the title as \\"the first Czech text game with only three buttons\\". Indiana Jones III was notable for using a non-standard font upon its release in 1990, which allowed Franti≈°ek Fuka to circumvent the display limitations of thirty-two characters per line. The title contained eight spaces for game saves, which was above that of foreign commercial products.

While on death row, Hamm developed lymphatic cancer, which made it difficult to impossible to achieve the venous access necessary to administer the drugs used in lethal injections. Despite months of warning by Hamm's attorney and human rights observers and a decades' long legal battle, the Alabama Department of Corrections attempted to execute Hamm on February 22, 2018. The unsuccessful execution attempt lasted nearly three hours and drew international attention. In March 2018, Hamm and the state of Alabama reached a confidential settlement, the terms of which preclude a second execution attempt.  Early life  An arrest photo of Doyle Hamm from February 1981.Doyle Hamm grew up in northwest Alabama and was the tenth of twelve children. While he was growing up, Hamm's father and each of his six older brothers spent time in jail. In an interview, one of Hamm's sisters described their childhood home as ‚Äúconstant hell all the time‚Äù and recalled that her father told his children that ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt go out and steal, then you‚Äôre not a Hamm.‚Äù From an early age, Hamm struggled in school. Tests and report cards indicated that, in the fifth grade, Hamm was still reading in at a first-grade level. Hamm dropped out of school during the ninth grade and began abusing drugs and alcohol. At the age of twenty, Hamm was arrested and charged with robbery after a drunken fight in a bar parking lot. Hamm entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to five years in prison. Years later, the alleged victim confessed that no robbery had ever taken place and Hamm's court-appointed attorney admitted that he had been ‚Äútoo busy and overworked to give this case the time and attention it needed.‚Äù Hamm was arrested other times for burglary, assault, and grand larceny.  Capital murder  In January 1987, Hamm went on a crime spree that culminated in a motel robbery and the murder of Patrick Cunningham, a nighttime clerk at the motel. $350 was taken from the motel's cash register and Cunningham was shot once in the temple. Hamm was arrested and charged with capital murder. Two individuals claiming to be witnesses to the crime initially identified Hamm as the gunman during the robbery, but soon recanted their testimony. Those individuals were later charged as co- defendants and took deals to testify as state witnesses. During questioning, Hamm confessed to committing the robbery.  Problems at trial and on appeal  = Problems at trial = Hamm's 1987 trial was divided into two parts: a first stage during which a jury would determine whether Hamm was guilty and, if it found him guilty, a second phase during which the jury would determine whether life imprisonment or a death sentence was the appropriate punishment. During the second phase of the trial, defense attorneys are able to present mitigating evidence to the jury, in order to argue that the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death. Hamm's defense attorney spent only 19 minutes presenting mitigation evidence. None of the medical and education records indicating that Hamm may have had brain damage or an intellectual disability were presented to the jury, even though the records were available. Additionally, evidence that Hamm suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and that he had an IQ of only 66 was not presented to the jury. The defense counsel's failure to present this evidence to the jury became the subject of subsequent appeals, which raised the possibility that Hamm's attorney was so ineffective as to violate the Sixth Amendment. = Problems on appeal and in post-conviction proceedings = In June 1999, twelve years after Hamm's conviction, Hamm received a hearing to review claims that his trial counsel was ineffective and that Hamm's constitutional right to counsel was violated as a result. On Friday December 3, the Alabama Attorney General's office submitted a ‚ÄúProposed Memorandum Order‚Äù to the judge who was presiding over the case. The following Monday, less than a single business day after the proposed order had been submitted, the judge entered the proposed order as his ruling, without changing a single word or even striking out the word ‚Äúproposed.‚Äù The Brennan Center for Justice noted that it isn't clear from the record whether the judge who presided over Hamm's 1999 hearing ‚Äúever bothered to read the order.‚Äù In 2015, when the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was reviewing Hamm's case, the court included a footnote stating that ‚Äúwe take this opportunity to once again strongly criticize the practice of trial courts‚Äô uncritical wholesale adoption of the proposed orders or opinions submitted by a prevailing party.‚Äù Judge Adalberto Jordan of the Eleventh Circuit stated ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe for a second that that judge went through 89 pages in a day and then filed that as his own. As if he had gone through everything, went through his notes, the transcript, the exhibits, and the like. It just can‚Äôt be done! It just can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù Judge Jordan added that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt there something fishy about such a detailed opinion being signed on a Monday after being submitted the previous Friday?‚Äù Another problem with the 1999 hearing occurred as a result of a change in counsel. Over the objection of Hamm and Bernard Harcourt, a law professor who was then representing Hamm pro-bono, the court terminated Harcourt's representation of Hamm and appointed a new attorney to represent him during the proceedings. The new counsel, who was unfamiliar with the work that Hamm's previous attorney had been doing, called only a single witness during the trial. The court-appointed attorney did not call the expert psychologist or the mitigation psychologist, both of whom were prepared to testify about Hamm's brain damage. These problems with Hamm's 1987 trial and 1999 hearing were significant enough to warrant a group of former judges and state bar association presidents to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to grant legal relief to Hamm. The group of former judges included a former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a former Associate Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a former Presiding Judge of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, and two former presidents of the Alabama State Bar.  Illness  In February 2014, Hamm, who was still on death row, was diagnosed with lymphatic and cranial cancer. Doctors discovered a large malignant tumor behind his left eye and determined that Hamm suffered from B-cell lymphoma. Doctors also discovered ‚Äúnumerous abnormal lymph nodes‚Äù in Hamm's abdomen, lungs, and chest. Hamm underwent years of cancer treatment, including radiation therapy, but the treatments did not eliminate the cancer entirely and, by late 2017, Hamm's cancer had worsened. By late 2017, Hamm was suffering from inflamed lymph nodes in his neck, chest, and abdomen, symptoms which are associated with worsening lymphoma. Hamm's swollen lymph nodes were observed by multiple independent medical examiners. A surgery to remove a cancerous lesion on Hamm's cheek that was eating through bone and tissue was canceled on December 13, 2017, the date it was scheduled to be performed, when the Alabama Supreme Court handed down Hamm's death warrant and scheduled an execution for a few months later. In September 2017, when an anesthesiologist came to visit Hamm for a medical examination, he was prohibited from bringing his medical equipment past the prison security and the doctor was forced to use Hamm's lawyer's tie as a tourniquet. Andrew Cohen, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice noted that Hamm's case symbolizes the injustice of Alabama's death penalty system. Cohen observed that ‚Äúthe idea that executioners want to make sure they kill Hamm before he dies of cancer, the fact that it is likely the lethal injection itself will cause him \\"needless pain\\" before he dies, may be abhorrent but it's entirely consistent with the way state officials have handled Hamm's case for years.‚Äù In addition to cancer, Hamm suffered from Hepatitis C and had a history of intravenous drug use that made it more difficult to access his veins.  Lead up to execution  On December 13, 2017, the Alabama Supreme Court set Hamm‚Äôs execution date for Thursday, February 22, 2018. On January 31, 2018, Chief Judge Karen O. Bowdre issued a stay of execution, finding that Hamm had shown a substantial likelihood that he would suffer irreparable injury if the execution were to go forward. In an order released on February 6, Chief Judge Bowdre ordered an independent medical examination of Hamm, finding that a medical examination was necessary in order to determine whether ‚ÄúAlabama's lethal injection protocol \\"presents a risk that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering, and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers. Alabama appealed the district court‚Äôs order and, on February 13, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the stay and ordered the district court to immediately appoint an independent medical examiner and schedule an independent medical examination. The medical examination found that Hamm‚Äôs arms and hands were unusable, but his ‚Äúlower extremities‚Äù were usable.  Calls for clemency  In the weeks leading up to Hamm's executions, human rights experts from the United Nations called on the Alabama to halt Hamm's execution. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern that the execution could amount to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, and possibly torture. The Special Rapporteurs also expressed concern that Hamm did not receive a fair trial. Sister Helen Prejean, an anti-death penalty advocate, frequently spoke out about Hamm's execution and expressed concern that the execution would ‚Äúgo horribly wrong.\\" Prejean described Alabama's decision to execute Hamm despite his cancer as ‚Äúespecially inhumane.‚Äù On February 20, two days before Hamm's execution was scheduled to take place, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and the International Commission Against the Death Penalty authored an open letter to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey expressing serious concern over Hamm's scheduled execution. On February 6, Hamm's attorney petitioned Governor Ivey to grant Hamm clemency. Included in Hamm's clemency petition were letters of support from family and friends, faith leaders, and community members. The Human Rights Center of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro also wrote a letter in support of clemency. On February 21, the day prior to Hamm's scheduled execution, a group of lawyers and former judges wrote a letter to Governor Ivey, urging her not to go ahead with Hamm's execution. The group, which included former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Ernest ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù Hornsby, former Court of Criminal Appeals Judge William Bowen, and two former presidents of the Alabama State Bar, warned ‚Äúthe prospect of the prolonged, agonizing execution of a very sick cancer patient cannot be a desirable one for anyone in our State, even those who support retention of the death penalty in general. The jurists raised the prospect that Hamm‚Äôs impending execution could turn out to be like the botched execution of Clayton Lockett, which would draw ‚Äúgrotesque international attention‚Äù to Alabama and its execution practices.  Attempted execution  On February 20, two days before Hamm's execution was scheduled to take place, Chief Judge Bowdre issued an order allowing the execution to take place. At 12:30 on February 22, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied Hamm's request for a stay of execution, prompting Hamm's counsel to appeal the decision to the United States Supreme Court. At 6:00 PM on February 22, the Supreme Court issued a temporary stay of execution as it considered Hamm's claims. Almost three hours later, at approximately 8:40, the Supreme Court lifted the temporary stay and denied Hamm's petition for a stay of execution. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented from the court's denial and noted that the method of execution that Alabama had devised in order to execute Hamm despite his cancer and venous access issues has ‚Äúnever been tried before in Alabama.‚Äù During the course of the execution attempt, correctional officers spent two and a half hours inserting needles into Hamm's legs and ankles, trying to get venous access. The execution team turned Hamm on his stomach and slapped the back of his legs in attempt to find a usable vein. When attempts at peripheral venous access failed, members of the execution team began inserting needles into Hamm's groin in the hopes of finding a vein. During this process, Hamm was stabbed a half-dozen times, with needles puncturing his bladder and penetrating his femoral artery. In the days following the execution attempt, Hamm's blood contained urine as a result of the punctured bladder. During the execution, a large amount of blood accumulated around Hamm's groin, soaking through the pad he was laying on and requiring the execution team to replace it. The large amount of blood led to speculation that the executioner had also punctured Hamm's femoral artery. When the execution was finally called off, Hamm collapsed as he was removed from the gurney. During a visit with his defense counsel the following day, Hamm was limping and sore and was described by his attorney as ‚Äúa shadow of himself.‚Äù Hamm became only the third person in the United States since 1946 to walk out of the execution chamber still alive. In a press conference following the execution attempt, Jeff Dunn, Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections told reporters ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt necessarily characterize what we had tonight as a problem.‚Äù The New York Times described the botched execution as ‚Äúghoulish proceedings.‚Äù Sara Totonchi, executive director of the Southern Center for Human Rights described the event as ‚Äúunconscionable,‚Äù adding that the ‚Äúattempted execution clearly demonstrates the cruelty and the torture of the death penalty.‚Äù The editorial board of a local newspaper in Alabama described the attempted execution as ‚Äútorture in Alabama‚Äôs death chamber.‚Äù In a report submitted to the federal court, the doctor who examined Hamm after the attempted execution wrote that, during the execution, Hamm wished for death ‚Äúbecause he preferred to die rather than to continue to experience the ongoing severe pain.‚Äù  Aftermath  On March 5, 2018, Hamm and his attorney filed an amended civil rights lawsuit against the Alabama Department of Corrections. The lawsuit alleged that a second execution attempt would violate Hamm's Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Hamm also alleged that a second execution attempt would violate 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, a federal law prohibiting the deprivation of civil rights. In the immediate aftermath of the execution attempt, the Alabama Attorney General's Office would not comment on whether it would seek a second execution attempt. On March 26, 2018, a little over a month after the attempted execution, Hamm and the state of Alabama reached a confidential settlement. The settlement ‚Äúresolved all of the state and federal litigation‚Äù that was still pending in the case at the time and ended the efforts by Alabama to set a second execution date for Hamm. In a press conference announcing that Oklahoma would move forward with executions by inert gas inhalation, Joe Allbaugh, the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, described the attempt to execute Hamm as \\"inhumane.\\" Following Hamm's attempted execution, the Associated Press and other news outlets requested the state's execution protocol and related records. The state initially denied the request, claiming that the execution protocol was secret. A district court ordered that that state could not keep its protocol secret and had to disclose the requested records. In March 2019, a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling. The Eleventh Circuit wrote that ‚ÄúThe fact that Alabama zealously guards information about a matter of great public concern does not tip the scales against disclosure. The court concludes that the considerations in favor of unsealing the records greatly outweigh Alabama‚Äôs interest in maintaining secrecy.‚Äù The events surrounding Alabama's attempt to execute Hamm were recounted in a Supreme Court brief that was filed in Bucklew v. Precythe, a 2019 Supreme Court case concerning the death penalty. The brief was filed on behalf of former federal and state judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials, who were urging the Supreme Court to prohibit the execution of Russell Bucklew.

She showed ability as a two-year-old in France when she won three of her five races but was not expected to make further progress. In the spring of 1929 she was sent to England and recorded a 33/1 upset victory in the 1000 Guineas but never raced again. As a broodmare she produced at least two high-class winners. Background Taj Mah was a \\"tiny\\" grey mare, standing barely 15 hands high bred in Ireland by Aga Khan III. As a yearling she was considered surplus to her owner's requirements and put up for sale. She was bought for 250,000 francs by Simon Guthmann who sent her into training in France with the Argentinian Juan Torterolo. She was from one of the last crops of foals sired by Lemberg, whose wins included the Epsom Derby, Eclipse Stakes and Champion Stakes. Lemberg also sired the Ellangowan and Pogrom and had been Champion sire in 1922. Her dam Taj Mahal also produced Taj Kasra (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Taj Shirin, the dam of the Derby runner-up Taj Akbar and the Irish Derby winner Nathoo. Racing career =1928: two- year-old season= Taj Mah won three minor races from five starts in France in 1928 and was rated the ninth best juvenile of the season in the French Handicap Libre. The filly was however thought to have stamina limitations and unlikely to stay further than 1200 metres (six furlongs). =1929: three-year- old season= Juan Torterolo felt that there was little point in sending the filly to race in England in the spring of 1929 but was overruled by the owner and Taj Mah temporarily joined the stable of Victor Gilpin at Newmarket. Her chances of success in Britain were not improved when she became highly agitated and distressed on the boat journey across the English Channel. On 3 May, with the Australian Wally Sibbritt in the saddle, she started a 33/1 outsider in a 19 runner field for the 116th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course. Before the race she looked unimpressive being described as \\"deficient in size\\" and a mere \\"pony\\" in comparison to her rivals. The joint-favourites for the ace were Sister Anne and Almondale while the other fancied runners included Necklace (Prix Morny) and Arabella (Queen Mary Stakes, Champagne Stakes). In a major upset Taj Mah took the lead from Arabella a furlong from the finish and won by a length from Sister Anne, with Ellanvale a short head away in third place. Taj Mah did not race again and was retired at the end of the year. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Taj Mah a \\"poor\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Taj Mah became a broodmare for Simon Guthmann's stud. She produced at least three foals between 1931 and 1935: *Birmah, a grey colt, foaled in 1931, sired by Biribi. Won Prix de Courcelles. *Birmania, filly, 1933, by Biribi. Won Prix de Pomone *Rajah, grey colt, 1935, by Blandford Pedigree * Taj Mah was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Bona Vista, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generation of her pedigree.

He was a brother of Charles Kingston, who was Premier of South Australia from 1893 to 1899. Brilliant but unstable, he died by his own hand. History Kingston was born in Adelaide the elder son of (later Sir) George Kingston, an Irish- born surveyor, landowner and parliamentarian. He was educated at Adelaide Educational Institution, where he was considered, with his brother and (later Dr.) Joseph Verco, one of its three brightest students. He was also a fine athlete and sportsman, excelling in long-distance running, jumping, boxing and on the football field. On leaving school he found employment with the Bank of Australasia (Samuel Tomkinson was manager at the time), then decided to study law. Samuel Way took him on as an articled clerk, then when in 1876 Way was elevated to Chief Justice of South Australia, his articles were transferred to Josiah Symon, Way's partner. Kingston was admitted to the bar in April 1879 Six new barristers were created on 26 April, all born in SA: E. W. Hawker, F. L. Stow, S. G. Kingston, W. J. L. Sinclair, T. F. Wigley, and L. W. Bakewell. and joined his brother in partnership as Kingston & Kingston, solicitors, with offices in Eagle Chambers, Pirie Street. The practice was successful, but cut short by a stupid act on (S. G.) Kingston's part: On Sunday 8 June 1884 around 4 pm Kingston, carrying a saloon rifle in a bag, boarded a cab operated by one Patrick Guerrin, who sported a tall felt hat \\"after the American pattern\\". He had been carried along Pirie Street as far as Hindmarsh Square when he took it into his head to put a bullet through the \\"topper\\" of the cabman, but whether through carelessness, inebriation or (as Kingston claimed) a sudden lurch of the vehicle, the slug went low and lodged in Guerrin's scalp. The cabman immediately ejected Kingston, and appears to have demanded money (perhaps ¬£1000, then ¬£300) to avoid a criminal charge, which Kingston refused. Kingston was duly charged, convicted and jailed for six months, confounding skeptics, who predicted he would, by virtue of his profession and connections, somehow be treated lightly. By this time Charles Kingston, who dearly loved his older brother, had been appointed Attorney-General in the Colton Cabinet and dropped his legal practice; otherwise it is likely that despite his brother's mad action and consequent disgrace, their business partnership would have been renewed. Certainly he never distanced himself from his aberrant brother. In January 1885 Kingston returned to legal practice in the old offices, and appears to have had no shortage of clients. In March 1886 he moved to offices in Lipson Street, Port Adelaide, then in July 1889 to Church Street, Port Augusta. He was an extremely clever lawyer and was able by sophisticated arguments to save many wealthy clients from the legal consequences of their actions. > \\"The Chairman caused some amusement by reading a cutting reporting the trial > before justices at Port Augusta of two cases in which the defendants were > charged by the District Council of Woolundunga with neglecting to destroy > rabbits. In both cases Mr. N. A. Webb appeared for the District Council, and > Mr. S. G. Kingston for the defendants.

It was doubtless miserable Hannah > Tapley's own fault in speaking the truth that caused her to be fined.\\" =Death= Around mid-September 1897 Kingston was in Adelaide to appear in an action being heard before the Supreme Court, and expressed to his brother-in- law Hubert Giles his confidence in the outcome. He took it badly however when the verdict went the other way. Canon Hopcraft of St. John's (Anglican) church, Adelaide, a longtime friend and confidante, reported that he took this loss personally, and was not seen sober for several days. Back in Port Augusta, Kingston, never a temperate man, and frequently driven to excessive drinking, \\"had been in a very depressed state of mind for some time\\" and was suffering the after-effects of a heavy night when he received news of a client having withdrawn from a case, though there is no indication that precipitated what happened next. He shot himself through the heart with a Martini-Henry sporting rifle at his office in Church Street at 2.40 pm on 4 October 1897 and died shortly after. Charles Kingston, who had recently returned from a triumphant visit to the United Kingdom, followed by a meeting with the Federation Commission, where he was elected chairman; cancelled all appointments and with his Commissioner of Crown Lands (L. O'Loughlin) was on the 4.30 pm Broken Hill express, and at Petersburg had a \\"special\\" waiting to take them to Port Augusta, arriving at 3.45 am. After viewing the body, which caused Charles Kingston great distress, they returned with the coffin by the same train. His remains were deposited in the family mausoleum, West Terrace Cemetery. Family On 25 September 1879 Kingston married Kathleen Pittar Stanton ( ‚Äì 3 June 1929) daughter of Rev. L. W. Stanton, Anglican clergyman at Burra and Kapunda, later of Coombe Keynes, Dorset, England. They had two daughters: *Kathleen Molly Kingston (1880‚Äì1958) married Walter Leslie Stuart ( ‚Äì1933) in 1901.

She was the only daughter of a Norfolk lawyer, William Paston and Agnes Barry. In her late teens and twenties she resisted marriage to several men proposed by her mother and brothers, before marrying Sir Robert Poynings in 1458, with whom she had a son Edward Poynings. Following her husband's death at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, she spent a period as a widow before marrying George Browne by whom she had two further children. Browne's execution in 1483 following his involvement in a rebellion against Richard III left her a widow again.  Family  Elizabeth Paston, born 1429 in Norfolk, was the middle child and only daughter of William Paston, Justice of the Common Pleas, and Agnes Barry, the daughter and co-heir of Sir Edmund Barry (d. 1433) of Hertfordshire. Elizabeth had four brothers, the eldest of whom, John Paston (died 1466), succeeded her father in 1444 as heir and head of the family. = Marriage proposals and marriages = By the standards of the time Elizabeth Paston married late; she was nearly 30 when she married in 1458. Her father William had left her ¬£200 towards her marriage in his will, provided that she married according to the advice of her mother and his other executors. Potential marriages had been under discussion from at least the time she was nineteen in 1449 when marriage was proposed with a fifty-year-old widower Stephen Scrope, whose stepfather John Fastolf was John Paston's chief patron. Elizabeth was being harshly treated at home by her mother, Agnes, who, as her cousin Elizabeth Clere reported in a letter of 1449, beat her regularly. However, her brother John, who was responsible for organising her dowry, was slow to do so. Various suitors were put forward during the 1450s but marriage did not materialise until 1458 when Elizabeth married Robert Poynings, one of the younger sons of a Sussex landowner. It may not have been a love match but within a year she had a son, Edward Poynings. Edward was born in 1459, only months before Robert Poynings was killed fighting on the Yorkist side at the second battle of St Albans. Elizabeth was left a widow to bring up their son. Edward Poynings was to become a trusted administrator of King Henry VII. In his role as deputy lord lieutenant in Ireland he was responsible for the famous \\"Poynings' Law\\" which clearly subordinated the Anglo-Irish and the Irish to the authority of the English parliament. Elizabeth Poynings (nee Paston) was a widow for over a decade, until she remarried in 1471 to George Browne, landowner of Betchworth in Surrey. With Browne Elizabeth had two further children, a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Mary. Browne was actively involved in politics, both local and national. Twelve years after their marriage George Browne - accompanied by his stepson Edward Poynings - was involved in the unsuccessful rebellion of Henry, Duke of Buckingham against King Richard III in 1483. Elizabeth's husband was beheaded on Tower Hill in London that December, leaving Elizabeth a widow as a result of political activity during the wars of the roses for the second time. She was not to remarry. = Will = Elizabeth Browne died in 1488, aged 58 or 59. Her adult life had been dominated and significantly marked by the political activities of both her husbands and also by her elder son Edward. Her extensive will shows that she was a devout widow but also a very wealthy one, with an extensive list of valuables and jewels left to her descendants.

It was published by Proxima Software as part of their \\"Fuxoft uv√°d√≠\\" series. A newer version of the game (as opposed to a sequel) entitled Poklad 2 was designed in 1985 and released in 1992. Production Poklad is one of the oldest surviving games created in Czechoslovakia. Franti≈°ek Fuka had previously created several games on the Commodore VIC-20, however he would sell the computer along with its software to an unknown buyer, and those games would not survive. Fuka, a 16-year-old computer enthusiast, programmed the game on his friend's ZX Spectrum as he didn't have a computer of his own. Fuka first got interested in games after his uncle bought him a copy of Creative Computing magazine, which he wrote for; Fuaka began reading reviews and ads for text adventures. He had been inspired to make the game after playing a different game called Poklad (which the thesis The Beginnings of Czech and Slovak Digital Narrativity: The History of Text Computer games in Czechoslovakia surmises as a translation of a Western game) on the ZX81 computer. Fuka programmed it entirely from memory. Poklad is considered a beta version of Poklad 2, for this reason Fuka himself deems Boxing (1985) his first video game and he expressly acknowledges the first game's non-existence. Poklad 2 was translated into English, although Fuka does not remember who did the translation. Polka is sometimes considered the first Czechoslovak game, however depending on the definition earlier video games may have existed through the 1970s. Text-based adventures would become the most popular video gaming genre throughout the second half of the 1980s, with over 500 games created; this is because they were easy to make (one developer could make a game in 2-3 weeks), and easy to translate to Western languages. Fuka created the title without any expectation of financial gain. The Czechoslovak video gaming development industry was predominantly young high school or college aged males who attended computer clubs, and who made games individually. This made it difficult for the amateur one-team developers to complete with Western professional companies. Fuka would proclaim in 1998: \\"The few individuals that make games in our country can naturally hardly compete with teams of specialists, for whom making games is not only fun, but also a job (a paid one, of course). One person can hardly be a good author of a game idea, a programmer, a graphic artist, a musician and also have enough time to pull it all off\\". Plot and gameplay The player finds themselves in a magical country and their task is to find five treasures. The game consists of a 4 x 5 room matrix in three levels. Gameplay consists of a classic text adventure game. Reception Tiscali.cz thought it was a very simple and short attempt at a game, but that it offered a great foreshadowing of where Fuka's career would end up.

The station was a stop on the Ankara suburban from 1972 to 2016, when the station was closed for renovation. Once the rebuilt station is opened, commuter rail service will resume. Etimesgut station is located along ƒ∞stasyon Avenue, near Hikmet √ñzer Avenue. History The original station was built in 1925, by the Turkish government-owned Anatolian‚ÄîBaghdad Railways, to service the newly formed neighborhood of Etimesgut. The station house was designed by Turkish architect Burhaneddin Tamcƒ±, who also designed the station house of the nearby Gazi station. Until his death in 1938, when President Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk traveled from Ankara, Etimesgut station was where public crowds would gather to watch his train pass by. When the nearby Ankara Sugarcane Mill opened in 1962, freight rail cars were stored at the station's small yard. This continued until the 1990s, when the mill replaced freight rail transport with trucks. In 1970, the Turkish State Railways expanded the station, adding a new platform in preparation for electric commuter rail service from Sincan to Kaya≈ü. The new platform entered service in 1972 when the Ankara suburban entered revenue service. Once commuter rail service began, intercity and regional trains bypassed Etimesgut and the station became a local stop only. In 2012, the small siding on the north side of the station grounds was replaced with a new track for YHT high- speed rail. On 11 July 2016, Etimesgut station was closed to passenger traffic and the platform demolished shortly after. The railway was widened from three to five tracks and a new island platform was built with a new station house over it. The station is expected to re-open on 12 April 2018.

The project received approval from the Westminster Parliament by means of a Local Act of 14 August 1890.Garve and Ullapool Railway Act, 1890. Parliamentary Papers, ref: Local Act, 53 & 54 Victoria I, c. ccxxxiii. London. (1890) The line did not gain financial backing and was never constructed. Renewed attempts to build it were made in 1896, 1901, 1918 and 1945, again with no success. Social Background In the early 1880s, long-term deprivation and scarceness of land drove several communities on the West of Scotland to carry out acts of civil disobedience ‚Äì rent-strikes and land-raids - collectively termed ‚ÄòThe Crofters‚Äô War‚Äô. This also resulted in the formation of the Highland Land League and a political party named The Crofters Party which returned several members to the Westminster Parliament. In the investigations which were set up in the aftermath of these events, principally driven by the Napier Commission of 1883, it was acknowledged that the people of the west Highlands and Islands had a justifiable grievance. In an effort to alleviate conditions, proposals were made, firstly, to reform the laws of land- ownership, and secondly, to develop the fisheries by opening up markets in the British cities. This latter goal was to be achieved primarily by improving transport-links (i.e. harbours and railways) between the west coast and central Scotland and the south. All of this also came at a time when various private companies were developing ‚Äì or wishing to develop ‚Äì railway lines across Scotland, to capitalise on the Victorian tourist boom and the increased leisure-time of the middle- and upper-classes. Principal among these companies were Great North of Scotland Railway, the Highland Railway and the Caledonian Railway. All of these companies, and several more promoters besides, were anxious to have their proposals adopted by Parliament and ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì funded from the taxpayers‚Äô purse. History In 1890, six lines connecting the west of north Scotland to the central spine were to be considered by a Parliamentary Commission. These were: * the extension of the Dingwall and Skye Railway from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh * the extension of the West Highland line from Banavie to Mallaig * a line from Garve to Ullapool, leading from the Dingwall and Skye Railway * from Achnasheen to Aultbea, also leading from the Dingwall and Skye Railway * from Lairg to Laxford, leading from the Far North Line * from Culrain to Lochinver, also leading from the Far North Line All six lines were designed to open up access to new or established fishing ports and/or passenger-boat ports on the west coast. Proposal and Route The specific plan for the Garve and Ullapool Railway was first proposed in January 1889 by local landowners in the Lochbroom and Assynt area, who formally invited the Highland Railway to construct a line to Ullapool. The proposal was backed by Sir John Fowler, engineer in charge of the building of the Forth Bridge, and a number of local MPs and luminaries. The Highland Line company was not enthusiastic, since it had its own plans to drive a line through to Kyle of Lochalsh and was prepared to invest ¬£120,000 to do so; but it agreed to conduct a brief survey, which was undertaken in July 1889, at a cost of ¬£80. The route laid out on the plans Murdoch Paterson & C.R.Manners ‚Äì Garve and Ullapool Railway ‚Äì Bound Plans, Sections and Books of Reference: National Records of Scotland - ref RHP916 showed the line branching off the Dingwall to Skye line about east of Garve station, at a height of around . It then led in a north-westerly direction, following the right (south/west) bank of the Black Water river (in essence, parallelling the route of the modern A835 road); it then passed through the glen at Glascarnoch (note that Loch Glascarnoch did not exist then ‚Äì it is a man-made loch created in the mid-1950s ), rising to and continued as far as Braemore Lodge (where the A832 road now branches off). A steep descent of in the space of - a challenging gradient of 1-in-26 - would have been required to bring the line to sea-level at the head of Loch Broom; but the engineers instead planned to construct a tunnel through the hillside on the west side of the descent, and then descend to the mouth of the River Broom, after which the line would follow the coast as far as Ullapool. The terminus would have been at the junction of Shore Street and Quay Street, at the end of the pier. The total measured distance was just over (to be precise: thirty-three miles five furlongs four chains and fifty links). An original suggestion by the proposers for an onward route between Ullapool and Lochinver was never surveyed or planned in any detail. Quest for Backers The Garve and Ullapool Railway Act, 1890, of the Westminster Parliament received Royal Assent on 14 August 1890. In the papers relating to this Act, the proprietors of the proposed railway were named as : Lady Mary Matheson of the Lews (widow of James Matheson, 1st Baronet, and owner of the Isle of Lewis and most of Ullapool); Donald Matheson; Major Duncan Matheson; John Arthur Fowler (Sir John‚Äôs son); and Major James Houston; and the directors were named all of these except for Lady Matheson. Sir John Fowler was to be Consulting Engineer. The Crofters Party MP for Ross & Cromarty, Dr Roderick Macdonald, also backed the scheme. The cost of construction was estimated at ¬£240,000. The Parliamentary Commission of 1890 delayed in reporting its findings. In the interim, it was clear that the Highland Railway had been lobbying hard in Westminster, proposing that a grant of ¬£45,000 from central funds would allow the extension from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh to be built. The backers of the Garve line were aware to Highland Railway‚Äôs reluctance, and met with the Great North of Scotland Railway board to suggest that it took over the construction and running of the line. In the summer of 1891, a new Private Bill was proposed at Westminster to transfer arrangements for the construction and running of the line from the Highland Railway to the Great North of Scotland company. The Commission of Inquiry published its report in the summer of 1891, recommending that the best option of the original six was the extension of the line from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh. The backers of the Ullapool line and local MPs were highly critical of this decision ‚Äì noting amongst other things that there were glaring factual errors concerning the navigability of Loch Broom, and hence obstacles to establishing Ullapool as a port. But their protests were to no avail. Despite a belated attempt by the Great North of Scotland company to adopt the scheme, by Private Bill on 31 May 1892, the scheme could attract no further political or financial interest. In June 1893, an Act was passed, authorising the extension of the line from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh; this was shortly followed by a Local Act, dated 24 August 1893, which finally abandoned the Ullapool proposal. Further Proposals and Legacy Although further railway-line extensions were authorised during the 1890s ‚Äì and partly as a result of these - a Light Railways Act was passed in 1896, which encouraged the development of light railways on the west coast and the islands. John Arthur Fowler proposed that the Garve and Ullapool Railway be considered as one project under this Act and offered it again to the Highland Railway to run. The Highland Railway replied that it would do so only if Fowler raised the capital to build it ‚Äì which he was unable to do. In 1901, Major Blunt-Mackenzie (husband of the Countess of Cromartie) proposed building the line as a 'tram-way', to support the west coast fisheries; but could get no financial backing for the scheme from the Government-backed Congested Districts Board.Correspondence of the Congested Districts Board : National Records of Scotland - ref AF42/1026 Towards the end of the First World War, the Secretary of State for Scotland, Robert Munro set up the Rural Transport (Scotland) Committee, a commission to recommend improvements to the poor road, rail and sea transport facilities in Scotland. The commission invited applications from County Councils and local interest groups, for consideration of proposals. A local committee was set up in Ullapool, and made a strong case for the building of the Garve and Ullapool Railway.Unpublished Minutes of the Lochbroom Executive Committee, Ullapool March 1918 to September 1919 ‚Äì Ullapool Museum The Rural Transport Committee was duly impressed and, when its report appeared in April 1919, it recommended that the railway be constructed, completely funded by the government.Report of the Rural Transport (Scotland) Committee, HMSO Edinburgh 1919 But, along with many other schemes and radical proposals made by the Committee, nothing happened. In 1945, Commander Vyner, a local Ullapool landowner, tried to persuade the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) to build and run the railway. The LMS estimated the cost to be ¬£1 million and refused to have anything to do with the scheme.Minutes of the Scottish Committee of the LMS, 18 Sep 1945 - National Records of Scotland - ref BR/LMS/1/142 The construction of the line from Garve to Ullapool was imagined in a novel by Andrew Drummond (An Abridged History‚Ä¶) in 2004.

She primarily plays as an attacking midfielder but was also deployed as a defensive midfielder in the Under-20s National team. She is known for her vision, passing, all round technical ability, and her ability to play and score with both feet. On 16 July 2018, Sayer received her first call up to the Matildas, the senior Australian Women's Team, for the 2018 Tournament of Nations.  Early life and education  Born in Sydney, Australia, Sayer grew up in Northern Sydney, where she later attended Barker College. She was granted special permission to not attend classes due to her international team commitments and playing for Canberra United during the W-League season.  Club career  Sayer began her youth career at Northbridge FC (now known as North Shore Mariners), as well as playing futsal and football at the FNSW Institute. Several clubs were interested in signing Sayer for the 2016 W-League season, however due to her age, she decided to stay closer to home, signing for Sydney University on a youth contract. Canberra United signed several young talents to play in the 2017 W-League season. Sayer joined the club after some impressive performances for the Australian National U-20 Women's Team, along with teammates Georgia Plessas, Georgia Boric, Clare Hunt and Karly Roestbakken. On 25 November, Amy Sayer scored her first goal in the country's top division in a 3‚Äì2 home win against Perth Glory at McKellar Park. Sayer finished the season with one goal in 10 appearances, as well as being deployed in various positions such as an attacking midfielder and a left winger by manager Heather Garriock. Sayer signed for Sydney FC on 4 September 2018 after one season at Canberra United in the W-League. On 3 November, she scored her maiden goal for her new club in her first appearance. On 9 November 2018, Sayer was diagnosed with a stress fracture in her right foot. She was withdrawn from the Australia squad for the Seven Consulting Series against Chile, and was ruled out for at least 12 weeks. Her next appearance in a football match will be in January 2019, at the earliest.  International career  Sayer made her international youth debut on 25 August 2016, in a 28‚Äì0 demolition of Palestine, played at Vietnam. She marked her debut with one goal and seven assists in the first half of the match. She followed the first cap with three more dominating displays against Hong Kong (14‚Äì0), Iraq (8‚Äì0) and Vietnam (6‚Äì0). At the age of 14 years old, Sayer earned her first call up to the U-20 squad for the AFC Pre-Qualifiers in November 2016. She made two appearances in two games, playing full minutes and scoring two goals. Following her debut tournament, Sayer was reselected in the Young Matilda's squad for the friendly series against USA and Canada in July 2017, and for the 2017 AFC Qualification Tournament held in China where she made four more appearances in the group stage and final series. She made another appearance in the 2018 friendly match against Thailand where she scored one goal. On 16 July 2018, Alen Stajcic called up Sayer to the Senior Matildas squad to participate in the Tournament of Nations in USA after impressing in her maiden W-League season in with 10 appearances. She earned her first international cap as a 93rd-minute substitute in the 2018 Tournament of Nations against Japan. Sayer was called up to the Matildas squad for the second time to play matches against France and England in October 2018. She came on as a substitute against France but couldn't salvage a 2-0 defeat, while she started the second match against England in a 1-1 draw following a last minute header from Claire Polkinghorne. Later in October, Sayer joined the Young Matildas on their trip to Lebanon, to play Mongolia, Lebanon and Hong Kong. She scored a hat-trick in the 18-0 demolition of Mongolia, while an assist and a goal against Lebanon and one assist with a brace against Hong Kong, converting the first from the penalty spot, and the second from outside the box. On 9 November 2018, Sayer withdrew from the Matildas squad in the two-match series against Chile after a stress fracture diagnosis. She will be out for a minimum of 12 weeks  Style of Play  An attacking midfielder and playmaker, Sayer is adept at finding quality forward passes and likes to combine with others for quick passing moves rather than carrying the ball too often. While Sayer is an excellent athlete, her style draws more on her technical range, vision and creativity and she would prefer to play an incisive pass or use one touch passing combinations to beat a player ‚Äì rather than looking to rely on speed in a footrace. In the front third she is an increasingly unpredictable and dangerous attacker as she adds more variety to her attacking style ‚Äì while she is naturally inclined to look for a clever through pass or combination play to attack the opponent's penalty box, she is equally capable of scoring from range on either foot and is demonstrating this more and more with some eye- catching long distance goals at club and international level.

Son of Timothy and Anastasia Conway and brother to 6 siblings, 5 brothers and 1 sister. Mr William Conway was a member of the Irish Republican Army and among the founders of the Young Ireland Hurling Club.  Background  His father was a farmer. William Conway joined the IRA as a member of the North Tipperary IRA from 1917 to 1919. He came to Dublin and worked as a barman with his brother James near Lower Mount Street where they rented a place. Once in Dublin, he joined the branch of G Company 3rd Battalion of the Dublin Brigade. While working in Mount Street and met Sean Hyde who came into his shop. They discussed the spies, or the Murder Gang, on Mount Street.  Bloody Sunday (22 Lower Mount Street)  On 22 November 1921, his lodgings were raided by the military over the Bloody Sunday murders. The raiding party found pamphlets (illegal) a first aid kit, filed dressings, some maps, and a compass. He was arrested with his brother Jim and taken to the bridewell RIC barracks. During a police lineup on 1 December he was identified by Nellie Stapleton, a witness and maid at 22 Lower Mount Street, as being one of the people she saw during the assassination of Lieutenant Angliss. He was charged with Murder. On 15 December he was taken to Kilmainham Gaol along with 3 other suspects Frank Teeling, Edward Potter, and Daniel Healy.  Kilmainham Gaol escape  On the night of 14 February 1921, a daring escape from Kilmainham Gaol was masterminded by Michael Collins and his command. Frank Teeling, Ernie O‚ÄôMalley, and Simon Donnelly escaped from the Gaol on the pretext of a transfer order, and after some guards were bribed. After Frank Teeling escaped, William Conway, who said he was in the cell next door told of the incident is a letter to the pensions board statement, that he took Frank Teeling's overcoat from his cell when he heard that bloodhounds were being brought in to search for the prisoners; thus removing the scent for the dogs. Following the prisoner escape by Frank Teeling from Kilmainham Jail on 14 February, the Under Secretary James MacMahon hastily arranged under curfew, for the transfer of 24 high risk prisoners including Conway to Mountjoy Jail during the night of 16 February 1921.  Lower Mount Street trial  The Bloody Sunday trial for the Lower Mount Street murders began on the 25 January 1921, and ended on 31 January. The whole of Ireland were enthralled by the trial with most Irish newspapers and international newspapers reporting it. During the trial William Conway vigorously protested his innocence saying that he was at 9am Sunday mass in Westmoreland Street. One controversial thing came to light recently when a lawyer for the defence, Vincent Rice, wrote to the Bureau of Military history stating that a witness had seen Conway with his brother at about 8.50am walking on the way to mass. This statement was not shared by the prosecution at the time. William Conway was convicted of the murder of Lieutenant Angliss along with Frank Teeling, and Edward Potter. Two of the defendants were identified by a witness, a British Army Lieutenant called Mr. \\"C\\". The 3 were given sentences of death by hanging. Daniel Healy was tried separately and was found not guilty.  Parliamentary Pressure  A parliamentary question was asked by William Lunn MP in the House of Commons, with regard to doubts about William Conway's (and Edward Potter) conviction for the murder of Lieutenant Angliss. This being due to the two witnesses being of unreliable character. Mr. Lunn asked the Chief Secretary whether William Conway and Edward Potter were convicted of the murder of Lieutenant Angliss on the evidence of two witnesses; whether one of these witnesses was a servant in the house, whose account of the tragedy was excusably confused and contradictory; whether the other witness admitted that he was frequently drunk; whether he had been charged with disorderly conduct and also with assault and obscene language; and whether he had previously identified as having been concerned with the murder of Lieutenant Angliss two men who were subsequently proved to have been in gaol at the time? A second parliamentary question was asked by John Swan MP to the Chief Secretary of Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood, about the 15 witnesses at Conway's trial who were brought forward to prove William Conway's alibi that he was not present during the murder of Lieutenant Angliss on November 20th 1920. Mr. John Swan MP asked the Chief Secretary whether at the court-martial which convicted Conway and Potter of the murder of Lieutenant Angliss 15 witnesses were brought to prove an alibi for Conway and seven to prove that Potter was in bed at the time? Sir. Hamar Greenwood (the Chief Secretary of Ireland) The answer is in the affirmative. Over a month later, William Conway and Edward Potter had their sentences commuted to penal servitude on 6 March 1921. He was later transferred to various prisons in England, including Dartmoor, Portland, and Frongoch in Wales.  Aftermath  Following the amnesty of December 1921 he returned to Ireland. As an early member of the GAA he remained a faithful organiser of the Irish National sport. Notably he was also a playing member of Faughs and Grocer's Club. The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave attended his burial at Deans Grange Cemetery in 1976. William Conway was given full military honours with a 21 gun salute from the Irish Army at his funeral.
