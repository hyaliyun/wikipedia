These decisions principally include the temporary imposition on a target of economic, trade, diplomatic, cultural or other restrictions (sanctions measures) that are lifted when the motivating security concerns no longer apply, or when no new threats have arisen. According to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, only the UN Security Council has a mandate by the international community to apply sanctions (Article 41) that must be complied with by all UN member states (Article 2,2). They serve as the international community's most powerful peaceful means to prevent threats to international peace and security or to settle them. Sanctions do not include the use of military force. However, if sanctions do not lead to the diplomatic settlement of a conflict, the use of force can be authorized by the Security Council separately under Article 42. UN sanctions should not be confused with unilateral sanctions that are imposed by individual countries in furtherance of their strategic interests. Typically intended as strong economic coercion, measures applied under unilateral sanctions can range between coercive diplomatic efforts, economic warfare, or as preludes to war. There are several types of sanctions. *Economic sanctions ‚Äì typically a ban on trade, possibly limited to certain sectors such as armaments, or with certain exceptions (such as food and medicine)Haidar, J.I., 2015.\\"Sanctions and Exports Deflection: Evidence from Iran,\\" Paris School of Economics, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Mimeo *Diplomatic sanctions ‚Äì the reduction or removal of diplomatic ties, such as embassies. *Military sanctions ‚Äì military intervention *Sport sanctions ‚Äì preventing one country's people and teams from competing in international events. *Sanctions on Environment ‚Äì since the declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, international environmental protection efforts have been increased gradually. Economic sanctions are distinguished from trade sanctions, which are applied for purely economic reasons, and typically take the form of tariffs or similar measures, rather than bans on trade. Types Reasons for sanctioning Sanctions formulations are designed into three categories. The categories are used to differentiate between the political contexts due to the global nature of the act. The first category involves such sanctions that are designed to force cooperation with international law. This can be seen in the sanctions placed on Iraq in Resolution 661 on August 6, 1990, after the initial invasion of neighboring Kuwait. The United Nations placed an embargo on the nation in an attempt to prevent armed conflict. Resolution 665 and Resolution 670 were further added creating both naval and air blockade on Iraq. The purpose of the initial sanctions was to coerce Iraq into following international law, which included the recognized sovereignty of Kuwait. The second category of design is those sanctions with the purpose to contain a threat to peace within a geographical boundary. The 2010 Iran nuclear proliferation debate is a contemporary example. The current United Nations Security Council passed on June 9, Resolution 1929 providing restrictions on missile and weaponry materials that could be used for the creation of destructive weapons.\\"Should the United Nations Security Council Impose Additional Sanctions on Iran Due to Its Nuclear Program?\\" CONS. (2010). International Debates, 8(9), 41‚Äì48. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. This principle of restriction is to contain the possibility of Iranian aggression within the neighboring region. The third category involves the United Nations Security Councils condemnation of actions of a specific action or policy of a member/non-member nation. The white minority declared Rhodesian Independence on November 11, 1965. The General assemble and United Nations in a 107 to 2 vote took to condemning Rhodesia on all military, economic, as well as oil and petroleum products. The international display of disapproval forced sanctions onto the Rhodesian people, but without a clear goal as to a remedy for the economic sanctions. The three categories are a blanket explanation on the reasons sanctions are applied to nations, but it does not go as far as to say that voting members share the same political reasons for imposing them. It is often the case for many nations to be driven by self-interests in one or more categories when voting on whether or not to implement sanctions. Diplomatic sanctions Diplomatic sanctions are political measures taken to express disapproval or displeasure at a certain action through diplomatic and political means, rather than affecting economic or military relations. Measures include limitations or cancellations of high-level government visits or expelling or withdrawing diplomatic missions or staff. Economic sanctions Economic sanctions can vary from imposing import duties on goods to, or blocking the export of certain goods from the target country, to a full naval blockade of the target's ports in an effort to verify, and curb or block specified imported goods. Well known examples of economic sanctions include: * Napoleon's Continental System of 1806‚Äì1814, directed against British trade * the United Nations sanctions against South Africa * United Nations sanctions against Zimbabwe * United Nations sanctions against Iraq (1990‚Äì2003) * the United States embargo against Cuba Since 1993 many countries have imposed trade sanctions on Burma (Myanmar). The case of South Africa gives rise to the typical example used for arguing for the effectiveness of sanctions, though that alleged effectiveness remains a matter of debate. In 2001/2002 the United States imposed economic sanctions against the state of Zimbabwe, through the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 or ZDERA, , vetoing or voting against access to financing, debt relief and rescheduling, and forcing the Zimbabwean government to operate on a cash-only basis. On August 2, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that grouped together sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.\\"Senate overwhelmingly passes new Russia and Iran sanctions\\". The Washington Post. 15 June 2017. Military sanctions Similarly military sanctions can range from carefully targeted military strikes to degrade a nation's conventional or non-conventional capabilities, to the less aggressive form of an arms embargo to cut off supplies of arms or dual-use items. Sport sanctions Sport sanctions are used as a way of psychological warfare, intended to crush the morale of the general population of the target country. Sports sanctions were imposed as part of the international sanctions against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 1992‚Äì1995, enacted by UN Security Council by resolution 757. The Gleneagles Agreement approved by the Commonwealth of Nations in 1977, committed member nations to discourage contact and competition between their sportsmen and sporting organisations, teams or individuals from South Africa. However, it was not binding and unable to stop events such as the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa or the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand. Sanctions on individuals The United Nations Security Council can implement sanctions on political leaders or economic individuals. These persons usually find ways of evading their sanction because of political connections within their nation. Sanctions on Environment The sanctions on environment include both economic and political issues such as trade since these are all interdependent. The trade barriers and restrictions on trade are the key factors since they are engaged with the problems of endangered species, ozone- depleting chemicals and environmental laws. Although the sanctions and laws regarding the environment are relatively new, recent concerns over the environmental issues encouraged individuals and governments to actively cooperate in dealing the problems. Sanctions in international law It is sometimes claimed that sanctions imposed by single countries or by an intergovernmental body like the United Nations are \\"illegal\\" or \\"criminal\\" due to, in the case of economic sanctions, the right to development or, in the case of military sanctions, the Right of self-defense. A 1996 report by International Progress Organization criticized sanctions as \\"an illegitimate form of collective punishment of the weakest and poorest members of society, the infants, the children, the chronically ill, and the elderly\\". Support for use Sanctions have long been the subject of controversy as scholars question their effects on citizens, the level of ethnocentrism involved when designing and implementing sanctions, and the possibility of ineffectiveness. Supporters of sanctions argue that regardless of sanctions' effects on a group of people, those citizens were most likely already being oppressed by their government. Supporters also argue that sanctions are the best alternative international tool, as opposed to taking no action, and that in the absence of sanctions, oppressive regimes have no incentive to reform. On the side of opposition, it is asserted that sanctions are a way to promote nationalistic values and diminish the culture of a state. In counterargument, support is argued on the basis that something must be done and democratic peace theory is cited as sound reasoning despite any possible cultural insensitivity. In the case of the United States, it is important to note that the US has little to lose, in regards to public perception, as many around the world already have a distaste for American international policy and actions. In regards to the effectiveness of the sanctions, supporters concede that multilateral sanctions have been found to work 33% of the time. There are several ways to remove and dissolve sanctions that have been imposed on a nation(s). In some cases, such as those imposed on Iraq in 1990, only a new resolution can be used to lift the sanctions. This is done when no provision is put in the resolution for the lifting of sanctions. This is generally only done if the sanctioned party has shown willingness to adopt certain conditions of the Security Council. Another way sanctions can be lifted is when time limits are implemented with the initial sanction. After an extended duration, the sanction will eventually be lifted off the nation, with or without cooperation. The practice of time limitations has grown over the years and allows for a gradual removal of restrictions on nations conforming, at least in part, to conditions imposed by sanctioning bodies, such as the U.N. Security Council.

Founded in 1997, it had formerly been Militant, an entryist group in the Labour Party from 1964 to 1991, which became Militant Labour from 1991 until 1997.  History  The Socialist Party was formerly the Militant group which practised entryism in the Labour Party around the Militant newspaper. Founded in 1964, the Militant newspaper described itself as the \\"Marxist voice of Labour and Youth\\". In the 1980s, Militant supporters Dave Nellist, Pat Wall and Terry Fields were elected to the House of Commons as Labour MPs. In 1982, Liverpool District Labour Party adopted Militant's policies for Liverpool City Council in its battle against cuts in the rate support grant from government, and came into conflict with the Conservative government. In 1989‚Äì1990, Militant led the All-Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, which organised a non- payment campaign against the poll tax. Terry Fields was jailed for refusing to pay the poll tax and expelled from the Labour Party for defying the law. The Labour Party had earlier found Militant guilty of operating as an entryist group, contrary to the party's constitution. In 1991, there was a debate within Militant as to whether to continue working within the Labour Party, centred around whether they could still effectively operate in the party following the expulsions. The poll tax campaign also suggested that there was more to be gained as an open organisation than inside the Labour Party. At a special conference, 93% of delegates voted for the Open Turn. A minority around Ted Grant broke away to form Socialist Appeal in the Labour Party. Operating as an \\"open party\\" was first undertaken in Scotland with Scottish Militant Labour, standing Tommy Sheridan for election from his jail cell.This initiative would eventually lead to the foundation of the Scottish Socialist Alliance. The majority of Scottish members, after forming the Scottish Socialist Party, left the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI ‚Äì the international socialist organisation which the Socialist Party is affiliated to) in early 2001 as the Scottish majority moved away from traditional Trotskyist politics. The CWI in Scotland now works as part of Solidarity ‚Äì Scotland's Socialist Movement. The group became Militant Labour in 1991, after leaving the Labour Party. The journal Militant International Review, founded in 1969, became a monthly publication and was renamed Socialism Today in 1995.Fighting for socialism: One hundred issues, by the editor, Lynn Walsh. Retrieved 2007-07-29 In 1997, Militant Labour changed its name to the Socialist Party, and the Militant newspaper was renamed The Socialist. In 2018, the Socialist Party created a faction in the CWI in opposition to the Irish and other sections. On 21 July 2019, a Special Congress of the Socialist Party passed a motion, by a vote of 173 to 35, which resolved to sponsor the international faction conference taking place from 22‚Äì25 July in London and to support all efforts to ensure the continuation of a principled revolutionary international. 130 members of the SP who had left the Socialist Party to form Socialist Alternative.  Political views   Minimum wage of ¬£10 an hour  Obtaining higher wages for workers is a central policy objective of the Socialist Party. In 2014, 17 front-page headlines of The Socialist focused on wages. On 16 July 2014, The Socialist front-page headline stated \\"Raise the minimum wage: ¬£10 NOW\\". The front page quoted the General Secretary of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, Ronnie Draper, calling for \\"a minimum wage of ¬£10 now\\". The call for a ¬£10 an hour minimum wage, the front page explains through a second quote, was inspired by the \\"historic victory of the $15 minimum wage in Seattle\\". On 24 September 2014, the front page, carrying the slogan \\"We need ¬£10 an hour now!\\", states: \\"As a result of a Bakers' Union motion, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) adopted the ¬£10 demand at its recent conference\\".  Unemployment and youth  In 2011, the Socialist Party gave prominent support to the Jarrow March for Jobs, a 330-mile march from Jarrow in South Tyneside to London to highlight youth unemployment, supported by several MPs, eight trade unionsMarching for a Future ‚Äì We have received the support of eight national trade unions ‚Äì Unite, UCU, Bectu, CWU, TSSA, RMT, PCS and the FBU and the Daily Mirror newspaper. Kevin Maguire, associate editor of the Mirror, spoke at the Jarrow launch rally, following the Socialist Party's Coventry councillor Dave Nellist, as featured on a number of Socialist Party videos about the event. The Jarrow march featured prominently at the Socialist Party's Socialism 2011 weekend event in November 2011, which coincided with the marchers' arrival in London. = Youth Fight for Jobs = The Socialist Party's first issue of 2010, headlined \\"Rage Against Unemployment\\" and written by Youth Fight for Jobs national organiser Sean Figg, who took part in the Jarrow March for Jobs, argues that young people are likely to suffer \\"permanent psychological scars\\" from unemployment. Figg calls for the right to a \\"decent job for all\\", with a \\"living wage\\" of at least ¬£8 an hour, and an end to university fees. Figg demands that the government \\"bail out young people\\" as it had the banks, stating that \\"capitalist politicians\\" will claim the cost would be \\"too high\\". = Socialist Students = The National Union of Students‚Äô NEC voted \\"to stand in complete solidarity with workers taking strike action\\" in the 2014 strike on 3 December in higher and further education as a result of an Emergency Motion passed by NUS NEC, which was moved by Socialist Party and Socialist Students NUS NEC member, Edmund Schluessel.

It opposes both terrorism and also the war on terror. It joined the protests against the Group of Eight (G8) meetings as part of the Committee for a Workers' International. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York in September 2001, Peter Taaffe, the Socialist Party's general secretary, writing in the Socialist Party's newspaper The Socialist, states:  Nationalisation  In December 2009, the Socialist Party demanded what it called \\"socialist nationalisation\\" as the only way to save the manufacturing industry.Editorial, The Socialist, \\"Socialist nationalisation ‚Äì the only way to save manufacturing jobs and end the bank bonus scandal\\", 9 December 2009 This marks a response by the Socialist Party to the nationalisation of major banks by the Labour Government, beginning with the nationalisation of Northern Rock in February 2008. In the 'What we stand for' column of The Socialist, its weekly paper, the Socialist Party calls for \\"a socialist government to take into public ownership the top 150 companies and banks that dominate the British economy, and run them under democratic working-class control and management. Compensation to be paid only on the basis of proven need.\\" The Socialist Party thus defines its \\"socialist\\" nationalisation to include at least three distinct features: no compensation except on the basis of proven need; democratic workers' control and management; and that the nationalised industries should be part of a \\"plan of production\\". = Banks = In an end of year statement on the December 2009 Pre-budget, an article under the name of the Socialist Party deputy general secretary, Hannah Sell, indicated the Socialist Party's response to the banking nationalisations.'Stop the slaughter of jobs and services', Hannah Sell, http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/campaign/Workplace_and_TU_campaigns/8631 Sell argued that the trade unions should demand \\"nationalisation of all the major financial institutions\\", with compensation paid only to small shareholders and depositors on the basis of proven need. However Sell added that this should be just a first step to the \\"unification of all the banks into one democratically controlled financial system\\" and called for the introduction of a state monopoly of foreign trade. On workers' control and management, Sell argues that a nationalised finance sector could be \\"run by and for the mass of the population\\". She suggests that this could be done through \\"majority representation\\" at all levels. Representatives are to be drawn from workers in the banking unions, \\"and the wider working class and labour movement\\", and some also the government.  Internationalism  Socialist Party on the anti-G8 demonstration in Edinburgh The Socialist Party believes that socialism can only be realised on an international basis: In accordance with a perceived need for internationalism, the Socialist Party is a member of the refounded Committee for a Workers' International, an organisation of Trotskyist political parties from across the globe.  Critique of the Soviet Union  The Socialist Party argues that the Soviet Union was not socialist: \\"the regimes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were not genuinely socialist, but a grotesque caricature\\".Socialism in the 21st Century p. 45 Its analysis follows that of Leon Trotsky, who, with Vladimir Lenin and others, led the October 1917 Russian revolution. The Socialist Party argues that neither Lenin nor Trotsky wished to establish an isolated socialist state. They argue that Lenin, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks defended and advanced the gains of the revolution of February 1917 by carrying through the October revolution. They emphasise Lenin and Trotsky's call on workers in the advanced capitalist countries to carry through the socialist transformation of society. This, they say, would have been a step towards the goal of a world socialist federation and would have seen those countries come to the aid of the economically and industrially underdeveloped Russia. However, this was not successful and the advanced capitalist countries invaded, blockaded and imposed trade sanctions on the young workers' state. The Socialist Party agrees with Trotsky that the isolated Russian revolution inevitably \\"degenerated\\" under Stalin into a bureaucratic dictatorship. In this and many other ways, the Socialist Party's policies may therefore be termed orthodox Trotskyism.  Electoral strategy and alliances  The Socialist Party argues that the Labour Party under the leadership of Tony Blair and since \\"has deprived the working people in Britain of any kind of political representation\\"Socialism in the 21st Century p. 10 and campaigns for a new mass party of the working class based on the trade unions and the working class movement. It argues that political representatives such as Members of Parliament should only receive the \\"average workers wage\\", and its parliamentary candidates would only take the average wage of a skilled worker, if elected, in the same way that Labour MPs who supported Militant (the forerunner of the Socialist Party) ‚Äì Terry Fields, Dave Nellist and Pat Wall ‚Äì did in the 1980s. In elections, when not standing as part of an alliance, the Socialist Party fields candidates as Socialist Alternative. The right to stand under the name Socialist Party was won by the Socialist Party of Great Britain, which was founded in 1904.  Socialist Alliance  In the 1990s, the Socialist Party was one of the founders of the local Socialist Alliance groups, which joined together as a national network in 1999. In 2001, the organisation was transformed from a federal body into a one-member-one-vote political party. The Socialist Party opposed this change in structure, arguing that it allowed the single largest group in the alliance, the SWP, to control it. It could also mean that local Social Alliances affiliated to the national body had, in effect, to expel any members who declined to join the Socialist Alliance party. As a result, the Socialist Party left the alliance late that year. The Socialist Alliance itself was dissolved in 2005, following its merger with Respect. In February 2005, the Socialist Party announced plans to contest the 2005 parliamentary elections as part of a new electoral alliance called the Socialist Green Unity Coalition (SGUC). Several former components of the Socialist Alliance that did not join Respect also joined the SGUC. Following the local elections in 2007, the Socialist Party had two councillors in St. Michael's in Coventry, and two in Telegraph Hill ward in Lewisham, South London. A member of the party was also elected in Huddersfield but stood under the Save Huddersfield NHS party banner. In the local elections of 2010, however, the party lost one of the two councillors in Coventry and both councillors in Lewisham.  Campaign for a New Workers' Party  At its annual Socialism event in November 2005, the Socialist Party formally launched the Campaign for a New Workers' Party along with other socialists, left activists and trade unionists with the aim of persuading individuals, campaigners and trade unions to help set up and back a new broad left alternative to New Labour that would fight for working class people. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT union) held a conference in January 2006 to address what it calls \\"the crisis in working class representation\\" in which Socialist Party councillor and Campaign for a New Workers' Party chair Dave Nellist was invited to speak. Most of the speakers were in favour of a broad left alternative to New Labour. The remaining speakers, such as MP John McDonnell, wished it well. The Campaign for a New Workers' Party held a conference on 19 March 2006, which was attended by around 1,000 people, to formally launch the Campaign for a New Workers' Party. At the 2008 CNWP conference a discussion forum was hosted by the campaign which was addressed by RMT general secretary Bob Crow, PCS Vice- President John McInally, Socialist Party councillor Dave Nellist, Labour left Simeon Andrew and RESPECT representative Rob Hoveman.  No2EU  In March 2009, the Socialist Party was invited to participate in No to EU ‚Äì Yes to Democracy, a left-wing alter-globalisation coalition by the RMT union leader Bob Crow, for the 2009 European Parliament elections. No2EU received 153,236 votes or 1% of the national vote. This alliance then developed into the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.  Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition  Supporters of the No2EU electoral challenge entered discussions on a continued electoral alliance and in January 2010 the formation of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) was announced in time to contest the 2010 general election.Launch of Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, The Socialist, 12 January 2010 The Scotsman newspaper named Bob Crow as the coalition's leader.New socialist party led by union veteran Bob Crow to fight general election, The Scotsman, 14 January 2010. According to the Scotsman, policies include: \\"commitment to public ownership of industry, banking and utilities; a promise not to implement cuts in public services; an end to public bail-outs of the banking industry; improved trade union rights; and an end to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\\". The 38 TUSC candidates who ran in the elections pooled 12,275 votes. The four Socialist Party candidates who still stood under the name Socialist Alternative received an additional 3,298 votes.Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition#Candidates and results The party lost its only remaining Councillor, Dave Nellist, in the 2012 elections to Coventry City Council.\\"Labour win but come under fire from axed Nellist\\". In March 2013 Joe Robinson, a Socialist Party member standing as TUSC, won a Maltby Town Council by-election. A second TUSC supporter & Socialist Party member, Shaun Barratt was elected unopposed as a town councillor on 27 March 2014. On 30 April 2014, the Socialist Party reported that the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) \\"will be fielding 561 candidates in the local elections on 22 May\\". It terms the TUSC election challenge of the May 2014 council elections \\"the biggest left of Labour electoral challenge since World War Two\\". No candidates were elected. At its annual congress in February 2015, the Socialist Party discussed TUSC's target of standing 100 parliamentary candidates and 1000 council candidates. Achieving this target should secure a TV broadcast. By the end of February 2015, 95 TUSC parliamentary candidates had been approved by the TUSC steering committee, with more expected, six of which were standing in the Independent newspaper's top 100 marginal constituencies against sitting Labour MPs. On 25 February 2015, the United Left, a broad left caucus within Unite the Union, wrote an open letter to Socialist Party members in Unite appealing for them to withdraw from standing against the Labour Party in marginal constituencies in the 2015 general election. Signed by the Chair and vice chair of the Unite Executive Councils and a number of regional chairs, the letter accused the Socialist Party of having a \\"derisory\\" electoral record, gaining coverage in the Morning Star newspaper. In response, the Socialist Party claimed that a Labour government \\"would be at best austerity-lite and a continuation of the crisis that faces working-class people. This prospect has led to a fracturing of politics.\\" The Socialist Party's reply pointed out that \\"we are part of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) that also comprises the RMT in an official capacity, representing its 80,000 members, and other leading trade unionists from PCS, Unite, NUT and the POA as well as other socialist organisations and individuals\\". Asking \\"why is this letter necessary?\\" if its efforts were derisory, the Socialist Party nevertheless appealed to the United Left to \\"enter a dialogue\\" with TUSC's steering committee about any threatened Labour Party MPs they feel are likely to represent Unite's members interests in parliament. The final count for TUSC candidates is 135 parliamentary and 619 council.  Transitional demands  The Socialist Party's demand for nationalisation and its longstanding practice of running in elections has led some critics to label the Socialist Party as reformist, though the party argues that its method is based on Trotsky's Transitional ProgrammeFor instance, see the debate between the Socialist Party's Lynn Walsh and a critic at \\"\\"Marxism and the state: an exchange\\". and that this demand would lead to the socialist transformation of society with a \\"socialist plan of production ... to meet the needs of all\\" whilst \\"protecting our environment\\". Critics from within the Trotskyist tradition have sometimes argued that the Socialist Party misunderstands Trotsky's Transitional Programme. Since transitional demands are an attempt to link today's struggles with the struggle for socialism, critics argue that Trotsky's transitional demand regarding the need for strike committees should be raised and that the Socialist Party should argue for these strike committees to take control of the workplaces. They argue that this is preferable to arguing for nationalisation since nationalisation does not show how workers would reach workers' control of the workplaces. The Socialist Party argues that the sections of Trotsky's Transitional Programme which argue for the \\"expropriation of separate groups of capitalists\\" and of the \\"private banks\\" can be represented as nationalisation as long the demand includes workers' control and management of the nationalised industries. For this reason, the Socialist Party's call for public ownership in the \\"What We Stand For\\" column in The Socialist newspaper is followed by the demand for democratic working class control and management as well as \\"[c]ompensation to be paid on the basis of proven need\\",The Socialist, \\"What we stand For\\", p. 12, 26 June ‚Äì 4 July 2007. as judged by the workers once in control and management of the industry in question. The Socialist Party criticises what it terms the \\"lavish\\" compensation given to the bosses of nationalised industries in the past, and links up the demand for nationalisation to demands for the workers to rely on their own control and management of the nationalised industries, and to the need for the socialist transformation of society itself. It argues that this is a valid modern interpretation of the Transitional Programme's conception.Trotsky, Leon, The Transitional Program for Socialist Revolution, p. 122‚Äì123, Pathfinder Press (1977). At the outset of the 'Name change' debate which led to the establishment of the Socialist Party, Taaffe argued in 1995: \\"To merely repeat statements and formulas, drawn up at one period, but which events have overtaken, is clearly wrong\\" and that it would be fatal \\"to put forward abstract formulas as a substitute for concrete demands, clear slogans, which arise from the experiences of the masses themselves\\". Briefly discussing Trotsky's demands regarding factory committees, Taaffe comments that: \\"The shop stewards committees embody the very idea of 'factory committees' advocated by Trotsky\\".Taaffe, Peter. \\"Our Programme and Transitional Demands\\". Retrieved 26 August 2007.  Organisation  The Socialist Party is a membership based organisation, with branches in localities where it has members. The annual Conference or Congress is the decisive body of the party. Branches send delegates (the number of delegates per branch is proportional to the size of the branch), to regional and national bodies, conferences and decision making annual congresses. At the annual congresses the national organisers have only a consultative vote, and must win support for new policies. The exit from the Labour Party in 1991, and the change of name of Militant Labour to Socialist Party, are two major debates in which a substantial exchange of views took place in a period of discussion and debate at branch, regional and national level, with a number of documents circulated, before a Congress at which the matter was concluded by a vote.For instance, The Open Turn debate After a conference decision, members are generally expected to abide by the views agreed upon, at least publicly, whilst discussion may continue, or be returned to later, within the party until all concerns are addressed. Congress elects a National Committee, which in turn elects an Executive Committee of around a dozen or so members which runs the party on a day-to-day basis. Peter Taaffe is general secretary, and Hannah Sell deputy general secretary. I Areas of responsibility for the executive apart from the development of general policy matters are various campaigning roles, such as NHS, workplace and youth campaigns, together with editorial responsibilities for The Socialist, Socialism Today and other issues such as finance raising. The Socialist Party argues that its method of elections to the National Committee does not promote individuals, but instead is conceived as the selection of a rounded-out team, including both experienced as well as young or less experienced but promising members, together with members from the trade unions and youth and other aspects of the Socialist Party's work. Each geographical region of the Socialist Party is felt to be in need of inclusion. In general, the Executive Committee, after a period of discussion with regional representatives, presents to the National Committee its \\"slate\\" or list of members selected from all aspects of work of the party. After any amendments from the National Committee, this list is proposed by the outgoing National Committee to the annual congress. In general, in presenting the slate to annual congress, the proposed members are listed primarily by region of the country, with an additional list of trade union and youth members, along with other variations from time to time. A session of conference is usually set aside to discuss the slate, with an executive member explaining the reasoning behind the list, and outlining the proposed changes, followed by contributions to the discussion by delegates. Congress can approve, amend or reject the list, proposing an alternative. From time to time in the history of Militant, the forerunner of the Socialist Party, this list has been amended at conference,Crick, Michael, The March of Militant, p.126-28 although in the view of the Socialist Party, the inclusive approach of the consultation process makes this rare, and has not happened at Socialist Party congresses so far. The Socialist Party argues that this method is an example of aspects of genuine democratic centralism, where the widest democratic discussion and debate takes place to attempt to reach agreement before any formal meeting takes place, followed by a meeting and a vote, after which, especially in times of serious struggle, the party is expected to pull together in the direction agreed. In a document written by General Secretary Peter Taaffe in 1996 for the Socialist Party's predecessor Militant Labour, Taaffe suggests that the term \\"democratic centralism\\" has \\"[u]nfortunately ... been partially discredited, the concept mangled and distorted by Stalinism in particular. It has come to mean, for uninformed people, something entirely opposite to its original meaning\\". Taaffe argues that the \\"right-wing Labour leadership who usually hurl insults against the Marxists on the alleged undemocratic character of 'democratic centralism' themselves actually practice an extreme form of 'bureaucratic centralism', as the experience of the witch-hunt against Militant and others on the left in the Labour Party demonstrated\\". Discussing the perceived 'dangers' of democratic centralism, Taaffe has argued that according to Leon Trotsky there are no guarantees in any form of organisation which can guard against malpractice and the form of organisation that a party takes has a material origin that reflects the circumstances it finds itself in as well as how it orientates to them: \\"The regime of a party does not fall ready made from the sky but is formed gradually in the struggle. A political line predominates over the regime.\\" Taaffe has also written that \\"Trotsky then makes a fundamental point: 'Only a correct policy can guarantee a healthy party regime.  Trade union influence  The Socialist Party has a number of members in leading trade union positions, including USDAW President Amy Murphy, PCS Former Assistant General Secretary Chris Baugh former POA General Secretary Brian Caton, current POA Assistant General Secretary Joe Simpson and UNISON NEC member Roger Bannister amongst others. A number of Socialist Party members have also held key positions in workplaces where disputes have taken place, such as Keith Gibson who was elected to the Lindsey Oil Refinery strike committee and Rob Williams who was trade union convenor at the Linamar car parts plant in Swansea, and is now the party's industrial organizer.\\"Even in a slump, strikes and occupations can get results\\". The Guardian. 24 June 2009. On 16 May 2018, PCS President Janice Godrich announced that with the support of PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka she would be standing against fellow Socialist Party member Chris Baugh for the role of Assistant General Secretary. The Socialist Party released a statement describing the move as a \\"divisive step that threatens a split on the left, which can only aid opponents in the union and the Tories and the Blairites outside\\" and that Serwotka \\"has attacked Chris without publicly explaining any differences on industrial or political issues\\".Following this decision a group in PCS, Socialist View, split from the Socialist Party.

If the organization being \\"entered\\" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and subversion to hide the fact that they are an organization in their own right. Definitions Horton (2014) gives the \\"example of entryism ‚Äì the infiltration of a self-proclaimed human rights activist into an institution committed to neoliberalism, a market fundamentalism that has been credited with eroding health systems in dozens of low and middle-income countries.\\"Horton, Richard (2014) Offline: the Kim Doctrine The Lancet, Sep 6, 2014, Vol.384(9946), p.840 Leslie (1999) uses the example of gender: \\"alternative, yet complementary, strategies of 'entryism', with attempts to enter and transform these institutions' gender inequalities from within (as missionaries).\\"Leslie, A. (1999). Missionaries and Mandarins. United Nations Chronicle, 36(2), 82-83. Socialist entryism Trotsky's \\"French Turn\\" The \\"French Turn\\" refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by Leon Trotsky in his essays on \\"The French Turn\\". In June 1934, he proposed for the French Trotskyists to dissolve their Communist League and to join the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and for the Communist League to dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition, and successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists. Proponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the social democratic parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them and then to steer those currents toward Leninism. However, entryism lasted briefly since the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the Workers Party of the United States also successfully used their entry into the Socialist Party of America to recruit their youth group and other members. Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Poland. Entryism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties. Since it was used in France, Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last: * A \\"split perspective\\" is sometimes employed in which the smaller party intends to remain in the larger party for a short period of time, with the intention of splitting the organisation and leaving with more members than it began with. * The entrist tactic can work successfully, in its own terms, over a long period. For example, it was attempted by the Militant tendency in the United Kingdom, whose members worked within the Labour Party from the 1950s onward and managed to get control in the Labour Party Young Socialists and Liverpool City Council before it was expelled in the 1980s. Many other Trotskyist groups have attempted similar feats, but few have gained the influence that the Militant tendency attained (See Militant's Problems of Entrism pamphlet). Deep entryism sui generis In these types of entryism, activists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in the hope of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation. In entryism sui generis (\\"of a special type\\"), Trotskyists, for example, do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party. \\"Deep entryism\\" refers to the long duration. The tactic is closely identified with Michel Pablo and Gerry Healy, who were leaders of the Fourth International in the late 1940s and the 1950s. The \\"deep entry\\" tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the Cold War. In countries with mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as it was to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party. In Europe, that was the approach used, for example, by The Club and later Socialist Action in the Labour Party, and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties. In France, Trotskyist organizations, most notably the Parti des Travailleurs and its predecessors, have successfully entered trade unions and mainstream left-wing parties. Open entryism Some political parties, such as the Workers' Party in Brazil or the Scottish Socialist Party, allow political tendencies to organise within them openly. In those cases, the term \\"entryism\\" is not usually used. Political groups that work within a larger organisation but also maintain a \\"public face\\" often reject the term \\"entryism\\" but are sometimes still considered to be entryists by the larger organization. Examples by country Australia In Australia, the practice was widespread during the 1950s, when the Communist Party of Australia battled against right-wing Industrial Groups for control of Australian trade unions. The 'Groupers' subsequently formed the Democratic Labor Party. Today, the practice in Australia is often known as a type of branch stacking. In 1985, the Nuclear Disarmament Party was split after accusations that it had been infiltrated by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a Trotskyist group.Nic MacLellan, 'The Election and Defection of the NDP', Peace Studies, July 1985, pp 18-19Ken Mansell, 'Making Sense of the NDP Split', Peace Studies, July 1985, pp 19-20Greg Adamson, 'The rise and undermining of anti-nuclear political action ', Green Left Weekly issue 361, 19 May 1999. In recent times, RSPCA Australia has been described as being the victims of the practice. The National Farmers' Federation and Animals Australia have each been accused of infiltrating branches RSPCA Australia in an attempt to promote opposing policies concerning battery hens, intensive pig farming, and the live export of sheep. Since the 2000s, the religious right has practiced entryism into a number of state branches of the Liberal Party of Australia, notably in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria. In 2018, it was revealed that the NSW National party and its youth wing, the Young Nationals had been infiltrated by the far Right with more than 30 members being investigated for alleged links. Leader McCormack denounced the infiltration, and several suspected Far right were expelled from the party and its youth wing.An abridged list of articles discussing Far rigjt infiltration:  Canada Although the term \\"entryism\\" was used little, if at all, opponents accused David Orchard and his supporters of attempting to win the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in the late 1990s and the early 2000s decade with the intention of dramatically changing its policies. Orchard had made his name as a leading opponent of free trade, which was perhaps the singular signature policy of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. While opponents pointed to the remarkable distance, Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented \\"traditional\\" Conservative values and the economic nationalism of the older Conservative Party and the Progressive Conservative Party had espoused before Mulroney, namely under John Diefenbaker. Opponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance also charged Alliance members with infiltration. It was widely speculated that most, if not all, of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the Progressive Conservative Party Party's membership before the merger vote were Alliance members, who likely voted in favour of the merger. Liberals for Life, a pro-life group allied with the Campaign Life Coalition, was accused of infiltrating the Liberal Party of Canada in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Members of Socialist Action, a small Trotskyist group, play a leading role in the New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus, a small faction on the left wing of the social democratic NDP, and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP. That, however, does not fit with most definitions of entryism because of its continued existence apart and separate from the NDP, in addition to its work in it. Fightback, a rival Trotskyist organization, carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP, particularly in its youth wings, and models itself after the British Militant tendency, which practiced entryism into the Labour Party and, at its peak, was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record. After the fall of the Social Credit Party of British Columbia, the British Columbia Liberal Party saw the shift by the joining of former Social Credit members. As a result, the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right in fiscal policy. Thus, entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members. That, however, is not formal entryism since former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party. China During the Northern Expedition in China, the Communist Party of China joined the party of the Nationalist Party of China for a time (1923‚Äì1927), creating the First United Front against warlordism, but one of the Communists' ideas behind doing so was the possibility of eventually gaining a majority in the Nationalist Party and shaping its policies. Eventually, the situation degraded, the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party, and the Chinese Civil War began. The war was paused for a time (1936‚Äì1945) to allow for a Second United Front during the Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule. However, the civil war resumed again and remained active until 1950, after the Communists had won. Netherlands The Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands was a fake pro-China communist party in the Netherlands set up by the Dutch secret services, the BVD, to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes. It existed from 1968 to the early 1990s.  New Zealand The country's four small communist parties, the Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ), Socialist Unity Party (SUP), Workers Communist League (WCL), and the Socialist Action League (SAL), have tried to influence the Labour Party, the trade unions, and various popular issues, like the anti-Springbok tour protests, MƒÅori biculturalism, and the anti-nuclear movement. During the ANZUS diplomatic crisis 1984 to 1985, which resulted from New Zealand's nuclear ship ban, the pro-Moscow SUP tried to infiltrate anti-nuclear organisations, as part of a strategy of steering New Zealand's foreign policy away from its traditional ally, the United States. New Zealand's Christian Right also attempted to obtain electoral influence. During the 1987 general election, several conservative Christian groups, including the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), Women for Life and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens, tried to infiltrate the National Party by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates. The groups also attacked the Labour government's policies towards peace education, sex education, abortion, MƒÅori biculturalism, and the ANZUS alliance. Several CCC supporters contested the 1987 election as National candidates, including Rob Wheeler (Mount Albert), Andrew Stanley (Onehunga), and Howard Martin (Papatoetoe). However, the efforts met little electoral success, and the Lange government was re-elected for a second term. During the 1990s, another conservative tendency emerged within the National Party by the establishment of the informal Christian Voice in 1998. However, the group had faded by the mid-2000s, when several minor Christian political parties including former National MP Graeme Lee's Christian Democrat Party, Peter Dunne's United Future, and Brian Tamaki's Destiny New Zealand emerged to court the evangelical Christian vote. As a result of the attempts at taking over the party, National quietly centralised its candidate selection procedures. Despite the tensions with moral conservatives, National Party leader Don Brash still accepted covert assistance from the Exclusive Brethren during the 2005 general elections. The assistance included organizing a separate electoral canvassing and advertising campaign that attacked the incumbent Labour and Green coalition government. The strategy backfired and contributed to Prime Minister Helen Clark's second re-election. The controversy arising from the Exclusive Brethren's canvassing on behalf of National, Brash's successor, Prime Minister John Key, explicitly rejected any assistance from the Exclusive Brethren during the 2008 election.Colin James, \\"National,\\" p.491  United Kingdom A long-lasting entry tactic was used by the Trotskyist group Militant tendency, whose initially small numbers of supporters worked within the mainstream Labour Party from the 1960s. By the early 1980s they still numbered only in the low thousands but had managed to gain a controlling influence of the Labour Party Young Socialists and Liverpool City Council, however shorty thereafter Militant activists began to be expelled after an internal Labour ruling that their organisation breached the party's constitution. A remnant of the group now operates within the Labour Party as Socialist Appeal but the majority then left to form the Socialist Party (England and Wales). The Guardian columnist George Monbiot claims that a group, influenced by the defunct Marxist Living Marxism magazine, has pursued entryist tactics in British scientific and media organisations since the late 1990s.The Guardian comment, December 9, 2003. \\"Invasion of the entryists\\" by George Monbiot. Online at and , retrieved on October 25, 2007. The 2015 Labour Party leadership election was the target of a campaign by The Daily Telegraph for Conservative sympathisers to join the Labour party (at a fee of ¬£3) in order to vote for the left-wing candidate Jeremy Corbyn, with the view that he would render the party unelectable. That strategy was labelled 'entryism' by observers, though it is unclear that it qualifies under the commonly-understood definition, unlike the broader term 'subversion'. Likewise, the left-wing Momentum group has been accused of entryism and engaging in the Militant-style tactics, with movements made by prominent Labour MPs (current and suspended) to deselect MPs who did not support Corbyn. In the wake of the Brexit vote in 2016, some supporters of Leave feared that the government would negotiate a deal that would keep far too many ties between with the European Union and so members of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which had struggled politically since Brexit, joined the Conservative Party, along with previously independent Leave supporters. The movement was especially pronounced in the constituencies of Conservative MPs who had supported Remain. The group Leave.EU ran campaigns that urged its supporters to join the Conservatives to deselect MPs who did not support a hard Brexit. Those who joined the party during that period were credited with helping Boris Johnson win the leadership election (and thus become Prime Minister) after Prime Minister Theresa May's resignation.  United States  Supporters of Fred Newman and the New Alliance Party joined the Reform Party en masse and gaining some level of control over the New York State affiliate of the Reform Party. Another United States politician, Lyndon LaRouche, has attempted an entryist strategy in the Democratic Party since 1980, but with little success. Many Libertarians or libertarian-leaning politicians have run for office as Republicans, and several (such as Ron Paul, his son Rand Paul, and Mark Sanford) have been successful. Laws against entryism Some jurisdictions have passed laws to discourage entryism. In New York State elections, changes in party affiliation by voters already registered are not formally processed until a week after that year's general election to prevent entryism in a primary election since they are open only to voters who are already enrolled in the party holding the primary. The state's Wilson Pakula law, passed after American Labor Party candidates were entering and winning Democratic and Republican Party primaries in the late 1940s, also requires candidates who are not members of a particular political party to get formal permission from the relevant jurisdiction's party committees before they run in a primary election.

In 773 BC, the 33rd year of the reign of Duan Huan of Zheng, King You of Zhou gave him the position of situ (Minister of Land) due to the people's love for him. State relocation Due to the instability during the rule of King You of Zhou, Duke Huan of Zheng consulted Taishi Bo (Â§™Âè≤‰ºØ) on his opinions on state relocation. Duke Huan expressed that he wished to move the country to the west or to the Yangtze River Basin. Taishi Bo indicated that establishing a country in the west would not last long since the people of the west were avaricious and greedy, and that establishing a country in the Yangtze River Basin would be unfavourable for the country since the state of Chu was expanding in the south. In the end, Duke Huan listened to the advice of Taishi Bo and moved the country to the east of Luoyang, south of the Yellow River and the Ji River (ÊøüÊ∞¥), and named it New Zheng (Êñ∞ÈÑ≠). After relocating the country, other nearby states such as the state of Kuai (ÈÑ∂) and Guo offered Duke Huan ten cities, which were incorporated into the land of his country. Death In 771 BC, the 45th of his reign, the Quanrong attacked the Zhou capital Haojing and killed both King You of Zhou and Duke Huan of Zheng. His son, Juetu (ÊéòÁ™Å) assumed the throne as Duke Wu of Zheng.

Biography Heinrich Funck is commonly believed to have been born in the Palatinate region of Germany. No baptismal record is known. He was a descendant of Swiss Mennonites who were expelled from Bern, Switzerland, in the 17th Century based largely on their religious beliefs. Funck arrived in Philadelphia in 1717 with his family and other German Palatines, seeking a place to freely practice their Mennonite faith, including Dielman Kolb (1691-1756), who became an early Mennonite minister in Pennsylvania. During 1719, he settled in Franconia Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. In about 1720, Funck married Anne Meyer (ca 1700-1758), daughter of Mennonite immigrant Christian Meyer (1676-1751). They would be the parents of ten children. Heinrich Funck was the grandfather of Joseph Funk and of Jacob Funk, the original owner of the historic Jacob Funk House and Barn. In 1725, Heinrich Funck built and operated a grist mill on Indian Creek in Franconia Township in what is today Telford, Pennsylvania. In 1738, Heinrich Funck, together with others including Dielman Kolb and Christian Meyer, was instrumental in purchasing land for the Salford Mennonite meeting house. The Salford Mennonite Congregation itself had dated to 1717. He served for many years as bishop in the Franconia Mennonite Conference. From 1745-1748, together with Dielman Kolb, he supervised the translation of the classic 1660 Dutch religious history, Martyrs Mirror into the German language. Funck also wrote two German language religious books, Ein Spiegel der Taufe (A Mirror of Baptism), published in 1744, and Eine Restitution, Oder eine Erklaerung einiger Haupt-puncten des Gesetzes (Restitution, or an Explanation of Several Principal Points of the Law), published posthumously by his children in 1763. Heinrich Funck died during 1760 and was buried in the Delp Burying Ground in Harleysville, Pennsylvania. A memorial gravestone there lists him as Henry Funk.

This song was also wrongly attributed to a Peruvian composer, Manuel Casazola Huancco, but there is no proof of it. Rojas Enriquez composed many songs with a style very palpable in Ojos Azules. In the SADAIC (Argentine Society of Composers and Authors), Ojos Azules was listed in 1951 as song number #1635196, by author Gilbert Rojas Enriquez. In the past 40 years, Ojos Azules has been interpreted by several Bolivian, Peruvian, Chilean, and Argentinian groups. Most groups had the wrong information about its composer, only Mercedes Sosa knew about Gilberto Rojas.  Lyrics  > Ojos azules no llores, no llores ni te enamores.

Having won the B-Division in 2002, they spent a number of seasons struggling in the A-Division and regularly finished bottom or second from bottom only to gain a reprieve whether through relegation playoffs or because there was no relegation that season. After several years, they were finally sent down to the B-Division, where they were last recorded playing in 2013.  History  Rigzhung were promoted from the B-Division following the 2002 season, when they won the league, going unbeaten throughout the whole season. Drawn in group 1 for the group stage, they won four and drew one of their games in this single round-robin stage, a point ahead of Yeedzin Their +22 goal difference was aided by a 6‚Äì0 win over RC Cables and an 11 victory against Veterans FC. they defeated Sharks FC 6‚Äì2 in the semi final of the knock-out stage and then beat Yeedzin 5‚Äì3 on penalties after a 1‚Äì1 draw following extra time, and were promoted to the A-Division for the following season. In their first season in the A-Division, they finished second from bottom, finishing only above Druk United. Details for this season are scant, but it is known that as well as drawing two of their games, their solitary victory in the season was a 7‚Äì3 win against Druk United. No details exist to indicate how Rigzhung performed in the 2004 season, but the next season for which full records are available show they again finished in penultimate place in the relegation zone. They entered the relegation playoffs with Dzongree from the A-Division and Choden and another unknown team from the B-Division. there is little in the way of information about these matches, but Rigzhung must have been successful as they competed again in the A-Division the following season, although their only known result was a 9‚Äì0 loss to Transport United. In the 2007 season, Rigzhung finished bottom of the A-Division, winning just a single game from their fourteen matches and losing all the rest. they again entered the relegation playoffs, this time with RIHS against the top two teams from the B-Division: Veterans and Wolfland. They won 2 and lost one of their games (to Veterans), doing enough to secure another season in the A-Division. The following season saw them bottom of the league with no points at all at the halfway stage of the competition, having lost all seven of their games by that stage, although none of their results are known. Their second half performance was ultimately moot, as no teams were relegated or promoted in the A-Division at the end of the season. In 2009, they were saved from last place as Royal Bhutan Army withdrew halfway through the season (having already amassed more than three times the points that Rigzhung did all season by that stage), though this time they were relegated, without going through any playoffs. Rigzhung suffered some heavy defeats that season, losing 13‚Äì0 and 11‚Äì0 to eventual champions Druk Stars and 10‚Äì2 and 9‚Äì2 to Yeedzin. The next time records show the performance of Rigzhung, they were playing in the B-Division again in 2012 and 2013.

The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on , 2012. It had a limited release in theaters in the United States on , 2013. Synopsis The documentary follows the plan that Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad puts forth in 2009 for the Palestinians to achieve statehood. It follows the progress made by the Palestinians but also \\"the political quagmire\\" that threatens the progress. The documentary shows the following people: * Salam Fayyad, Palestinian Prime Minister from , 2007 to , 2013 * Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority from , 2005 to present * Majd Biltaji, a Palestinian blogger from the West Bank * Mahmoud El- Mandawi, a Palestinian blogger from Gaza and Biltaji's friend * Nabeel Sweety, a Palestinian member of The Parents Circle-Families Forum whose sister was killed * Ron Dermer, senior advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel * Tzipi Livni, Israeli Opposition Leader from 2009 to 2012 * Avi Dichter, former Minister of Israeli Internal Security * Yitzhak Frankenthal, founder of The Parents Circle-Families Forum * Sara Benninga, an activist of the Palestine Solidarity Movement * George Mitchell, former American Senator who wrote the \\"Mitchell Report\\" * Jeremy Ben-Ami, founder of J Street * Robert Serry, Middle East envoy for the United Nations Production The film is directed by Dan Setton and produced by Setton and Elise Pearlstein. Setton heard Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad make a radio address in 2009 and thought that Fayyad's plan to build social services and economic infrastructure was a similar path to the Zionist movement that led to the creation of Israel. Setton met Fayyad in 2009 shortly before the filmmakers began filming the documentary. He began filming with the support of the French company Zagib Productions. He soon approached Participant Media for backing, and the company expanded the film's production and advised the filmmaker to increase its scope. They attached producer Elise Pearlstein to work with Setton. Filming took place in several cities in the West Bank, including Ramallah. They featured two Palestinian bloggers, Madj Biltaji from the West Bank, and Mahmoud El-Madawi from Gaza, to show grassroots activists using social networks. Pearlstein said the filmmakers did not know the outcome of Fayyad's plan, \\"We were trying to make sure the film served as a historical documentation of the time when change felt really possible.\\" They sought to show nonviolent images of the conflict: \\"There's no blood in this film. It's all about the constructive building of institutions and a political movement.\\" Setton said of the conflict's complex reality, \\"We tried to make it as clear as possible for the many underinformed people that are in our audience.\\" The filmmakers used aerial shots and wide shots for the documentary; Setton said, \\"We thought it would be a good cinematic approach to rise up from the day-to- day little things and show a bigger picture.\\" Salam Fayyad resigned in April 2013, a month before the documentary's theatrical release. When the Los Angeles Times asked Setton about Fayyad's resignation affecting the prospects of statehood, the director said, \\"There was a loss of momentum even before his resignation. I‚Äôve spoken with him recently, and he said he resigned his job but he hasn‚Äôt resigned his mission. He will push Palestinians to continue working on what he believes will create the conditions of statehood.\\" Release State 194 premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on , 2012. The Palestinian Prime Minister depicted in the documentary, Salam Fayyad, was scheduled to appear at a news conference at the film festival with Setton, producer Elise Pearlstein, and representatives of The Parents Circle- Families Forum, but Sallah was detained in Ramallah when demonstrations broke out among Palestinians over high prices in the occupied territories. The documentary also screened at the Berlin International Film Festival on , 2013. It had a limited release on , 2013 in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles. Reception Mark Adams of Screen Daily reviewed State 194 at its Berlin screening and called it \\"a highly watchable and impressively optimistic documentary\\". He spoke of its distribution potential, \\"The film... is made with enthusiasm and passion, and would be a suitably provocative and challenging transmission for broadcasters. Technical qualities are okay, but this is the sort of project where content and context are everything.\\" Anita Gates, reviewing for The New York Times, called State 194 \\"an intelligent, evenhanded Israeli documentary\\". Gates compared the film to a 60 Minutes TV segment \\"without the confrontational interview style\\". For her, the film's different elements \\"lay out the situation but offer little new insight\\". She said, \\"Sadly, the overall effect of 'State 194' is a fresh wave of frustration and discouragement over a heartbreaking and seemingly insurmountable political standoff and its human toll.\\" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"This globe-hopping film offers an easily digestible look at the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, past and present, while framing the roles of its recent key players.\\" Goldstein said the film focused on \\"the seemingly level-headed, optimistic Fayyad\\" as he pushes for statehood. He concluded, \\"With a two-state solution still elusive, 'State 194' may feel a bit like yesterday's news ‚Äî literally and figuratively. But as an aid to better understanding this vital, complex dispute, the film is definitely worth a look.\\" Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club said the documentary was unnecessary for moviegoers who have a basic understanding of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. D'Angelo said, \\"As a primer, however, the film does the job, albeit less thoroughly and with more needless digressions than would even a lengthy magazine article on the subject.\\" The critic thought the documentary easily summarized Fayyad's plan and spent too much time recording the prime minister at photo ops. D'Angelo said, \\"Ultimately, State 194 wants to rally viewers to the cause of a two- state solution, and that entails glossing over many of the reasons why it hasn't already happened, in spite of it being in almost everybody‚Äôs best interest.\\" Notes References * External links  Category:2012 films Category:2012 documentary films Category:American films Category:Israeli films Category:Israeli documentary films Category:Palestinian films Category:Arabic-language films Category:English-language films Category:Hebrew-language films Category:Documentary films about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Category:Films scored by Michael Brook Category:Films shot in the State of Palestine Category:Participant Media films ","title":"State 194 (film)"},{"id":"39412052","title":"Let It Go (Anna Rossinelli song)"},{"id":"39412074","text":"Luigi Boscolo (; 22 March 1824 ‚Äì ?) was an Italian engraver, active in Venice.

Since December 1993, it has been home to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\\"Historia Palacio San Carlos\\", Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores. Retrieved 17 May 2013. History The Palace of San Carlos The history of the building goes back to the end of the 16th century when it was built by Archdeacon Francisco Porras Mejia, in 1585. At the time Santa Fe de Bogot√° was the capital of New Kingdom of Granada, part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. It was occupied by the archdeacon's family until 1605 when it was sold to Archbishop Bartolom√© Lobo Guerrero who used it as a Jesuit seminary known as the Colegio Seminario de San Bartolom√©. In 1739, the first printing press of Sante Fe was also established here. In 1767, after the Jesuits were expelled from New Granada by Francisco Antonio Moreno y Escand√≥n, acting on orders from King Carlos III, it became the Royal Library of Santa Fe and served as barracks for the Presidential Guard. From 1827 to 1908 the palace was the official residence of the President of Colombia. Then President Rafael Reyes Prieto moved out to the Palace of Nari√±o where he lived till 1954. From 1954 it again became the residence of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and his successors till 1980. In 1980 after the Palace of Nari√±o was inaugurated as the presidential residence, the Palace of San Carlos was converted to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which it still accommodates today. Wall plaque commemorating the assassination attempt on Simon Bolivar The palace was also the scene of an assassination attempt on Simon Bolivar in 1828. He was attacked when a group of conspirators attempted to assassinate him while he was taking a bath and he escaped through the window with soap still covering his body. His mistress, Manuela S√°enz Aizpuru, who tipped him off and saved him came to be known among Bogotans as \\"the liberator of the liberator\\". The event became known as the Noche Septembrina (), and it is referenced in Latin in a plaque conspicuously fixed on the wall next to the window through which he escaped. In 1937, properties next to the palace were acquired on the eastern side. The main entrance was added along with a triple storied building to accommodate the offices of the Ministry. Built by the Italian architect Pietro Cantini, the new fa√ßade stands close to two other historic buildings on Calle del Coliseo (Calle 10): the birthplace of the poet Rafael Pombo and the Christopher Columbus Theatre. On 11 August 1975, the San Carlos Palace was declared a National Monument.\\"Historia del Palacio de San Carlos\\", Canciller√≠a: Ministerio de Ralaciones Exteriores. Retrieved 19 May 2013. Architecture The Palace is built around a central courtyard with Tuscan columns and slightly pointed arches. On the south side of the courtyard there is a stairway up to the first floor. The original stone entrance with a balcony and iron railings is preserved as part of the fa√ßade. There are two rows of rectangular windows including the one on the east side through which Bol√≠var escaped on 25 September 1828. From 1937 to 1942, the building was adapted for future use by the architects Hernando Gonz√°lez Varona and Manuel de Vengoechea. On 9 April 1948, the palace was attacked during the Bogotazo which caused damage to its interiors. Interior and furnishings The building has been completely restored to serve as a heritage site and as a venue for diplomatic receptions and special events. It is known for its elegant state rooms. In its patios, there is a walnut planted by Bol√≠var and a palm which President Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez Vald√©s planted to commemorate the birth of his daughter Policarpa. The large entrance hall displays six 18th- century Spanish chairs in the Cordoba style and a central table. Two large 19th-century bronze vases flank the stairway at the far end. Bolivar's bedroom is furnished with a 17th-century bed and a bargue√±o desk with secret drawers. The neighbouring oratory with works from the Santa Fe school and an altar in the colonial style with two florally decorated candelabras. Since colonial times, the Bol√≠var Room opposite the bedroom has been a venue for important official ceremonies. It houses a portrait of Bol√≠var by the Venezuelan artist Antonio Salguero Salas and a fireplace with two Solomonic columns. The ceiling in the entrance to the state rooms is decorated with a Pompeian fresco by Santiago Mart√≠nez Delgado (1950).

Stilwell (May 10, 1866 ‚Äì April 20, 1942) was an American lawyer and politician from New York. Life He was born on May 10, 1866, on a farm just on the border line between Mount Vernon and Yonkers, in Westchester County, New York, the son of William J. Stilwell and Mary D. (Archer) Stilwell. He attended the Union Free School in Yonkers, graduated from New York University School of Law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Mount Vernon. For some time he owned and edited The Reformer, the Democratic newspaper of Mount Vernon. Stilwell was a member of the New York State Senate (21st D.) from 1909 to 1913, sitting in the 132nd, 133rd, 134th, 135th and 136th New York State Legislatures. In 1913, Stilwell was accused by George H. Kendall, President of the New York Bank Note Company, of demanding a bribe of $3,500 to pass legislation which would make it a misdemeanor for the New York Stock Exchange to refuse certificates engraved by the New York Bank Note Company. The case was investigated by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, but Stilwell was cleared by a vote of 28 to 21 in the Senate. The report of the Senate investigation was then forwarded to D.A. of New York County Charles S. Whitman who prosecuted the case in the New York Supreme Court. Stilwell was convicted of bribery, and automatically forfeited his seat in the State Senate on May 24, 1913. He was sentenced by Justice Samuel Seabury to not less than four or more than eight years in prison, and on July 15, 1913, began serving his term in Sing Sing. On February 9, 1914, he was transferred to Great Meadow State Prison in Comstock. In April 1941, he was arrested on a charge of attempted bribery, and remained incarcerated in the Westchester County Jail. On February 9, 1942, he pleaded guilty, and died on April 20 in Grasslands Hospital in Valhalla, New York, where he was receiving medical treatment while awaiting sentence in custody.

A 1937 welfare building, a 1940 county library, and a 1940 heating plant are also located on the courthouse grounds, which are extensively landscaped and include a fountain, sundial, plaque, and the remains of the former county courthouse. The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 12, 1998.  History  Because of an Earthquake that occurred in the 1920s, the Earlier County Courthouse was severely damaged and found unsafe. The County Supervisors suggested constructiong a new courthouse. After reviewing three sites and public opinions fond of the new courthouse idea, the supervisors bought a block on North Arrowhead Street and issued a $450,000 bond for the construction of the new courthouse. On November 17, 1925, R.W. Wescott was selected as contractor. Noted local architect Howard E. Jones (1885 - 1966), who had proposed multiple ideas for remodels of the original Courthouse, was responsible for design. He is said to have drawn inspiration from the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the recent City Beautiful movement, which sparked the popularisation of Classical Revival and other monumental Architectural styles in the United States.  Description  The building's design features classical columns spanning the second and third floors, a parapet along the roof line, regularly spaced windows, and extensive use of projecting blocks on the front facade. The courthouse is faced with unpainted stone and stucco, an uncommon design choice. It is the only surviving Classical Revival building in the city.

Sessions are also used in operational analytics and provision of user-specific recommendations. There are two primary methods used to define a session: time- oriented approaches based on continuity in user activity and navigation-based approaches based on continuity in a chain of requested pages.  Definition  The definition of \\"session\\" varies, particularly when applied to search engines. Generally, a session is understood to consist of \\"a sequence of requests made by a single end-user during a visit to a particular site\\". In the context of search engines, \\"sessions\\" and \\"query sessions\\" have at least two definitions. A session or query session may be all queries made by a user in a particular time period or it may also be a series of queries or navigations with a consistent underlying user need.  Uses  Sessions per user can be used as a measurement of website usage. Other metrics used within research and applied web analytics include session length, and user actions per session. Session length is seen as a more accurate alternative to measuring page views. Reconstructed sessions have also been used to measure total user input, including to measure the number of labour hours taken to construct wikipedia. Sessions are also used for operational analytics, data anonymization, identifying networking anomalies, and synthetic workload generation for testing servers with artificial traffic.  Session reconstruction  an illustration of the different criteria used by different session reconstruction approaches. Essential to the use of sessions in web analytics is being able to identify them. This is known as \\"session reconstruction\\". Approaches to session reconstruction can be divided into two main categories: time-oriented, and navigation-oriented.  Time-oriented approaches  Time-oriented approaches to session reconstruction look for a set period of user inactivity commonly called an \\"inactivity threshold.\\" Once this period of inactivity is reached, the user is assumed to have left the site or stopped using the browser entirely and the session is ended. Further requests from the same user are considered a second session. A common value for the inactivity threshold is 30 minutes and sometimes described as the industry standard. Some have argued that a threshold of 30 minutes produces artifacts around naturally long sessions and have experimented with other thresholds. Others simply state: \\"no time threshold is effective at identifying [sessions]\\". One alternative that has been proposed is using user- specific thresholds rather than a single, global threshold for the entire dataset. This has the problem of assuming that the thresholds follow a bimodal distribution, and is not suitable for datasets that cover a long period of time.  Navigation-oriented approaches  Navigation-oriented approaches exploit the structure of websites - specifically, the presence of hyperlinks and the tendency of users to navigate between pages on the same website by clicking on them, rather than typing the full URL into their browser. One way of identifying sessions by looking at this data is to build a map of the website: if the user's first page can be identified, the \\"session\\" of actions lasts until they land on a page which cannot be accessed from any of the previously-accessed pages. This takes into account backtracking, where a user will retrace their steps before opening a new page. A simpler approach, which does not take backtracking into account, is to simply require that the HTTP referer of each request be a page that is already in the session. If it is not, a new session is created. This class of heuristics \\"exhibits very poor performance\\" on websites that contain framesets.

Gomez joined the independence movement on May 4, 1810 and this participation invited his persecution by the government which resulted in his staying incognito on the island, in 1812. He accompanied General Juan Bautista Arismendi in the second insurrection of Margarita Island. This resulted in his arrest in 1815. He was associated with the peace treaty of April 15, 1815 and sided with Arismendi, on November 16, 1815 in the revolt. On May 8, 1816, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var promoted him to colonel. During the July 31, 1817 Battle of Matasiete, he fought against General Pablo Morillo. He published the manifesto titled \\"Great Nations and Generous World\\" on June 23, 1817. On July 31, 1817 he was promoted as Brigadier General for the successful war campaign of the Battle of Matasiete. In 1830, Jos√© Antonio P√°ez made Gomez commander-in weapons of Maracaibo. In 1835, the constitutional president of Venezuela, Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas, entrusted Gomez with the Command of Arms of the province of Cuman√°. In 1837, he served as Chief Operating Officer of Cuman√°, Margarita and Barcelona. In 1847 he sought and obtained a certificate as an invalid, but he was reappointed Governor of Margarita in 1853. He died the same year in the building that was the Franciscan Convent of La Asunci√≥n Legacy As directed by the President of Venezuela, on February 11, 1876 his mortal remains were transferred to a funerary urn in the Catedral Nuestra Se√±ora de La Asunci√≥n. On July 18, 1880, the urn containing his mortal remains was shifted to Caracas. It was then interred in the National Pantheon of Venezuela on August 20, 1880. G√≥mez Municipality, Nueva Esparta, birthplace of the victorious general, is named in his honor. The Plaza Francisco Esteban Gomez in Santa Ana honors him with his statue as the hero of the Battle of Matasiere, while his home, located close by, is conserved as a museum.

Early life  John Minter Morgan was probably born in London in 1782. His father, John Morgan, a wholesale stationer at 39 Ludgate Hill, and a member of the court of assistants of the Stationers' Company, died at Claydon, Suffolk, on 1 March 1807, aged 66. The son, inheriting an ample fortune, devoted himself to philanthropy. Works His projects were akin to those of Robert Owen of Lanark but were avowedly Christian. His first book, published in 1819, entitled Remarks on the Practicability of Mr. Owen's Plan to improve the Condition of the Lower Classes, was dedicated to William Wilberforce, but met with slight acknowledgement. His next publication was an anonymous work in 1826, The Revolt of the Bees which contained his views on education. Hampden in the Nineteenth Century appeared in 1834, and in 1837 he added a supplement to the work, entitled Colloquies on Religion and Religious Education. In 1830 he delivered a lecture at the London Mechanics' Institution in defence of the Sunday morning lectures then given there. This was printed together with A Letter to the Bishop of London suggested by that Prelate's Letter to the Inhabitants of London and Westminster on the Profanation of the Sabbath. Morgan presented petitions to parliament in July 1842 asking for an investigation of his plan for an experimental establishment to be called the Church of England Agricultural Self-supporting Institution which he further made known at public meetings, and by the publication in English and French in 1845 of The Christian Commonwealth. In aid of his benevolent schemes he printed Pestalozzi's Letters on Early Education, with a Memoir of the Author in 1827 ; Hannah More's Essay on St. Paul 2 vols. 1850 ; and Extracts for Schools and Families in Aid of Moral and Religious Training 1851. He also edited in 1849 a translation of an essay entitled ' written by Napoleon III, and in 1851 The Triumph, or the Coming of Age of Christianity ; Selections on the Necessity of Early and Consistent Training no less than Teaching. In 1850 he reprinted some of his own and other works in thirteen volumes under the title of The Phoenix Library, a Series of Original and Reprinted Works bearing on the Renovation and Progress of Society in Religion, Morality, and Science ; selected by J. M. Morgan. Near his own residence on Ham Common he founded in 1849 the National Orphan Home, to which he admitted children left destitute by the ravages of the cholera. In 1850 he endeavoured to raise a sum of ¬£50,000. to erect a Church of England self-supporting village but the scheme met with little support. He died at 12 Stratton Street, Piccadilly, London, on 26 December 1854, and was buried in the church on Ham Common on 3 January 1855. Besides the works already mentioned, he published: # The Reproof of Brutus, a Poem 1830. # Address to the Proprietors of the University of London [on a professorship of education and the establishment of an hospital] 1833\\\\. # A Brief Account of the Stockport Sunday School and on Sunday Schools in Rural Districts 1838. # Letters to a Clergyman on Institutions for Ameliorating the Condition of the People 1846 ; 3rd edition, 1851. # A Tour through Switzerland, and Italy, in the years 1846‚Äì1847, 1851 ; first printed in the Phoenix Library, 1850.

It was released on November 8, 2013 in Europe, November 9, 2013 in Australia, November 15, 2013 in North America, and December 5, 2013 in Japan. It the first title in the series to feature an online multiplayer mode, and the first to be published by Nintendo globally, as previous titles were published by Sega outside Japan and unlike previous instalments, the game was released solely on home console, and does not have a portable version. The game formed the second part in Sega's exclusivity agreement with Nintendo after Sonic Lost World back on mid-October 2013 and followed by Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal on November/December 2014. The game received mixed reviews from critics who praised the visuals, multiplayer and addition of online play, but criticised its controls and lack of innovation from previous games in the series. A fifth game in the series, Mario and Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, was released for Wii U and 3DS in 2016. Gameplay The players can only choose one of twenty characters that return from the previous two games and participate in a series of sixteen Olympic events. Events are controlled either using the Wii Remote Plus, Wii MotionPlus Nunchuk controllers, or the Wii U GamePad, with some events, such as the biathlon, utilizing both control methods, for the Wii U version. Along with returning events, such as skiing, bobsledding and curling, new events include figure skating pairs and snowboarding slope style. Like in the previous games, players can also participate in one of eight fictional Dream Events, including a new mixed event in which cases can be simultaneously played with snowboarding, skiing and bobsledding players. These events are played in places from the Mario and Sonic franchises. A new addition to this game is the Action & Answer Tour, where players answer questions to score points while competing in various events hosted by Orbot and Cubot from Sonic Colors and Sonic Lost World. Reception Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games received generally mixed reviews, with most critics praising the visuals, multiplayer and the online mode, but panning the game's similarity to previous Mario & Sonic series games and motion controls. It has an aggregate score of 55/100 at Metacritic.

Idioms are a common type of figure of speech. Based on common linguistic definitions, an idiom is a combination of words that contains a meaning that cannot be understood based on the literal definition of the individual words.Liu, D. (2008). Idioms: Description, comprehension, acquisition, and pedagogy. New York, NY: Routledge. An example of an idiom is hit the sack, which means to go to bed. It can be used in a sentence like the following: I'm beat; I'm gonna hit the sack. Traditionally, idiom comprehension was thought to require a distinct processing mode other than literal language comprehension. Subsequent research suggested that the comprehension of idioms could be explained in the context of general models of comprehension. Contemporary researchers have also posited that different modes of processing are required for distinct types of idioms. Factors, such as idiom familiarity, transparency, and context are found to influence idiom comprehension. Recent neurolinguistic research has found, using various techniques, several neural substrates that are associated with idiom comprehension, such as the left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex.  History  Psycholinguistic research in idiom comprehension began in the 1970s. Early research on figurative language typically assumed that comprehending figurative and literal language involved different kinds of processes. The non-compositional models of idiom comprehension were constructed based on this assumption. Noncompositional Models.  Non-compositional Models  Non-compositional models in general assume that idioms are stored like long words in memory.Caillies, S., & Butcher, K. (2007). Processing of idiomatic expressions: Evidence for a new hybrid view. Metaphor and Symbol, 22, 79-108. For example, the entire phrase kick the bucket is represented by the meaning to die. The words kick and bucket separately do not contribute to the idiomatic meaning. Since individual words do not matter in an idiomatic expression, they are thought to be processed together as one entity during comprehension. In contrast, processing a literal expression requires the meaning of each word to be derived and then perceived in relation to the other words in the phrase. Non-compositional models include the literal first hypothesis, lexical representation hypothesis, and the direct access hypothesis. The Literal First Hypothesis *The literal first hypothesis suggests that an idiom is first processed literally upon encounter.Swinney, D. A., & Culter, A. (1979). The access and processing of idiomatic expression. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 18, 523-534 Idioms are often ambiguous since they may be processed in two ways: literally and idiomatically. For example, kick the bucket can be interpreted as to strike the pail with one‚Äôs foot. The literal first hypothesis proposes that, only after an appropriate literal meaning is not found, a mental idiom list is assessed to retrieve the idiomatic meaning. This hypothesis posits that there are separate storage for normal words and idioms, and that literal processing and figurative processing require different modes. Researchers claimed that this hypothesis was supported when people reported that they made an idiomatic interpretation first after they have read a set of idiom-containing sentences, but a literal interpretation first if they have seen a set of literal but ambiguous sentences. The Lexical Representation Hypothesis *Contrary to the previous model, the lexical representation hypothesis posits that idioms are stored along with normal words in memory.Bobrow, S. A., & Bell, S. M. (1973). On catching on to idiomatic expressions. Memory & Cognitio, 1, 343-346 Idioms are processed both literally and figuratively simultaneously. However, the figurative meaning (lexical representation) of the idiom is accessed first since the word string is stored and processed as one entry. Literal processing consumes more time since it requires the understanding of each word individually. Research conducted to support this hypothesis found that people recognized grammatical idioms as meaningful expressions more quickly than non-idiomatic but grammatical phrases when they were presented out of context. The Direct Access Hypothesis *The direct access hypothesis proposes that literal processing does not necessary occur when an idiom is encountered. It is possible that people completely bypass such mode when faced with a highly familiar idiom or have sufficient context to infer an idiomatic interpretation. In these cases, the idiomatic meaning is directly accessed.Gibbs, R. W. (1980). Spilling the beans on understanding and memory for idioms in context. Memory and Cognition, 8, 149-156 This hypothesis is based on the findings that demonstrated that people processed idiomatic sentences quicker than literal ones, and tended to interpret idiomatic expressions figuratively even when they are used in a literal sense.  Criticisms of Non-compositional Models  There are several criticisms for the non-compositional models. First, studies demonstrated that idiom expressions are not processed more slowly than literal expression. In fact, it is often the opposite, which is in contrary to the prediction of literal first hypothesis. Second, idioms have been found to be more than just ‚Äúfrozen phrases‚Äù or long words. For example, some idioms can be transformed to some extent and still be recognized and understood. For example, spill the beans can be used as ‚Äúthe beans were spilt by Mary‚Äù. This is possible because spill the bean can be mapped on the meaning ‚Äúreveal the secret‚Äù, i.e. spill (reveal) and beans (secret). Such idiom shows that the internal structure of the word string matters during comprehension. The meaning of some idioms, like play with fire, can be also inferred from literal interpretation of their components (i.e. to do something dangerous). These findings reveal that idioms are not a homogeneous, distinct group and thus may not involve different processing strategies from those for literal expressions.Titone, D. A., & Connine, C. M. (1999). On the compositional and noncompositional nature of idiomatic expressions. Journal of Pragmatics, 31, 1655-1674.  Compositional Models  Compositional models assume that idiom comprehension uses normal language processing. When an idiomatic expression is encountered, it is processed incrementally like a normal expression. Components of an idiomatic word string contribute to a figurative meaning in either a literal or metaphorical way. Compositional models include the configurational hypothesis and the conceptual metaphor hypothesis. Compositional models. The Configurational Hypothesis *The configurational hypothesis rose in response to the former hypotheses. It was based on a finding that demonstrated that people did not make an idiomatic interpretation once the first part of an idiom is encountered (against the prediction of the direct access hypothesis) or at the end of the idiom (against the prediction of the lexical representation hypothesis). Instead, the configurational hypothesis posits that a sufficient portion of an idiomatic word string must be processed literally before the idiom is identified.Cacciari, C., & Tabossi, P. (1988). The comprehension of idioms. Journal of Memory and Language, 27, 668-683 The point where most people recognize the string as an idiom is the idiom key. Once the key is encountered, the words in the rest of the string will not be processed literally. The idiom key is the most important part of the idiom. If it is replaced by other words, the idiomatic meaning cannot be activated. The Conceptual Metaphor Hypothesis *The conceptual metaphor hypothesis proposes that metaphors are fundamental to human thought and they influence the comprehension of many aspects of language, including idioms.Gibbs, R. W., Bogdanovich, J. M., Sykes, J. R., & Barr, D. J. (1997). Metaphor in idiom comprehension. Journal of Memory and Language, 37, 141‚Äì154 An example of a conceptual metaphor is ‚Äúlove is a journey‚Äù. This metaphor is embedded in the idiom-containing sentences like their marriage is on the rocks and our relationship is at a cross-road. This hypothesis suggests that conceptual metaphors facilitate the understanding of idiomatic expressions. Individual words in the idiom can metaphorically contribute to its figurative meaning. In fact, research demonstrated that conceptual metaphors are activated during idiom comprehension. The words associated with the metaphor (e.g., journey) were more quickly identified as meaningful after the presentation of the idiom.  Criticisms of Compositional Models  The prediction of the configurational hypothesis was not supported by research findings. Researchers found that even after a word string is recognized as an idiom, its literal meaning is still activated. Another criticism of the compositional models concerns the role of familiarity in idiom comprehension. As discovered by research on non-compositional models, idiomatic expressions are processed faster than non-idiomatic expressions. This is likely due to people‚Äôs familiarity of idioms. This suggests that when highly familiar idioms are encountered, people may not need to engage in literal processing or utilize conceptual metaphor to infer their meanings.  Recent Models  The dual idiom representation model. Research in idiom comprehension continues today. Non-compositional and compositional models both inform contemporary researchers. One of the recent models includes the dual idiom representation model. The Dual Idiom Representation Model *The dual idiom representation model suggests that idiomatic expressions are simultaneously ‚Äúlong words‚Äù and compositional phrases. Thus, idiom comprehension involves both direct memory retrieval and normal language processing. Idioms behave noncompositionally to the degree they are familiar. When highly familiar idioms encountered, their idiomatic meanings can be directly activated. In addition, idioms can behave compositionally if they are decomposable. Decomposability of an idiom refers to the extent to which the literal meaning of the individual words in the word string participate in the overall figurative meaning of the idiom. As suggested earlier, the idiom play with fire is decomposable while kick the bucket is nondecomposable. Comprehension is facilitated in a decomposable idiom since there are commonality between the results of its literal analysis and its idiomatic meaning. Research shows that familiarity had the larger effect on the speed of idiom comprehension than decomposability. Decomposability nonetheless facilitates processing the meaningfulness of the idiomatic expression.Libben, M. R., & Titone, D. A. (2008). The multidetermined nature of idiom processing. Memory & Cognition, 36, 1103-1121.  Factors that affect Idiom Comprehension  Many factors have an effect on the comprehension of idioms. They can influence the processing speed and understandability of the idioms. Some of these factors include the familiarity, transparency, and context of use of the idioms.  Familiarity  Idiom familiarity is typically defined as how frequently an idiom is encountered in a language community. Subjective ratings of idiom familiarity are usually obtained from members of the language community. An example of a more familiar English idiom is pain in the neck, while a less familiar idiom is paddle his own canoe. Research demonstrated that familiar idioms are processed quicker and more accurately than unfamiliar ones.Schweigert, W. A. (1986). The comprehension of familiar and less familiar idioms. Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 15, 33-45. As the dual idiom representation model suggests, highly familiar idioms may lead to direct memory retrieval. Processing unfamiliar idioms, on the other hand, requires contextual information and commonsense knowledge.  Transparency  Idiom transparency can refer to the ‚Äúliteralness‚Äù of an idiom; how easy it is to understand an idiom based on the words it contains. Idioms can be sorted depending on their degree of transparency. Three categories of idioms have been identified: decomposable, abnormally decomposable, and nondecomposable. Decomposable idioms are composed of words that literally contribute to their overall figurative meaning, e.g. pop the question. Pop refers to sudden and the question refers to marriage proposal. Abnormally decomposable idioms contain words that are associated with the overall figurative meaning of the idiom but in a metaphorical way, e.g. spill the beans. Spill mapping on to reveal and beans metaphorically representing secret. Nondecomposable idioms are made of words that do not reflect their idiomatic meaning, e.g. kick the bucket. People are found to respond to both types of decomposable idioms faster than nondecomposable ones.  Context of use  Research in children highlighted the important effects of context on idiom comprehension. It was found that children understand idiomatic expression more accurately when they are shown in informative contexts than when they are presented in isolation.Levorato, M. C., Roch, M., & Nesi, B. (2007). A longitudinal study of idiom and text comprehension. Journal of Child Language, 34, 473-494. When they are encountered out of context, children tended to interpret idioms literally. The ability to use contextual information in language processing has also been found to influence children‚Äôs performance in idiom comprehension. Adults, however, are more affected by the familiarity of the idiom.  Neurolinguistic Research  Researchers have used various means to explore the brain regions that are associated with idiom comprehension. The investigations involve examining brain damage patients, and conducting transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Brain damages in the patients were mostly caused by strokes or traumatic accidents. rTMS causes temporary cerebral lesion, and thereby impairs the target area‚Äôs functioning. fMRI measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. The areas that have been studied include the right hemisphere, left hemisphere, and prefrontal cortex.  Right Hemisphere  Since aphasic patients often preserve their ability to use familiar phrases (i.e. idioms and proverbs), researchers hypothesized that they may be stored and processed in different brain regions than novel phrases. It was found that patients who experienced right-brain damage (RBD) showed more impairment in idiom comprehension than patients with left-brain damage (LBD). RBD patients however performed better in comprehending novel sentence compared to patients with LBD.Van Lancker, D. R., & Kempler, D. (1987). Comprehension of familiar phrases by left-but not by right-hemisphere damaged patients. Brain and Language, 32, 265-277. This suggests that the right hemisphere is involved in the comprehension of idioms. However, later research has suggested that RBD patients‚Äô difficulties in idiom comprehension, as demonstrated by sentence-to- picture matching task, may be due to deficits in their visuospatial abilities, rather than impairment in linguistic processing. The right hemisphere shows dominance in visuospatial processing.Papagno, C., Curti, R., Rizzo, S., Crippa, F., & Colombo, M. R. (2006). Is the right hemisphere involved in idiom comprehension? A neuropsychological study. Neuropsychology, 20, 598-606. Gray's Neuroanatomy.  Left Hemisphere  Other researchers have hypothesized that comprehension of nondecomposable idioms mainly involved left hemispheric activity. When healthy adults were studied, left temporal rTMS was found to influence the reaction time and accuracy of both idiom comprehension and literal sentence processing. In particular, it increased processing time and reduced accuracy in understanding. When rTMS was applied to the left frontal, right frontal and right temporal, there were no effects on idiom comprehension.Papagno, C., Oliveri, M., Romero, L. (2002). Neural correlates of idiom comprehension. Cortex, 38, 895-898. Recent research with healthy adults using fMRI also found that, when processing idioms that were not literally interpretable (i.e., raining cats and dogs), the Broca‚Äôs area in the left prefronto-temporal network was activated. However, when literally interpretable idioms (i.e., break the ice) were processed, the left medial frontal gyrus (MFQ) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were activated.Hillert, D. G., & Buracas, G. T. (2009). The neural substrates of spoken idiom comprehension. Language and Cognitive Processes, 24, 1370-1391.  Prefrontal Cortex  Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is suggested to be important for idiom comprehension. It may play a role in selecting the appropriate interpretation and suppressing the incorrect ones when an idiomatic expression is encountered. Research using fMRI indicated that the left temporal cortex, left superior medial frontal gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus were activated when idiomatic phrases were presented.Lauro, L. J. R., Tettamanti, M., Cappa, S. F., & Papagno, C. (2008). Idiom comprehension: A prefrontal task? Cerebral Cortex, 18, 162-170. In addition, the right superior and middle temporal gyri, the right temporal pole, and the right inferior frontal gyrus were activated as well. In contrast, the left inferior parietal lobe and the right supramarginal gyrus were activated when literal sentences were presented.  MEG  Future research in this field should continue to investigate which brain regions are associated with idiom processing, in order to resolve the ongoing debate on hemispheric specialization in figurative language comprehension.Kasparian, K. (2013) Hemispheric differences in figurative language processing: Contributions of neuroimaging methods and challenges in reconciling current empirical findings. Journal of Neurolinguistics, 26, 1-12. A recent review suggested that the familiarity affect which brain region is activated during the comprehension of figurative language. Less familiar expressions are suggested to be processed in the right hemisphere, while more familiar ones are processed predominately in the left hemisphere. More brain imaging research needs to be conducted to test this hypothesis. Additionally, future research could use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore the temporal dynamics of idiom comprehension. Recent research using MEG has found that, when idioms containing action verbs (i.e. kick the bucket) were processed, motor regions of the brain were activated. The anterior fronto-temporal cortex, a region previously found to distinguish between literal and figurative processing, was activated at the same time as well. This suggests that literal and figurative meanings are processed in parallel to some extent, which gives support to the configurational hypothesis.Boulenger, V., Shtyrov, Y., & Pulvermuller, F. (2012). When do you grasp the idea? MEG evidence for instantaneous idiom understanding. NeuroImage, 59, 3502-3513. More work with MEG should be done to verify these findings.

Adenike is given fertility beads by her mother-in-law, Mama Ayo (Bukky Ajayi) and although the couple make love on their first night of marriage, Adenike struggles to become pregnant. Despite drinking a tea that is supposed to help with fertility, Adenike is still unable to conceive and faces growing pressure from Mama Ayo. A visit to the doctor reveals that Adenike can receive help on the issue, but Ayodele refuses to cooperate. Sade (Yaya Alafia) mentions adoption but Adenike insists that she wants to give birth to the child herself. Mama Ayo raises a controversial option: Adenike could conceive the child with Ayodele's brother, Biyi (Tony Okungbowa). Biyi initially refuses to participate in the scheme but eventually gives in. Following this Adenike becomes pregnant. Ayodele believes he is the father. The guilt becomes too much for Adenike to bear, and she finally tells her husband the truth. Ayodele subsequently walks out of the marriage and confronts his mother. Adenike goes into labor, and the film concludes as Ayodele joins the others at the hospital.

The \\"diversionist\\" thus was a camouflaged subject that spoke as it were from the inside the lines of the Revolutionary cadres, but in reality subscribing the vices and habits of bourgeoisie values. Ideological Diversionism redefined the political culture of Cuban social landscape during the decades of seventies and eighties, functioning even as a legal and moral category to proscribe, and demoralize dissent and revolutionary citizens that adopted norms that the State sought as deviant from standard social conducts.  Origins   Raul Castro's definition  Castro's speech on \\"Ideological Diversionism\\" sought to come to terms with the so-called peaceful aggressions by imperialists. The argument behind this thesis was that since imperialism could not defeat socialist countries, their new form of aggression was to destabilize the socialist culture and developmental socialist ideals through the means of propaganda as \\"peace means\\" of subversion. This would consequently entail that specially the youth and the intellectual classes were the most prone to ideological manipulation. As Raul makes clear at one point during his speech: \\"El diversionismo ideologico se realiza, ante todo, mediante la accion sobre la inteligencia, los sentimientos y la mente de las personas. Hacia esto se orienta todo el sistema de diversion ideologica a escala mundial. El objetivo de su atencion es en particular la juvetud y espcila la intelectualdia creadora, consideraso amobs por los ideologis imperialista como los recepctivos a su propaganda. En una de las instrucciones especial a los agendes de la guerra sicologica se les exige, asimismo, centrar su atencion \\"en las autoridades locales que influyen en la formacion de la opinion publica\\" [2]. \\"Ideological diversionism is done through a mediete action on the intelligence, sentiments, and the mind of people. The whole system of ideological diversion is oriented towards this goal at planetary scale. Their particular objective is the youth, and in particular the intellectual creative class, since they are considered as the receptors to their propaganda. In one of to the special instructions to the agents of the psychological war, they require focussing their work in local authorities that would influence in the shaping of public opinion\\".  Cuban intellectual discourse  After Raul Castro's speech in 1972, many State intellectuals conceptualized and redefined the term of ideological diversionism as a concept to put into use in the \\"struggle\\" against imperialist heterodox social norms. In 1974, one of Cuba most important Marxist cultural critics, Jose Antonio Portuondo, delivered the lecture \\"Mart√≠ y el Diversionismo Ideologico\\", where he extended Castro's theoretical argument by offering a national genealogy of the concept, tracing it to the history of patriot and national independence martyr Jos√© Mart√≠ [3]. According to Portuondo, it was Jose Marti, a nationalist and exiled Cuban, well before Raul Castro, who first attacked \\"ideological diversionism\\" as a way to unmask those who fought against independence and in favor of the division within nationalist forces of the nation. In Portuondo's reading, Mart√≠ becomes the symbolic figure in which ideological diversionism is neutralized and contained, since there is never a possibility to diverge from what is in the interest of the Nation. In 1979, a rather different intellectual, the educator Gaspar Garc√≠a Gallo, delivered a lecture entitled \\"El diversionismo Ideol√≥gico\\" in the Psychiatric Hospital of Havana. Unlike Portuondo, for Gaspar Gallo \\"diversionism\\" was rooted in the structure of human nature itself and it was to be contested from the biological as well as the psychological view of point. Intertwining dialectical materialism and pseudoscientific theories, a program that was beginning to take shape in the Lenin School of Havana as a pedagogical project, Gaspar Gallo argued that ideological diversionism, rooted in bourgeois vices and habits, was a product of an ill and corrupted nature [4]. These corruptions included, but were not limited to, homosexuality, western popular culture like The Beatles, laziness, and intellectualism. Gaspar Gallo offered, in the vein of naturalist of the 19th century, physiological stereotypes in which one could identified \\"members\\" of this psychological tendencies and deviations in the same way that later on students of the Cuban Communist Youth (UJC) will illustrate in the university journal Mella and Alma Mater. A couple of years before the lecture given by Gaspar Gallo, \\"ideological diversionism\\" was integrated into the official legal document Tesis y Resoluciones del Primer Congreso del Partido Comunista de Cuba (1976), and defined in these terms: \\"El diversionismo es una labor encubierta , solapada, que consiste en criticar al marxismo desde posiciones supuesta mente marxistas, con un falso ropaje revolucionario, progresista, o a lo sumo aparentando imparcialidad u objetividad; que trata de introducir en las filas revolucionarias las ideas contrarias al socialismo, present√°ndolas como socialistas o como favorables al socialismo, o como ideas nuevas ¬´superiores¬ª a las del socialismo, que lo mejoran o perfeccionan. Toda labor ideol√≥gica persigue objetivos pol√≠ticos. El diversionismo imperialista se dirige a minar, desde adentro, las fuerzas del socialismo; relajar sus bases ideol√≥gicas, introducir concepciones burguesas, mellar los principios b√°sicos de la teor√≠a cient√≠fica del socialismo; entorpecer o frustrar los planes de desarrollo, desvirtuar los objetivos principales en la econom√≠a y en la formaci√≥n comunista de las masas; dividir y sembrar la desconfianza en el seno de las fuerzas populares; tratar de desacreditar a los dirigentes; crear, en definitiva, un ambiente de relajamiento de los principios socialistas y de inconformidad en las masas, que sea caldo de cultivo para un retroceso ideol√≥gico, pol√≠tico y social que conduzca gradualmente a la derrota del socialismo\\".[5]  Soviet influences  In the Cuban intellectual discussion, the concept of ideological diversionism is sometimes referred as having direct influence from the era of Stalinism [6]. Although in the Stalinist historiography the direct concept is never articulated as such, one could point for a possible intellectual origin the 1929 text \\"On Right Deviation in our Party\\", where Stalin heavily critiques Bukharin, the kulak culture, and \\"social democracy\\" tendencies within the Soviet Communist Party. Deviations, according to Stalin, unlike Mao, must never be present in the Party, since it a structure of division in the vanguard of the People [7]. Stalin's deviation differs from the \\"diversionist\\" position to the extent that it never seeks to establish a \\"foreign\\" influence or a linguistic appropriation of Marxist categories as an aesthetic of concealment. Stalin's critique of deviation centered on the nature and necessity to keep the nature of class struggle as a driven principle of Soviet Society. In the Cuban case, diversionism besides being about the formation of a class unity, as it was about exclusion of a particular social subject. Another notable work about diversionism from the Soviet Union is Prosƒçety ideologiƒçeskix diversantov (The Miscalculations of Ideological Saboteurs) by V. I. Strepetov, written in 1976, and translated into Spanish in 1980 by Editorial Progreso. This means that this work was read and perhaps studied in Latin America and Cuba [8], and that it was most probably influenced by Raul Castro's speech of 1972. Strepetov as Raul Castro, sees the danger of diversionism as a flow of ideas coming from the West and that seek to destroy the anti-bourgeois principles of the Soviet Union. Diversionism is seeing as an activity and even \\"sabotage\\" to undermine the different relations and core principles of the soviet people, including labor, discipline, and loyalty. Confronting the discourses of Western Marxism and the crisis of theoretical paradigms that explicate the new capitalist post-industrial constellation, Strepetov suggests that ideological diversionism fosters a new tool for imperial and United States domination, not through violence and war, but through culture and rhetoric. Precisely the Russian term diversantov means the flow of ideas coming \\"from outside\\", and not merely a deviation from the norm.  Enforcement   Cultural censorship  Ideological Diversionism was not only a political or juridical term, since it also functioned, even before Raul Castro's speech in 1972, to police conducts and norms of everyday citizens and the production of culture, whether it was fashion, literature, or cinema. Most of the cultural production censored since the mid-1960s in Cuba - novels like Adire y el tiempo roto (1967) by Manuel Granados, and poetry books like Fuera del Juego (1968) by Heberto Padilla - were judged and accused from the paradigm of diversionism. It was in the university circles and groups were ideological diversionism was intensified as a hate speech against plural thinking of an array of social actors. As Mella or Alma Mater, two of the official publications of the University of Havana makes clear, the diversionist were from the \\"intellectualized student\\", who wore sandals, carry books by Jean-Paul Sartre and had homosexual conducts, to the bureaucrat, those interested in fashion or even those who would mimic The Beatles' haircuts (see figure 1.). These deviant cultural incarnations were not only not possible in the public sphere, but also had to be eliminated from all possible political and social activity to prevent contamination. In everyday life speech, \\"diversionists\\" were labeled as \\"d√©biles\\" (weaks), \\"raros\\" (weirdos), and \\"gusanos\\" (worms), terms that picked out the heterogeneity of social groups that contested the Revolution from below starting in the first decade of the Revolution, as the personal case of Anna Veltfort, an art history student at University of Havana bears witness to it [9] (see Figure 1.). Figure 1. \\"A los gusanos hay que hervirlos\\". Revista Mella, June 1965. \\"Los Gusanos\\".  Political censorship  Ideological diversionism was a cultural logic that led way for orthodox Marxist to foster a notions of ideological purity and normalization in Marxist culture. Hence, a great part of Western Marxism, from Jean-Paul Sartre's humanist existentialism and the Frankfurt School, to Antonio Gramsci and the debates of structuralism and post-structuralism in France, were banned from intellectual and academic circles within and out the University of Havana [10]. In the need to suppress \\"cultural\\" horizons of Marxist thinking, in favor of a \\"scientific mode\\" of dialectical materialism, ideological diversionism was by itself a cultural invention to suspend all possible cultural articulation of Marxism as such. In the Cuba of the 1970s, as one could see from journals such as Educaci√≥n or Cuba Socialista, Marxism was understood as a hard science that little or nothing had to do with everyday hybridity of cultural forms and habits [11]. The sovietization of the political system of Cuba, starting in 1971 with the National Congress of Education and Culture and with the first Constitution of Communist Party in 1976, further catalyzed the closure of the many different and plural positions within socialism, Marxism, social democracy, and syndicalism during the first five years after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution. Ideological Diversionism was the operation by which power articulated a totalizing enframing of a national socialist culture. Figure 2. \\"El intelectualizado\\" as a \\"ideological diversionist\\" subject. Revista Mella, 1964.El Intelectualizado. Legacy From an analysis of the politics of memory, many Cubans still remember the usages of ideological diversionism in everyday life, such as in schools, the street, the police, and the televised speeches of Fidel Castro. When asked to a 58-year-old Cuban from Miami accused and imprisoned for ideological diversionism, he remembered: \\"Yo claro que recuerdo el uso del t√©rmino \\"diversionismo ideol√≥gico\\", era una palabra que se utilizaba para tildar a la gente que le gustaban las cosas del extranjero; ya sean zapatos caros, la m√∫sica rock, o que incluso recib√≠a cartas de sus familiares exiliados. Diversionista tambi√©n era todo aquel que no simpatizaba ni cre√≠a en los valores de la Revoluci√≥n, y por eso se sent√≠a fuera de aquella sociedad. A otros les hac√≠an actos de repudio, como tirarles huevos\\" [12]. Not only are testimonies alive in the living memory of Cubans within and outside the island, but in recent cultural production the term has also repapered. For instance, the punk band \\"Porno Para Ricardo\\", has included the term in many of their lyrics, and the frontman of the band, Gorki √Åguila, sometimes comes out in the stage wearing a T-shirt that reads \\"Viva el diversionismo Ideologico!\\" (\\"Hurray for ideological diversionism!\\"), a public provocation that today has lost all its radical intentions in contemporary Cuba. In New York, the Cuban poet Alexis Romay has recently published a book, Diversionismo Ideologico, where he writes about the political and social realities of Cubans of both shores through d√©cima poems [13]. While, the young Cuban visual artist Hamlet Lavastida has worked through many of his pieces, the \\"ideological diversionism speech\\" and many of the political texts that were instrumental to the making of a new revolutionary subject after the Cuban Revolution.

She is traditionally regarded as an example of female patriotism in the early Republic, though many scholars and historians dispute the historical accuracy of the stories and traditions surrounding her life. Early life Tempe Wick was born at Jockey Hollow in Morris County, New Jersey, the youngest of Henry Wick's five children. She was likely named after her paternal grandmother Temperance Barnes. The Wick family were one of the first and oldest families in America. Her father, Henry Wick, was a grandson of the Pilgrim Father John Wick, and was the wealthiest and largest landowner in that part of New Jersey.https://www.nps.gov/morr/learn/historyculture/jockey-hollow.htm Very little is known of her early life, but at the age of 21 she and her brother Henry Wick, Jr. were the last of the Wick children living at home with their elderly parents. Revolutionary War Henry Wick was commander of the Morris County Cavalry, which was responsible for protecting the New Jersey government and legislature. The winter of 1780-1781 was known as the Hard Winter because of its unprecedented severity. The Continental Army, consisting of more than 10,000 soldiers, made camp on the Wick family's 1400 acre estate, Jockey Hollow, while General Arthur St. Clair and his staff rented quarters in the Wick House.Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women edited by Joan N. Burstyn, p41 During the winter at Jockey Hollow, supplies for the large force put great burdens on the community. The troops were poorly clothed and fed, and many went barefoot in the snow. An estimated 100 soldiers died in the brigade hospital that winter and were buried in the field north of the Wick House. The Pennsylvania Line Mutiny Pennsylvania Line Mutiny Despite many requests and pleas to the Second Continental Congress, the soldiers wintering in Jockey Hollow had not been paid for most of the year and over a thousand soldiers had deserted. The issues came to a head in late December, when a group of Pennsylvania soldiers organized a mutiny. They planned to march to Philadelphia to demand their pay directly from Congress. The mutineers spent several days foraging through the countryside and stealing any horses and food they found. On December 21, 1780, Henry Wick died, leaving Tempe alone to care for her sick mother Mary and her mentally ill brother Henry. When her mother's condition worsened, Tempe saddled her horse and rode for the home of Doctor William Leddell, who lived about a mile away. The doctor was not present, so Tempe left a message at the Leddell residence and returned home. Along the way, she was accosted by three mutineers. One grabbed the bridle of her horse, demanding that she give them her mount. Tempe agreed, but when the soldier released the bridle to help her down from the saddle, she whipped her horse and raced for home. She arrived safely, but she feared the mutineers would follow her home and take the horse by force. According to one version of the story, Tempe led the horse into the house and hid it in a guest bedroom. She closed the shutter over the window and put a feather bed under it to muffle the sound of its hooves. The soldiers arrived soon after and searched the outbuildings, barn, and woods around the house, but left empty-handed. Tempe supposedly kept the horse hidden in the bedroom until New Year's Day, when the mutineers marched south to Princeton, New Jersey. In another version of the story, Tempe hid her horse in the kitchen. Claims are frequently made that a faint imprint of a horse's shoe can be seen in one of the bedrooms in the Wick House. The Wick House at Jockey Hollow still stands, and is now a part of the Morristown National Historical Park. Visitors are allowed to see the bedroom where Tempe is said to have hidden her horse.Wick House Later life After her mother Mary died on July 7, 1787, Tempe inherited Jockey Hollow, and married Dr. William Tuttle at the relatively late age of 30. Together they had five children. Historical accuracy Scholars dispute the historical accuracy of her life and the traditions surrounding her role in the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny, but she and her parents are frequently mentioned in extant historical documents from the period, including letters, journals, and receipts. Depictions in literature Tempe Wick is the main character in a short story written by the American story-teller Frank R. Stockton. His version emphasizes the patriotic virtues of American girls, using Tempe Wick as an example. However, most scholars agree that Stockton used very few sources when writing the story, and like most later writers and story-tellers who wrote about Tempe Wick, added many details of his own to the legend. Stockton's story is filled with exhortations to patriotism and courage: \\"When [Tempe] first began to canter over these hills and dales, it had been in times of peace, when there was nothing in this quiet country of which any one might be afraid; and now, although these were days of war, she felt no fear. There were soldiers not far away, but these she looked upon as her friends and protectors; for Washington and his army had encamped in that region to defend the country against the approach of the enemy.\\" Ann Rinaldi's historical fiction novel A Ride Into Morning centers on Tempe Wick and her family and is told from the perspective of Tempe's cousin Mary Cooper. Howard Fast's historical novel The Proud and the Free (1950) tells the story of the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny from the enlisted man's perspective.Fast, Howard The Proud and the Free (1950) Patricia Lee Gauch's version of the story, \\"This Time, Tempe Wick?\\", is a popular children's book.

Origin An octagonal brick tower in height was built on the site of the low light in 1893, with a higher tower behind it. It was designed by A.C. van Loon. Coming from the sea, the low light would be seen first, then the high light behind it. When the two were aligned vertically the ship was on the correct course to sail the Nieuwe Waterweg (New Waterway) leading to the Port of Rotterdam. However, it was soon obvious that the low light was too low, and it was replaced by a round cast iron tower, the last cast iron lighthouse to be built in the Netherlands. History The red cast iron tower was built in 1899 by Penn & Bauduin of Dordrecht. It is made of many cast iron components bolted together. There are four floors and 42 steps. At first the tower had a 2,000 candlepower gas light. In 1913 this was replaced by a 12,000 candlepower gas light. In 1921 the light was replaced by a 20,000 candlepower electric light. In 1967 the light was turned off and the tower painted grey. The construction of Europoort had extended the shore line, and the two lights were now too far from the waterway entrance. A temporary arrangement of spotlights on a scaffold was erected, and in 1974 nine modern concrete lighthouses replaced the old coastal lights. In 1977 the tower was transported in two parts from Leuvehaven to Rotterdam, and in 1990 it was erected in the Maritime museum in Rotterdam. It was repainted to its original reddish-brown color. A similar tower to the old low light used to stand in Kijkduin. In 2004 this tower was transported by Chinook helicopter to the original site of the old low light. In 2006 a petition to return the old low light to its original site gained 2,000 signatures.

William Vaughan, drawing of the 1811 bust by Francis Chantrey Life Born on 22 September 1752, he was the second son of Samuel Vaughan, a merchant in London and Jamaica, by his wife Sarah, daughter of Benjamin Hallowell of Boston, Massachusetts. Benjamin Vaughan was his elder brother. He was educated at Newcome's School in Hackney and Warrington Academy. After leaving school Vaughan entered his father's business, and became prominent in commerce. In April 1782 Vaughan travelled to Amsterdam to meet John Adams, as part of the negotiations to end the American War of Independence. In 1783 he was elected a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation, and continued in it, as director, sub-governor, and governor, until 1829. During the Nore mutiny in 1797, Vaughan formed one of the committee of London merchants convened to meet at the Royal Exchange to deal with it. He independently drew up a short address to the seamen which was put in circulation by the naval authorities. From 1793 to 1797 Vaughan published a series of pamphlets and tracts advocating the construction of docks for the Port of London. On 22 April 1796 he gave evidence before a parliamentary committee in favour of the bill for establishing wet docks. Later that year he was on the committee planning docks, with Robert Milligan, George Hibbert and Beeston Long. Plans were laid for docks at Wapping; but the following year Milligan and Hibbert broke away to follow their own, more exclusive plans at the Isle of Dogs.museumoflondon.org.uk, Robert Milligan statue.

Life  Bonifatius Stirnberg: Statue of Gregor in Burtscheid, in front of St. Michael Church. Gregor von Burtscheid was known in Germany as Gregor von Calabria. He was born in Cerchiara di Calabria (Cosenza province) in Calabria at a time when that region was still under the influence of the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Otto III founded the Burtscheid Abbey in 997 in the independent city of Burtscheid, and installed Gregor, who until this time was abbot of the Basilian monastery of St. Andreas in Calabria, as first Abbot. Gregor died 4 November 999 with a reputation as a holy man, and thus after his death, his bones were held in the nearby Nicholas Chapel (Nikolaus-kapelle). Around 1190, an Abbot by the name of Arnold transferred the bones to the Abbey church. By the end of the 12th century, Gregor was bestowed the honor of the altars (zur Ehre der Alt√§re), and the date of his death was celebrated as a feast day at the abbey, until it was dissolved in 1802. Due to the heavy bombing of Burtscheid on 11 April 1944, Gregor von Burtscheid's grave was destroyed. The remnants of his bones that could be salvaged were kept in a silver casket. These small reliquaries were transferred in 1996 to the Berdolet altar, which stands in St. Johann Church in Aachen-Burtscheid, where the previous abbey church once stood. Since 2010, Abbot Gregor has been the patron saint of the dissolved rectories of St Gregorius, Sacred Heart, St. John, and St Michael, as well as the patron of the newly founded parish of St. Gregor von Burtscheid.St. Gregor von Burtscheid: Willkommen , 2.

He worked in his profession until shortly before his death and was at the time the oldest practising solicitor in the country, and was regarded as the father of his profession in his city. He joined the solicitor Frederick Merriman and they called their firm Merriman & Jackson. Upon Merriman's death in 1865, he took on a new partner and the firm was renamed Jackson Russell, by which name it is still known today. In his younger years, he was involved in provincial politics. Early life Jackson was born in 1831 in Providence Green, Green Hammerton, near Harrogate, Yorkshire, England. He was the son of Samuel Jackson (1806‚Äì1858), a brewer and yeoman who owned and farmed his land, and Sarah Jackson (n√©e Hughlings; 1807/08‚Äì1836), the daughter of a Welsh revenue collector. His mother died when he was five. He had three brothers and a sister; all but his youngest brother emigrated to New Zealand. His parents had married on 24 March 1828. His oldest sibling was his sister Ann (30 April 1829 ‚Äì 9 August 1859). She died three days after giving birth to her first child. He himself was the oldest of the brothers and he was born on 16 April 1831, and baptised a month later on 24 May. His brother William was the third of the children; he was born on 11 October 1832 and baptised a month later on 12 November. Thomas (2 December 1833 ‚Äì 15 November 1906) was the next sibling. He became a mariner and also emigrated to New Zealand. His youngest brother, John (4 April 1835 ‚Äì 7 October 1911), remained in England and became a prominent neurologist. Jackson studied law at the University of York, then joined the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1853. He emigrated to New Zealand in 1855 on the Merchantman and arrived in Auckland from Plymouth on 4 September 1855. Amongst the other passengers was the family of Reverend James Mandeno. He married Sarah Anne Mandeno, the eldest daughter of the family, on 26 August 1856. Political career On 8 April 1864, John Anderson Gilfillan and Jackson were appointed to the Executive Council of the Auckland Provincial Council; they replaced William Daldy and Joseph May. Whilst Gilfillan had previously been a provincial councillor as well as a member of the executive council, neither of them were provincial councillors at that time, and Jackson was never an elected member. The source does not state an end date for Jackson's membership of the executive council. From 21 July to 12 October 1865, Jackson was the 5th Deputy-Superintendent of Auckland Province. Professional career Within two weeks of arriving, Jackson made the necessary declaration and was admitted as an attorney and solicitor of the Supreme Court. Within a short time, he worked in the office of the solicitor Frederick Merriman. In July 1856, the first advertisement of 'Merriman & Jackson' appeared in the Daily Southern Cross, the largest Auckland newspaper at that time. Upon Merriman's death in 1865, the firm was joined by James Russell and was renamed Jackson Russell. James Russell retired from the firm about 1903 on the death of his brother, Thomas Russell, who had been Chairman of Directors of the Waihi mine. Jackson had a long and distinguished legal career, and gained the respect of the whole profession. He practised until approximately a year before his death and was thus active in his profession in New Zealand for over 55 years, which made him the oldest practising solicitor in New Zealand at that point. He became generally regarded as the father of the profession in Auckland. His firm is still known as Jackson Russell today. During his career, Jackson advised many rich benefactors regarding their bequests. When John Edward Elam came to see him about a suitable cause to leave his estate to, Jackson suggested that a school that teaches fine art was needed. As a result, the Elam School of Fine Arts was set up. Edward Costley had no relatives, so proposed to leave his wealth to Jackson and his children, to which Jackson replied: \\"I'm cosy. Leave it to Auckland.\\" Seven charities benefited from Costley's estate, and one of the buildings at Greenlane Hospital came from this. Another case was James Dilworth, who bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the Dilworth Ulster Institute Trust, which established Dilworth School with this funding. Family Since his marriage in 1856, Jackson lived at Orakei Road, Remuera. Before trams were introduced, he walked to his office in downtown Auckland on a daily basis, a distance of each way. Their first child was christened Samuel, and he was sent to England for his secondary education and to study law. Samuel Jackson Jr. joined the legal profession in Auckland, but emigrated to Oakland, California, USA, in 1890. A further son, born in 1870, was christened John Hughlings. Jackson died on 29 July 1913 at his residence and was survived by his wife and several children: Samuel Jackson (by then living in San Francisco), John Hughlings and G. J. Jackson (auctioneers in Auckland under the name T. Mandeno Jackson), Thornton Jackson LLB (employed at Jackson and Russell), Mrs A. Blair (of Wellington), Mrs W. Madill (of Auckland), Miss Ruth Jackson, Mrs Proude (of Auckland), H. Hughlings Jackson (Chief Mechanical Engineer at the New Zealand Railways Department), and Mrs Andrew Hanna (of Auckland). His son Thomas Mandeno Jackson, the founder of the auctioneering business, had died five years before him. At the time of his death, he had 23 grandchildren.

With an educational background of grammar and philosophy, he became a highly skillful orator and political figure, attaining the position of the Attorney General. He generated a vast wealth through his trading activities. He was honored with a bust in the patio of the Palacio Li√©vano. Early life Born in 1773 in Charal√°, he was baptized in the Mongu√≠ parish. He was descended from noble Spanish families on both sides. He studied at the Our Lady of the Rosary University. While he read the classics and liberal philosophers of the eighteenth century, he did not pursue a degree. Instead, he developed skills in trade. He evolved as a very good orator, and with this skill he could promote freedom movements of the country. In the field of business trading, which he operated from 1810 from Bogot√°, his cousin Miguel Tadeo Gomez Duran (in 1810, Gomez Duran was also an administrator of a royal trading company in Socorro) was his partner. He was considered a rebellious merchant. Career He moved to San Gil where he held various public offices. In Bogot√°, he delivered his oratory, \\"The Tribune of Pueblo\\". Here, he prospered as a trader, while training in law and philosophy. In 1808, he was appointed Perpetual Regidor of the Cabildo of Santa Fe. The same year, Spain was invaded by the French, and Acevedo participated in the oath of allegiance to King Ferdinand VII, but also stated the need to form a Governing Board. During 1809, he engaged in conspiracies seeking to depose the Viceroy Antonio Jos√© Amar y Borb√≥n, to form an independent government. He became interested in the emerging proposals for the emancipation of the American colonies and decided to begin organizing meetings with other intellectuals and leaders of the city which culminated with the Cry of Independence of Colombia of July 20, 1810, when street riots began, turning chaotic and ineffective. Popular leaders proclaimed their tribute to Acevedo, trying to harness his excellent oratory skills, and he addressed the crowd at the central square of the city with a speech that fueled the need to seize the moment to organize as an autonomous government. He stated: :\\"Santafere√±os: If you lose the moment of effervescence and heat, if you let this opportunity escape single and happy, within twelve hours shall be treated as insurgents: behold the dungeons, shackles and chains that await you.\\" With six other patriots, Antoni Narino, Camilo Torres Tenorio, Francisco Jose de Caldas, Jorge Tadeo and Lozano, he met on 20 July 1810 and proclaimed the independence of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. They had gathered in the main plaza of the country's capital city, Bogot√°, in an open-air meeting. The seven patriots of the group were known as the \\"Colombian Founding Fathers\\". On the morning of 21 July 1810, a document was drafted by Antonio Jos√© known as the ‚ÄúAct of Independence‚Äù and was signed by the members of the group. This document clearly spelt out the autonomous status of New Grenada to be governed under Federal system. The autonomy was to enable the people to govern themselves through a constitution. Following this declaration there were agitations and riots between rival groups of people. This group's decision called the junta proclamation stated that ‚Äúit no longer recognized the Supreme Regency Council, marking a decisive moment: no corporation or person located in or hailing from the peninsula have authority over these lands except for Ferdinand VII.‚Äù During the period known as \\"Patria Boba\\", Acevedo participated in the independence rebellions of Cundinamarca and Tunja. He held positions in government during the Patria Boba. But when the forces of General Pablo Morillo regained much of United Provinces of New Granada, Acevedo took refuge in the jungles of Caquet√°. While there, he fell ill and died in May 1817.

Stringer, Author, Entrepreneur Early life Stringer grew up in Detroit, Michigan. Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father was an electrical engineer for General Motors. She graduated from the prestigious Cass Technical High School in 1985. She briefly attended Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and was in the process of transferring to Ohio State University when she became romantically involved with a drug dealer. The two had a son in 1992, after which Stringer and the boy's father separated. In order to support herself and her son, Stringer then turned to dealing drugs herself, and also worked as a manager of an escort service. In September 1994, Stringer was arrested on federal drug trafficking and money-laundering charges after selling two- kilograms of cocaine to a police informant in Columbus, Ohio. She pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering and received a seven- year sentence in a federal prison. Writing career While in prison, Stringer wrote her first novel Let That Be The Reason. She was released from prison in January 2001, and began working as a bartender. Stringer attempted to interest publishers and agents in her manuscript and was rejected twenty- six times. She borrowed money from her family and had a printer make a small number of copies of her book, which she then marketed and sold on her own. Sales were so good that Stringer soon had enough capital to found Triple Crown Publications - named after her drug crew - to publish her works and those of other writers, principally in the urban fiction genre, aimed at a demographic largely ignored by major publishers. Publisher Weekly Magazine named her, \\"The Reigning Queen\\" of Urban fiction and Book Magazine name one of the \\"Most 50 influential Women\\" in publishing. Additionally, her novel has been translated in Japanese for worldwide distribution and acclaim. Stringer's second novel, Imagine This, was purchased by Simon & Schuster imprint Atria Books as part of a six-figure two-book publishing deal. As with her debut (Let That Be The Reason) novel, Imagine This spent more than a two years on the Essence paperback bestseller list. Simon & Schuster Atria offered Stringer additional publishing deals which resulted in more best-sellers as her well-received \\"Red Series\\": Dirty Red, Still Dirty, Dirtier Than Ever, Low Down & Dirty and Dirty Love.  Entrepreneur  Stringer is credited for creating the genre, \\"Hip- Hop\\" fiction by the niche success of her publishing company Triple Crown Publications. In its 15th year in business Triple Crown Publications has broken barriers and launched the carriers of the biggest literary names in the urban fiction genre.

The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. Purpose The purpose of the sales force compensation metric is to determine the mix of salary, bonus, and commission that will maximize sales generated by the sales force. When designing a compensation plan for a sales force, managers face four key considerations: level of pay, mix between salary and incentive, measures of performance, and performance-payout relationships. The level of pay, or compensation, is the amount that a company plans to pay a salesperson over the course of a year. This can be viewed as a range, because its total will vary with bonuses or commissions. Construction Managers enjoy considerable freedom in designing compensation systems. The key is to start with a forecast for sales and a range within which each salesperson's compensation should reside. After these elements are determined, there are many ways to motivate a salesperson. Key formulas in this area include the following: :Compensation ($) = Salary ($) + Bonus 1 ($) + Bonus 2 ($) :Compensation ($) = Salary ($) + [Sales ($) x Commission (%)] Break-even number of employees After a sales compensation plan has been established, management may want to reevaluate the size of its sales force. Based on forecasts for the coming year, the firm may have room to hire more salespeople, or it may need to reduce the size of the sales force. On the basis of a given value for projected sales, managers can determine the break- even number of employees for a firm as follows: :Breakeven number of employees (#) = {Sales ($) x [Margin (%) - Commission (%)]} √∑ ({Salary ($) + Expenses ($) + Bonus ($)}) See also * Performance-related pay  References   External links  * MASB Official Website Category:Marketing analytics ","title":"Sales force compensation"},{"id":"39413218","text":"Wurld may refer to: *Wurld Media, American company 1999-2008 *Wurld (musician) (born 1987), Nigerian musician See also * *World (disambiguation) ","title":"Wurld"},{"id":"39413233","text":"Fandoq Poshteh (; also known as Fand≈´q Poshteh) is a village in Heyran Rural District, in the Central District of Astara County, Gilan Province, Iran.

During his Stanford career, he batted .340 with 124 runs, 132 RBIs, 43 doubles, 12 home runs and 62 walks in 172 games. Professional career St. Louis Cardinals The St. Louis Cardinals selected Piscotty in the first round, with the 36th overall selection, of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft and signed him on June 16 with a $1.4 million bonus. After playing in the infield for the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class A Midwest League in 2012, the Cardinals moved him to the outfield before the 2013 season. His first season showed mixed results as he batted .295 with a .376 on-base percentage, .448 slugging percentage, four home runs, 18 doubles and 27 RBIs, but committed 22 errors in just 36 games at third base. The Cardinals assigned Piscotty to the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL) in 2013, where he was selected as an All-Star. After batting .295 with 15 home runs in 112 games for Palm Beach and the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League in 2013, the Cardinals assigned Piscotty to the Arizona Fall League (AFL) to play for the Salt River Rafters. Piscotty spent the 2014 season with the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and opened the 2015 season with Memphis. There, he batted .272 with an .841 OPS in 87 games for the Redbirds. =2015= First baseman Ryan Howard (right) of the Philadelphia Phillies holding Piscotty on first base in a game in 2016 The St. Louis Cardinals promoted Piscotty to their major league roster on July 21, 2015. He made his major league debut that night as the starting left fielder against the Chicago White Sox in an 8‚Äì5 win, and singled off Carlos Rodon in his second at bat for his first hit. His sacrifice fly scored Peter Kozma on July 25 and was the only run of the game and game-winner in a 1‚Äì0 win over the Atlanta Braves for his first RBI. His first home run came at Busch Stadium on August 16 in a 6‚Äì4 loss to the Miami Marlins, and he hit his first triple the next day in a 2‚Äì1 win over the San Francisco Giants. Piscotty set a career- high five RBI on August 23 against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park, including his first career multi-home run game, while adding a triple. The first four-hit game of Piscotty's professional, and major league, career was in 6‚Äì0 win over the Giants at AT&T; Park on August 29. While playing the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 28, Piscotty was injured on a fly ball into left field when he collided with Peter Bourjos' knee, which hit him in the head. He suffered a bruise, but tests results were negative for injury, including concussion. His regular season totals in the major leagues included a .305 batting average, .359 on-base percentage, .494 slugging percentage, seven home runs and 39 RBI. Ready for game action in time for the playoffs, Piscotty's first playoff appearance was in the National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Chicago Cubs. There, he hit both his first career postseason home run and double in a 4‚Äì0 win. The Cardinals lost the NLDS in four games, but Piscotty batted .375 with 1.000 SLG, three home runs and six RBI in four games. He tied for sixth in the National League Rookie of the Year Award voting, and was the franchise's Minor League Player of the Year for 2015. He lost to the winner of the National League Rookie of the Year Award to Cubs' third baseman Kris Bryant. =2016= After spring training of 2016, Piscotty won the role of starting right fielder for the Cardinals. While facing Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals on May 27, Piscotty hit his first career grand slam in a 6‚Äì2 win. Piscotty finished his first full season in the majors batting .273 with 22 home runs and 85 RBI's. Piscotty also finished the season batting .363 with runners in scoring position. =2017= Now 26, he signed a six-year extension for a reported $33.75 million ($5.625 mil. average), with a $15 million option for 2023 on April 3. Piscotty was not yet arbitration-eligible, and his first year of free-agent eligibility was to be 2022. Five years ago, the Cardinals plucked Piscotty out of Stanford University with one of the two picks they netted as compensation for Albert Pujols' departure. Since making his big league debut, Piscotty has posted a .282/.349/.467 slash line and an .816 OPS. In 2016, Piscotty led the Cards in games played (153), runs scored (86), RBIs (85) and game-winning RBIs (10). The day after signing a new contract, he received the rare distinction of getting hit by a ball three times in one AB and trip around the bases, including a bruised head in scoring a run on April 4. At bat, he was hit by a pitch near the right elbow. Piscotty then hustled to second on a wild pitch, only to be struck on the left elbow by the catcher's throw. After a bobbled- ball error in the infield, giving him an opening to take the extra base, he sprinted home. The second baseman's throw hit him in the left side of his head, wearing a helmet, as he slid in 'safe at home'. He was subject to concussion tests before he can return to action after taking the hit by the ball, sustaining a contusion. Starting pitcher and teammate Adam Wainwright said afterwards, \\"Probably the roughest turn around the bases I've ever seen.\\" He passed the concussion protocol on April 5, clearing him to play. He said he was more sore around his right elbow where he was hit by the pitch to start the unusual sequence of getting hit three times in that one inning at bat. He took personal leave on May 26. After returning from personal leave, Piscotty was placed on the DL once again and missed 16 games. Piscotty returned from the DL, and was subsequently optioned to Triple-A Memphis due to his underachieving year, with a .232 batting average. Oakland Athletics On December 14, 2017, the Cardinals traded Piscotty to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Yairo Mu√±oz and Max Schrock. The trade came at the request of Piscotty who wished to be closer to his mother, Gretchen, who was battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Gretchen would pass away on May 6, 2018. On May 15, 2018, in his first game back after returning from bereavement leave following the death of his mother, Piscotty hit a home run. Piscotty hit 27 home runs and drove in 88 runs in his first year with the A's, both career highs. Following the season, he won the Tony Conigliaro Award. On June 29, 2019, Piscotty sprained his knee trying to slide into second base in a game at the Los Angeles Angels. The injury limited him to 94 games in the 2019 season where he batted .249 with 13 home runs and 44 RBI. During the 2020 season, Piscotty hit two grand slams: one on August 4 to walk off the Texas Rangers 5-1, and one on August 14 against the San Francisco Giants to tie the game in the ninth inning, which the A's began trailing 7-2. Skills profile With a short, compact swing, Piscotty consistently hits to the gaps. In the FSL, which is considered a pitcher-friendly league, he hit .292 with a .477 slugging percentage in 63 games. As of September 2013, he is thought to have a hit tool and approach that should help him get to the Major Leagues, but scouts are unsure if he will develop the type of power that is associated with corner outfield positions. He is rated to have a smooth swing and a strong arm. As a pitcher, he has been clocked up to .

The poem is a 200+ line lyric poem, written in the first person, broadly encompassing the relationship of an individual to humanity and nature. The narrator is contemplating a vista from a mountaintop. Overwhelmed by nature, and thoughts of human suffering, the narrator empathetically feels the deaths of others, and feels pressed into a grave. Friendly rain brings the narrator back to joy in life‚Äîthe rebirth, or \\"renascence\\", of the title.  Publication history and importance to Millay's career  Millay's fame began in 1912 when the nineteen-year-old, encouraged by her mother, entered her poem \\"Renascence\\" in a poetry contest in The Lyric Year.\\"Edna St. Vincent Millay\\", Poets.org (last visited May 17, 2013). Millay had written and published poetry in St. Nicholas, a children's magazine, throughout her teen years, and had become a proficient poet.Thomas Mallon, \\"Hustler with a Lyric Voice\\", Atlantic, Oct. 2001. At some point, Millay wrote \\"Renascence\\" while looking out from the summit of Mt. Battie in Camden, Maine (where a plaque now commemorates the writing of the poem).[http://maineanencyclopedia.com/millay- edna-st-vincent/ \\"Millay, Edna St. Vincent\\", Maine: An Encyclopedia. The poem may have been influenced by Millay's childhood experience of nearly drowning. Her mother, Cora Millay, saw an announcement for a poetry contest sponsored by The Lyric Year, an annual volume of poetry, and encouraged Edna to enter the poem into the contest. The poem was well received and was published in the annual volume, along with other best entries. On publication, Millay's poem was widely considered the best submission, and her eventual award of fourth place caused a major scandal. The first-place winner Orrick Johns was among those who felt that \\"Renascence\\" was the best poem, and stated that \\"the award was as much an embarrassment to me as a triumph.\\" A second-prize winner offered Millay his $250 prize money. The scandal brought Millay much attention, and \\"Renascence\\" was widely distributed and even taught to schoolchildren as an exemplar of American poetry. Millay used the publication to promote her own career, maintaining correspondence with editors and poets who congratulated her on her publication. In the immediate aftermath of the Lyric Year controversy, wealthy arts patron Caroline B. Dow heard Millay reciting her poetry and playing the piano at the Whitehall Inn in Camden, Maine, and was so impressed that she offered to pay for Millay‚Äôs education at Vassar College.

Research  Acharya's major research interests include the diffusion of ideas and norms in world politics, and constructivist International Relations (IR) theory more generally; comparative regionalism, with a focus on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); and contributions to IR theory and practice from the Global South, or Global IR.\\"Theory Talk #42 - Amitav Acharya,\\" (On the Relevance of Regions, ASEAN, and Western IR's false universalisms), 10 August 2011. http://www.theory-talks.org/2011/08/theory-talk-42.html\\"Constructing Security and Identity in Southeast Asia,\\" Interview with Amitav Acharya published by the Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol.11, no.2 (Winter-Spring 2006), 155‚Äì164. http://www.bjwa.org/article.php?id=Bsg9lE965f1HviKf8L7VqWf0xYX7FR347fH0dj0l Acharya's research combines and cuts across these different topics, often touching upon multiple themes in a single work.  Norm localization and norm subsidiarity  Acharya's principal contributions that advance constructivist IR theory are the concepts of norm localization and norm subsidiarity. Constructivism has traditionally accorded more importance to the role of ideas and norms in international politics compared to realism and liberalism. However, Acharya points out that most constructivists conceive of ideas as spreading outward from the West (or the Global North) to the \\"Rest\\" (or the Global South). Acharya challenges this story of unidirectional norm diffusion by showing how \\"local\\" beliefs and practices also matter. Using case studies from ASEAN, Acharya highlights how Southeast Asian leaders did not just accept transnational norms as is. Rather, where such transnational norms were in line with prior local beliefs, or \\"cognitive priors\\", they were successfully \\"localized\\". This is exemplified in how the ASEAN states localized the \\"common security\\" norm of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe into \\"cooperative security\\" as manifested in the ASEAN Regional Forum. While the cooperative security norm recognized the need for inclusive regional security cooperation, it rejected the legalistic and domestic politics aspects of the common security norm, in line with the basic tenets of the ASEAN Way. While norm localization emphasizes the agency of local actors in adapting prevailing transnational norms, norm subsidiarity is concerned with the creation of new norms by local actors. Norm subsidiarity posits that local actors create new norms and rules with a view toward protecting the norm's autonomy from violation and abuse at the international level. In contrast to localization, which is inward-looking, subsidiarity is outward-looking. Acharya again uses a case from Southeast Asia to illustrate the concept. In resistance to the US-led collective defence organization of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization signed in 1954, the leaders of South and Southeast Asia met at the Bandung Conference in 1955 and established their support for the norm of collective defence but rejected the use of such an arrangement for the defence of a single country. In so doing, the leaders at Bandung not only rejected the central position of the United States in regional security arrangements, but also created a new norm of collective defence that accorded importance to all treaty members. A number of IR scholars have built on, engaged with, and challenged Acharya's work on norms, including Antje Wiener, Lisbeth Zimmerman, and Kathryn Sikkink. Through her concept of \\"norm protagonism\\", Sikkink goes beyond Acharya by divorcing the formation and diffusion of norms in the Global South from the North. She illustrates how Latin American countries were protagonists of human rights norms and, among other things, adopted the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man in April 1948, eight months before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948.  Comparative regionalism  Acharya places a high importance on the study of regions in world politics. His work has attempted to bridge the gap between scholarship in IR and area studies by encouraging conversation between \\"regionally oriented disciplinarists\\" and \\"discipline-oriented regionalists\\". For Acharya, rather than imagining a \\"world of regions\\", where it is primarily superpowers that shape how and when regions are important, it is more useful to think of \\"regional worlds\\", where the roles of external powers are balanced by the countries that constitute the region and construct it from within. Acharya's most prolific work has been on ASEAN. In Constructing a Security Community in Southeast Asia, Acharya traces the evolution of ASEAN and the ASEAN Way of conflict management, which is based on the ASEAN norms of non- interference and avoidance of confrontations in word and deed. Building upon the work on the concept of a security community‚Äîa region where the outbreak of war has become almost unthinkable‚Äîby Karl Deutsch and Emanuel Adler and Michael Barnett, Acharya finds that ASEAN exhibits the characteristics of a nascent pluralistic security community. Acharya has also been critical of the Eurocentrism prevalent in comparative regionalism, whereby the European Union (EU) is considered as the best way to regionalize‚Äîa model for regional integration‚Äîand regionalism projects in other parts of the world are judged against the EU. Rather than compare with the EU, Acharya calls for studies in comparative regionalism to focus more on the specific regional contexts of regionalism projects and to develop more general criteria for comparison that are not based solely on the European experience.  Global IR and a multiplex world order  In line with his focus on the role and contributions of the Global South to IR theory and practice, Acharya has advanced what he terms \\"Global IR\\". One aspect of Global IR is to uncover sources of IR theory from the non-Western world to counterbalance the dominating influence of European history‚Äîfrom the Peloponnesian War in Ancient Greece to the nineteenth-century balance of power under the Concert of Europe‚Äîon contemporary IR theory. Along with Barry Buzan, Acharya has published two books on Global International Relations theory that explore scholarly thinking as well as teaching traditions on international relations and foreign policy throughout the Global South. One reason Acharya and Buzan transitioned from \\"non-Western\\" to \\"Global\\" IR theory is that Global IR, while challenging traditional IR's neglect and marginalization of the Global South, does not reject the mainstream theories, thus differentiating Acharya from postcolonial IR scholars. Global IR revolves around six main dimensions: *It is based on pluralistic universalism that recognizes diversity and abjures universal imposition *It is grounded in world history *It supplements and subsumes, rather than supplants, traditional IR *It includes the study of regions as a core part of IR *It eschews exceptionalism *It recognizes both ideational and material forms of agency Acharya's concept of the \\"multiplex world order\\" captures his understanding of the ongoing changes and future directions in the landscape of international relations. While not arguing that the United States is in decline per se, Acharya contends that the \\"American world order\\", whereby the United States played a hegemonic role in shaping the international system‚Äîor the \\"liberal world order\\"‚Äîto its own benefit through its dominant role in international institutions and its interventionalist foreign policy, is coming to an end. In this respect, Acharya disagrees with John Ikenberry, who highlights America's important role in designing, spearheading, and maintaining postwar \\"constitutional orders\\". In contrast to Ikenberry, Acharya finds evidence of an emerging \\"multiplex\\" world order, where there is an array of plots (ideas), directors (power), and action (leadership) under one roof (the international system) to choose from.  Professional activities  Acharya was elected President of the International Studies Association (ISA) for 2014‚Äì15. He was the first Indian, Asian, and non-Western scholar to be elected as ISA President. He was a Vice-President of the ISA in 2008‚Äì09. He is one of the founders of the Asian Political and International Studies Association (APISA), and served as its inaugural co-president in 2003‚Äì04.http://www.amitavacharya.com/sites/default/files/Acharya- Identity%20Without%20Exceptionalism.pdf He is the joint chief editor of the Studies in Asian Security series for Stanford University Press. Acharya's work has been influential in shaping policy on Asian regionalism and human security.

Its constitution defines it as a not-for-profit unincorporated association. It is commonly regarded as being one of the first, if not the first, explicitly neo-pagan Druid Orders. The order draws on medieval Welsh texts such as the Mabinogion and other early British/Celtic texts for inspiration and to re-connect with the pre-Christian, indigenous religious and spiritual practices of Britain which it believes to be shamanic in nature. History Founded in 1979 with the creation of the original Mother Grove, The Grove of the Badger, in Hastings, Sussex, England by Philip Shallcrass, the current Chief of the Order. By 1992, the BDO was publishing and disseminating pagan literature focused on the shamanic traditions of the Islands of Britain. The Gorsedd of Bards of Caer Abiri was co-founded at Avebury in 1993 by the BDO with ritual designed by Philip Shallcrass In 1995, Philip Shallcrass was joined by Emma Restall Orr as joint chief of the order. The first US Gorsedd, Caer Pugetia, was founded in Seattle during a visit to America by the joint chiefs of the Order in 1997 and the Gorsedd of Bards of Cor Gawr founded at Stonehenge as part of the BDO's work to extend ritual access to the site. In 2002, Emma Restall Orr stepped down as joint chief of the order in order to set up The Druid Network, following which in 2003 the BDO Circle of Elders was formed. By 2010, the BDO had completed construction of an Iron Age style Roundhouse which has since been the focus of training, workshops and ritual for the order. 2011 saw the launch of the BDO's Bardic training, with its first Bards graduating in 2013. 2013 also saw the launch of the Druid Hedge Schools initiative, a loose network of pagan Druid trainings intended to promote Druidry as a spiritual practice in the modern world. Principle Beliefs The British Druid Order follows the contemporary tradition of neo-druidry with its threefold division of the Order membership into Bards, Ovates and Druids. BDO Druidry * is animistic, seeing all things as imbued with spirit, * is polytheistic, recognising many gods and goddesses, * venerates ancestors of blood (our direct physical forebears) and of spirit (those who have walked similar spiritual paths before us) and * venerates Spirit of place. The order believes that the pre-Christian, indigenous religious and spiritual practices of the original Druids were shamanic in nature, and works to reconstruct such practices in a form as a spiritual system answering to the needs of the 21st century where possible and to reconnect with the spirit of them where not, a process referred to by the BDO as 'rekindling the sacred fire.'The title of the BDO introductory book published by the Order in 1992, with revised editions in 1996 and 2002. Practically, the British Druid Order seeks to understand and work with the spirit of inspiration and creativity known in the British Druid tradition as 'awen' through study, ritual, folklore, healing and many other practices to facilitate connections to sources of knowledge, inspiration and wisdom beyond the confines of the human psyche and rooted in the natural world. It also sees political and practical activism, in the areas of ecology, as a spiritual obligation. Publications The following is a list of publications that the BDO have produced. Tooth and Claw is still published on an occasional basis. * The Druid's Voice: The Magazine of Contemporary Druidry * Tooth and Claw: The Journal of the British Druid Order * Gorseddau: Newsletter of the Gorsedd of Bards of the Isles of Britain References External links * British Druid Order website Category:Neo-druidism in Britain Category:Magical organizations Category:Religious organizations established in 1979 Category:Neopagan organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Neo-druid orders ","title":"British Druid Order"},{"id":"39413525","text":"Steinkilenuten is a mountain in the municipality of Suldal in Rogaland county, Norway.

She is based in British Columbia, Canada. Her paintings have been exhibited in Canada and internationally and she is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.  Biography  Sandra Meigs was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1953. She was a ceramics major at the Rhode Island School of Design from 1971 to 1973 and obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, in Halifax in 1975. She completed her Master of Arts in Philosophy at Dalhousie University in 1980. She began her career as a painter in Toronto, and in 1993 moved to Victoria, British Columbia where she was a Professor in Visual Arts at the University of Victoria for 24 years. She retired in July 2017 after 24 years with their Visual Arts Department. She taught painting 101, as well as theory to all levels of students, both graduate and undergraduate. Meigs‚Äô paintings have been widely exhibited in Canada and internationally. She is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.  Art practice  Meigs is known for her vivid, enigmatic paintings that combine dense narratives with comic elements.\\"This is Paradise: From the National Gallery of Canada Collection.\\" The Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art. Accessed June 7, 2013. Her paintings are often provocative, providing layers of meaning that are gradually revealed. Her work typically explores psychological spaces and philosophical ideas, and, as John Bentley Mays notes in a National Post article,‚Äú[Meigs‚Äô] topics are those of the cave-painters of the Stone Age and artists ever since: the body, light and darkness, storytelling.‚ÄùBentley, John Mays. ‚ÄúThe thinking person‚Äôs artist‚Äù. The National Post (1 September 2001) Her works usually contain an element of paradox that encourages viewers to look for multiple meanings.McMackon, Jennifer. \\"Scenes from My Affection at Susan Hobbs Gallery.\\" Big Red and Shiny Journal. Accessed June 7, 2013. As David Jager writes in NOW Magazine, ‚ÄúMeigs‚Äô textured surfaces and silhouette shapes seem casually naive at first glance, but they are actually carefully planned. Layering the canvas with gesso, she produces smooth raised lines and surfaces whose negative spaces hold as many surprises as her blobby and colourful shapes.\\" Jager, David. ‚ÄúFresh Wind From the West: Three Vancouver Conceptual Artists Play with Colour and Form‚Äù. Now Magazine (March 2‚Äì8, 2006) Meigs works in various media and often experiments with new techniques and unusual combinations of materials. Her 2010 body of work entitled The Fold Heads, for example, straddles the line between painting and sculpture.  Teaching experience  During her Master of Philosophy studies, Meigs worked as a teaching assistant at Dalhousie from 1977 to 1979. From 1983 onwards she taught art techniques in Banff; she was the Chief Administrative Assistant to the head of the Visual Art Department at the Banff School of Fine Arts. From 1984 to 1985 she worked as an art instructor at York University. She eventually moved on to be a guest Thesis Counsellor in the Graduate Division of York University. She taught introduction to painting at the University of Toronto between 1990 to 1993 and then moved on to work at the University of Victoria. She became an associate professor teaching in their department of Visual Arts. She eventually retired in 2017 after 24 years of teaching. Her teaching practise focused on a hands-on learning rather than straight theory. Selected works * Room of 1000 Paintings, (1986);- This work was displayed at the Toronto Pearson International Airport and consisted of a room of paintings in plain colours. It depicted various faces with different expressions. * Love Muscle, (1989);- When displayed at the National Gallery of Canada, the titles of each work consisted of one word from the sentence: When she whispered penetrate his rocket blasted into her yearning flower. * Baby, (1994);- Consisting of 12 paintings of oil on linen, sandblasted cedar, plywood frames and title plaques, these 12 panels in the style of children's nursery rhymes tell the story of a woman who drops her baby in a canyon. * Canadian, (1995);- This series of 15 abstract landscape paintings use oil on linen, text panels and frames. They were displayed at the Art Gallery of Ontario and based on children‚Äôs books and fairy tales. * Reckless Days, (1997);- These 8 works were installed in a row at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. They use oil on panel, electric lights, silver Mylar and title plaques. Each painting was labelled as a time of day but were not installed in chronological order. * Resin Heads, (1988);- These 25 paintings were constructed with fiberglass, resin, ethafoam, marine paint and floor vinyl to resemble human faces. They were installed alongside two circular floor displays, one alternating the words RESIN and HEADS while the other alternated the words SAVE and FACE. The Resin Heads were displayed at the Susan Hobbs Gallery. Blake Gopnik, a visual art critic wrote in the Globe and Mail that this exhibition gives ‚Äúus a study in emotional minimalism.‚Äù Then elaborates that this minimalism and the ‚Äúunreadable expressions [of her heads] would be enough to get us pondering its wearer‚Äôs feelings but assembled in a gathering brought together like a tribe that actively excludes us ‚Äì the effect becomes more sinister.‚Äù * The Newborn, (2001);- These 12 paintings were installed at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. Meigs conceived the idea for her work while in Cougar Annie‚Äôs Garden. This display uses a fairy tale style of narrative. * Fold Heads, (2009);- Eight paintings which used acrylic, mixed media and gobo lights on irregularly shaped canvases with various fabric pieces draping off them and were accompanied with neon lights that read: the FOLD HEADS EVER SO GOTTA GO HEY TO PLEASURE‚ÄôS MINE FEELIN‚Äô FINE LUV YA SO FEELIN‚ÄôLO with MISTER WHISTLER.‚Äù These paintings were displayed at the Susan Hobbs Gallery. Gary Michael-Dault who writes a weekly column in the Globe and Mail about Art Galleries says that this exhibit ‚Äúasks us to be infants again ‚Äì but only in that initial pareidolian way. She provides us with barely enough anatomical help and then dances away.‚Äù * The Basement Panoramas, (2013);- This work consists of four panorama paintings that use acrylic on canvas to depict personal events from Meigs‚Äô life. * Room for Mystics, (2017);- Meigs created this work in collaboration with Christopher Butterfield. It consists of 30 paintings, wall banners and various sound equipment with some paintings displayed in the center of the room on easels, while others were hung on the walls. This was the display that Meigs created after winning the Gershon Iskowitz prize. * TERRE VERTE, (2019);- This series of paintings reflects upon the ecology and spirit of the grasslands of Southern Alberta. Meigs painted and studied these landscapes en plein air, over a period of twenty-eight years. Each of the works portrays an encounter with the synergist system of life in this diverse habitat. The works were shown as a solo exhibition at the Southern Alberta Art Gallery. Returning to visit the same terrain, Meigs‚Äô gouache studies and acrylic paintings refer to McIntyre Ranch: a 55,000 acre ranch established in 1898 and in operation today. Meigs was included in two iterations of the McIntyre Ranch Project in 1991 and 2004, wherein the Thrall family hosted a research project between the artists, curators and biologists at the ranch. Each residency resulted in an exhibition of new works at the Southern Alberta Art Gallery in 1992 and 2005 respectively. Meigs continued her research there from 2017 through 2019, creating representations of the distinctive rough fescue, flora, wildlife and fowl of the region, rendered in her enigmatic and vivid style. Meigs depicts the landscape as alive, using neon colours and the symbol of the vortex to contend with mortality. Meigs describes her experience in residencies in Southern Alberta and its impact upon her work as follows: \\"One day I was observing a far-off eagle nest with my binoculars. The nest was on the side of the cliff, built into the clinging remnant of a tree that had tried to grow there. During this drawing session the sky darkened and it became very windy. A rainstorm began. Under my rain jacket I watched the eagle and her chicks, the mother gliding high in the dark sky, swooping low and hunting prey for her babies, then dropping the food in the nest. It was one of the most profound experiences I remember ever having in nature.\\" Meigs wrote a book of poems that was published in 1983. Many of her visual works include poetry as a supplementary part of the exhibition ‚Äì but she also publishes her poetry as stand-alone material. Her book of poems, Heavens to Betsy was initially part of her instillation at the Art Gallery of Lethbridge but was later published as a separate work.  Awards  In 2015 she was awarded the Gershon Iskowitz Prize which came with a $50,000 cash prize. Additionally, another $10,000 was rewarded to Meigs to continue her publication. Winning the Gershon Iskowitz prize entitles the recipient to a solo show at the Art Gallery of Ontario the next year. However, her display Room for Mystics was unveiled in 2017 instead of 2016 due to the sheer volume of work she had to complete. She was unable to assemble her 30 paintings in time for 2016. In 2015, she was one of eight recipients of the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts. Winning this award came with the honour of having her work featured in the National Gallery of Canada. Meigs has also been named a fellow at the Royal Society of Canada. She was also named a Canadian Council Laureate, having a film made in honour of her win. Further reading * Bradley, Jessica. Making Strange.

The show follows The Guy, a cannabis courier (played by Sinclair), as he delivers his product to clients in New York City. Each episode focuses on different characters as their lives intersect with The Guy. High Maintenance originally premiered as a web series on Vimeo on November 11, 2012, and began airing as a television series on HBO on September 16, 2016. The show's second HBO season premiered on January 19, 2018, and its third on January 20, 2019. HBO renewed the series for a fourth season, which premiered on February 7, 2020. High Maintenance has received critical acclaim for its portrayals of boredom, loneliness, and the human condition.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43zd9p/high-maintenance-creators- ben-sinclair-and-katja-blichfeld-hbo-how-to-stop-feeling-lonely First season episodes \\"Meth(od)\\" and \\"Grandpa\\" both placed on numerous year-end lists in 2016,https://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/25-best-tv-episodes-of-2016-veep-game- of-thrones-americans-bojack- horseman-1201757385/https://www.vulture.com/2016/09/high-maintenance-method- gay-straight-friendship.html while second season episode \\"Globo\\" was ranked as one of the best episodes of 2018 by sources such as Time and Variety.https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/best-tv- episodes-2018-1203051440/https://time.com/5463609/best-tv-episodes-2018/ Plot Largely plotless, the show consists of vignettes in the lives of various New Yorkers as they come into direct or indirect contact with The Guy. The web series was shot throughout various neighborhoods in Brooklyn and occasionally Manhattan, and its episodes range from 5 to 20 minutes in length. The television version continued the practice of on-location photography. \\"Freed of the constraints of thirty-minute or one-hour formulas, the episodes are luxurious and twisty and humane, radiating new ideas about storytelling,\\" wrote television critic Emily Nussbaum in an article for The New Yorker. When the series moved to HBO, its episodes expanded to the half-hour format. Episodes Production Sinclair said that the TV shows Six Feet Under and Party Down were inspirations for the web series. The talent pool in New York City is rich‚Äîand familiar to Blichfeld (who is an Emmy Award-winning casting director of 30 Rock). Each episode cost less than $1,000 to make. In June 2014, Vimeo announced that the website would provide financial backing for upcoming episodes of original programming via their Vimeo on Demand platform. Vimeo funded six episodes of High Maintenance before the series was picked up by HBO. Three episodes were released November 11, 2014, and the remaining three on February 5, 2015. Critical response Critical response has been positive. The actor Dan Stevens, who later appeared on the show, calls it \\"a brilliant collection of succinct character portraits from a cross-section of New York society.\\" Jenji Kohan said that High Maintenance was one of her favorite recent discoveries, calling the episodes little jewels, \\"beautiful glimpses into people's lives,\\" \\"really well crafted,\\" \\"delicious.\\" The Guy often interacts with members of the Jewish community in the areas of New York that he services, and he himself is Jewish. This aspect of the series has been noted approvingly by Jewish reviewers for its representation of contemporary Jewish life. Ethnic diversity in the show as it moved from web series to an HBO series has also been noted.

The Terry Thomas is Seattle's first commercial office building structure developed in decades without central air conditioning. It was designed by Seattle-based architectural firm Weber Thompson, who also designed the interiors of the building and use it as their headquarters. History The former building - a light industrial warehouse from the 1920s - was once used as a practice space for one of Seattle's best known bands, Pearl Jam. Most of the existing, two-story building was salvaged for reusable building materials and components, in particular, the brick and heavy timber. 93% of the materials reclaimed during demolition were recycled and 94% of construction waste was recycled. Design and features The Terry Thomas was designed to provide a healthy and creative work environment and to illustrate the possibilities of sustainable design. The project was driven by Weber Thompson, who was looking for space to accommodate their expanding architectural practice. The firm wanted to stay in the neighborhood in a building that reinforced their commitment to sustainable design. The building is a redevelopment of an urban site in the Seattle neighborhood of South Lake Union. The mixed-use neighborhood, formerly a light industrial zone, includes parks, multi-family residences, offices (including the Amazon.com campus) and light industrial buildings. It is also located on the South Lake Union Streetcar line. The project goals for the building were to develop a sustainable building without air conditioning. Sustainable strategies incorporated into the design include shallow floor plates, operable windows, a central, open air courtyard, different treatments on the fa√ßades to minimize heat retention, and floor to ceiling glass at optimal height to depth ratios and open floor plans to maximize daylight. The building is constructed out of recycled steel, aluminum and fly ash concrete. Interior finish materials were produced using sustainable methods with high-recycled content. The windows and storefront are locally manufactured, as is the metal exterior cladding. The exterior cladding of the building also includes FSC-Certified ipe wood. The interior minimizes the use of additional finish materials. Materials were chosen for their ability to serve multiple functions. Castellated beams were integrated into the structure to reduce the weight of steel used and to encourage air movement. The exposed concrete slab was polished and used as the finish floor surface. The castellated steel beam structure, chosen for strength, lower cost, and reduced material was left exposed and painted white, allowing light, air and services to circulate. The metal cable tray system corrals electrical and data cabling also serve as the support for the light fixtures. Ceiling mounted acoustical panels double as light reflectors. Acoustical wall panels provide additional noise damping and a place to pinup sketches. The courtyard doughnut shape is critical to the two main design priorities: daylighting and natural ventilation. Natural daylighting was achieved through the shallow floor plate depths and high ceilings allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior of the building and the core open-air courtyard. Daylighting models were tested at the University of Washington‚Äôs Integrated Design Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers. Within the bulk of the building, daylight sensors are on all lighting within 15 feet of the windows and Energy Star equipment is provided to reduce the plug load. Automated blinds are installed on specific windows that modeling predicted would receive the most sun. These ‚Äúsmart blinds‚Äù automatically adjust depending on the sunlight levels and orientation. On the roof, sensors with hemi-spherical lens acts as photocells, monitoring the intensity of lights. A wind sensor causes the blinds to retract into their housings when the wind exceeds 40 mph. Interior controllers on the ceiling are programmed based on the blinds‚Äô orientation towards the sun, building latitude and an astronomical clock that tracks the seasons. Passive cooling is achieved through multiple design strategies; the most significant being operable windows. The windows are enhanced by automated louvers, high ceilings, a shallow floor plate, and a central court that acts as a chimney, drawing the warmer air out the windows and up through the courtyard. Exterior shading devices protect occupants from significant solar heat gains and a white roof keeps the upper floors cool while reducing the urban heat island effect. Every exterior fa√ßade is treated differently, according to its micro-climate and sun exposure. Good indoor air quality was of paramount importance in the design of the building. Low- emitting materials such as low-VOC paints, adhesives and carpets were specified to minimize the impact of off gassing on the air quality. CO2 sensors throughout the building control exterior louvers that deliver fresh air into the space. Operationally, a recycling program is mandatory and tenants are committed to use recycled and environmentally-friendly products in their daily operations and cleaning. A green building operations manual and a tenant manual were developed for all tenants. Lighting is controlled by several methods. Photoelectric eyes measure the amount of sun coming into the space and increase or decrease the fluorescent lighting to balance the light levels in the office. Occupancy/motion sensors turn lights on and off in conference spaces and the lights are programmed to turn off automatically at night and on weekends. These strategies reduce the wattage per square foot to 35% below the baseline of one watt per square foot. Only one elevator was integrated into the building, an energy-efficient but slow model. Use of the stairs by employees is encouraged by a prominent and accessible outdoor staircase in the courtyard, while the elevator is located towards the back of the building. In order to accurately measure the energy consumption and gauge the effectiveness of the design strategies, sub-metering was installed for all tenants. The Terry Thomas was also designed to conserve as much water as possible. A storm water drainage system was designed to detain runoff into an on-site tank, and then slowly release it to the city storm water system. Low- flow fixtures, dual-flush toilets and waterless urinals were installed in order to save an approximate 50% of the water during everyday operation as compared to a typical office building. Energy performance The Terry Thomas was originally modeled to reduce its energy use by 30% to 40% from that of a typical office building with conventional air conditioning. Eliminating a traditional HVAC system contributes significantly to energy savings. As part of this energy reduction, the designers increased thermal insulation. Heating is provided by highly efficient hydronic radiators placed along exterior walls; this allows for individual temperature control. Based upon the Department of Energy‚Äôs National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency metric, The Terry Thomas consumes 56% less energy than a typical class A office building.

Coalshaw Green is also the location of South Chadderton Metrolink station. History Coalshaw Green Road looking north towards Butler Green. Archaically known as Coldshaw, Coleshaw and Cauleshaw, Coalshaw Green is mentioned in some of the earliest recorded accounts of the township of Chadderton dating from the early 13th century, when lands in Chadderton including Coalshaw Green (Caule Shaw), were granted to the Stanlaw Abbey religious order by Gilbert de Notton who held the manor of Chadderton and Foxdenton from 1234. Historical records also mention Coalshaw Green in 1672 when a right of way through 'Coleshaw Lane' was established on payment of a half penny a year. The growth of the nearby village of Hollinwood from the mid 18th century along the common border of Oldham and Chadderton townships saw development take place along Drury Lane and by the mid 1840s Coalshaw Green effectively lay at the edge of the village. 'Hollinwood, Lancs' was the area's postal address from the late 19th century until the advent of the modern postcode system, when 'Chadderton, Oldham' became the official address.http://www.chadderton-historical- society.org.uk/current%20newsletters.htm  Retrieved 5 April 2016 The late 19th century saw the area expand into a cotton mill district with the construction of the Gordon Mill (1884), Rose Mill (1885) and the Asia Mill (1904) all established within the vicinity (see List of mills in Chadderton). All of these mills have now been demolished. The Rose Mill was destroyed by a major fire in 2007.http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local- news/major-blaze-at-mill-983694 Coalshaw Green Road, the main thoroughfare through the area, was constructed during this late 19th century period connecting the area to the nearby settlement of Butler Green/Washbrook. Turf Lane (mentioned in records dating back to the mid 17th century) was originally called Tarve Lane and took its name from its use. It was a lane used by tenants to collect turf or peat for themselves and their manorial overlords. The inhabitants had certain rights of 'turbary' but were required to all use the same road so that they could be supervised in this operation. The turf would be gathered from the Hale Moss area around Whitegate.P30 Chadderton Chapters (1972), Lawson M, http://www.tetlow.co.uk/17th_century.htm Now closed, Drury Lane Council School, located near the junction of Turf Lane and Coalshaw Green, served the area between 1894 and 1954. http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C3694660 Coalshaw Green Park In December 1908, Chadderton Urban District Council were informed that Miss Marjorie Lees of Werneth Park, Oldham, was offering to give them ¬£3,113 wherewith to purchase a plot of land from the Trustees of C. E. Lees, her late father. This would be a memorial in his honour. The Council, in accepting the gift on behalf of the inhabitants of Chadderton, gave their 'sincere and hearty thanks ‚Ä¶ for her most generous offer.' The land, comprising about 11 acres [4.5 hectares] lay between the Werneth to Hollinwood railway line and Coalshaw Green Road, and ran from Stanley Road to the now-demolished Rose Mill. It was to be used as a recreation ground for children and adults for all time, with 'no tipping of refuse to take place there.' The park was officially opened by Miss Lees, using a gold key, on 25 May 1912 in the presence of Councillor Joseph Hilton, Chairman of the Urban District Council, and other dignitaries. Before the ceremony, a large procession led by Chadderton Brass Band, made its way from Stanley Road School through streets bedecked with flags. Coalshaw Green, the first public recreation ground in Chadderton, was totally renovated in 1998, and was the first of the town's three major parks to receive a Green Flag award. Much of its redevelopment in recent years has been due to the enthusiasm of Barbara Wilson MBE, and her dedicated group of 'Friends' of the park. March 2015 saw the opening of a skate park in Coalshaw Green Park. Built at a cost of almost ¬£160,000, the skatepark is open to skateboarders, scooters, cyclists and roller skaters and is accessible by able-bodied and disabled skaters.http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news- features/8/news-headlines/86112/160000-super-skate-park-plan-wins- fundinghttp://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news- headlines/90921/its-takeoff-for-new-skate-park Further improvements including the provision of new tennis and basketball courts were announced in June 2016.http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/99/chadderton- extra/98499/a-whole-new-ball-game-as-site-gets-an-upgrade Retrieved 17 June 2016 Coalshaw Green Playing Fields In July 2016 it was announced that the former Rose Mill site was, subject to planning, to be developed for housing.

Career Octave Leopold Boudouard became a professor at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers in Paris. He worked in various fields of applied chemistry, such as the chemistry of fuels and clays. His most important work was his research into chemical equilibria when reducing iron oxides in a blast furnace. In 1901 he proposed the first theory of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, where he considered that metal oxide was reacting with carbon. In 1905 Boudouard identified the Boudouard reaction, where carbon and carbon dioxide combine to form carbon monoxide at high temperatures, while the reverse occurs at lower temperatures. In 1912 he published a paper on the odors of Paris, researching the chemicals polluting the air of that city. Boudouard reaction The Boudouard reaction is: ::2CO CO2 \\\\+ C Boudouard found that when an excess of coke reacts with air or metal oxides, below about 400¬∞C this produces carbon dioxide and soot, while at temperatures above 1,000¬∞C it produces carbon monoxide. Between these extremes a mixture of the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and soot is produced Understanding the reaction is a significant factor in the design of blast furnaces where the goal is to maximize use of fuel while minimizing production of soot.

He was a merchant and plantation owner, living largely in Jamaica, from 1736 to 1752, when he set up business as a merchant banker at Dunster's Court, Mincing Lane, in the City of London. Political activist In politics Vaughan supported John Wilkes. He sent his five sons to Warrington Academy,Ben, 1766‚Äì73; William, 1766‚Äì69; John, 1772‚Äì74; Charles, 1775‚Äì77; Samuel, 1777‚Äì79. (Dissenting Academies Online: http://dissacad.english.qmul.ac.uk). Benjamin and William being taught by Joseph Priestley, with whom a strong family connection was forged.Graham, p. 103. In early 1769 Vaughan was using his contact with John Seddon of Warrington to circulate Wilkite literature in Lancashire. He also hoped to recruit supporters in Manchester and Liverpool through Seddon.Graham, p. 98 note 229. With Joseph Mawbey and others, Vaughan was a founder of the Bill of Rights Society (Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights). It was a trust giving financial support to Wilkes, and the treasurers were Vaughan, Richard Oliver and John Trevanion (1740‚Äì1810). The Society set about dealing with Wilkes's tangled money affairs. Vaughan belonged to what Benjamin Franklin fondly called the Club of Honest Whigs, which met at St Paul's Coffee House in the cathedral churchyard (see English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries). His support for the cause of Corsica in 1768 brought him the acquaintance of James Boswell through the Club.Verner W. Crane, The Club of Honest Whigs: Friends of Science and Liberty, The William and Mary Quarterly Third Series, Vol. 23, No. 2 (Apr. 1966), pp. 210‚Äì233, at p. 228.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1922508 Vaughan was a trustee of funds for Corsica, with William Beckford and Barlow Trecothick. In December 1774 Franklin and Josiah Quincy II stayed with Vaughan at Wanstead in Essex. In the period 1781‚Äì2 the parliamentary reformer Christopher Wyvill met radical leaders at Vaughan's house. There resulted a political pact for the following session of parliament, of mutual support between Wyvill and a radical group around Vaughan (including John Jebb, John Horne Tooke, and James Townsend). Vaughan joined the Society for Constitutional Information in the 1780s.Graham, p. 43 note 39. Through William Beckford, he met the Earl of Shelburne. When Shelburne became Prime Minister, the Vaughan family influence reached foreign policy, trying to split the United States from their French allies in some ultimately unsuccessful moves of 1782. The Vaughan family was part of the Newington Green congregation of the dissenting minister Richard Price.amphilsoc.org, John Vaughan papers, 1768 ‚Äì Circa 1936. Samuel Vaughan was a friend of the elder William Hazlitt, the Unitarian minister. Vaughan's religious views have been described as \\"free-thinking Unitarian\\". Jamaica and bribery scandal Vaughan purchased in 1765 the post of Clerk to the Supreme Court of Jamaica. In 1769 Vaughan then offered the Duke of Grafton, a government minister, a sum of ¬£5000 to secure a reversion, to hold this official place in the family for three of his sons. Grafton brought a King's Bench case against Vaughan, which resulted in embarrassment to both parties. The prominence of the issue led the campaigning writer Junius to expose a previous sale of office by Grafton. This was the post of Collector of Customs in Exeter, to a Mr. Hine, for which Grafton took ¬£3,500; and the implication was that the money went to a card-sharp. Vaughan put his side of the case in An Appeal to the Public on Behalf of Samuel Vaughan, Esq. in a fall and impartial Narrative of his Negotiation with the Duke of Grafton; and Grafton dropped the prosecution. Even so, Vaughan's actions appeared to be a political gaffe to some of the political radicals, Vaughan's allies. Anna Laetitia Barbauld, a family friend, wrote a poem complimenting his wife Sarah as a gesture of support. Some of Vaughan's sons became involved in the plantation business, and its London end Vaughan & Co. Benjamin visited the Colony of Jamaica in the early 1770s, and in parliament in the 1790s defended slavery on the island. William worked in the company, and became prominent in the London Society of West India Merchants. Vaughan himself visited Jamaica again in 1775. The Vaughan estates were Flamstead and Vaughansfield in Saint James Parish, slave-run sugar plantations. Vaughansfield was involved in the Second Maroon War in the neighbouring Trelawny Parish. Samuel Vaughan junior became proprietor of these estates. In the United States After the end of the American War of Independence Vaughan made several long stays in the United States. There were three separate visits. Vaughan was accompanied by his family, but sent them home in 1786.Graham, p. 60. He wrote to Richard Price in 1785 of the American principles of government as being \\"the permanent security of the rights of mankind\\".Graham, p. 51. Philadelphia and Virginia Vaughan was on good terms with George Washington; Washington wrote to him on 30 November 1785 about gifts of a pamphlet of Mirabeau on the Society of the Cincinnati, and Jamaican rum.John Clement Fitzpatrick, David Maydole Matteson (editors), The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745‚Äì1799; prepared under the direction of the United States George Washington Bicentennial Commission and published by authority of Congress vol. 28 (1931), pp. 326‚Äì328; archive.org. They had met in Philadelphia in December 1783. There Vaughan planned the planting of the State House garden, as well as laying out the gardens of Gray's Ferry Tavern in the English style. In Philadelphia also, with Francis Hopkinson, he helped revive the American Philosophical Society; and provided a sketch-plan for Philosophical Hall. As Vaughan explained to Humphry Marshall, he planned to plant the State House Yard with a representative collection of American trees and shrubs.specialcollections.nal.usda.gov, Vaughan to Marshall, May 28, 1785, USDA History Collection. The ambition was a political statement, on the unity of the newly United States, and was shared by Washington and Thomas Jefferson as gardeners. In Philadelphia for the Constitutional Convention during the summer of 1787, Vaughan paid a visit in July to William Bartram's nursery, from which he ordered 55 species of plants. The State House project's greater scope was abandoned, but Vaughan saw to the publication of Marshall's Arbustum Americanum, in 1785.Joseph Ewan, Seeds and Ships and Healing Herbs, Encouragers and Kings, Bartonia No. 45 (1978), pp. 28‚Äì29.

The company launched CloudReady in February 2015. CloudReady is built on Google's open-source operating system Chromium. Neverware customizes CloudReady so it can be installed and used on PC and Macintosh hardware up to 13 years old, making them behave more like a Chromebook. Although the company began with an exclusive focus on the US K-12 education sector, it announced in October 2017 its intention to use its Series B funding from Google to further expand into the enterprise market.  History  Jonathan Hefter, founder of Neverware Jonathan Hefter began developing Neverware‚Äôs core technology in 2009 after graduating from Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. In May 2010, Dogpatch Labs invited Hefter to work out of their Manhattan incubator, and in early 2011 Neverware officially formed, moved to General Assembly‚Äôs Manhattan location, and began operations. Hefter remains at Neverware as Chairman.https://www.neverware.com/about#meet-the-team After a successful pilot program, Neverware launched in January 2013, rolling out its first service, called PCReady, around New York City. Its second product, CloudReady, was released at the 2015 TCEA conference in Texas, indicating a broader national reach on the part of the company. In October of 2017, Neverware announced that Google would lead its Series B round of investment as a strategic partner and investor. In March of 2018, Neverware announced it would acquire Flint Innovations, the UK-based company behind Flint OS, another offshoot of Chromium OS.  Technology  Neverware‚Äôs first product, branded PCReady, used their proprietary server computer, called a Juicebox, which generated thin clients ‚Äì a special kind of virtual machine. The Juicebox, which was installed locally, handled all processing and computing tasks and relegated only simple display and input tasks to the user‚Äôs machine. Neverware's second product, CloudReady, is built on Google's open-source Chromium and allows schools, businesses, and consumers to convert their existing hardware to the Google Chrome ecosystem. CloudReady is packaged in three ‚Äòeditions‚Äô: Enterprise, Education, and Home. The Home Edition of CloudReady is free. CloudReady attempts to differentiate itself by enabling machines running the OS to be managed alongside Chromebooks in the Google Admin console, support being provided for more than 350 certified computer models for up to 13 years, and mass deployment to many devices being possible through a variety of tools. This aims to allow school districts and enterprise IT administrators control and security features in addition to providing an alternative to surplussing existing machines.  Financing  Neverware is backed by a variety of technology and venture capital firms. Investors include Google, Khosla Ventures, Upfront Ventures, Thrive Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Collaborative Fund, OurCrowd, Mark Suster and Nihal Mehta. Rethink Education became a major investor in Neverware in October 2014.  Recognition  Neverware has received media attention for its investment from Google, young founder, noteworthy cause, and projected viability. It has also attracted interest for its potential for reducing Ewaste by extending the lifespan of aging hardware. Neverware has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the Boston Globe, the Guardian, Forbes.com, The New York Times, TechCrunch, The Verge, Engadget, and The MIT Technology Review. Neverware has also been repeatedly recognized as being a great place to work by organizations such as Crain‚Äôs New York, Built in NYC, Business Intelligence Group, and Great Place to Work.

This notion can be used to solve Constraints Satisfaction Problems that are inconsistent by relaxing a small number of constraints. When a bounded-error approach is considered for parameter estimation, the relaxed intersection makes it possible to be robust with respect to some outliers. Definition The q-relaxed intersection of the m subsets X_{1},\\\\dots ,X_{m} of R^{n}, denoted by X^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}=\\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}X_{i} is the set of all x \\\\in R^{n} which belong to all X_{i} 's, except q at most. This definition is illustrated by Figure 1. Figure 1. q-intersection of 6 sets for q=2 (red), q=3 (green), q= 4 (blue), q= 5 (yellow). Define \\\\lambda (x) =\\\\text{card} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ i\\\\ \\\\ x\\\\in X_{i}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. We have X^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}=\\\\lambda ^{-1}([m-q,m]) . Characterizing the q-relaxed intersection is a thus a set inversion problem. Example Consider 8 intervals: X_{1}=[1,4], X_{2}=\\\\ [2,4], X_{3}=[2,7], X_{4}=[6,9], X_{5}=[3,4], X_{6}=[3,7]. We have X^{\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}} = \\\\emptyset, X^{\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}}=[3,4], X^{\\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\}}=[3,4], X^{\\\\\\\\{3\\\\\\\\}}=[2,4] \\\\cup [6,7], X^{\\\\\\\\{4\\\\\\\\}}=[2,7], X^{\\\\\\\\{5\\\\\\\\}}=[1,9], X^{\\\\\\\\{6\\\\\\\\}}=]-\\\\infty ,\\\\infty [. Relaxed intersection of intervals The relaxed intersection of intervals is not necessary an interval. We thus take the interval hull of the result. If X_i's are intervals, the relaxed intersection can be computed with a complexity of m.log(m) by using the Marzullo's algorithm. It suffices to sort all lower and upper bounds of the m intervals to represent the function \\\\lambda . Then, we easily get the set X^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}=\\\\lambda^{-1}([m-q,m]) which corresponds to a union of intervals. We then return the smallest interval which contains this union. Figure 2 shows the function \\\\lambda(x) associated to the previous example. Figure 2. Set- membership function associated to the 6 intervals. Relaxed intersection of boxes To compute the q-relaxed intersection of m boxes of R^{n}, we project all m boxes with respect to the n axes. For each of the n groups of m intervals, we compute the q-relaxed intersection. We return Cartesian product of the n resulting intervals. Figure 3 provides an illustration of the 4-relaxed intersection of 6 boxes. Each point of the red box belongs to 4 of the 6 boxes. Figure 3. The red box corresponds to the 4-relaxed intersection of the 6 boxes Relaxed union The q-relaxed union of X_1,\\\\dots ,X_m is defined by \\\\overset{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\bigcup}X_{i}=\\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{m-1-q\\\\\\\\}}X_i Note that when q=0, the relaxed union/intersection corresponds to the classical union/intersection. More precisely, we have \\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}}X_{i} =\\\\bigcap X_i and \\\\overset{\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} }{\\\\bigcup}X_{i} =\\\\bigcup X_i De Morgan's law If \\\\overline{X} denotes the complementary set of X_i, we have \\\\overline{\\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}X_i} = \\\\overset{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\bigcup}\\\\overline{X_i} \\\\overline{\\\\overset{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\} }{\\\\bigcup }X_i}=\\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}\\\\overline{X_i}. As a consequence \\\\overline{\\\\bigcap\\\\limits^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}X_i}=\\\\overline{\\\\overset{\\\\\\\\{m-q-1\\\\\\\\} }{\\\\bigcup }X_i}=\\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{m-q-1\\\\\\\\}}\\\\overline{X_i} Relaxation of contractors Let C_1,\\\\dots ,C_m be m contractors for the sets X_1,\\\\dots ,X_m , then C([x]) =\\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}C_i([x]). is a contractor for X^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}} and \\\\overline{C}([x]) =\\\\bigcap^{\\\\\\\\{m-q-1\\\\\\\\}}\\\\overline{C}_i([x]) is a contractor for \\\\overline{X}^{\\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}}, where \\\\overline{C}_1,\\\\dots,\\\\overline{C}_{m} are contractors for \\\\overline{X}_1,\\\\dots ,\\\\overline{X}_m. Combined with a branch-and-bound algorithm such as SIVIA (Set Inversion Via Interval Analysis), the q-relaxed intersection of m subsets of R^{n} can be computed. Application to bounded- error estimation The q-relaxed intersection can be used for robust localization or for tracking. . Robust observers can also be implemented using the relaxed intersections to be robust with respect to outliers. We propose here a simple example to illustrate the method. Consider a model the ith model output of which is given by f_i(p)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi p_2}}\\\\exp (-\\\\frac{(t_i-p_1)^{2}}{2p_2}) where p\\\\in R^{2}.

He is a third generation retablo artist and learned the tradition from his father and grandfather. He also studied sculpture at several universities in Peru. The main altarpieces represent religious, historical and everyday life events. They can be humorous or political. His works are based on their pre-Hispanic Andean art and family influences. In 2012, he was the recipient of a Florida Folk Heritage Award. His altarpiece figurines are made by hand with a mix of boiled potato and gypsum powder. His work has appeared in major museum exhibitions, including the Smithsonian Institution where they are part of the permanent collection.

The ex-Midland line bridged the ex-GNR line in Teversal and the stations were fairly close to each other, the ex-Midland station being on the higher level. From inception they were both called \\"Teversall\\" with two \\"l\\"s. After nationalisation in 1948 the early British Railways had a policy of renaming stations where confusion over names could occur, typically in towns and villages where two or more stations existed. Teversal had two stations, so, although one had closed to regular passenger services and the other had never provided any, they provided other services such as goods and excursions. They were therefore renamed. The ex-MR Teversal station became \\"Teversall Manor\\" and the ex-GNR Teversal station became \\"Teversall East\\". This article concerns the ex-Midland railway station on the line from Tibshelf and Whiteborough to Pleasley. Context The station was built by the Midland Railway on the circuitous Mansfield to Westhouses via Mansfield Woodhouse and Tibshelf line known as \\"The Teversall & Pleasley Branch\\". The line's primary purpose was to carry coal. History The station was opened without ceremony on 1 May 1886 when the Teversall & Pleasley Branch opened to passenger traffic. It initially provided a service of four trains each way between Mansfield and Alfreton via Mansfield Woodhouse, Tevershall and Tibshelf, taking about 40 minutes from end to end. The station had a typical Midland Railway country station building very similar to Pleasley West. By 1922 the passenger service through the station was down to three trains each way Monday to Saturday. There never was a Sunday service. By 1930 this had fallen to one train a day southbound and, curiously, two a day northbound. On 28 July 1930 passenger services were withdrawn. As the station remained open for goods it was renamed \\"Teversall Manor\\" in 1950 to avoid confusion with the obscure ex- GNR terminus station nearby. Excursions and railtours continued until 1963. Through traffic was rendered impossible from 1964 when the line North from Pleasley Colliery to the junction with what is now the Robin Hood Line closed. Pleasley Colliery subsequently sent its coal underground to Shirebrook and Teversall Colliery closed in 1980. Coal continued to be dug from Silverhill Colliery until 1992 and passed through the site of Teversall Manor station. After the colliery closed the line became redundant and was subsequently lifted. The station buildings have been razed to the ground. Parts of the trackbed of this and neighbouring lines have been turned into public footpaths and bridleways.http://www.teversaltrails.com/visitorscentre.htm References  * External links *Teversall railway station on navigable 1947 O.S.

(1996). Beyond the Tower of Babel: A nomenclature for suicidology. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 26(3), 237-252. and terminology describing suicide has often been defined differently depending on the purpose of the definition (e.g., medical, legal, administrative). A lack of agreed-upon nomenclature and operational definitions has complicated understanding. In 2007, attempts were made to reach some consensus.Silverman MM, Berman AL, Sanddal ND, et al. Rebuilding the Tower of Babel: a revised nomenclature for the study of suicide and suicidal behaviors. Part 1: background, rationale, and methodology. Suicide Life Threat Behav 2007; 37:248‚Äì63.Silverman MM, Berman AL, Sanddal ND, et al. Rebuilding the Tower of Babel: a revised nomenclature for the study of suicide and suicidal behaviors.

Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA): classification of suicidal events in the FDA's pediatric suicidal risk analysis of antidepressants\\" Am J Psychiatry 2007; 164:1035‚Äì43. There is also opposition to the phrase \\"to commit suicide\\" as implying negative moral judgment and association with criminal or sinful activity which has been found to discourage sufferers from seeking help for their mental illness which could lead to death by suicide. In 2020, research demonstrated that stigmatizing and other verbiage commonly used in regard to suicide, such as reporting or sharing the method of suicide leads to a 13% increase in the national suicide rate following highly publicized (celebrity) suicides as well as a 30% increase in suicides completed in the same method as the public figure.  Suicide-related ideations  Suicidal ideation is any self-reported thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior. Subtypes of suicide-related ideations depend on the presence or absence of suicidal intent. To have suicidal intent is to have suicide or deliberate self-killing as one's purpose.Leenars, A. A. (2004). Psychotherapy with suicidal people. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons. Intent refers to the aim, purpose, or goal of the behavior rather than the behavior itself. The term connotes a conscious desire or wish to leave or escape from life, and also connotes a resolve to act. This is contrasted with suicidal motivation, or the driving force behind ideation or intent, which need not be conscious.  With no suicidal intention  Suicide-related ideation with no suicidal intention is when an individual has thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior but has no intention to do so.  With undetermined degree of suicidal intent  When an individual is unable to clarify whether suicidal intent was present or not, the term undetermined degree of suicidal intent is used.  With some suicidal intent  Suicide- related ideation with some suicidal intent is when an individual has thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior and possesses suicidal intent.  Suicide-related communications  Suicide-related communications are any interpersonal act of imparting, conveying, or transmitting thoughts, wishes, desires, or intent for which there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) that the act of communication is not itself a self-inflicted behavior or self- injurious. This broad definition includes two subsets. A suicide threat is any interpersonal action, verbal or nonverbal, without a direct self-injurious component, that a reasonable person would interpret as communicating or suggesting that suicidal behavior might occur in the near future. A suicide plan is a proposed method of carrying out a design that will lead to a potentially self-injurious outcome; a systematic formulation of a program of action that has the potential for resulting in self-injury. With No Suicidal Intent  =Suicide Threat, Type I= Suicide Threat, Type I is a suicide threat with no associated suicidal intent. The threat may be verbal or nonverbal, passive or active. =Suicide Plan, Type I= Suicide Plan, Type I is the expression of a definite plan to end one's life but with no suicidal intent.  With Undetermined Degree of Suicide Intent  =Suicide Threat, Type II= Suicide Threat, Type II is a suicide threat with an undetermined level of suicidal intent. The threat may be verbal or nonverbal, passive or covert. =Suicide Plan, Type II= Suicide Plan, Type II is a proposed method of achieving a potentially self-injurious outcome with an undetermined level of intent. With Some Degree of Suicidal Intent =Suicide Threat, Type III= Suicide Threat, Type III is a suicide threat with some degree of suicidal intent. The threat may be verbal or nonverbal, passive or covert. =Suicide Plan, Type III= Suicide Plan, Type III is a proposed method of achieving a potentially self-injurious outcome with some suicidal intent.  Suicide-related behaviors  Suicide related behavior is a self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior for which there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) either that: (a) the person wished to use the appearance of intending to kill himself/herself in order to attain some other end; or (b) the person intended at some undetermined or some known degree to kill himself/herself. Suicide-related behaviors can result in no injuries, injuries, or death. Suicide-related behaviors comprise self-harm, self- inflicted unintentional death, undetermined suicide-related behaviors, self- inflicted death with undetermined intent, suicide attempt, and suicide. Self- harm is self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior for which there is evidence (either implicit or explicit) that the person did not intend to kill himself/herself (i.e., had no intent to die). Persons engage in self-harm behaviors when they wish to use the appearance of intending to kill themselves in order to attain some other end (e.g., to seek help, to punish themselves or others, to receive attention, or to regulate negative moods). Self-harm may result in no injuries, injuries, or death. Suicidal gestures are suicide- related behaviors that are carried out without suicidal intent. It is considered a controversial term. These behaviors may be labeled as Self Harm, Type I (no injury) or Self-Harm, Type II (with injury), because the purpose of the behaviors is to alter one's life circumstances (interpersonal or intrapersonal) in a manner without suicidal intent but involving self- inflicted behaviors (whether or not it resulted in injuries). If there is an undetermined degree of suicidal intent, it is labeled as Undetermined Suicide- Related Behavior, Type I (no injury), or Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type II (with injury). With No Suicidal Intent =Self-Harm, Type I= Self-Harm, Type I is self-harm that has not resulted in injury. =Self-Harm, Type II= Self-Harm, Type II is self-harm that has resulted in nonfatal injury. =Self-Inflicted Unintentional Death= Self-Inflicted Unintentional Death is self-harm that has resulted in death. It is defined as from self-inflicted injury, poisoning, or suffocation where there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) that there was no intent to die. This category includes those injuries or poisonings described as unintended or accidental. With Undetermined Degree of Suicide Intent Suicide-related Behavior With Undetermined Degree of Suicide Intent is self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior where intent is unknown. =Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type I= Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type I is self-injurious behavior that has not resulted in injuries and for which the person is unable to admit positively to the intent to die or is reluctant to admit positively to the intent to die due to other psychological states. =Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type II= Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior, Type II is self-injurious behavior that has resulted in injuries and for which the person is unable to admit positively to the intent to die or is reluctant to admit positively to the intent to die due to other psychological states. =Self-Inflicted Death with Undetermined Intent= Self-Inflicted Death with Undetermined Intent is self-injurious behavior that has resulted in fatal injury and for which intent is either equivocal or unknown. With Some Degree of Suicidal Intent A suicide attempt is defined as a self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior with a nonfatal outcome for which there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) of intent to die. A suicide attempt may result in no injuries, injuries, or death. =Suicide Attempt, Type I= Suicide Attempt, Type I is a suicide attempt with some degree of suicidal intent and no resultant injuries, regardless of the degree of injury or lethality of method. =Suicide Attempt, Type II= Suicide Attempt, Type II is a suicide attempt with some degree of suicidal intent and resultant injuries. =Suicide= A suicide is a self-inflicted death with evidence (either explicit or implicit) of intent to die. The term completed suicide has also been used synonymously, but is generally believed to be redundant and potentially pejorative, and, as such, is not recommended. Opposition to the term \\"commit\\" suicide According to Fairbairn, \\"The most common way of speaking about suicide is to talk of its being 'committed'.\\" \\"Committed suicide\\" or similar descriptions continue to be the norm in the English language.. However, the phrase \\"committed\\" associates death by suicide, or more accurately, death by mental illness, with criminal or sinful actions. For example, when someone dies by cancer, it is not the norm to say the a person \\"committed\\" cancer. Research has pointed out that this phrasing has become so entrenched in English vocabulary that it has gained \\"a naturalness which implies a deceptive harmlessness.\\" Per reportingonsuicide.org, \\"Certain phrases and words can further stigmatize suicide, spread myths, and undermine suicide prevention objectives such as 'committed suicide' or referring to suicide as 'successful,' 'unsuccessful' or a 'failed attempt.' Instead use, 'died by suicide\\", 'died from suicide', 'died from/by mental illness,' 'suicided,' or 'died from/by _________ (the mental illness from which the victim suffered i.e. PTSD:Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia).' While common, Lebacqz & Englehardt argue that referring to suicide as an act \\"committed\\" is hazardous to ethical clarity. Others have also argued in favour of alternative language regarding suicide, both in the interest of moral and ethical precision, as well as scientific and clinical clarity. A United States Navy report urges against the use of the term \\"committed suicide\\" on similar grounds, asserting that \\"suicide is better understood when framed objectively within the context of behavioral health.\\" The lack of clarity in English suicide terminology has been attributed to the connotations of crime, dishonour, and sin that suicide may carry. The German term Selbstmord begehen is similar, denoting an act of commission. Common language has been described as \\"[portraying] suicide as a 'crime' to be 'committed' as is, for example, murder.\\" This is despite the fact that suicide is largely no longer a crime, and that, as noted suicidologist Samuel Wallace wrote, \\"all suicide is neither abhorrent nor not; insane or not; selfish or not; rational or not; justifiable or not.\\" Canadian suicide prevention activist, P. Bonny Ball, commented that the alleged criminal implications of suicide are a carryover from the Middle Ages when suicide was considered \\"both illegal and sinful by the laws and religions of the time.\\" Sommer-Rotenberg had similarly argued that \\"the act of self-killing was considered criminal because it was perceived as transgressing the moral authority of God and the righteous feelings of humankind.\\" Since \\"committing suicide\\" was akin to committing murder or rape, it has been argued that they continue to be linked in some languages. However, this common English expression is not universal: \\"By contrast the French se suicider and the Italian uccidersi are reflexive. Likewise in Hebrew: l'hit'abbed, 'to self- destroy,' is something one does to oneself, with no implication of criminality\\" and translates in meaning most closesly to \\"suicided.\\" Various alternatives have been proposed to alter the language regarding the act of suicide from a variety of sectors ‚Äì including government, journalism, community mental health advocates, and the scientific community. Terms such as \\"death by suicide\\" have been suggested to be more objective. The World Health Organization has agreed that these terms \\"are more accurate and less open to misinterpretation.\\" As it applies to a direct clinical context, the widely cited Beck Classification of Suicidal Behaviour exclusively uses the terminology of \\"complete suicide.\\" This classification was revisited in a number of notable documents (such as the Operational Classification for Determination of Suicide, the 'Tower of Babel' nomenclature, the WHO/EURO definitions, the Columbia University suicidality classification, the CDC self- directed violence surveillance system, and the Denver VA VISN 19 MIRECC self- directed violence classification system). Advocacy groups have suggested a variety of guidelines for suicide terminology. As it concerns media reporting of suicide, a key indicator of guideline influence on language as it is practiced in that context reports including one by the Annenberg School for Communication's Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggests that there is \\"evidence of a change in reporting practices following the release of the new media guidelines\\".

Founded by former Finance Minister Lajos Bokros MEP on 21 April 2013, MoMa stood for free market, liberal values and champions \\"individual freedom, the free market, and the freedom of private and intellectual property\\". The party claimed to be modelled on the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. History MoMa decided not to participate in the 2014 parliamentary election, because \\"they do not want to weaken the cooperation of left-wing parties with separate candidates.\\" Bokros criticized and resented that his party were excluded from the alliance. Later MoMa formally asked its supporters to vote Unity in the 2014 general election, after receiving constitutional guarantees from the left-wing opposition. The party planned to run in the 2014 European Parliament election, however its registration was refused by the National Election Office (NVI). As a result Bokros lost his European Parliament mandate. Bokros also ran for Mayor of Budapest in the 2014 municipal election. On 29 September 2014, two other candidates, the independent Gy√∂rgy Magyar and candidate of the leftist opposition parties' Ferenc Falus withdrew from the election and supported Bokros. Bokros received 36.04% of the vote and came second after Istv√°n Tarl√≥s. He was supported by Together, the Democratic Coalition and the Budapest branch of the Hungarian Socialist Party. In September 2017, the MoMa made an electoral coalition with the Democratic Coalition (DK) for the 2018 parliamentary election. In the same time Bokros announced his \\"500 days programme\\" which contained the short-lived inevitable cooperation of the \\"democratic opposition parties\\" after the victory to \\"restore democracy\\" and \\"break down the Orb√°n regime\\". Bokros argued another by-election is required after the successful restoration. In January 2018, Bokros announced the DK has not kept its promise and rejected the agreement; as a result the MoMa aimed to participate in the election individually. DK issued a statement saying, Bokros refused their \\"fair offer\\" to provide a single mandate for his party with \\"not measurable support\\". While Bokros and some others withdrew their candidacy in favor of the parliamentary opposition, ten candidates of the MoMa ran in the 2018 national election, thus the party was not able to set a national list. They altogether obtained 617 votes. Lajos Bokros announced the disestablishment of the Modern Hungary Movement on 23 April 2019 with effect from 1 May. He said the delegation members decided to dissolve the party on their last meeting on 15 March. Bokros argued \\"he main reason for this is that we no longer see the point of serving as a scenario for the weak opposition activity that, under the pressure of arbitrariness, had mostly degenerated into the \\"Hunger Games\\".

He is chiefly remembered as the founder of the town of Baltimore, County Cork, which he built into a flourishing port, but which was largely destroyed shortly after his death in the Sack of Baltimore. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Baltimore in the Parliament of 1613‚Äì1615. He was the first of the Crooke baronets of Baltimore, and ancestor of the Crooke family of Crookstown House. Early life He was born in Cransley, Northamptonshire, the eldest son of the Reverend Thomas Crooke; his mother was a Miss Samuel.Usher, Brett Thomas Crooke Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2004 His father was a Calvinist clergyman whose strong religious views often brought him into conflict with the English Crown, but who escaped serious censure, probably due to his position as the appointed preacher at Gray's Inn. Helkiah Crooke, Court physician to James I, was one of Sir Thomas's brothers, and Samuel Crooke, a preacher of some note, was another brother. Stephen Egerton, another leading Puritan preacher, married Thomas's sister Sarah.Waters, Robert Edmond Chester Memoirs of the extinct family of Chester of Chicheley (1878) p.278 Egerton's niece, Margaret Tyndal Winthrop, was the third wife of John Winthrop, who became a coloniser with a much wider vision than Crooke's, being several times Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.Waters p.280 Crooke and Winthrop, although they must have been acquainted, are not known to have been intimate, but Crooke's sister Sarah was a close friend of Margaret Winthrop and left her a substantial legacy at her death in 1624. Thomas spent much of his childhood in Suffolk, where his father served for some years as vicar of Great Waldingfield. The younger Thomas, on his father's petition, was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1597.Usher He is said to have acquired a successful practice at the English Bar, but after his father's death in 1598 he turned his mind towards colonisation. His motives appear to have been twofold: to establish a thriving commercial centre, and to create a safe haven for those who shared his strong Calvinist views. The Settlement of Baltimore Baltimore, his foundation, present day In about the year 1600 Crooke entered an agreement with Sir Fineen O'Driscoll, the Gaelic lord of Baltimore in County Cork, to establish an English colony in Baltimore. Their agreement was disrupted by the closing stages of the Nine Years War. O'Driscoll throughout his long career had been an ally of the English Crown, and was something of a royal favourite of Queen Elizabeth I; but his relatives persuaded him, against his own better judgement, to take the Irish side at the Battle of Kinsale. After the failure of the Irish cause at Kinsale most of his relatives fled the country, and Sir Fineen himself only obtained a royal pardon with difficulty.Ekin, Des The Stolen Village-Baltimore and the Barabry Pirates O'Brien Press Dublin 2008 p.71 His daughter Eileen married into the prominent Coppinger family, who were to cause Sir Thomas much trouble throughout his career. In 1605 Crooke decided to regularise the matter: he surrendered the extensive lands granted to him by O'Driscoll to King James I and had them regranted back to him. James disapproved of Crooke's Calvinism, but he was pragmatic enough to see the advantages to the Crown of a strong English presence in West Cork. In 1607 the town was given the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs a year.Ekin p.408 In 1612 it was incorporated as a borough, with a \\"sovereign\\" (Crooke himself) and twelve burgesses. Baltimore was given the right to return two members to the Irish House of Commons, with the franchise known as a potwalloper (that is, a constituency where every male householder with a hearth wide enough to boil or \\"wallop\\" a pot had the vote). Crooke himself sat in the Irish Parliament of 1613‚Äì15. He reached the high point of his fortune in 1624 when he was created a baronet. Development of Baltimore The town of Baltimore thrived from the beginning: we are told that Crooke \\"divided the town into tenements with lots for gardens, and gave to each settler land convenient for building and grazing\\". It grew prosperous as a centre for the pilchard fisheries and the wine trade. From the first foundation of the colony however there were repeated accusations that Baltimore's real prosperity depended on piracy, and that all its inhabitants, including Crooke himself, were pirates or the accomplices of pirates.Ekin p.399 Portrait of James I by Nicholas Hilliard Charge of piracy The coast of West Cork has many deep sheltered coves which have always been suitable for smuggling, and the O'Driscolls had for years been widely believed to take advantage of to this engage in piracy. Not surprisingly similar accusations were made against Crooke, and in 1608 the Privy Council summoned him to London to answer a number of charges, including one that he slaughtered cattle in his own yard to victual the pirate ships. Ominously the charge was phrased in terms of an actual verdict that he had been a \\"chief maintainer and abettor of notorious pirates\\".Hanna, Mark G. Pirate Nests and the Rise of the British Empire 1570-1740 University of North Carolina Press 2015 p.65 Crooke denied all the charges, and by now he had gained the goodwill of most of the influential men in Munster, including William Lyon, Bishop of Cork, Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, and Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby, Lord President of Munster. His friends spoke up for him: Bishop Lyon in particular praised his extraordinary achievement in having created a well-ordered town out of nothing in less than 5 years. The Privy Council, despite an apparent preliminary finding that he was guilty, in the end exonerated Crooke completely, but not everyone was satisfied: the authorities in Venice continued to call Baltimore \\"a nest of pirates\\", and it was claimed that the entire population of the town were implicated in the illicit business.Hanna p.66 Historians are still divided as to whether or not, and if so to what extent Crooke condoned or engaged in piracy.Ekin p.399 The more cynical view is that the Privy Council was convinced of Crooke's guilt, but was unwilling to damage the growing prosperity of Baltimore.Hanna p.66 Conflict with Sir Walter Coppinger From the start of his Irish career Crooke was forced to contend with the increasing power of the wealthy Roman Catholic lawyer Sir Walter Coppinger. Coppinger came from one of the most prominent families in Cork city; though himself of Viking rather than Gaelic descent, he was hostile to the English settlers, and he had a reputation for ruthlessness. In his defence it must be said that his brother Richard had married Eileen O'Driscoll, daughter of Sir Fineen O'Driscoll, so the Coppingers may honestly have believed that they had a better right to Baltimore than Crooke did. Almost from the first settlement of the colony, Coppinger harassed the settlers with dubious legal claims to ownership of their lands. Eventually in 1610 a compromise was reached: Crooke, Coppinger and Fineen O'Driscoll jointly granted a lease of Baltimore to the settlers for a term of 21 years.Ekin pp.405‚Äì6 This gave the settlers a solid claim to their lands but Coppinger soon made it clear that he had no intention of observing the agreement. Crooke, with his wealth, lands, baronetcy, and influential friends, was personally secure enough, but the Baltimore settlers were subjected to constant harassment. In 1616 Crooke and his fellow settlers brought a lawsuit in the Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber, alleging numerous acts of aggression against them: Coppinger was found guilty on one count of riot but cleared of the other charges. However Castle Chamber was not noted for providing effective remedies for litigants and this verdict did Crooke little good.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571‚Äì1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.324 In 1618 Crooke, despairing of any chance of obtaining justice in the Irish courts, appealed to the Privy Council in London to protect the settlers against Coppinger's \\"malicious and covetous desire to supplant them\\" both by \\"bloody riot\\" and by fraudulent claims to their titles.Crawford p.325 No firm decision was taken, and Crooke renewed his petition before the new King Charles I in 1626. The King, noting that Castle Chamber was apparently divided on the issue, ordered a hearing before Star Chamber.Crawford p.325 The case was still proceeding when Crooke died in 1630; it seems that the authorities were reluctant to decide finally either in favour of Coppinger or of the settlers. =Legacy- the Sack of Baltimore In 1631 Algerian pirates raided Baltimore and carried away more than 100 settlers, who were later sold into slavery in North Africa. A handful of them were eventually ransomed, but the vast majority never saw Ireland again. This dealt the town a blow from which it has never fully recovered. Whatever Sir Thomas Crooke's faults, most notably the charge, which is still widely believed, that he made Baltimore into a pirate's nest,Hanna p.66 it was his intelligence and energy which had made the town thrive, and, it has been said, it was symbolically appropriate that it should collapse soon after his death. Family By his wife, Mary Jackson, Thomas had three sons: Sir Samuel Crooke, 2nd Baronet, Thomas, a barrister of Gray's Inn, who was still living in 1624 (although he is not mentioned in his father's 1629 will) and James, who was still living in 1634.Usher They had at least two daughters: Judith, who married the landowner and writer Sir Vincent Gookin, and a second daughter, who is referred to in her brother Samuel's will (although curiously not in her father's), who married a Mr Salmon (this was probably James Salmon of Castlehaven, a prominent local landowner). In his will Thomas refers to his \\"son-in-law\\" Arthur Jackson: the word son-in-law was then interchangeable with stepson, so Arthur was very likely Lady Crooke's son by a previous marriage. In his own will Arthur refers to Lady Crooke as his mother. Thomas left his estate to his widow, with legacies to his daughter Judith, his stepson Arthur Jackson and his wife Mary, to Thomas' brothers Samuel, \\"dear Helkiah\\" and Richard (\\"for his kindness to my children\\"), his sister Rachel Rosse (described as \\"much impoverished\\"), who was the wife of Henry Rosse, goldsmith, his \\"dear sister in law\\" Judith, wife of Samuel, and \\"good old Aunt Hudson\\" (who was still living in 1635).Waters, Henry Fitz-Gilbert Genealogical Gleamings in England 1901 Vol.1 p. 325 The third baronet, also called Thomas, dropped the use of the title, apparently as a condition of his marriage settlement with an heiress of the MacCarthy family. The family lived at Crookstown House for several generations: it later passed by inheritance to the Warren baronets.

The historic building was recognized by the National Park Service on its National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 2013. History The Pure Oil Station in Geneva, Illinois was built in 1937 on Illinois Route 38 (West State Street) at its intersection with Fifth Street. The Pure Oil Company popularized the idea of filling station buildings. Prior to the 1920s, filling stations were regarded as unappealing fire hazards and were kept away from residential areas. Pure Oil developed a cheap, attractive design in the Tudor Revival style that fit the suburban aesthetic ideal. Pure Oil's design became their corporate trademark starting in 1927. Carl August Petersen, the Chief Engineer of Marketing Construction for Pure Oil, was responsible for the design which was replicated all over the country. By 1945, there were six gas stations along the four blocks of downtown State Street. Only two remain‚Äîthis station and an unnamed station of questionable integrity at 427 State Street. It is not a contributing property of the Central Geneva Historic District, but is within its physical boundaries. Architecture The main facade faces Illinois Route 38 to the north, and the east facade faces South Fifth Street. The exterior is brick, covered in white paint. The east section of the building serviced pedestrians and the west section serviced vehicles. The brickwork is decoratively skintled (bricks are irregularly projecting at varying degrees). Most of the building is covered with a steeply pitched gable roof. It is covered with blue terra cotta tile. A flat roof covers the south half of the service bays, though it is mostly hidden from view because of the pitched roof. Three brick chimneys flank the ends of the gables. Two of these chimneys have a large metal letter \\"P\\", painted white, a Pure Oil emblem.

Roberts (April 27, 1871 - January 21, 1930), sometimes referred to as \\"Ragtime\\" Bob Roberts, was an American novelty singer and ragtime song composer in the early years of the 20th century. Biography He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Nicholas (Nick) Roberts, a well-known clown who became the proprietor of one of the country's leading touring pantomime companies, and his French-born wife Augustine C. Zahn. Bob Roberts is assumed to have traveled widely with his father's shows in his youth, and indeed for the 1880 census when he was 9-years-old, his mother and brother were found lodging in a Richmond, New York hotel while father and son were performing somewhere nearby. Roberts, who had published compositions in Cincinnati as early as 1897, made his recording debut for Columbia Records in 1900, and initially recorded remakes of other artists' cylinders before starting to make recordings of new songs.Allan Sutton, American Recording Pioneers - Bob Roberts . Retrieved 16 May 2013 Among the most successful of his early recordings for Columbia were \\"Hurrah For Baffin's Bay\\" and \\"By The Sycamore Tree\\", both in 1903. Roberts also recorded for Edison, Victor, and other companies. He recorded prolifically, recording some songs for several different labels. One of his biggest comedy successes was with \\"The Woodchuck Song\\", written by Theodore Morse, with a chorus of \\"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\\",Tim Gracyk, Bob Roberts - Tenor. Retrieved 16 May 2013 which he recorded in 1904 for Edison, Columbia, Victor, and Zon-O-Phone Records. He also recorded for both Edison and Columbia as part of a duo with Albert Campbell. He was at the peak of his recording career between 1903 and 1907, when he rivaled Billy Murray for popularity, and received a similar payment of $30 for each recording. He and Murray occasionally recorded together, as on \\"Oh! Oh! Sallie\\", in 1905. Roberts was a leading exponent of the comedic \\"coon song\\", such as \\"Wouldn't It Make You Hungry\\", written by Harry Von Tilzer, and \\"I'm Satisfied\\", many of them recorded for Zon-o-phone, a subsidiary of Victor. The number of his recordings started to diminish around 1908, perhaps because he devoted more of his time to stage performances. Roberts spent long periods touring in vaudeville, where he became a popular monologist, and was a leading attraction at the Regal Theater in Los Angeles. However, he also continued to record for Edison, Columbia, Victor, and other labels such as Indestructible. He had further popular success in 1911 with his recording of \\"Woodman, Woodman, Spare That Tree\\", from the Ziegfeld Follies of 1911, and in 1912 with the earliest recording of \\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\\", for Victor Records. He did not record for any of the major companies after 1913 but, between 1914 and 1917, recorded for the Rex Talking Machine Company as Robert Roberts, including a duet with fellow vaudevillian Elida Morris. By the 1920s, Roberts had given up touring and returned to live in Cincinnati. He was married there on 14 December, 1920, to Catherine De Vine.Ohio marriage records, Ancestry.com According to Jim Walsh, he ran a pool hall there, and in the late 1920s appeared on radio station WCKY in a show called \\"Adolph and Otto\\".

Aircraft bridges must be designed for the substantial forces exerted by aircraft braking, affecting the lateral load in substructure design. Braking force of 70 percent of the live load is assumed in two recent taxiway bridge designs. And \\"deck design is more apt to be controlled by punching shear than flexure due to the heavy wheel loads.\\" Taxiway bridges are unusually wide relative to their length, and aircraft loading cannot be assumed to be distributed evenly to a bridge superstructure's web, so different modeling is required in these bridges' structural design.

And there are various other differences versus typical bridges covered by AASHTO standards.Anthony N. Mavrogiannis, of Airport Consultants Council, Review Comments on Advisory Circular 150/5300-13, Airport Design , see esp. p.3. A major issue is that closing an airport for construction even temporarily is impossible. Major alternatives considered for construction of a taxiway bridge in 2008 were: *use of precast, prestressed concrete I-girders *use of precast, prestressed concrete box girders *use of steel girders *cast-in-place, post-tensioned concrete box girder bridge.

A taxiway bridge must be designed to carry the weight of the maximum size airplanes crossing and perhaps stopping directly upon it. A runway bridge is similar but may have different stresses. Alternatively, a motorway may be brought by tunnel underneath one or more runways and taxiways. Examples include: *At Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, the Schiphol tunnel takes the A4 motorway underneath an airplane runway and two taxiways, and in 2003 a sixth runway was added at quite some distance west of the rest of airport, with use of two connecting taxiway bridges crossing the A5 motorway and the , respectively. *At Manchester Airport in the United Kingdom, the A538 road runs in a pair of twin-bore tunnels underneath the southern ends of both runways. *At Los Angeles International Airport, a tunnel was completed in 1953 allowing Sepulveda Boulevard to revert to straight and pass beneath the two runways; it was the first tunnel of its kind.LAX airport diagram, 1956 shows runways 25 and 26 crossing the line of Sepulveda Boulevard (although boulevard is not indicated). *At Indianapolis International Airport, a taxiway bridge is planned to connect a future fourth runway across the Interstate 70.

The simplest example is the family household, which can be a system of obligations nevertheless. Moneyless economies are studied in econometry, in particular, game theory and mechanism design. See the section on microeconomics below. When embedded in a monetary economy, a non-monetary economy represents work such as household labor, care giving, civic activity or even friends doing something for each other that does not have a monetary value but remains a vitally important part of the economy. While labor that results in monetary compensation is more highly valued than unpaid labor, nearly half of American productive work goes on outside of the market economy and is not represented in production measures such as the GDP.  Embedded non-monetary economies  The non-monetary economy, typically embedded in a monetary economy, undertakes tasks that benefit society (whether through producing services, products, or making investments) that the monetary economy does not value. The non-monetary economy makes the labor market more inclusive by valuing previously ignored forms of work. Some acknowledge the non-monetary economy as having a moral or socially conscious philosophy that attempts to end social exclusion by including poor and unemployed individuals, providing economic opportunities and access to services and goods. Community-based and grassroots movements encourage the community to be more participatory, thus providing a more democratic economic structure. See also the non-monetary aspects of mutual aid as an organisational theory.  Core (or social) economy  The social economy refers to the space between public and private sectors occupied by civil society, including community organizations, volunteering, social enterprises, and cooperatives. The social economy represents ‚Äúa wide family of initiatives and organisational forms ‚Äî i.e. a hybridisation of market, non-market (redistribution) and non- monetary (reciprocity) economies‚Äù. Rather than being fringe activities at the margins of the formal economy, this amounts to a significant level of activity: The \\"civil society\\" sector of the United Kingdom employs the equivalent of 1.4 million full-time employees (5% of the economically active population) and benefits from the unpaid efforts of the equivalent of 1.7 million full-time volunteers (5.6% of the economically active population), and contributes 6.8% of GDP. Edgar S. Cahn developed the concept of the core economy to describe the informal social networks that he considered the bedrock of society, which he felt were eroding as monetary economies de-legitimized them. The core economy as he defined it consists of social capital, and generates collective efficacy that's of critical importance to the core economy. Collective efficacy refers to the effectiveness of informal mechanisms by which residents themselves achieve public order. More specifically, this is the shared vision or fusion of shared willingness of residents to intervene and create social trust (the sense of engagement and ownership of public spaces), intervening in the lives of other residents to counter crime, increase voting, or encourage residents to recycle. These informal mechanisms are what he calls social capital, a public good provided by citizens who participate to build up their communities (from raising children and taking care of the elderly to volunteer work). This kind of work is essential to a democratic and stable society. Unlike a market economy, the core economy relies on specialization reinforced by a \\"do-it-yourself\\" attitude that ‚ÄúBuilds self-esteem and a voluntary interdependence that replaces involuntary dependence that comes w/ industrial and market specialization‚Äù and where self-sufficiency is based upon interdependent family or community units (instead of a market economy's atomized individual). This model reduces or eliminates the involuntary dependence that comes with the market economy's strict division of labor. It also focuses on alternative distribution mechanisms to pricing, using instead normative considerations like need, fairness, altruism, moral obligation, or contribution. Collective efficacy and social capital are central to two very successful examples of civic-based, non-monetary economies: time banks and local exchange trading systems (LETS). These work systems provide alternative forms of currency, earned through time spent in directly serving the community, e.g. working in the community garden, recycling, repairing leaky faucets, babysitting. These units of time can be used to ask other members of work systems to do jobs they need, or may act as a forum in which special jobs or needs can be communicated and traded. These systems operate to a large degree outside of the monetary economy, though do not supersede the monetary economy or seek a return to systems of barter.  Time banks  A time bank is a community-based organization which brings people and local organizations together to help each other, utilizing previously untapped resources and skills, valuing work which is normally unrewarded, and valuing people who find themselves marginalized from the conventional economy. These are things that family or friends might normally do for each other, but in the absence of supportive reciprocal networks, the time bank recreates those connections. These interactions are based upon the exchange of hours spent on an activity, where time dollars are the unit of measure/ currency. They are traded for hours of labour, and are redeemable for services from other members.  Community building  In 1998, Redefining Progress estimated that housework amounted to $1.911 trillion, roughly one-fourth of the U.S. GDP that year. As of 2010, the Bureau of Economic Analysis found that household work, if tracked, would increase the GDP by 26%. More than a decade later, household work continues to provide a key source of foundational support to the domestic economy. Such household work includes cleaning, cooking, care giving, and educating children. There may be a closed household economy, where a specific (perhaps familial) group of individuals benefits from the work performed. In extreme cases of survival, the open nature of the household economy is most evident. Food, clothing, toiletries, and basic necessities were often shared or exchanged amongst war-torn, impoverished families in East Europe post- communism. Cooking, cleaning, clothes-making, and forms of work may seem to be intuitively thought of as work. An Australian study (1992) determined that an estimated 380 million person-hours per week were spent on these types of unpaid activities, compared to 272 million hours per week at paid work. A large portion of these hours can be attributed to nurturing. Nurturing can take two forms, in terms of raising children and nursing the sick, elderly, and infirm, both still usually expected from women and girls. Children represent not only a product of a household but an asset to the community as a whole. In the home, kids may provide help in the form of chores and so are an asset. In a greater sense, children are a public good: an investment in which time, energy, and money are spent so that they can become stable adults who share in reducing national debt and contributing to Social Security, thus a public good. As children mature and learn, they have the potential to benefit society in whatever profession or products they eventually produce. The products and services produced within a home are open to the non-market economy at large. Society as a whole benefits from this unpaid work, whether in an immediate manner or a more abstract, macro scale. The other form of home-based nurturing also serves benefits society as a whole. Care giving provides assistance for those who are elderly, disabled, suffering terminal illness or chronic illness, or are generally frail or in need of assistance. Someone who cares for someone in any of these positions is a caregiver. This is largely provided unpaid by friends or family of the patient. Care giving often exceeds the nursing tasks that come with caring for someone who is ill or recovering from surgery. Often, caregivers also must maintain the dwelling, provide meals, and interact with medical providers and doctors, among other responsibilities. Nearly 80% of labor that keeps seniors out of nursing homes is unpaid labor by families. In 1997, the value of work produced by caregivers was estimated at $196 billion. The figure was $375 billion for 2007. At the time, only $32 billion was spent on formal health care and $83 billion spent on nursing home care by the federal government. According to these statistics, only half as much money is spent on nursing and home health care as is necessary. These numbers do not take into account the financial burden as well as emotion work that is an inescapable part of this work. The same research estimated that in 1997 caregivers would have received $8.18 as the hourly wage. As of May 2013, the hourly wage was estimated at $9.14 when averaging the minimum wage in Florida and the median wage for Home Health Aides. Caregiving requires a large dedication, as much as 22 to 70 hours a week. An estimated 25.8 million people as of 1997 performed these tasks. Caregiving has a disproportionate effect on women and white households. The cost of caregiving is exorbitant, nearly five times what Medicaid would have spent on long-term care, meaning only wealthy families can afford to do this type of in-home care. The intersection of class and race in this phenomenon is an important place to explore as less advantaged families will have to rely on government care, potentially at the risk of having less quality care. These statistics also highlight a differential effect on women, showing that women disproportionately do caregiving work. Valuing all work changes perceptions of what constitutes valuable work. Acknowledging a non-monetary economy may change the ways in which the unemployed, poor, women, and other stigmatized persons‚Äô work is valued. It can allow citizens to see their community as a more cohesive, intertwined system that deserves their time and energy. Exploring this economy also exposes numerous areas of help that do not have enough support from the public and private sectors. Education and caregiving in particular highlight where assistance is needed and often not provided.  Barter economies  Barter economies also constitute an important form of non-monetized interaction, although for the most part this kind of interaction is viewed largely as a temporary fix as an economic system is in transition. It is also usually considered a side effect of a tight monetary policy such as in a liquidity crisis, like that of 1990s Russia where barter transactions accounted for 50 percent of sales for midsize enterprises and 75 percent for large ones.  Moneyless interaction of individuals with the monetary economy  This concerns individuals who agree with a participant of the monetary economy to exchange goods or services (reciprocation) or to receive them without any obligation (genuine gift.) For instance, begging for anything but money, perhaps in exchange of religious services, as is the case for mendicants. Examples of individuals: # Raphael Fellmer # Heidemarie Schwermer Film: Living Big on Less on Vimeo and http://livingwithoutmoney.org/ # Carolien Hoogland # Mildred Lisette Norman  Free contributions to the intellectual common good  This is a case of mutualism (see macroeconomies below) embedded in the monetary economy and restricted to intellectual labour. Typical examples are posting questions and answers on an internet forum and, of course, wikipedia. In these cases, subsistence is usually guaranteed by the monetary economy. Categories of such contributions are Commons-based peer production, Open source, Creative Commons license, and so on.  Non-monetary microeconomies  This concerns moneyless economies which are often embedded in a monetary economy but not necessarily interacting with it. (The distinction from other categories is somewhat artificial.) Examples of interacting economies are families and larger communities, like the one in Twin Oaks, where members are supposed to work 42 hours per week on average and jobs are assigned manually.https://moneyless.org/living-without-money-twin- oaks Publicly known utilities Suppose first that cost and profits are publicly known. In game-theory, markets initially were modeled as barter for sake of purity. However, the market models use utilities. These naturally lead to introduce idealised money as an exchange commodity, which has a transferable utility. This greatly simplifies models and solutions. Yet, so- called games without side-payment have gained attention because of the Internet economy, for example, as a model of cooperation between autonomous systems. Privately known utilities Often, participants can misreport their properties, like their preferences. Using so-called mechanism design one can try to arrange the economy so that such misreporting is discouraged. One such case is rationing, which is a mechanism for allocating scarce goods. An example is uniform rationing, which (loosely speaking) serves first who asks least. Uniform rationing can also be arranged to more or less the same effect by paying certain prices.Herv√© Moulin (1995) Cooperative microeconomics. A game-theoretic introduction. Princeton University Press. Uniform rationing is emulated using competitive equilibrium with equal incomes (pp. 195, 248) or, without Pareto efficiency, using fixed prices (p.144). If the available amount is collected from multiple participants (the suppliers) and redistributed among the demanders along certain links (bipartite rationing) then a similar mechanism is the so-called egalitarian transfer. This is further generalised to the uniform gains rule, which is based on a so-called leximin ordering. Other examples of mechanisms without money (yet with numerical utilities) are truthful resource allocations like the partial allocation mechanism, which is an approximation of so-called proportionally fair allocation of divisible resources;Richard Cole, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Gagan Goel (2013) Mechanism design for fair division: allocating divisible items without payments, Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM conference on Electronic commerce, June 2013 Pages 251‚Äì268. doi:10.1145/2492002.2482582 furthermore, combinatorial auctions;Dimitris Fotakis, Piotr Krysta, Carmine Ventre (2014) Combinatorial auctions without money.

Roth (oct. 2000) The Art of Designing Markets, Harvard Business Review. https://hbr.org/2007/10/the-art-of-designing-markets Voting (of which there are many kinds) is yet another alternative. Even if money is not used, there may be a unit of exchange, for example, when a present profit is \\"payed\\" by renouncing a promised profit. In 2009, researchers at Microsoft called for more research into truthful (i.e. strategy-proof) non-monetary mechanisms, such as allocations on the internet.Procaccia, A. and Tennenholtz, M. 2009.

Non- monetary macroeconomies  The following is a list of moneyless systems which intend (or did) encompass an entire society.  Moneyless systems having a technological component  The following systems aim at moneyless societies, often aided by technology. # Technology-driven, often centralised (\\"resource based\\") societies: the Zeitgeist movement, its related projects named Venus, Auravana, or Kadagaya in Peru,https://moneylesssociety.com/ and the Money Free Party. # The Technocracy movement, which proposes to replace money with energy certificates. # Large-scale algorithmic distribution (as envisaged by Stefan Heidenreich) for negociating \\"matched transactions,\\" each of which \\"has effects beyond all immediate participants.\\" Yet, the procedure emulates money \\"when our profiles, our likes, and our consumer histories are used to calculate who will buy what and where.\\"Stefan Heidenreich (2017) \\"Geld [crossed out] F√ºr eine non-monet√§re √ñkonomie\\" (Money [crossed out] For a non- monetary economy) Merve Verlag, .

People contribute to a community without payment not only to help but also because they expect to be helped by a member of the community when in need (a selfish interpretation of solidarity.) So, the term 'mutualism' is understood as aid by the community and not necessarily reciprocation. # The redistribution economy like practiced by the Incas and its contemporary penchant, the Minka communal work. Possibly, also the empire of Majapahit.Arjan van Aelst (1995) Majapahit Picis: The Currency of a 'Moneyless' Society 1300-1700. Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, Vol.151, nr.3, pp.357-393 # Labour vouchers, which are inalienable certificates of hours worked. # Non-monetary communist currents, ranging from libertarian proposals to the harsh reality of Democratic Kampuchea. Many communists and socialists envisaged a moneyless society. Abstract: https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Non-Market_Socialism See pp.33 ff. of ch.2 by Anitra Nelson: Money versus Socialism, pp.23-46. # Gift economies: other than the word suggests, the gift in such economies usually comes with an obligation to do something in return. # Altruistic society: as proposed by Mark Boyle, a moneyless economy is a model \\"on the basis of materials and services being shared unconditionally\\" that is, without explicit or formal exchange.Mark Boyle (2012) The moneyless manifesto. Hampshire: Permanent Publications and White River Junction: Chelsea, p.34 # The subsistence economy, which caters only for essentials, often without money. # Calculation in kind, which (in a restricted form) dispenses with any general unit of calculation when exchanging goods or services. # Natural economy, where resources are allocated through direct bartering, entitlement by law, or sharing out according to traditional custom. # Non-market ecosocialism as advocated by Anitra Nelson: as for the nonmonetary aspect, each household \\"guesstimates\\" its basic needs, which are met in return for \\"collective production as a community obligation.\\" The production, distribution, and procurement of goods and services from \\"more distant communities\\" are collectively agreed on.  Policy implications of embedded non-monetary economies  The UK in particular has been targeted by the government since the New Labor administration of the mid-1990s onwards‚Äîthe social economy has been developed as a means of delivering effective public services, and mobilizing active citizenship. In 2002, for example, the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) 2002 launched the Strategy for Social Enterprise to develop ‚Äúthe government‚Äôs vision ‚Ä¶ of dynamic and sustainable social enterprise strengthening an inclusive and growing economy.‚Äù The intent of the Strategy was to create an enabling policy environment for social enterprise, to make social enterprises better businesses, and to establish the value of social enterprise, in order that the sector may help to deliver on a range of policy agendas: productivity and competitiveness; contributing to socially inclusive wealth creation; neighborhood regeneration; public service reform; and developing an inclusive society and active citizenship. However, by and large current policy does not reflect the implications of a system that does not validate actions that transmit community values, provide support, generates consensus, etc. These actions in the past were subsidized by cheap or free labor derived from subordinate groups, like women and ethnic or racial minorities, who as a result of entering the workforce to receive monetary validation negate these positive public goods. The biggest issue that time bank coordinators face, as a result, is funding. Time banks do not rely on volunteers, but require financial support ‚Äî to pay the time broker‚Äôs salary, for a publicly accessible drop-in office, for marketing costs ‚Äî to successfully attract socially excluded people in deprived neighborhoods. While many UK time banks have been supported by grant funding from the National Lottery, over time it becomes harder to secure ongoing funding, or to increase the funding available for time banks overall, and established projects close while new ones are begun elsewhere.  United States time banks and the IRS  Organizations that administer time banks, barter networks, or currencies may register for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) as non-profit organizations working to benefit the community. The IRS has recognized some time banks as tax exempt; it is harder to obtain exemptions for a barter network or local currency, as they are harder to prove as operating purely on a basis of service to the community. Being a time bank alone does not enable an organization to obtain tax exemption under 501(c)(3). If, instead of a time bank, an organization operates a local currency or barter network, such an organization may be deemed to be operating for the private benefit of individuals, even if those individuals are members of a charitable class. An exchange platform that is designed for use of the broader community, and not specifically for a charitable class, may not be considered a tax-exempt activity for a 501(c)(3) organization.

The land was formerly an opencast coal mining area that was flooded in 1988, after the riverbank collapsed. Repairs and remediation required its own act in Parliament to allow the necessary works to go ahead. Mining ceased at St Aidan's in 2002. The nature park opened to the public in May 2013 under the care of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). However, the car park and visitor centre were subsequently closed in July 2013 due to unresolved land issues. With the successful transfer of St Aidan's to Leeds City Council, a 99-year lease was signed from the council to the RSPB in March 2017. The site is now open and functioning as an RSPB nature park. It is open every day excluding Christmas Day with the visitor centre open from 9.30 am to 5 pm February ‚Äì October and 9.30 am to 4 pm November ‚Äì January. RSPB St Aidan's Nature Park is designed for both people and wildlife and is open for a wide range of activities, from bird watching, cycling and walking to jogging, horse riding and dog walking.  History  St Aidan's nature park comprises the former St Aidan's opencast site, Lowther North opencast site and parts of the former Savile Colliery, Methley. In March 1988, there was a slope failure on the banks of the River Aire, resulting in a massive flood of of water. RAF Chinook helicopters were used to ferry sandbags into the breach, but it did not stop the water cascading in. It took four days for the floodwater to fill the mine workings. Not only did the downstream river flow into the site, but the River Calder actually flowed upstream in the River Aire waterbed from Castleford until the water found a natural level. Government documentation states that it was the Aire and Calder Navigation, whilst others list the Aire as being the source of the water that flooded St Aidan's. The failure came about just southeast of Lemonroyd Lock where the two waterways converge. The resultant deluge created a lake that was in size and deep. Mining operations were suspended and remedial works costing ¬£20 million were required to drain the site and re-route the river. Mining resumed after ten years was subsequently completed. The site was then converted into a wetland reserve. The Pontefract and District Archaeological Society won the Pitt Rivers award for their work on the preservation of the ships and heritage that was found in the abandoned river bed after the water was diverted. The find provided a unique insight into river trade in the seventeenth century onwards, including the hulls of four boats (virtually intact), various pottery and evidence of a medieval weir. Ownership of the land was transferred in 2010 from UK Coal/Harworth Estates to St Aidan's Trust, a charity administered by Leeds City Council. The trust would then lease the land to the RSPB for 99 years on a peppercorn rent. The Country Park officially opened to the public on 25 May 2013. Unfortunately, due to unresolved land ownership issues, the RSPB withdrew its staffing and support in July 2013. As of 21 December 2016 ownership of St Aidan's was successfully passed from Harworth Estates to the St Aidan's Trust (of which Leeds City Council is the sole trustee). The site was then leased to the RSPB on a 99-year lease and reopened in April 2017. The RSPB now have control of the management of the site, including the car park, visitor centre and visitor operations. Location St Aidan's is adjacent to the River Aire and the Aire and Calder Navigation. The nature park can be accessed via a network of paths, some of which run alongside the River Aire. It is approximately 2 miles from Woodlesford railway station. Nearby are the residential areas of Allerton Bywater, Mickletown, Methley, Woodlesford, Swillington and Great Preston, all of which lie within an area bounded by three motorways: A1(M), M62 and M1. Wildlife The main trails at St Aidan's pass through a variety of habitats including reedbed, wetland, meadows and woodland. St Aidan's is home to many species of bird including the Eurasian bittern, little owl, western marsh harrier, and Eurasian skylark. Breeding birds on the site include one of the rarest in the UK, black-necked grebe with around 25% of the national population which nest, for protection, near the one-thousand pairs of black-headed gull. Northern lapwing and common redshank also breed. Dragline \\"Oddball\\", near Swillington There is a giant and unique \\"walking\\" dragline known as Oddball at St Aidan's. The name refers to it having been built in the US to run on a 60 Hz electrical supply rather than the UK standard 50 Hz. Originally christened Clinchfield, it was brought to the UK from the US in 1954, when it was the second-largest such machine in the world, weighing . It moved to St Aidan's in 1988 and was used to mine surface coal from the area now occupied by the Country Park. Its maximum speed was , in steps of at a time. It last moved in 1999, when it was moved to the top of the hill overlooking the reserve, for preservation.

The \\"LST\\" stands for Landing Ship, Tank, while \\"USS\\" stands for United States Ship. LST-594 was part of the second wave of LSTs, denoted LST Mk.2s, which began production in 1943, replacing the earlier Mk.1 version. Within the Mk.2 version, there were three classes: LST-1, LST-491 and LST-542. USS LST-594 was a member of the 542 class, which had several operational and armament upgrades over the prior classes. History Construction of LST-594 began on July 1, 1944, when her keel was laid down at Evansville, Indiana by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Company (MVB&I;). MVB&I; was one of five major inland shipbuilders, and, with International Steel Company (also located in Evansville), contributed the greatest number of LST's to the American war effort. Completed in 43 days, she was launched on August 12, 1944, and was sponsored by Mrs. Everett B. Wiley. She was commissioned September 6, 1944, with Lt. Edgar Y. M. Henderson, USNR, in command. The ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific Theater. For her efforts, LST-594 was honored with the American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp), and the Philippines Liberation Medal. Following the end of World War II, LST-594 performed occupation duty in the Far East. She also saw service in China until mid- February 1946. She was decommissioned on February 21, 1946, and struck from the United States Navy list on March 5, 1947. On June 4, 1947, LST-594 was sold to the government of South Korea. Her final fate is unknown. Description The 542 class of LSTs, of which LST-594 was one, was the third step in the evolution of Mk.2 LSTs. Changes in the later LST-542 class included the addition of a navigation bridge, the installation of a water distillation plant with a capacity of 4,000 gallons per day, the removal of the tank deck ventilator tubes from the center section of the main deck, the strengthening of the main deck to carry a smaller Landing Craft Tank (LCT), and an upgrade in armor and armament, with the addition of a 3\\"/50 caliber gun.

Melba has a student population of approximately 560 students. The school's main campus is on Brentnall Road in Croydon. History During mid-2009, a merger of Maroondah and Croydon Secondary Colleges was proposed, following the goal of the Maroondah Education Coalition to improve secondary education. Despite poor community feedback around the merger, plans and a site study were completed to build a new school on the site of Maroondah Secondary College (the current Brentnall Road campus). The project was not funded in the 2010/2011 Victorian State Budget. Despite the project's lack of funding, Croydon Secondary College and Maroondah Secondary College ceased operations as individual schools at the end of the 2011 school year. They merged under the temporary name Croydon Maroondah Secondary College for the start of the 2012 school year but continued operating at their respective campuses. Melba Secondary College was then officially established with the Victorian Department of Education in January 2013. The founding principal was Terry Bennett, formerly the principal of Maroondah Secondary College, and also the principal of the temporary Croydon Maroondah Secondary College. The merger also attracted some students from the nearby Parkwood Secondary College which was closed at the end of the 2012 school year, although Parkwood was not officially involved in the merger. Between 2013 and 2017, the old Croydon Secondary College site on Croydon Road served as the Junior Campus and the Maroondah Secondary College site on Brentnall Road was the Senior Campus. Building works Croydon and Maroondah Secondary Colleges were part of the Maroondah Education Coalition which was promised $100 million for redevelopment of school buildings by the then Labor state government, prior to the 2010 state election. The Labor government lost the 2010 election and the funding was not received, so the individual schools had no major upgrades until after the merger. Prior to the 2014 state election, Melba College was promised $10 million for building upgrades by both major political parties. The school was then listed for building upgrades in the 2015/2016 Victorian State Budget as part of a $217 million statewide school upgrades project, and was provided $500,000 for planning. The proposed upgrade included an $18.4 million campus overhaul and constituted part of the Maroondah Education Plan. A further grant of $17.9 million was provided to the school in the 2016/2017 Victorian Budget. The first stage of the school upgrade commenced in July 2015 and was completed in May 2018, based on recommendations from the study conducted in 2010. The new buildings were awarded Best School Project Above $5 million in the 2018 Victorian School Design Awards. With the first stage complete, the Junior Campus on the former Croydon Secondary College site was closed in late 2017. All students now study on the Brentnall Road campus, the former site of Maroondah Secondary College. Funding for Stage 2 of the building project was provided in the 2018/2019 Victorian State Budget, and this project is due for completion in July 2020. Programs The school competes within the School Sport Victoria (SSV) Maroondah Division, Eastern Metropolitan Region and State Levels for sporting events and carnivals such as athletics, swimming, cross-country and team sports. The school has a comprehensive music program, with its school band participating in Melbourne's Anzac Day Parade annually. Name Melba Secondary College is named after Australia opera soprano Nellie Melba. The community was consulted for suggestions of names for the new school. The name Melba College is often used as an abbreviation.

History First Cymru Alexander Dennis Enviro 300 on a T1 service in Aberystwyth in January 2015 Optare Tempo on a T9 service at Cardiff bus station in May 2014 Richards Brothers Optare Tempo in January 2015 Launch plans In 2010 the Welsh Assembly Government ran a consultation on improvements to the TrawsCambria network.http://www.trawscymru.info/news/2011/03/ In 2011, a programme of improvements for TrawsCambria services X40 (Carmarthen - Pencader - Lampeter - Aberaeron - Aberystwyth) and 704/T4 (Newtown - Brecon/Merthyr) was announced. Under these plans services X40 and T4, and the network as a whole, were to be re-launched under the new TrawsCymru brand. Service X40 was to be re-numbered TC1 and T4 would have become TC4, along with extension south to Cardiff. During 2012, these two routes were to receive new Optare Tempos equipped with coach style seating, greater luggage space, real time information and WiFi.Tempo is the vehicle of choice for TrawsCymru Optare 27 March 2012 The plans for re-numbering T4 were dropped, but the new vehicles and extension to Cardiff were introduced. The six additional WAG-funded Optare Tempos with leather seats, free WiFi and tables operate alongside the existing three Optare Tempos that had previously worked the T4 service. The X40 was originally scheduled to be replaced by TrawsCymru service T1/TC1 from 1 April 2012 under a contract until 31 March 2020 on offer. However it later emerged that Arriva Buses Wales intended to stop operating the X40 service, along with its share of route 550, from 26 February.Your X40, X41 and 550 services are changing Arriva Instead Arriva introduced services branded Cymru Express on a fully commercial basis in place of the former TrawsCambria X40. Changes of plan Because of the commercial CymruExpress, the TC1 TrawsCymru service could not be introduced. The six new buses that had been ordered to operate the TC1 were thus placed into store. These were longer than the new vehicles for the TC4, so were later taken out of storage and put to use on the T4 service, to increase capacity. They replaced three of the vehicles that had been ordered for the TC4, which joined the remaining three unused vehicles which had been intended for the TC1 in store. In August 2013, the Welsh Government launched an express bus service between Cardiff Central station and Cardiff Airport. This was branded as a TrawsCymru route, given the number T9. Five of the six TrawsCymru buses were taken out of storage to operate this service, later being joined by the sixth. Arriva's CymruExpress services ceased on 21 December 2013, meaning a TrawsCymru service between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen was once again a possibility. Interim contracts to continue bus services on the route were let pending the introduction of a TrawsCymru service. Review In July 2013, it emerged that Welsh Government transport minister Edwina Hart had commissioned a review of the TrawsCymru network. This was to be undertaken by Dr Victoria Winckler, director of the Bevan Foundation think tank This outcome of this review was published by the Welsh Government in February 2014. Dr Winckler's report defined the purpose of TrawsCymru as a network of medium-to-long-distance (defined as 25 miles or more), strategically important, bus services that connect key towns in Wales and which complement the rail network in Wales. The report's recommendations included: * TrawsCymru requires a strategic, all-Wales, approach. Currently, TrawsCymru contracts are let by four different local authorities and this approach was considered too fragmented * That the implementation of any new corridors should be based on robust business plans which demonstrate demand and provide for a package of measures to improve the passenger journey. * TrawsCymru should complement the rail network and not seek to compete with rail services. Where justified by demand, it should provide good connections to onward rail services, but it should not be driven by or secondary to the rail network. * Service quality provision: ** TrawsCymru services should serve intermediate bus stops as well as main towns, but should avoid detours. ** The impact of intermediate stops/detours should increase the journey duration by no more than 50% longer than by car, and ideally less (around 33% being preferable). ** TrawsCymru should promote and accept CymruConnect (rail and bus combined) through-tickets, and action should be taken to improve the profile and performance of CymruConnect. ** TrawsCymru services need to address passenger facilities at bus stations and passenger information, which are part of responding to passenger needs. * Focus of effort in the short term should be on completing the rebrand of the five core TrawsCymru routes (T1 to T5) from TrawsCambria, rather than expansion of the TrawsCymru network to new routes * The TrawsCymru strategic board should focus on strategic issues with corridor delivery groups dealing with operational matters, on a formal basis. Both groups should have strengthened user representation. 2014/15 launches Richards Brothers Optare MetroCity on a T5 service in Aberystwyth in April 2015 During 2014, the roll-out of the TrawsCymru brand to the other TrawsCambria corridors finally began. The first route to appear was the Carmarthen-Aberystwyth route, but the original plan for the service to become known as TC1 has been dropped. The TrawsCymru service was instead launched under the service number T1, in August 2014. Unlike the T4 and T9 TrawsCymru contracts, the operator provides vehicles for the T1, rather than using vehicles owned by the Welsh Government. It remains to be seen how the vehicles used will compare to the Welsh Government owned ones on the other routes. Invitations To Tender were also published for the remaining three TrawsCambria routes X50 (Aberystwyth-Cardigan), T2 (Bangor-Aberystwyth) and X94 (Wrexham- Barmouth), to be known as T5, T2 and T3 respectively. The X94 became the T3 in November 2014, and the X50 the T5 in January 2015.GHA awarded TrawsCymru T3 Bus & Coach Buyer 30 October 2014Welsh Government funds new service Bus & Coach Buyer 8 January 2015 The T2 contract was expected to start in 2014, but due to last minute registrations of commercial workings by the incumbent operators ended up being let as a short term extension without TrawsCymru branding. In November 2015, the T2 was finally launched with branded buses in due course. Lloyds Coaches have ordered three Optare MetroCitys with the first two due in January 2016 and the third due in March 2016. Routes T1/T1S/T1C: Aberystwyth to Carmarthen/Swansea/Cardiff The T1 service commenced operating on 4 August 2014.New TrawsCymru service backed Bus & Coach Professional 17 July 2014Transport expert Stuart Cole on a Welsh Government transport success story in TrawsCymru Wales on Line 5 August 2014 An hourly service is provided Monday to Saturday with a few Sunday journeys. A late evening working also operates, between Aberystwyth and Lampeter. A single service number is used, but buses take two different routes between Pencader and Lampeter in order to serve intermediate villages every two hours (prior to the T1 launch, one village had an hourly bus service and the other nothing). The T1 is operated by First Cymru using standard buses from their existing fleet in TrawsCymru livery; many duties are subcontracted to Mid Wales Travel drivers. From August 2014 to July 2016 they used two Alexander Dennis Enviro200s and three Alexander Dennis Enviro300s, and from July 2016 to present they use five Enviro300s. Since December 2016 a Wright Eclipse Urban bodied Volvo B7RLE has also been T1 liveried and allocated. Journey time for the T1 is 2 hours 15 minutes.T1 timetable TrawsCymru 22 February 2015 According to Dr Winckler's review, the journey time by car is 1 hour 25 minutes, meaning the bus service takes 58% longer than driving and hence misses the target set by the review. From 5 December 2016 to 14 April 2018, First Cymru operated the T1C service using the T1 fleet, which was then a once per day (except Sundays) extension of the T1 to Swansea and Cardiff, introduced as a replacement for the more frequent 701 service which had ceased operating in August 2016 when its final operator, Lewis Coaches, ceased trading. The full journey time of the combined T1 & T1C service when operated by First Cymru was 4 hours 35 minutes. From 16 April 2018, NAT Group took over operation of the T1C service. NAT Group 16 April 2018 Though still once per day, the use of a separate Aberystwyth to Cardiff service by coach (in this case a Mercedes-Benz Tourismo bodied Mercedes-Benz OC 500 RF and Sunday operation both resumed, neither of which had been seen since the 701. The T1C as operated by NAT Group takes advantage of being a separate service to the T1 by bypassing Lampeter, Llanybydder, and from Monday to Saturday, Swansea, taking an hour off the full journey time which is now 3 hours 35 minutes. The T1S service also commenced operation by First Cymru on 16 April 2018 using the T1 fleet. The T1S provides connections at Carmarthen for passengers travelling between Aberystwyth and Swansea on Monday to Saturday, has an approximate full journey time of 1 hour and additionally serves the National Botanic Garden of Wales once per day in either direction. T2: Bangor to Aberystwyth The T2 service is operated by Lloyds Coaches (formerly Lloyds Coaches and Express Motors until the latter's closure in January 2018) and runs twice a day from Bangor to Aberystwyth, with additional workings over part of the route on Mondays to Saturdays. This service was introduced towards the end of September 2012, when Arriva Buses Wales cancelled TrawsCambria service X32. The T2 would have been the second TrawsCymru service launched but its status as a TrawsCymru service was dubious for many years as although the operators referred to the service as TrawsCymru from the start they did not have any TrawsCymru branded vehicles for use on the service. Instead, they used buses in their own standard liveries. In March 2016, the service was upgraded with four TrawsCymru branded Optare MetroCitys.Optare Metrocity buses for transformed TrawsCymru T2 service Optare 11 March 2016 In January 2018, one of those MetroCities, which was the one owned by Express Motors, was replaced by a brand new one owned by Lloyds Coaches. Since then, the original one was acquired and joined the fleet. T3: Wrexham to Barmouth The T3 service commenced operating on 2 November 2014. A more frequent Monday to Saturday service is provided compared to the previous TrawsCambria service X94 it replaces along with improved connections with the T2 service in Dolgellau. GHA Coaches were awarded a seven-year contract to operate the service, initially with existing buses (one single deck Scania OmniCity of which was TrawsCymru liveried) before taking delivery of three Alexander Dennis Enviro400 bodied Scania N230UDs and an Alexander Dennis Enviro200, all fitted with Wi-Fi and leather seats in 2015.\\"TrawsCymru double-decks await tree clearance\\" Buses issue 724 July 2015 page 10 Journey time is 2 hours 30 minutes.T3 timetable TrawsCymru July 2015 Following the collapse of GHA Coaches in July 2016, the service was immediately taken over by Lloyds Coaches. Initially, Lloyds Coaches entirely used vehicles they already owned, before acquiring all three of the Scania-ADL Enviro400s, but not the OmniCity nor the ADL Enviro200, the latter of which went to NAT Group as one of the T6 vehicles, so a different Enviro200 was used in its place. As of July 2017 that Enviro200 has been replaced with two brand new Optare MetroCitys. T4/T14: Newtown/Hereford to Cardiff The T4 was the first TrawsCymru service to be launched on 31 May 2011 and is operated by Stagecoach South Wales, who also operated the previous TrawsCambria 704 (which operated between Newtown and Brecon only).Future Timetable Information Cyngor Sir Powys County CouncilImproved bus services between Powys and South Wales County Times 23 June 2011 The service as launched was operated with nine Optare Tempos, branded TrawsCymru, three of which had been ordered and used on the 704 and were repainted into TrawsCymru livery. The other six were new vehicles introduced to extend the service to Cardiff. The new vehicles were to an enhanced standard with a new design of seat and WiFi. The three aging former TrawsCambria Optare Tempos were finally retired in May to June 2017 after more than a decade of service, and replaced with three transferred two-year-old Alexander Dennis Enviro300 bodied Scania K230UBs. The T14 service (Cardiff to Hereford via Merthyr Tydfil, Brecon and Hay-on-Wye) commenced operating on 2 September 2018. In July 2019, 12 MCV Evoras were introduced for use on both the T4 and the T14 replacing the remaining Tempos and Enviro300s. The service is the longest end-to-end journey on the TrawsCymru network, with a journey time of 3 hours 50 minutes.T4 timetable TrawsCymru August 2015 One of the new MCVs in Pontypridd on its first official day of service One of the 12 new MCVs for the T14 in Pontypridd heading to Cardiff T5: Aberystwyth to Haverfordwest The T5 was commenced on 5 January 2015.Aberystwyth to Haverfordwest bus link service begins BBC News 5 January 2015 Roughly hourly departures are provided from Aberystwyth, Cardigan, Fishguard and Haverfordwest but the service is made up of a number of different routes, the most frequent being: * Aberystwyth - New Quay - Cardigan - Fishguard - Mathry Road - Haverfordwest and * Aberystwyth - New Quay - Aberporth - Cardigan - Fishguard - Mathry Road - Haverfordwest (between Cardigan and Aberystwyth, this was formerly known as TrawsCambria service 550) Additionally: * One trip in each direction does not travel via New Quay (the northbound service is a short working, starting from Cardigan) * Several short-workings between Haverfordwest and Cardigan/Newport do not travel via Mathry Road * Some journeys operate via Goodwick and/or Trecwn Shortly before the service launched, the TrawsCymru website was updated to include the service, with the statement: \\"The TrawsCymru T5 provides a regular and direct service along the scenic Cambrian Coast, linking Aberystwyth, Aberaeron, New Quay, Cardigan, Fishguard and Haverfordwest.\\" This is inaccurate because not all journeys serve New Quay and the inclusion of Fishguard and (on some trips) New Quay and Aberporth means the service is by no means direct. The website also reported that the service operates 7 days per week, when in fact there are no services between 03:00 on Sundays and 05:45 on Mondays (effectively no Sunday service). By 8 January 2015, this latter error had been corrected to say that the service operates 6 days per week. The service was initially operated with existing buses, including four former TrawsCambria Optare Tempos, and four VDL SB200s (two with Wright Pulsar 2 bodies, one with an old- style Wright Pulsar body and one with an MCV Evolution body registered as YJ14CCV, which is a one-off, as it is an ex-demonstrator that only received orders on other chassis). All of these vehicles received TrawsCymru livery and seating, and in 2015 were joined by four new Optare MetroCitys.Optare MetroCitys for TrawsCymru route Bus & Coach Professional 3 June 2015Minister launches upgraded TrawsCymru service Welsh Government 3 July 2015Metrocitys for TrawsCymru Bus & Coach Buyer 9 July 2015 While the Tempos remain on the service, the fact that they are ageing former TrawsCambria examples (same as the older T4 ones withdrawn in 2017) as opposed to the newer ones used on the T4 and T9, means that the MetroCitys and SB200s are somewhat prioritised. The new MCV Evora bodied Volvo B8RLEs received for the T11 have been known to operate the T5.

He was educated at the Inner Temple, and was active in its affairs throughout his life. He 'rarely missed a parliament' of the Inner Temple, was Reader in 1543, 1544, and 1553, 'and held the highest offices', serving as treasurer during the years 1555-7, and as governor in 1555 and 1566. Among his legal clients were Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland; his paternal uncle, Sir Brian Stapleton; John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, whose will he witnessed in 1548; and the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, who paid him a retainer of 40s a year. In 1544 he was appointed Recorder for Colchester in Essex, perhaps through Lord Oxford's influence, and in the same year was granted the reversion of the office of Town Clerk of London,Reversion as here used means \\"the right of succeeding to an office after the death or retirement of the holder.\\" a practice that was frequently used in England down to the 19th century. See the definition at Wiktionary although he was not able to take up the position until 24 July 1570. By the early 1550s he was a member of Oxford's council.

In 1946 he co-founded the avant-garde Concrete-Invention art movement, which was Argentine branch of the larger concrete art movement. Biography Enio Iommi was born on March 20, 1926 in Rosario to the Italian sculptor Santiago Girola and the also Italian modiste Mar√≠a Iommi (the trade of a fashion designer for nowadays standards). His elder brother, Claudio Girola, was delivered in 1923 and Nidia, his sister, in 1929. Claudio and Enio grew up around their father's workshop and learned the craft of sculpture while they submerged themselves into an environment soaking in artistic culture. In 1939, as a consequence of the 30s‚Äô economic crisis, the Girolas moved to Buenos Aires. Still in his teens, Enio is introduced by his brother Claudio and his uncle Godofredo Iommi (the elder brother of their mother) to a group of young artists with whom he began to frequent and exchanged ideas about avant-garde art. At the beginning of the 40s, these young poets and painters rebelled against traditional Figurativism ‚Äìthe mainstream current in Argentina. Together they formed a spearhead ready to revamp it. Claudio Girola, Alfredo Hlito, Tom√°s Maldonado, Edgar Bayley, Gyula Kosice, Rod Rothfuss, Arde Quin and others got together at Rub√≠ bar, in front of Miserere Square. They were interested in the information, available albeit scarce in the city, about the Russian Constructivism and the Dutch De Stijl. Two groups of artists emerged from those gatherings that led the way across the path of Modern Art in Argentina: Concrete-Invention Art Association (in Spanish, Asociaci√≥n Arte Concreto Invenci√≥n) and Mad√≠ Arts (Arte Mad√≠). Both rejected figuration and representation, to which they opposed the invention. In other words, the creation in a pure sense. The ultimate abstraction. A visual morphology not addressing anything in particular. These ideas were later developed in the Arturo magazine, whose single issue appeared in 1944. Given Enio's young age, he is first a spectator, but quickly became an active member of the Concrete- Invention group, giving birth to his first painting over a linoleum sheet that same year. The following year, the artist took his first step into sculpture with Opposite Directions, a work of great formal maturity despite being a debut piece. The members of the Concrete-Invention Art Association showcased their first public exhibition in the Peuser art salon, located in Florida street. Among the participants were Claudio Girola, Tom√°s Maldonado, the Lozza brothers, Alberto Molemberg, Primaldo M√≥naco, Nu√±ez, Liddi Prati, Jorge Souza and Enio, who took his mother's last name ‚Äì Iommi‚Äì as his alias to distinguish himself from his brother. The traditional art circles and part of the press replied negatively to the cutting-edge proposal of the Geometric art. Without giving up, the members of the association met every Saturday to discuss new concepts. Enio Iommi drew visual sustenance from artists such as Max Bill and Georges Vantorgerloo. It seems that the sculpture Torn Circles is opposing to the theoretical bases of the Constructivism and, as the titles announces, it foreshadows one trait of his work: to sever from models that begin to suffocate his desire to explore new horizons. They continued presenting group expositions until 1950, when the association disbanded. Due to the initiative of the critic Aldo Pellegrini, another crew was formed under the name of Modern Artists of Argentina (in Spanish, Artistas Modernos de la Argentina), which flocked together independent Abstract and Concrete Art sculptors and painters. Maldonado, Hlito, Iommi, Sarah Grilo, Fernandez Muro, Ocampo, Aebi and Claudio Girola staged collective shows in Viau and Krayd galleries. Also, in the Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro, where they applied pioneering museological criteria. In 1953, Enio Iommi met Susana Schneider, a young polyglot Argentinian woman of French-Swiss descent, to whom he married three years later and who played a decisive role in the development of his career as an artist. That same year, he was invited to work on a sculpture for what is now known as Casa Curuchet, designed by the architect Le Corbusier. The Modern Artists chose separate individual ways in 1955 and abandoned their activities as a group. Claudio Girola and Godofredo Iommi migrated to Chile. After his wedding, Enio moved his workshop to Mor√≥n district for two years before settling permanently in Palomar. In this period, he initiated collaboration with the Austrian architect Herman Loos, for whom he designed decorative items ‚Äìan activity that enabled him to secure his livelihood whereas he continued to produce his personal work, which took a new direction. Without discarding Geometry, the new sculptures based on simple shapes as circles, squares, triangles and ellipses were more expressive. Enio Iommi began to feel choked with the Concrete art principles. On metal surfaces, he performed cuts, that deconstructed the initial plane in order to form new virtual volumes and create the space. This period, that the art critic L√≥pez Anaya refers as ‚ÄúBaroque‚Äù stretched out for 25 years, during which Enio Iommi asserted his identity as a Modern sculptor. 1957 was a year marked by the arrival of his daughter Claudia, followed by his son Rafael in 1964. Neither the former ‚Äìan anthropologist‚Äì nor the latter ‚Äìan astronomer‚Äìfollowed the steps of their father (albeit Rafael had dabbled in painting for a certain time), but they inherited a lifelong passion for the chosen disciplines. In 1958, Enio Iommi unveiled his first solo art show in the Pizarro gallery. It consisted of a retrospective exhibition where works of his first period were featured as well as his ongoing production, which gained him recognition in the artistic scene. In the decade of the 60, the exhibits succeeded each other, enhancing his prestige. In 1968, due to a grant received from the Italian embassy in Argentina, he was able to visit Italy, France, London and New York. The trip constituted a face-to-face contact with the work of the greatest past and contemporary authors. By the end of the 60s, the invitations abroad multiplied: the Nur√´mberg Biennale, the Kuntshalle Basel; the Middelheim Open Air Museum for Sculpture (Belgium), the Aele gallery (Madrid), Quebec Maison Milot; the Ottawa City Hall, Caracas Galer√≠a Arte Contacto, Tokyo Modern Art Museum; The Osaka National Museum of Art, the Hakone Open Air Museum (Tokyo), La Habana, Cuba; Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic, the Tokyo Contemporary Sculpture Center; the Hayward gallery (London), El Palacio de Vel√°zquez (Madrid); the Art Basel (Switzerland), the Rachel Adler Fine Art (NY), the Michael de Daemstadt gallery (Germany), FIAC (Paris); the Monterrey Museum (Mexico), the Bronx Museum of the Arts (NY), Kuntshalle Cologne (Germany) and so on. 1977 will bear witness of the new turn in Enio Iommi's work, who was in urgent need of venturing upon new creative pursuits. ‚ÄòIt is a nuisance for me to keep doing what I‚Äôm familiar with, when I feel confident is when I doubt the most. I like researching.‚Äô (Enio Iommi). In addition, the eye-catching sculptures he had been collecting until then didn't fit in the political context imposed by the coup d‚Äô√©tat of the previous year. He preferred to assemble rustic materials spotted in the street or in similar contexts. Splintered wood and barbed wires alluded to the dictatorship and the deprivation of freedom. The Julia Lublin gallery housed the exhibition ‚ÄúFarewell to an Era‚Äù, whose most prominent work: Acrylic Rectangle and Trash Presented as a Glossy Surface that Conceals a Chaotic Inside was a hint of the forthcoming decades. The expositions ‚ÄúSomething Happened to the Cube‚Äù (1979) and ‚ÄúWastage‚Äù (1981) incorporated cobblestone as their main material and reinforced the presence of barbed wire. Stones, sheet metal, marble and wooden crates appeared stitched in an unconventional way and affected by the passage of time. His pieces The Stone Guest and His Little Dog (1984) and Our Daily Bread is Getting Harder Everyday (1987) carried on the same leitmotiv referring to the historical phase. In the decade of the 90, he began to plan educational activities that would extend to the end of his days. First, as workshops conducted on the Sivori Museum and later on, in the Cromos Art Institute ‚Äìan institution in which he took part as a founding member. By 2007, he gave private group lessons at a workshop situated in Piedras street, San Telmo. In 1999, he promoted the creation of the collective X. The ‚Äòx‚Äô symbolized the crossroads and meeting places between young artists born in the 60s who came from different backgrounds: Ana Gallardo, Pablo Siquier, Ernesto Ballesteros, Jorge Macchi, Carolina Antoniadis, Marita Causa, Danilo Danziger, Andrea Racciatti, Gladis N√©stor, Enrique Jezik, Gustavo Figueroa, Juan Papparella and the filmmaker Martin Pels. Many of them have accomplished remarkable careers later on. It is likely that the series of works that Iommi developed in 1997 were the seeds of the new clues that the artist was going to explore in the 2000s. The series consisted on kitchen utensils such as coffee pots, kettles or pans that were disintegrated by means of cutting them, bringing forth new spatial forms. The series was presented by the Ruth Benzacar gallery. To the long list of sculptures sited on public places ‚ÄìConstructive Spaces (1971) at the garden of the Fine Art Museum of Buenos Aires, Spatial Tension (1982) in Punta del Este, Majamoa (1985) at the Baconao square in La Habana; Construction (1987) in the Shikoku island, Japan; Planes within the Plane (1988), Porto Alegre, etc. ‚Äì is added in 1998 the piece 26 ft Elevation placed in the Buriti Palace, the seat of government in the federal district of Brasilia. On My Utopies vs the Reality, the last show at the end of the century, Iommi affirmed his criticism about the excess of industrialization and the consumerism typical of the modern lifestyle. He accomplished this through the assembly of kitsch objects, low-quality plastic, china cups, artificial fruit, toys, brushes and others. The show was an introduction to what is known as the fourth period of the artist, in which he is devoted to convey new meanings through the composition of objects, whose artistic value was previously nonexistent. Once more, the materials were found and obtained from dollar stores. \\"Whenever I found a material that is appealing to me, I look for it and save it at home for some time. After a while, I employ the material because I‚Äôve already pondered on it. I envisage how the material appears on my mind and how my mind adapts to the material. I strive towards what I want to do. If an image appears so be it. If nothing shows up, then off to trash. Beware! Because trash is also good! \\" The first decade of the century and the last one of the artist is punctuated by sporadic expositions in which Iommi focused on specific ideas. Such is the case of ‚ÄúA Tribute to the Cambalache Tango‚Äù in the Ruth Benzacar gallery (2002), ‚ÄúThe Human Kitchen‚Äù (Infinito Gallery, 2002); ‚ÄúMy New Realities‚Äù (Infinito Gallery, 2007) and ‚ÄúThe Wonders of the World‚Äù (Klemm Foundation, 2012). All of them alternated with major retrospective exhibitions: the anthology exposition entitled ‚ÄúIommi‚Äùat the Cronopios room in the Recoleta Cultural Center, where 43 sculptures produced between 1945 and 2000 were displayed. At the Parque Espa√±a Cultural Center in Rosario, he presented ‚ÄúFrom the Space in Tension to the Object in Situation. 1945-2002‚Äù in 2003. In 2005, it took place the exhibit ‚ÄúEnio Iommi, 1946-2005. From Utopia to Dystopia‚Äù at the Museum of the Tres de Febrero University (MUNTREF for its Spanish acronym). The last retrospective show called ‚ÄúThe Edge of Space 1945-2010‚Äù presented by himself is hosted by Recoleta Cultural Center in 2010 and spanned his entire work. During this last period, Iommi also participated in a number of collective exhibitions. In 2009, the legislature of the city of Buenos Aires awarded him as a Distinguished Citizen. Shortly after the show at the Recoleta Cultural Center, Iommi had to undergo a delicate surgical procedure, after which his health became fragile. Nonetheless, his creative energy encouraged him to produce more sculptures, built from the objects he collected. But this time restricted to the perimeter of his home. Soda pop bottles, drug boxes, sushi sticks and items that created a new and different series from his previous works when combined together. Adding to this are the scores of drawings, paintings and collages. Enio Iommi passed away on May 13, 2013.

The gay rights activists holding the rally were met by thousands of protestors opposing homosexuality, who were allowed to break through a police cordon and violently pursued them, beating and throwing stones at them. The rally, organized by Georgian LGBT-rights organization Identoba, was the first officially sanctioned anti-homophobic demonstration held in Georgia. Two days earlier, Ilia II of Georgia, the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church, had called for banning the gay rights rally, describing homosexuality as an \\"anomaly and disease.\\" The day before the rally, Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili stated that LGBT individuals \\"have the same rights as any other social groups\\" in Georgia. Dozens of gay rights activists had gathered in downtown Tbilisi for the rally. A reported 20,000 Georgian Orthodox church members protested, led by church priests, and a clash ensued in Pushkin Park, near Freedom Square. Police forces did not prevent the homophobic protesters from running at the anti-homophobia rally participants, as priests asked. Anti-homophobia demonstrators were evacuated by the police in buses, which were attacked by the counter-demonstrators. According to different sources, 17 to 28 people were injured as a results of the clashes. Reaction The violence was widely condemned by foreign embassies, and non- governmental organisations including Transparency Georgia, the Georgian Young Lawyers' Organization and Amnesty International. Ilia II of Georgia condemned any violence, but reiterated his view that homosexuality is a sin and should not be popularized. The Ministry of Internal Affairs launched an investigation and promised prosecution of the perpetrators. Paul Rimple and Mark Mullen have described the events as part of a larger struggle between the church and the secular government.

In May, the Tal Law ruling in 2012 led to protests by Haredi against conscription. Again in November, Bedouins in the Negev called for a Day of Rage against their displacement. Haredi protests Following announcements that the new government plans to gradually incorporate the Haredi Jewish population of Israel into the country's armed forces, there were widespread protests against the government and the draft. On 16 May of that year, between 15,000 and 30,000 Haredim demonstrated outside an IDF recruiting office in Jerusalem. Some allegedly threw stones and bottles at police and called them Nazis. Bedouin protests The Prawer-Begin plan to move Bedouins out of unrecognised villages, which the government has termed \\"illegal\\" and a \\"land grab,\\" is intended to move them to state-planned towns. Former General Doron Almog, who is tasked with implementing the plan, said: \\"The idea is to ... better integrate Jews and Bedouins; to bring many more Bedouins to our work force; to employ and educate many more women for employment; and to build new communities; and to expand some of the current communities and make them modern.\\" Its stated aim is also to \\"modernise\\" the Bedouin and improve their quality of life. US$340m has been allocated over five years for the project. A Day of Protest was called against the plan that organisers said would evict 40,000 Bedouin citizens from their homes and into impoverished townships. The main protest was scheduled to be held near the Bedouin township of Hura on 30 November, with other protests planned in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and in several other cities across Europe, North America and the Middle East. Bedouin activist Huda Abu-Obeid said: \\"The government is trying to present the plan as 'in the best interest of the Bedouin', while with one hand it is acting to destroy Bedouin villages‚Ä¶ and with the other it is building new Jewish localities in the Negev, some of these in the very same places where the [Bedouin] villages stand today.\\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/11/rage-protests-bedouin- eviction-plan-201311306106771519.html Following expectation the plan would fail a Knesset vote it was canceled.

Everyone tries to investigate the problem of how the stage got burnt. Plus, Tinka tries to be nice to Rocky and CeCe after Gunther moves to the old country. At the end, she, Rocky, and CeCe become friends. The problem is finally solved when one of the firemen says that a tanning bed was the reason why the stage got burnt and Gary ends up being the perpetrator because he forgot to turn it off when they went to Japan. CeCe and Rocky try to find other things to do since they can't perform on the show for a while, but they began to fall into a \\"funk stage.\\" In the episode \\"Quit It Up,\\" the stage has finally re-opened, but everyone has to re-audition for the show. In the episode \\"Ty It Up,\\" Gary has been replaced with a new producer, Phil, who makes everyone re-audition. Ty tries to become a dancer on the show which effects Rocky.

In the episode \\"Forward and Back It Up,\\" Rocky saves Phil's life when he chokes on a meatball. He then gives her the job back on the show, but Rocky wants to earn it by re- auditioning. She finally decides to take her job back and is now back on the show. Georgia starts dating firefighter, Jeremy Hunter and they subsequently get engaged and plan a wedding.

Making his professional debut in 2007, he reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in 2012. His highest rank has been maegashira 4, achieved in January 2016. He has one jury≈ç division y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship. He is a member of the Tomozuna stable. Early life and sumo background In 2004, Erdenbaatar first came to Japan. He came as an exchange student through the Mongolian Judo Federation and became a student at Motosu City First High School in Gifu Prefecture. In his second year of high school he took first place in the prefectural judo tournament and went on to take third place in the T≈çkai regional tournament. He had no experience in sumo beforehand, but having aspired to fellow Mongolian Kyokutenh≈ç's success he decided to join ≈åshima stable, the same stable as his idol. He was able to circumnavigate sumo's one-foreigner-per-stable rule because Kyokutenh≈ç had become a naturalized Japanese citizen, although this loophole has since been closed. In April 2012 the stable closed with his stablemaster, former ≈çzeki Asahikuni, close to the mandatory retirement age, and he moved to Tomozuna stable. Career He first stepped onto the dohy≈ç in May 2007. In November of that same year at the rank of jonidan 5 he achieved a perfect 7‚Äì0 record and then won a three-man playoff to take his first y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship. He rose steadily through the ranks recording only a few losing tournaments (two of which he withdrew from due to injury) before reaching the rank of makushita 2 in the July 2011 tournament. His convincing record of 5‚Äì2 at this record allowed him to rise to the level of sekitori and in the following September tournament he was given the rank of jury≈ç 10. A strong 9‚Äì6 showing followed by an even stronger 10‚Äì5 in the following January tournament allowed him to reach the top makuuchi division in only two tournaments. However a record of only 3‚Äì12 in his January 2012 divisional debut brought him demotion back to the second division after only one tournament. Though Kyokush≈´h≈ç seemed to have found his stride again after posting two consecutive 9‚Äì6 tournaments in the following March and May tournaments, a disastrous eight consecutive losses followed by a withdrawal from the July 2012 tournament saw him relegated back to the unsalaried ranks for the first time in a year. He bounced back quickly in the September tournament and a 6‚Äì1 record at makushita 1 put him right back in the salaried ranks. An 8‚Äì7 kachi-k≈çshi in the November tournament and a very strong showing of 11‚Äì4 in the January 2012 tournament would put him at the rank of jury≈ç 2 for the March tournament. Here he achieved his most successful tournament yet by posting a 12‚Äì3 record and the championship. To achieve this he beat fellow Mongolian Azumary≈´ on the final day to give both the same record for the tournament and then later in the day beat him again in a playoff to take the championship. For the May tournament Kyokush≈´h≈ç was promoted to the top division for the second time to a new highest rank of maegashira 12, but had to withdraw through injury on Day 10. He reached his highest rank to date of maegashira 4 in January 2016, but an injury forced him to sit out the May 2016 tournament, and this resulted in a fall to jury≈ç. His last appearance in the top division was in March 2017, and he has remained in jury≈ç since then. Fighting style Kyokushuho is a yotsu sumo wrestler, preferring grappling techniques to pushing or thrusting. His favoured grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt is migi yotsu, meaning his left hand is inside and his right hand outside his opponent's. A straightforward yori kiri or force out is his most common winning kimarite but he also regularly uses oshi dashi (push out) and uwatenage (overarm throw).

It is related to candombe, Murga and tablados. It has evolved into a dance parade in which different comparsas play the drums and dance to the music at \\"Desfile Inaugural del Carnaval\\" and Llamadas parade. The biggest carnival celebrations are in the capital Montevideo and can last up to 40 days, involving a series of cultural events such as dance parades in the streets, street stages called \\"tablados\\" and an artistic contest in the \\"Teatro de Verano\\" (Summer Theatre) in Montevideo.Carnaval del Uruguay Carnival in Montevideo is very different from carnival celebrations in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.6 reasons why carnival in Montevideo is unique, Guru'Guay candombe drums  History  Origins The background of the Uruguayan Carnival comes from Europe, where in different contexts (the celebration of the harvest or a religious festival) it served as a space for meeting people and creating a space for individual and collective freedom. Already, on Uruguayan soil, in colonial times, on the days of Carnival, Christmas, and New Year, Montevideans (black slaves) were covered with bright and gaudy robes and went outside to the city walls. They were allowed to sing their songs and perform dances. Some common practices of carnival in Europe, bran and flour shed, shed water syringes, throwing eggs, oranges, or other objects were imported into Uruguay. The importance of some of these practices by the first inhabitants of the city of Montevideo led to the carnival celebrations. According to Juan Carlos pattern, it is possible that in 1860, when two sources called \\"Wells of the King\\", the \\"van guerrillas\\" were disseminated and conform the first carnival practices were built.  Carnival in Montevideo  Comparsa at Llamadas parade in 1999 = Sociedades de Negros y Lubolos = In Uruguay, las Sociedades de Negros y Lubolos, also called comparsas are a group of persons who sing and dance candombe music. The word lubolos makes reference to the white people in blackface that dresses as black people in the past in order to take part in the dance parades during colonial times, not as mockery, but as tribute of their lives and recognition of the past. It consists of a group of dancers, a group of drummers named Cuerda de tambores and special characters such as La Mama Vieja, El escobero y El Gramillero Carnaval de Montevideo: La mayor fiesta de la cultura y la participaci√≥n popular =Murga= Murga is a theatrical-musical genre that consists of a chorus of 14 to 17 people with murga drums. They sings songs and do some acting in between with impersonators and a mockery of events that criticizes politicians and society. People in murgas have their faces painted and usually are in bright outfits. Lyrical content is based on a particular theme, chosen by the group, which serves to provide commentary on events in Uruguay or elsewhere over the preceding year. Consequently, murga is used as a form of resistance. For example, during the dictatorship in Uruguay in the 1970s, groups like Araca La Cana became known for their left-wing tendencies, subversive commentary and oppositional stance.Portal de Murgas Uruguayan murga = Parodists = They create humorous situations called parodies, based on a well-known novel or film or even some famous character in history. = Magazines = They are a group of people dancing and singing pop music with different lyrics about human nature and personal problems.  Escolas de Samba  Escolas de Samba in Uruguay have a tradition too, principally in places like Artigas and Montevideo. The genre of these groups are Samba with Brazilian percussion, dancers and a chorus of people singing the Samba Enredo. The main escola de samba in Montevideo was Aquarella founded by Mr. Juan de Dios Peza who lives for many years in Rio de Janeiro.

He was a prominent leader of the Baodiao movement in Hong Kong. The movement advocates Chinese sovereignty over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute between China and Japan. Biography Being a high school graduate from King's College, Hong Kong, David Chan Yuk-cheung obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of Hong Kong and a master's degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He began participating in the Baodiao movement in 1970. He joined the protest staged by university students at the Victoria Park in 1971 when he was a secondary school student. When he studied in the University of Hong Kong, he served as chairman for the Movement for Defending Diaoyu Islands, an active subgroup of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. After graduation, he worked for the Hong Kong government's radio and TV station RTHK and the Cantonese broadcasting section of the BBC. He was amongst the first generation of hosts for Phone-in programs, and acquired notable fame as a TV presenter in Hong Kong. He was selected as one of Hong Kong's Ten Outstanding Young Persons by Junior Chamber International Hong Kong (JCIHK) in 1985. Political life Chan was an independent candidate in the 1991 Hong Kong Legislative Council election for the Hong Kong Island West Constituency. He gained 29,413 votes. Election results In 1995, he ran again in the Legislative Council election and gained 10,514 votes in the Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services constituency. He lost both elections. Death On 26 September 1996, activists on board the ship Baodiao arrived in the waters around the Diaoyu Islands. Chan Yuk-cheung, along with 5 fellow activists, jumped into the sea and swam to the island wearing life jackets. While swimming, Chan's feet were caught by wires and his head was injured. He passed out in the water and remained upside down for several minutes, possibly suffering from asphyxiation. The Japanese Maritime Safety Agency assisted in the rescue effort, but were unable to revive him, and he died. When his coffin arrived at the Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport, it was covered with the Chinese national flag. Aftermath His death was mourned by tens of thousands of people in Victoria Park, Hong Kong. On 6 October 1996, the memorial service for \\"Chan Yuk-cheung, hero for defending the Diaoyu Islands\\" was held in Hong Kong; more than 2,000 people including officials from mainland China and Hong Kong had attended the service. Chan's death greatly influenced the unification of the different factions within the Baodiao movement. On 22 October 2006, activists of the Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan attempted to approach the islands on board the fishing boat Baodiao II, in memory of Chan Yuk-cheung on the 10th anniversary of his death. They were turned away from the islands by Japanese Coast Guard boats, but paid a public tribute to Chen Yuk-cheung at a position ten nautical miles from the islands. Books Chan wrote a number of books on Hong Kong society and politics during his lifetime. Family Chan's elder daughter, Chan On Yin, is a theater actress who graduated from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.

Pappano explains how Wagner did not approve of the word opera to describe his compositions. Instead he favoured the term musical drama, which he considered to be an all- inclusive term for his role of controlling every aspect of the production. Pappano relates how Wagner would stand on the stage, directing the singers, including singing all the roles, male and female to them; as means to direct them in interpreting roles. Wagner would also show stage choreography to the cast by performing stage fighting and demonstrating how to climb mountains. When scenes required some skill in mountaineering to scale scenography of a mountain. Also noteworthy within the programme is Pappano filming the interior of Ludwig II's palace revealing the neo-gothic and richly coloured interior design alongside panoramic paintings of scenes from Wagner's Ring Cycle.

It is endemic to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Distribution and habitat The species occur mainly in mountainous areas of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces from the Cederberg to Uitenhage, with the highest numbers found in the districts of Caledon, Worcester and Swellendam. They are often associated with fynbos habitats. Etymology The genus was named by English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury from its unusual leaves, from the Greek para (\\"illegal\\" or \\"contrary\\"), and nomos (\\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"). It was subsequently renamed Nivenia by rival botanist Robert Brown to honour plant collector James Niven, but Salisbury‚Äôs name has priority. They are commonly known as ‚Äúsceptres‚Äù or ‚Äúsceptre plants‚Äù for the shape of their inflorescences and after the first of the genus to be described, P. sceptrum- gustavianus ‚Äì ‚ÄúKing Gustav's sceptre‚Äù, in 1777. Description All species are shrubs, though some can grow quite large; for example P. tomentosus may become, at up to 3 m high, a small tree. Like the closely related serrurias they have divided leaves, though a distinctive feature of the genus is that individual plants of some species can bear both normal leaves and ones that are only minimally or even undivided. Other strange features of the leaves are that they do not have distinct upper and lower surfaces and their venation is primitive. The flowerheads are spike-like inflorescences in which the flowers are grouped into fours, with each group of four carried beneath a leathery bract. The shell-like bracts remain on the plant for a year or longer, well after the seeds have dropped off. The plants are not serotinous. They do not resprout after fires but regenerate from seeds which are shed soon after flowering.

History In the early 1960s,Taipower Company (TPC) was decided to set up a power plant in Tongxiao. Initially, Tongxiao Power Plant was fueled with diesel. In 1978, TPC rebuilt the power units with three combined cycle units (the fuel remained diesel, these units also called old #1~#3), they were the first combined cycle units in Taiwan. In 1990, TPC established #4 and #5 units, and #6 (fueled natural gas) was built in 1997. Later, TPC decided to renew old #1~#3 units (3 old units generate 763 MW electricity). The New Combined Cycle units started commercial operation on 27 February 2018 (New #1 Unit), 30 May 2019 (New #2 Unit), and 26 May 2020 (New #3 Unit). The new power units are established on the area of removed oil tanks. On 30 May 2018, power outage occurred at the power plant at 3:12 p.m. due to the tripping of high voltage transmission line. A total of 70,391 households were left without power. The power was then restored at 4:38 p.m. Technical description The new power units have the electricity capacity 892.6 MW each (3 new units are 2677.8 MW), and its heat efficiency is 60.7%.

He was sidelined in June 1943 when he was appointed to the Yugoslav legation in Portugal. He remained in exile after the war, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with hard labour in absentia during the Belgrade Process conducted by the country's newly established communist authorities, and emigrated to Canada where he lived until his death in 1983.

Kne≈æeviƒá was a member of the National Committee of the almost exclusively Serbian Democratic Party, as well as a friend of Mirkoviƒá. He was resolutely anti-Axis and remained as Minister of the Royal Court in the Simoviƒá government. The coup resulted in the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia commencing on 6 April 1941, during which the armed forces of Yugoslavia were defeated within eleven days. Fleeing the country by air, Kne≈æeviƒá remained with King Peter as Minister of the Royal Court, and was part of the Yugoslav government-in-exile in London. Yugoslav government-in- exile On 17 December 1941, King Peter gave a speech to a British audience in which he gave credit for the coup to younger and middle-ranking officers of the Yugoslav Army, and did not mention either Simoviƒá or Mirkoviƒá at all. As Minister of the Royal Court, Kne≈æeviƒá may well have ghost-written this speech for the king. In early 1942, the government-in-exile led by Simoviƒá was split along ethnic lines, with Kne≈æeviƒá and his brother ≈Ωivan forming part of an inner circle of anti-Simoviƒá advisers around King Peter, known as the \\"League of Majors\\". Under the influence of this group, and on advice from the rest of the cabinet, the king dismissed Simoviƒá and appointed Slobodan Jovanoviƒá as Prime Minister. The group of younger officers wanted to ensure that they would have a \\"direct share in power\\" with the Chetnik leader Brigadier General Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá in a Chetnik-dominated government after the war had ended. Achieving this objective required the removal of the senior coup plotters Simoviƒá, Minister of the Army and Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command General Bogoljub Iliƒá, and Mirkoviƒá, who was the Chief of the VVKJ in exile. These three officers had the support of almost all the officers of the VVKJ and most of the exiled colonels. Mirkoviƒá and the Chief of Military Intelligence Colonel ≈Ωarko Popoviƒá also had good connections with British military intelligence and the Special Operations Executive from their close liaison before and during the coup. Both Iliƒá and Mirkoviƒá were based in Cairo with the remnants of the Yugoslav forces that had fled the country in the face of the invasion. As soon as the new cabinet met for the first time, both Simoviƒá and Iliƒá were dismissed from their ministerial posts, and Iliƒá and Mirkoviƒá were also dismissed from their respective positions as Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command and Air Force respectively. Jovanoviƒá created a new portfolio for Mihailoviƒá as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Iliƒá and Mirkoviƒá disputed their dismissal, which was seen by the government as open mutiny, and has become known in Yugoslav historiography as the \\"Scandal of Cairo\\". The government placed Iliƒá and Mirkoviƒá on the retired list, and appointed another of the coup plotters and member of the \\"League of Majors\\" Lieutenant Colonel Miodrag Loziƒá as acting Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command, despite the fact that there were four generals and eight colonels in exile who outranked him. On 5 March 1942, his first day in the role, Loziƒá asked the British to remove Mirkoviƒá and his supporters from Cairo and hand over several others, including Popoviƒá, to Yugoslav authorities for court martial on charges of mutiny. In response the British ordered Loziƒá to vacate his post and appointed Lieutenant General Robert Stone, the Commander of British Troops in Egypt, as acting Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav Supreme Command. The government-in-exile sent Colonel Miodrag Rakiƒá to Cairo to resolve the situation, and on 7 May the British transferred the role of acting Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav Supreme Command to Rakiƒá. In June the government-in-exile transferred the post of Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav Supreme Command to Yugoslavia and appointed Mihailoviƒá to the position. Mirkoviƒá and his supporters were given the opportunity to transfer into British service in theatres away from the Balkans. The \\"Scandal of Cairo\\" constituted at least a partial victory for the Jovanoviƒá government and \\"League of Majors\\" but the whole affair damaged the relationship of the government-in-exile with the Western Allies and negatively affected potential aid to Mihailoviƒá. Historian Jozo Tomasevich considered it a serious setback for the Great Serbian forces in exile and that it \\"contributed substantially to the downfall\\" of Mihailoviƒá. The British ambassador to the Yugoslav government-in-exile from July 1941 until August 1943, George William Rendel, was very conscious of the power wielded by Kne≈æeviƒá, noting that he was \\"by no means working in harmony with the government\\". A wartime British intelligence handbook described the Kne≈æeviƒá brothers as \\"the most powerful forces in the exiled Yugoslav Government and the most instrumental in carrying through its chauvinistic Great Serb and anti-Partisan policy\\". In June 1943 Jovanoviƒá was replaced as Prime Minister by who replaced Kne≈æeviƒá, appointing him as charg√© d'affaires at the Yugoslav legation in Lisbon, Portugal. This removed Kne≈æeviƒá from political power and from a position of influence over King Peter. Post- war After the war, Kne≈æeviƒá remained in exile and was tried in absentia alongside others. He was found guilty of treason and war crimes and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with hard labour, loss of political and civic rights for 5 years, confiscation of all property, and loss of citizenship. The sentence of imprisonment with hard labour was to commence from the date of his future arrest. He emigrated to Canada where he was the editor of Glas kanadskih Srba (Voice of the Canadian Serbs). In the early 1950s, an acrimonious dispute arose between Cvetkoviƒá and Kne≈æeviƒá. Kne≈æeviƒá wrote an article in the international relations journal International Affairs claiming that Prince Paul and Cvetkoviƒá had formulated a secret plan to ally Yugoslavia with Germany and to gain control of the port of Salonika while Greece was defending against the Italian invasion. While Cvetkoviƒá issued two strong denials in the historical journal Dokumenti o Jugoslaviji, and stated that seizing Salonika had never been on the agenda of the Yugoslav government, his latter statement was not true. The main purpose of Kne≈æeviƒá's allegation was to discredit Prince Paul and portray the coup plotters in a favourable light. Kne≈æeviƒá died in Toronto on 22 June 1983.

Plot In June 1950, while stationed at Kimpo, South Korea, Captain George Slocum (John Hodiak) finds out from his friend, Lieutenant Jerry Barker (Todd Karns), that he has to go to Japan. At the airport, he meets Barker's younger brother, Pete (John Derek), who takes up a Stinson L-5 Sentinel liaison aircraft and begins showing off. George reprimands him for careless flying, but sticks up for him when the military police want to arrest Pete. Pete later meets Kate (Audrey Totter), an Army nurse, while George's wife Nancy (Maureen O'Sullivan), is surprised by his sudden appearance. Both pilots receive news of North Korea's attack on South Korea and are ordered to Pusan, but are diverted to Seoul. En route, they land at bombed-out Kimpo to find a critically wounded Jerry, who dies when the two aircraft are attacked on the way to safety. Pete is devastated and vows to get back at the enemy. On another mission, in unarmed L-5s again, Pete and George are flying the U.S. ambassador and the Korean president to safety, but are ambushed by enemy aircraft. George manages to skillfully fly low and force his pursuer into a hillside. Pete wants to take a more active role, rigging up a bazooka under his wings, but when he attacks a group of tanks, despite having some success, he is shot down. George reports the loss and attempts to convinces Major Hacker (Rex Reason) to mount a rescue mission, but is turned down, as the base is now cut off and under constant attack. However, Pete makes it back to the base, with the help of a group of South Korean Army soldiers. Both pilots continue to fly desperately needed supplies, but George is badly wounded in an attack on the base. Pete flies him out to a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital unit where he meets Kate again; she has to tell Pete that George succumbed to his wounds. Pete comes back to the front, more determined than ever to take the fight to the enemy. When Private Swenson (Richard Erdman) and Sergeant Maxie Steiner (Harvey Lembeck) install a powerful radio in his L5, it allows Pete to signal fighter jets overhead that North Korean tanks are about to attack. The fighters destroy the enemy tanks, but the L-5 is shot up. A wounded Pete and Maxie make it back to the base, but crash on landing, barely making it out alive.

As one of the many features that Sears helmed in a very short period, the film was a \\"B\\" feature, although it did star John Hodiak, Maureen O'Sullivan and future star John Derek. With principal photography done over a two-week span, from February 4‚Äì18, 1953 in California, the script was adapted to incorporate a portion of the 85,000 feet of location footage photographed by producer Robert Cohn and a camera crew near the Korean front lines.Smith, Richard Harland. \\"Articles: 'Mission Over Korea' (1953).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Gil originated from a tropical depression that developed near Clipperton Island on July 23. Steadily intensifying, it attained tropical storm status six hours later and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 26. After attaining peak intensity on July 27, Gil encountered cooler sea surface temperatures and began to weaken. Moving west-northwest, the weakening system also accelerated and on July 31, was downgraded to a tropical depression. However, Gil began to re-intensify on August 1, becoming a tropical storm again later that day. Initially expected to veer north of Hawaii, it continued west-northwest and began to approach the Hawaiian group on August 3. While passing through the island group, Gil reached its secondary peak intensity. Subsequently, Gil began to weaken once again as it threatened the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. After passing through the islands, Gil was downgraded to a tropical depression on August 5. Several hours later, the storm dissipated. The remnants of the storm moved into the West Pacific late on August 6 and were last noted the next morning while passing south of Midway Island. Due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, which devastated the island group the previous year, officials issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches while seven shelters were opened, though few people actually used these shelters. On Oahu, a power outage was reported, affecting 2,400 customers. Jellyfish also stung 50 people. Locally heavy rainfall and rough seas led to minor damage while strong winds lead to extensive damage on the north side of the island. On Maui and Kauai, minor flooding, as well, though damage was minimal. Offshore, one person is presumed to have died in a shipwreck. In a separate shipping incident, three crewmen were slightly injured. The remnants of Gil later affected the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where near-gale force winds were measured. Throughout the state, damage was minimal. Meteorological history The seventh tropical cyclone of the season originated from a tropical depression that developed during the afternoon hours of July 23 about north of Clipperton Island. Due to light wind shear and warm ocean temperatures, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gil at 0000 UTC on July 24. Gil was briefly expected to re-curve and approach Baja California Sur, but this never materialized. Gil subsequently began to intensify; on 0000 UTC July 25, the EPHC reported that Gil had intensified into a strong tropical storm, with winds of . Roughly 24 hours later, the storm was upgraded into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Early on July 27, the storm attained its peak intensity of . Despite turning west-northwest, Hurricane Gil maintained hurricane intensity until 1200 UTC July 29 when the storm began to encounter cooler waters. By 0000 UTC July 31, Gil was downgraded a tropical depression. Despite a well-defined atmospheric circulation, Gil was still a tropical depression when it entered Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) warning zone on August 1. The circulation gradually became better defined moved as the low moved west-northwest over a pool of slightly warmer waters west of 140th meridian west; later that day, the CPHC reportedly re-upgraded Gil into a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the storm was forecast to pass north of the U.S. State of Hawaii. Gil accelerated while approaching the Hawaiian Island group. On August 2, Gil was situated roughly east of the island chain. Gil re-strengthened slightly; on August 3, the tropical cyclone reached its secondary peak wind speed of . Late on August 4, Tropical Storm Gil made its closest approach to Oahu, passing north of Kahuku Point. While passing through the archipelago, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft recorded winds of ; however, the CPHC held the intensity of storm at due to calm surface winds. By this time, the strongest winds of the storm were situated north of the center. After clearing the main Hawaiian island chain, Gil began to approach the Hawaiian Leeward Island group. Continuing west- northwest, Gil passed very close to French Frigate Shoals on August 4 as a marginal tropical storm. Early on August 5, the system was downgraded into a tropical depression while centered west of Tern Island. Later that day, Tropical Depression Gil degenerated into a trough about west-northwest of Tern Island. The remnants of the storm crossed the International Dateline late on August 6. It then passed south of Midway Island while still producing deep convection. The remains of Gil were last noted in the West Pacific basin early on August 7. Preparations and impact Hurricane Gil strengthening Due to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, advisories and warnings for the main Hawaiian Islands were issued by meteorologists and Civil Defense Authorities, who had been criticized for the lack of warning prior to Iwa's near-landfall. Gale warnings were issued for a much of the islands (except for the Big Island), but on August 2, these warnings were discontinued for all islands except for Kauai. High surf advisories were also issued. Furthermore, seven shelters were opened as a precaution. Due to the threat of high waves, residents were warned to be ready to evacuate from low-lying areas. Tropical Storm Gil was the first tropical cyclone to threaten Hawaii since Hurricane Iwa during did the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, which devastated the region. Due to heavy rains, a couple of people sought shelter in Nanakuli High School on the island. Jellyfish stung 50 tourists along two beaches in Oahu, they were treated by life guards and none required hospitalization; the jellyfish were thought to have been residing there due to the storm. In addition, one beach on Oahu was closed because of high surf, and swimmers were asked to stay out of the water near Waikiki. Locally gusty winds were recorded on Oahu. On the northern part of the island, winds were reported, resulting in extensive damage in some areas, but slight damage to others. A minor power outage on the island briefly left 2,400 customers without electricity. In Maui, the outer rainbands of Hurricane Gil brought heavy precipitation, leading to minor flooding. Although winds were calm, locally heavy showers occurred over Kauai. Rough surf pounded the northeastern facing beaches of that island, as well as the northeastern side of Oahu. A sea level pressure of was also recorded. Overall, damage from Gil was minimal and less than expected. Later in the season, the state was affected by Tropical Storm Narda and threatened by Hurricane Raymond. Offshore, several ships were affected by the storm. Most notably, a catamaran, ironically named Hurricane, went missing after leaving Long Beach on July 20. Gil likely sunk this ship. The vessel had a crew of two, one of which was presumed to have died during the storm. However, as the ship lacked radio equipment, this death remains unconfirmed. In addition to the above, the 30-foot ship Adad also got caught into the storm 72 hours after leaving Kauai. Storm surge from all sides nearly sunk the vessel and all three people on board sustained minor injuries, one of which sprained his wrist. After passing the main islands of Hawaii, Gil approached the Leeward Island group. Tropical Storm Gil passed just south of French Frigate Shoals on August 4 as a minimal tropical storm. Winds were light, gusting to . Meanwhile, a peak pressure of was reported.

The attacks killed at least 449 people and left 732 others injured in one of the deadliest outbreaks of violence in years. Background From a peak of 3,000 deaths per month in 2006‚Äì07, violence in Iraq decreased steadily for several years before beginning to rise again in 2012. In December 2012, Sunnis began to protest perceived mistreatment by the Shia-led government. The protests had been largely peaceful, but insurgents, emboldened by the war in neighboring Syria, stepped up attacks in the initial months of 2013. The number of attacks rose sharply after the Iraqi army raided a protest camp in Hawija on 23 April 2013. Overall, 712 people were killed in April according to UN figures, making it the nation's deadliest month in five years. Post-Hawija targets have included both Sunni and Shia mosques, as well as security forces and tribal leaders. According to Mahmoud al-Sumaidaie, the deputy head of Iraq's Sunni Endowment, at least 29 Sunni mosques were attacked between mid-April and mid-May, resulting in the deaths of at least 65 worshippers. In contrast, only two Shiite places of worship were attacked during the same period, with a single person being killed. During the whole of 2012, a total of 10 Sunni mosques were attacked, signifying a recent increase in the sectarian nature of the insurgency.Attacks against mosques and husseiniyahs stoke Iraq fears of sectarian strife. Middle East Online. Attacks On 15 May, a total of nine car bombs struck the capital Baghdad, killing 23 people and injuring 108 others. All of the attacks targeted Shia civilians, with bombs exploding at a bus stop in Sadr City, as well as locations in Kadhimiya and New Baghdad. A pair of bombs detonated near government offices in the northern city of Kirkuk, killing 10 people and injuring 13 others, while 2 policemen were injured in a roadside bombing outside the city. A roadside blast in Mosul killed 2 policemen and injured another. A suicide bomber struck a checkpoint in Tarmiyah, killing 2 policemen and injuring 8 others. Mortar shelling killed a soldier in Akashat, near the border with Syria, while a bombing in Hammam al-Alil killed 2 soldiers and wounded 3 others. Blasts in Baqubah and Muqdadiyah killed a civilian and injured 5 others. Unidentified gunmen killed 2 Sahwa militiamen in Mehraijiya. Attacks continued at a similar pace on 16 May, with 40 people killed and 107 injured across the country. In Kirkuk, a suicide bomber attacked a mosque where the memorial service for the victims of the previous day's bombings was taking place, killing 12 people and injuring 36 others. A separate bombing in the city killed 2 children. In the capital Baghdad, a car bombing killed 9 people and injured 28 others in Sadr City, while gunmen shot dead the brother of an Iraqiya party member and injured 2 of his bodyguards.

In addition, gunmen shot dead an employee of the civil defense agency in Fallujah. Violence rose sharply on 17 May, as most of the incidents appeared to target Sunnis in apparent retaliation for previous attacks against Shiites. Twin bombings struck Baqubah, with the first bomb exploding as worshippers were leaving the town's main Sunni mosque after attending morning prayers. As people gathered to help the wounded, a second explosion occurred, inflicting even more damage than the first. At least 43 people were killed and 80 others were injured in the attacks, which were the second deadliest to ever hit the city after a July 2004 bombing at a police recruit center that killed 68 people. \\"I was about 30 meters from the first explosion. When the first exploded, I ran to help them, and the second one went off. I saw bodies flying and I had shrapnel in my neck,\\" reported an eyewitness. The attack continued a trend of targeting Sunni mosques; about thirty were attacked between mid-April and mid-May. Baqubah was an important center for the insurgency during the height of the Iraq War and was declared to be the center of operations for the Islamic State of Iraq in 2006, before US troops moved in and forced the group to relocate. The city was the site of major attacks in 2004, 2008 and 2010. Later in the day, a roadside bomb killed 8 people and injured 25 others in Madain, a town 12 miles south of Baghdad, near Salman Pak.

The spate of attacks heightened fears that violence would continue to rise due to retaliation back and forth between Shias and Sunnis. No group claimed initial responsibility, though such widespread and coordinated attacks have mostly been claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq in the past. Reactions Domestic Talal al-Zobaie, a Sunni member of the Iraqi Parliament, called on his colleagues to unite and face the enemies of Iraq together. \\"The government should admit that it has failed to secure the country and the people, and all security commanders should be replaced by efficient people who can really confront terrorism. Sectarianism that has bred armies of widows and orphans in the past is now trying to make a comeback in this country, and everybody should be aware of this\\", he said in a statement released to the press. Jawad al-Hasnawi, a lawmaker with the Sadrist Movement, loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he believed the pattern of attacks was not coincidental, and terrorist groups were trying to reignite sectarian tensions in Iraq. \\"But the government bears full responsibility for this security chaos and it has to take quick and serious measures in order to stop the bloodshed, instead of just blaming other political blocs. Today and yesterday, the Iraqi people paid for the failure of government security forces. Everybody should expect darker days full of even deadlier attacks\\", Al-Hasnawi added.Bombs targeting Sunnis kill at least 76 in Iraq (The Journal). Nujournal.com (9 September 2012).

It is now part of the city of Kranj. Name The settlement of ≈†marjetna Gora and the hill were both named after the church at the top of the hill, which is dedicated to Saint Margaret (). The name ≈†marjetna Gora literally means 'Saint Margaret's mountain'. The adjective form ≈†marjetna developed through contraction of the informal name of the saint: * > * > * > '.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 415. In the past the German name was Sankt Margarethen. History The hamlet of Gradi≈°ƒçe on the southwest slope of the hill has the remnants of prehistoric structures, attesting to early settlement of ≈†marjetna Gora. During the Middle Ages, ≈†marjetna Gora was a property of the Bishopric of Freising, which planted vineyards here. The vineyards were maintained until the 16th century, when they were converted into fields. In the 12th century, the Counts of Ortenburg built Wartenburg Castle on a cliff below the hill. This represented a threat to the Dominion of ≈†kofja Loka, and so Bishop Oton purchased it in 1282 and had it razed. The Ortenburgs later restored the castle and carried out raids against Okroglo and Stra≈æi≈°ƒçe, which belonged to the Bishopric of Freising. Wartenburg Castle is now a ruin. Near the castle there was an auxiliary building resembling a manor; it had a turret and bore the year 1653, but was destroyed in the 1895 earthquake. Saint Peter‚Äôs Manor ()‚Äîalso known as Schrottenturn Manor (, ) and Detela Manor ()‚Äîwas built at the foot of the hill in 1537 by the bishops of Freising, and the door casing bears the year 1574. The adjacent Saint Peter‚Äôs Chapel was built around 1500. During the Reformation, Lutherans gathered at the manor, and it contains the graves of the Protestant Siegersdorf family. After the Counter-Reformation, the chapel was remodeled and re-consecrated in 1645. It has a flat coffered ceiling and murals in the apse, a 1615 painting of the Holy Sepulchre by Matija Plainer, and a panel on the north wall describing the famine of 1817. ≈†marjetna Gora was annexed by the city of Kranj in 1957, ending its existence as a separate settlement.Raz≈°irjeni seznam sprememb naselij od 1948 do 1964: preimenovanja, zdru≈æevanja, odcepitve, pristavki, razglasitve in ukinitve. 1965.

Entrance to Old Fort Park. The park grounds include the Civil War era Fortress Rosecrans and two trailheads to the City's Greenway system. The park is bound on two sides by the West Fork of the Stones River and is bound on the east by Lytle Creek, with a small spring fed tributary to the Creek, Springs Branch, bisecting the public park. Old Fort Park The original park site was once private farm land which was then bought by the City of Murfreesboro in 1965. The park was dedicated on October 29, 1977. The park comprises and has three picnic shelters, two play grounds, two baseball fields, eight tennis courts and green areas. In 2010, the City began a $330,000 restoration project aimed at improving the quality of the waterways and preserving the natural spaces. In October 2013, the City broke ground on a new $3.7 million indoor tennis facility. The joint-venture with Middle Tennessee State University will feature eight new tennis courts and will be open to the public as well as serve as the home of the Blue Raider men's and women's tennis programs. Kids' Castle The main playground of the park is \\"Kids' Castle\\" which was built in 1995 over the site of the original playground. Initially built of wood, the Castle was rebuilt in 2012 using synthetic materials at a cost of $300,000. The Castle was funded in part through the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Fortress Rosecrans Fortress Rosecrans is a large earthwork fortification built in 1863 under the direction of Union General James Morton. The Fortress was given its name in honor of William Rosecrans, Commander of the Army of the Cumberland. The largest fort built during the American Civil War, it encompassed an area of and had a perimeter of . Built following the Battle of Stones River, the Fortress originally included eight lunettes, four redoubts, a sawmill, magazines, and soldier's barracks. Sitting astride the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and two major roads, the fort became a center for logistical support for the Union Army. By June 12, 1863 the fort was garrisoned with 2,394 men and by October, the 22nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment had been stationed there. Construction The fort was built using the labor of 4,000 men, including a large number of African- Americans. The walls averaged in height and in thickness at the base. They were made of compacted earth with wooden planks reinforcing the structure. A 10-foot (3 meter) ditch was dug in front of the walls and filled with sharpened sticks to deter an enemy charge. Today The fortress was never directly attacked during the War and by 1932 much of it had been lost, destroyed by development. Of its original of earthworks only remain. The remaining earthworks comprise the \\"Fortress Rosecrans\\" section of the Park. Of the four interior redoubts within Fortress Rosecrans, only Redoubt Brannan survives to this day. Redoubt Brannan lies outside of the Park boundaries. The fortress lies between the tennis courts and the public golf course. A series of interpretive trails and boardwalks run through the remaining fortified sections and include construction facts, quotes, diagrams, and other information. The City's Greenway \\"Fortress Rosecrans\\" trailhead is also located here. Golf course The Old Fort Golf Club was established by the City in 1985 and was designed by Leon Howard and Denis Griffiths. The 18-hole golf course runs 6,859 yards with a Par score of 72. The course rating is 72.8 and it has a slope rating of 125. The facility also has two 8,000 sq ft putting and chipping greens and a clubhouse. Junior, beginner and intermediate classes can be taken at the facility. Private lessons are also available with the on-staff PGA instructor. There are three golf associations at the Club, the Men's Golf Association, Ladies' Golf Associate and the Senior League.

A second adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel, the film stars Alex Pettyfer, Gabriella Wilde, Bruce Greenwood, Joely Richardson, and Robert Patrick. The film was released on February 14, 2014 by Universal Pictures in the US and UK, and on February 13, 2014 in Australia. Plot Reserved, lovely 17-year-old Jade (Gabriella Wilde) graduates from high school with an impressive college scholarship but few friends, having focused on her studies rather than a social life. David (Alex Pettyfer), another graduating senior, has had a crush on her for years but never acted on it. Hoping to make some summer memories, Jade asks her parents, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood) and Anne (Joely Richardson), for a graduation party. She invites the entire class, including David. The two hit it off and are caught fooling around in a closet during the party. Hugh worries that David's impulsive and carefree nature will adversely affect his daughter, who is preparing to leave for a medical-school internship. David, who works at his widower-father Harry's garage, tries to please Hugh by fixing a car which belonged to Jade's brother Chris who died of cancer years ago. Ironically, Hugh is the only one not pleased by David's gesture. Late that night, Jade invites David into her family's study where - at her own urging - they make love. The two strive to make the most of the ten days she has left at home. Ultimately, Jade opts to decline the internship and spend the rest of the summer with David...which infuriates Hugh. Later, Jade invites David to accompany the family to their lake house; he is welcomed with open arms by everybody except Hugh, whom Anne urges to give David a chance. Anne points out that Jade seems truly happy for the first time since Chris passed away. One night, David sees Hugh cheating on Anne with another woman; the next morning Hugh intimidates David into keeping quiet about the affair. David and Jade, along with Jade's brother Keith and his girlfriend Sabine, sneak into a local zoo after-hours for a night of fun. Jenny, David's jealous ex-girlfriend, calls the police; when they arrive, David allows himself to be caught so the others can escape. Hugh agrees to bail David out, on the condition that he breaks up with Jade and she takes the internship as planned. Against Hugh's orders, Jade goes to meet David at a restaurant where he's eating with his friend Mace...who, unbeknownst to either David or Jade, has invited Jenny (he figured David could use a sympathetic ear, after being forced to stop seeing Jade). Jade suddenly turns up, and jumps to the obvious-but-wrong conclusion; frustrated, she drives off and gets into an accident. At the hospital, Hugh gives Harry a restraining order to keep David away from Jade...who has suffered only minor injuries. Upon leaving the hospital, she tries to contact David - having realized by now that he was never unfaithful to her and never would be. But Harry won't allow this because it would land his son in prison. Over the next few months, David and Jade each attempt to move on with their lives by seeing other people; still, both are unhappy. David runs into Anne at a bookstore. She tells him that - despite the tension between her and Hugh - she admires his and Jade's love for each other. Anne arranges for David to meet Jade at the airport when she comes home for the holidays. The couple reaffirm their love, and Jade plans to move in with David that night, while Anne confronts Hugh about his obsession with destroying Jade's life. Anne also learns that Hugh prevented her recommendation letter for David from being sent out to college. Back at home, Hugh reams Keith and Sabine for listening to records from Chris's collection. Keith seconds his mother's sentiments regarding what losing Chris has done to Hugh. When Keith subsequently announces that he's moving in with Sabine, Anne opts for going with him. Hugh then finds Jade preparing to leave with David, who is waiting outside. Hugh charges outside in a rage, knocking over a burning candle on the way, and furiously attacks David with a baseball bat. Jade rushes to his defense...proclaiming that it was Hugh himself, not David, who tore their family apart. The defeated Hugh goes back inside, and discovers the fire which has started in Chris's room; Jade and David see the house in flames, so David rushes back in to save Jade's father, who is struggling to gather up Chris' possessions. When David falls unconscious, Hugh decides to leave the things and help David to safety instead. Outside, David and Hugh put aside their differences while they wait for medical attention. Anne and Hugh amicably separate but remain determined to rediscover the love, inspired by Jade and David...who are flying out to California, having been selected as maid of honor and (respectively) best man at Sabine and Keith's wedding. Both couples celebrate on the beach, where they camp for the night. Sharing David's bedroll, Jade fondly recalls how her first love - the relationship she shares with him - was everything all at once, the kind of undying love worth fighting to keep. Cast * Gabriella Wilde as Jade Butterfield * Alex Pettyfer as David Elliot * Bruce Greenwood as Hugh Butterfield * Joely Richardson as Anne Butterfield * Robert Patrick as Harry Elliot * Rhys Wakefield as Keith Butterfield * Dayo Okeniyi as Mace * Emma Rigby as Jenny * Anna Enger as Sabine * Patrick Johnson as Chris Butterfield * Alexandra Bartee as Kelly * Sharon Conley as Dr. Edie Watanabe * Stephanie Northrup as Dawn Besser * Matt Withers as Miles Production Emma Roberts was originally offered the role of Jade, but turned it down. Sophie Lowe, Gabriella Wilde, Sarah Bolger, and Olivia Cooke were on the final shortlist for the role; Wilde was ultimately cast. Principal photography began in May 2013 in Georgia. Filming wrapped in July 2013. Scenes were shot in Savannah, Georgia, Fayette County, Georgia, Butts County, Georgia at Lake Jackson, and at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. Release The first trailer was released on December 23, 2013. Reception Endless Love has received negative reviews from film critics. Criticism was mainly made towards the many liberties taken with the original source material. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 16% based on 93 reviews, with the consensus: \\"Blander than the original Endless Love and even less faithful to the source material, this remake is clich√©d and unintentionally silly.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 30 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" from critics. The film was not a box office success, earning a domestic gross of $23,438,250, barely over its estimated production budget of $20 million. In 2013, after reading the screenplay for the film, Scott Spencer - the author of the novel on which the film was based - wrote that \\"It‚Äôs about one hundred pages, and the only ones that were not dreary were sciatica inducing\\". In 2014 he wrote that his novel \\"has been even more egregiously and ridiculously misunderstood\\" in making the remake than in the 1981 film. Film historian Leonard Maltin was actually kinder to the remake, giving it two out of a possible four stars (he declared its 1981 predecessor a \\"BOMB\\"). Yet he also described the newer film as \\"Mediocre...This is sure to connect with its target audience - and it's Oscarworthy compared to the 1981 version - yet it remains overwrought and pointless for fans of the novel. Moreover, Lionel Richie's title tune - the only memorable aspect of the original - is sorely missed here.\\" Soundtrack End title track \\"Don't Find Another Love\\" was sung by Tegan and Sara and written by Golden Globe award-winning composer Julie Frost. Singer/songwriter Skylar Grey's cover of Robert Palmer's \\"Addicted to Love\\" was used for the trailer of the film. In addition, the song \\"Explosions\\" by Ellie Goulding was used in trailers adapted as television commercials. Another song which was taken is the track \\"Pumpin Blood\\" by the Swedish dance-pop group NoNoNo.Soundtrack on iTunes Director Shana Feste had considered using the original film's iconic theme song in one scene but eventually decided against it.IAR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: DIRECTOR SHANA FESTE TALKS 'ENDLESS LOVE' See also * Endless Love (1981 film) References External links  Category:2014 films Category:2010s coming-of-age films Category:2014 romantic drama films Category:2010s teen drama films Category:2010s teen romance films Category:Adultery in films Category:American coming-of-age films Category:American film remakes Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American teen drama films Category:American teen romance films Category:English-language films Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Shana Feste Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Films scored by Christophe Beck Category:Universal Pictures films Category:2014 drama films Category:Film adaptations disliked by their authors ","title":"Endless Love (2014 film)"},{"id":"39416567","text":"Daminah al-Gharbiyah (, also spelled Dumaynah Gharbiyah) is a village in central Syria, administratively part of the Homs Governorate, located southwest of Homs.

Written by Nissar Modi, it is based on the 1974 posthumously published book of the same name by Robert C. O'Brien, though the plot differs in some significant ways. The film's plot also resembles that of the 1959 film The World, the Flesh and the Devil. The film was released on August 28, 2015, in the United States by Roadside Attractions. It received generally positive reviews from critics who mostly praised Robbie's performance. It grossed $381,839 worldwide at the box office. Plot Nuclear-apocalypse survivor Ann Burden lives out an agrarian life on her family's valley farmstead, sheltered from radioactive contaminants by rocky hillsides, favorable weather patterns, and an abundant ground-fed water supply. One day Ann encounters fellow survivor John Loomis, a highly skilled engineer, who, aided by medicines and a radiation suit, has traveled from a distant military bunker to the safe confines of Burden's valley. Loomis bathes in contaminated water, and immediately sickens, but is nursed back to health by Ann, who welcomes him into her farmhouse. Loomis regains his strength and gradually becomes part of Ann's humble rustic life. He helps Ann to pump diesel from local petroleum pumps and gets the farm's long-disused tractor running, hoping to stockpile food for the winter. Ann tells Loomis about her parents and younger brother who left the valley to find other survivors but never returned. Loomis speculates that hydroelectric power might be generated from the nearby waterfall, using a water-wheel fashioned from the Burden church's planks and beams. Ann is uncomfortable with this proposal, citing her father's past involvement as preacher and her own deeply-held Christian beliefs. Loomis chooses not to pursue the project further. Ann and Loomis grow closer, cultivating crops and preparing for long-term habitation. Their domestic accord is marred by occasional tensions, notably involving matters of religion and Loomis' drinking. The two come to the verge of initiating a sexual relationship, but Loomis demurs, stating that further intimacy will change things between them, and that more time is needed. Mysterious phenomena (including stolen food supplies and a half-glimpsed shadowy figure) culminate in the arrival of a third survivor, Caleb. Though Ann welcomes Caleb into the farmhouse, friction develops between Caleb and Loomis. Loomis questions Caleb's backstory and motives; Caleb repeatedly emphasizes the religious connection he shares with Ann (in stark contrast to Loomis), and half-jokingly suggests a wager for the farm-girl's affections while the two men go out turkey hunting. The three survivors slowly settle into a marginally-stable partnership. Both men relate post-apocalyptic horrors they witnessed before reaching the valley; Loomis describes a radiation- sickened youth who begged him for death; later, he privately confides to Ann his belief that the dying boy may have been her long-absent brother. Caleb pressures Ann to go forward with the water-wheel project, and work commences on tearing down the church for materials. Perceiving their mutual attraction, Loomis awkwardly gives Ann consent to pursue a romantic relationship with Caleb, but belies his grief and anger in losing Ann through a racially tinged remark. Shortly thereafter, following a celebratory dinner, a heavily- intoxicated Loomis tells Ann he loves her before passing out in his bed. After failing to wake Loomis, seeming to want his affection, Ann joins Caleb in the adjoining bathroom, where the two engage in sexual activity. Further tensions arise between Caleb and Loomis following the sexual encounter. The two men finish the water-wheel, moving it and its wooden flume into place atop the waterfall. Encumbered by the bulky radiation suit, Caleb slips twice during his rope-assisted climb up the slick mossy cliff-side. During the second slip, the two men silently lock eyes, both holding the rope, while Caleb teeters on the cliff's edge. Loomis returns to the farmhouse alone. Ann apologizes for her earlier indiscretion; Loomis tells her that Caleb has left in search of other settlements. Ann takes this news badly, chasing after Caleb but not finding him, and lapses into a sullen silence. The farmhouse's electric lights and refrigeration are restored. Ann finds that her beloved church organ and three roughly fashioned pews have been moved into the barn. The two appear to exchange brief uncertain glances, Ann playing a hymn, Loomis sitting and clasping his hands, as the scene fades to black. Cast * Margot Robbie as Ann Burden * Chiwetel Ejiofor as John Loomis * Chris Pine as Caleb Production The three principal cast members were announced in May 2013, which at the time included Amanda Seyfried Seyfried, however, would eventually drop out and be replaced with Margot Robbie.

It is partially based on Ichneutae, a satyr play by the fifth- century BC Athenian dramatist Sophocles, which was found in fragments at the Egyptian city of Oxyrhynchus. In addition to its classical content, Harrison's play is also a dramatised account of the discovery of the papyrus fragments containing Sophocles' play by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt. The play had a one-performance premi√®re on 12 July 1988 in the ancient stadium of Delphi, Greece with a follow-up performance at the Royal National Theatre two years later on 27 March 1990. In the 1988 premiere at Delphi starred Jack Shepherd as Grenfell, Barrie Rutter as Hunt and Juliet Stevenson in the role of the mountain nymph Kyllene. No filming was allowed during the 1988 performance. Before appearing on the stage in London the play also had a \\"homecoming\\" performance at Salt's Mill, a former textile mill, at Saltaire, Bradford. Additional performances were held at the Wharf Theatre, in Sydney, Australia in 1992 and the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds in 1998. In January 2017 after nearly 30 years since first opening in London it returned to the Finborough Theatre. Historical background Fragment of the Ichneutae papyrus on which Harrison's play is based Harrison's play is partially based on the events surrounding the discovery of the ancient papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus containing fragments of Ichneutae, a satyr play by the fifth- century Athenian dramatist Sophocles, which was found in fragments at Oxyrhynchus, an Egyptian city where an archaeological site was discovered considered one of the most important ever found. The papyrus fragments containing the ancient play were found by Oxford dons Grenfell and Hunt. Harrison then takes some of the events surrounding their discovery and weaves a play involving the two British archaeologists in a modern version of the classic play. Plot The play starts with the two archaeologists shown doing excavations in situ at Oxyrhynchus in 1907. While both are depicted in the play deeply involved with their work, Apollo intervenes and commands Grenfell, in rhyming verses, to find an ancient play where the God plays a prominent part: Grenfell and Hunt on the site of the excavations. Harrison's play features them as central characters. The two dons are shown in the play to feverishly search for the fragments and they finally find them. Grenfell, in particular, is shown as possessed by Apollo. After their excavations, the Oxyrhynchus papyri, including those with the Sophoclean play, are packed in wooden crates and sent to Oxford for further study. Upon arrival at Oxford, the crates open up and a satyr chorus springs from inside, clogging. A metamorphosis then happens. Grenfell becomes the Greek god Apollo while Hunt turns into Silenus, the leader of the satyrs. The characters then start following Sophocles' play and begin looking for Apollo's missing cattle. Apollo strikes a bargain with the satyrs according to which the satyrs will become rich and free if they find his cattle. The satyrs finally find the cattle only to discover that the cows are also keeping amongst them baby Hermes who although an infant has just invented the lyre. Apollo is happy now that his cattle has been found and keeps his end of the bargain by granting the satyrs the riches and freedom he had promised them. However the satyrs also want to keep the newly discovered lyre but Apollo rejects that idea telling them that satyrs do not deserve such a highly artistic instrument and advises them that they should instead concentrate on low-level art. The satyrs are very unhappy and they become even more so since the gold bars that they received from Apollo have turned into gold leaf-covered boomboxes blaring a music they cannot even dance to. Having lost their chance to get involved in \\"High Art\\" the satyrs rebel and 2500 years later they become hooligans coming out of the crates and destroying the very papyrus to which they owe their existence in modern times. In the Delphi performance the satyrs destroy the backdrop papyrus screens of the play and are depicted playing a soccer match with a ball fashioned out of the Ichneutae papyrus. In the National Theatre performance Silenus is shown destroying the physical papyrus screen which functions as the backdrop of the theatrical play and commenting that the papyrus \\"could be put to better use as bedding material for the homeless of London's South Bank\\". Reception and analysis Richard Eyre calls The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, which features satyrs jumping out of box crates clog dancing, \\"among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s\\". Jocelyn Herbert, famous designer of the British theatrical scene, comments that Harrison is aware of the dramatic visual impact of his ideas: \\"The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is wonderful for the stage. Some writers just write and have little idea what it will look like, but Tony always knows exactly what he wants.\\" Edith Hall has written that she is convinced that Harrison's 1998 film-poem Prometheus is Harrison's \\"most brilliant artwork, with the possible exception of his stage play The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus\\". Punch magazine writes that \\"Despite its jawbreaking title, The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus is a very merry and mischievous play, which turns serious and even harrowing, not through any visual violence but in the unnerving poetry of Tony Harrison\\". Having been brought back to life through the rediscovered papyri the characters voice their grief at their neglected condition. Apollo laments through verse: In a critique contained in the book Tragedy in Transition it is mentioned that Harrison's play with its chaotic, lively, dynamic and sometimes fragmented verses, to match the condition of the papyri, contrasts with the stilted coverage of classics during the Edwardian era. In that sense Harrison may be pointing toward a neoclassicism which could indicate to a complacent and ignorant modern society that there are things which cannot be \\"assimilated\\". Harrison uses one of the satyrs in his work to hint that the classical world may be neglected in the modern era: The Routledge Companion to Directors' Shakespeare quotes Harrison as saying that without the satyr plays we are missing the whole picture of the Greek imagination as applied to ancient Greek tragedy and its ability to use the satyr plays as a vehicle to absorb the impact of the tragic events and to not be defeated by them. In that sense, Harrison continues, the satyr plays precipitated a \\"spirit of celebration\\" into the dramatic festival which also caused a \\"release into the worship of Dionysus\\". According to the same book, with his Trackers, Harrison wants to criticise the tendency of the elitists and right-wing politicians to divide art and society along refined and popular lines, represented by separate Apollonian and Dionysiac camps. Harrison made a point against this artificial segregation by choosing a third venue for the performance of his play between Delphi and London; he chose an abandoned textile mill in Salt's Mill, Bradford, as a \\"homecoming\\" for his play. Harrison said that he chose Salt's Mill as a venue because the \\"ghosts of the past were strong\\" in that place and it was part of his \\"slow burning revenge\\" against his teacher who \\"denied him the opportunity to recite poetry or take part in plays because of his accent\\". He also mentioned that clogging \\"geared the satyrs into action\\", because that dance is \\"one of the principal expressions of the rhythm of life\\". In A Companion to Sophocles Harrison's work is cited as an example of bidirectional influence, in that the ancient play influenced Harrison's work and in turn Harrison's play is shown to have influenced the modern perception of Sophocles and his works. According to the book, the papyrus is used as the stage background of Harrison's play both at the Delphi performance and in London at the Olivier Theatre. Its physical presence as a stage backdrop was used as a constant reference to the origin of the characters. It also functions as a visual device and a highly visible reminder of the barrier between the world of high art and that of the hooligans and the homeless. T. P. Wiseman remarks that Harrison has \\"opened up the possibilities\\" of an ancient Greek play which was until recently the exclusive domain of scholars specialising in the classics. According to Wiseman, Harrison's achievement is mirrored by the scene in his play when a chorus of satyrs jumps out of the papyrus crates. Mary Beard writes that Harrison through his play focuses on the reasons for searching and studying the classics. Hunt is depicted as \\"down-to-earth\\", searching for real-life records registering problems such as the desperate pleas of the homeless of that era. But Grenfell is shown as keenly searching for fragments of ancient poetry. According to Beard, Harrison uses this dichotomy to pose a question as to the value and purpose the study of classics has for the modern world; it can be used as a source of information regarding the power politics of the ancient world with its social deprivations, slavery and misogyny or it can be studied for the value of the classical literature that can \\"still engage and inspire\\".  Recent adaptations  The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus was performed for the first time in 30 years at the Finborough Theatre in January 2017. It was directed by Jimmy Walters in a joint venture with his company Proud Haddock and Neil McPherson at the Finborough Theatre. The production received excellent reviews with The Guardian writing \\"there is nothing limp about Jimmy Walters' production\\".

Activities within the port are managed by the Port Authority of New South Wales. Location and features Located to the east of the Wollongong suburb of Port Kembla, the harbour of Port Kembla comprises a body of water with a surface area of at a dredged average depth of drawn from a catchment area of . The port of Port Kembla was established in the late 1890s to facilitate the export of coal from the mines of the Illawarra region. Diversification of the port facilities during the late-1980s and since, has seen the port to include general and break bulk cargoes, containers and motor vehicle imports, and bulk grain exports. Regulation of the port rests with a number of federal, state, and local government agencies including the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Environment Protection Authority, and Wollongong City Council.  History of the Port   Outer Harbour  In 1898, Port Kembla was selected for further development as the main port for the Illawarra region. Between 1901 and 1937, first an eastern breakwater and then a northern breakwater was constructed, resulting in a large protected and safe anchorage now known as the 'Outer Harbour'. The eastern breakwater extended from the rocky headland and the northern breakwater extended from the beach at a point just south of where Tom Thumb Lagoon and Allen's Creek emptied into the sea. An advantage of Port Kembla over other potential sites for a port‚ÄîWollongong, Bellambi, and Lake Illawarra‚Äîwas that there was suitable stone for the breakwaters nearby and that the first part of the eastern breakwater could be placed on an existing natural reef extending seaward from the rocky headland. = Coal Jetties (1883-1963) = From 1883, coal was shipped from an ocean jetty on the beach just to the north of a rocky headland lying to the north of Red Point and Boiler's Point. At least one old map of 1890, which has a number of inaccuracies and omissions, shows this rocky headland as \\"Red Point\\" although Red Point is the headland further south, directly opposite the Five Islands. Red Point and the Five Islands provided some protection from southerly weather. This new port was named Port Kembla, after the Mount Kembla mine from where the coal was transported by rail. A second jetty belonging to the Southern Coal Company was opened in 1887, which loaded coal sent by rail from the Corrimal Colliery. This second jetty used a sophisticated loading arrangement capable of loading 300 tons/hour, which was greater than the capacity of the conventional jetty loading arrangements of the time. The Southern Coal Company wharf was located to the north of the Mt Kembla wharf. After Port Kembla was selected for further development as the main port for the Illawarra region, the two existing coal wharves and 496.5 acres of foreshore land were acquired by the government‚Äîduring 1900 and 1901‚Äîbut the companies were allowed to continue to use their former wharves pending a public tender. View of Pt Kembla from No.1 Coal Jetty in 1919. The closest chimney is the power station supplying the electrically-powered equipment on the jetty.In its earlier years‚Äîmuch like the other ocean jetty coal ports‚ÄîPort Kembla's two coal jetties were exposed to rough seas during bad weather. The new breakwaters of the Outer Harbour not only provided a reliably safe anchorage but also protected the jetties structures from damage. In 1906, the North Bulli Company won the right to use Port Kembla to ship its coal, dooming its Hick's Point Jetty at Austinmer. At the time, the Southern Coal Jetty was the only jetty on the southern coalfields capable of loading large ocean-going vessels. The Southern Coal Co.‚Äîhaving lost the tender ‚Äîwas forced to ship much of its coal via the Mt Kembla Wharf and via Bellambi. A new coal jetty was built to the north of the two existing coal jetties. The coal loading equipment and jetty was designed by the NSW Department of Public Works under the direction of Ernest de Burgh and constructed by contractors Kelly & Lewis in 1914. The new coal jetty opened in 1915 and became 'No.1 Jetty', the Southern Coal Jetty became No.2 Jetty, and the Mt Kembla Jetty became No.3 Jetty.Port Kembla c.1936 - Clockwise around the Outer Harbour (on the right) are the eastern breakwater, No.4 Low-Level Wharf, No.3 (Coal) Jetty, A.I.& S. Wharf, and No.1 (Coal) Jetty. No.2 Jetty (demolished 1925) previously stood at a location between those of the No.1 Jetty and the A.I.&S.; Wharf.The new coal jetty was of an advanced and modern design for its time. Coal was transported from the mines in bottom-dump wagons. The coal was dumped into concrete bunkers, drawn out by a steel cross-flight conveyor and then carried out to the two movable loaders located on the jetty by an electrically powered conveyor belt. The two moveable loaders were also of a modern design, unlike the primitive chutes and staithes used up to that time. The moving loaders removed the need to shift the ship during the loading operation. Each loader had a boom conveyor and a chute. The No.1 Jetty was capable of a peak rate of 750 tons per hour but due to constraints on the speed at which vessels could be loaded and kept in trim, its realistic rate was an average about 520 tons per hour at most. The No.2 Jetty had become unsafe and had fallen out of use by 1916. It was demolished as far back as the high-water line in 1925. The No.3 Jetty was still in use during the 1930s‚Äîits use confined to smaller vessels including ‚Äòsixty-milers' ‚Äîbut by 1939 it was out of use and due to be demolished. That left the No.1 Jetty as the sole coal wharf at Port Kembla. By 1937, the No.1 Jetty was loading coal from all the southern mines that shipped coal by sea, except those mines still using Bellambi or Bulli. After 1952, Port Kembla was the only coal port on the southern coalfields. The No.1 Jetty remained in service until it was replaced in 1963, by a new export coal loader located on the new 'Inner Harbour'. Port Kembla remains a major coal export port but no coal is now loaded in the Outer Harbour.417x417px = No.4 Low- Level Wharf = This wharf was originally built to service the Electrolytic Refining & Smelting Co. and Metal Manufacturers in 1908. It was the first wharf to be constructed at Port Kembla after the port was taken over by the government and was located between the No.3 Coal Jetty and the eastern breakwater. The jetty was extended in 1929. It had a connection to the government rail network and had two electric grab cranes suitable for unloading bulk cargoes. There is still a wharf at this location. = Australian Iron & Steel Wharf = The Australian Iron and Steel wharf was completed in 1928 on land leased by that company from the NSW Department of Public Works. It was located south of the No.1 (Coal) Jetty and south of the former location of No.2 (Coal) Jetty (demolished 1925). The wharf was 838 feet long, including 323 feet of unloading berth. It had two railway lines and a pair of rails for the electrically-operated ore-unloading crane. This crane stood 101 feet above the wharf deck and weighed 400 tons. It could lift 20 tons at once, at a rate of 220 feet per minute, unloading 300 tons per hour. The first shipment of iron ore for use in Australian Iron and Steel's new blast furnace was received from Whyalla, South Australia in 1928. The ore shipment of 5,500 tonnes had been mined by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at Iron Knob in the Middleback Ranges. In 1952 the first Yampi-class bulk carriers delivered iron ore to Port Kembla, carrying maximum loads of 11,000 tonnes. The A.I.& S. wharf no longer exists, with all A.I.& S. cargoes now using the berths of the Inner Harbour.  Inner Harbour  Planned expansion of the steelworks at Port Kembla necessitated that new port facilities be created adjacent to the area that would become the No.2 Steelworks. The New South Wales State Government agreed to build a new 'inner harbour'. The Inner Harbour was created by dredging the former Tom Thumb Lagoon, beginning in January 1956 and with the completion of the first stage of the new harbour in November 1960. The entrance to the new harbour was dredged to a depth of thirty-two feet to allow use by large ore-carriers. The first stage of the harbour was 1200 feet long. = Coal Terminal = Coal ship-loading operations were relocated from the 'outer harbour' to the 'inner harbour'. The first coal loader at the present site was commissioned in 1964 with a capacity of two million tonnes per annum. This had expanded to 7.2 million tonnes by the time the loader was replaced by the No. 2 Loader in 1982. = Grain Terminal = A bulk grain terminal‚Äîannual capacity of 5 million tonnes per year‚Äîwas opened in 1990. It can handle ships up to 129,000 tonnes, and has a storage capacity of 260,000 tonnes and a loading rate of 5000 tonnes. Capacity was expanded in 2016, when a new grain terminal capable of 1.3 million tonnes/year shipped its first export grain. = Car Imports = In 2007, imported car unloading operations were moved from Sydney Harbour to Port Kembla. The first two 55,000 tonne car carriers commenced unloading on 10 May 2007. = Casting Basin = As part of the construction facilities for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel (contract signed in June 1987) a casting basin‚Äî100m wide, 320m long, and overall 12.5m deep‚Äîwas excavated in the western section of the Inner Harbour. The submerged sections of the tunnel‚Äîeach weighing 30,000 tons‚Äîwere built there, temporarily sealed, floated and towed to Sydney for installation. Afterwards, the casting basin was used to make huge concrete gravity-based structures for two off-shore oil platforms, from 1993 to 1996.

Plot The cartoon opens with an animated Earth sleeping in a snoring fashion. It then moves to a cat trying to enter a house's front yard only to be shooed away by a resident dog. The scene once more moves to a house where the ghost of Hungarian composer Franz Liszt rises from a bust, and plays Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 on a piano. Moments later, a flock of storks are flying across the night sky, carrying infants in sacks. One of them gets hit by lightning and therefore drops a sack. The sack falls into a house where it opens. The baby that comes out is none other than Krazy Kat in diapers. Despite being so young, the kitten has a knack for making music, especially in the jazz genre. As he plays Down Home Rag with one instrument and another, the others come to life and play along. After spending time playing in the house, the young Krazy and the instruments take to the skies in an airplane. They then play Saint Louis Blues around the globe, and those who hear it dance to the rhythm. People who enjoyed their performance include: a man and a bull in a bullfight, Russian hooligans, Dutch clowns, and an African tribe. In no time, the animated Earth is awake and in an upbeat mood. Finally, Krazy and the instruments are parading on the street with thousands of spectators watching. When they reach the end of their march, a man in a tophat approaches and awards Krazy the key to a particular city.

It comes under the Agra Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The parish lies on the north-western tip of Agra Diocese, bordering with the Delhi Diocese on the west and Meerut Diocese on the north. The present parish priest of the church is Father Joseph Dabre.The Assistant Priests are Father Vineesh Joseph Nanthikatt and Father Stephen Paul, a member of the Society of the Blessed Sacrament. The parish comprises roughly 850 Catholic families.  History  Catholics searching for jobs were living in the industrial city of Noida since its constitution in 1976 by the UP Industrial Development Act. Initially they went to nearby churches in Delhi especially Mayur Vihar for attending Mass. On the insistence of Noida Catholics, the priest from Mayur Vihar parish later agreed to celebrate the Mass on Saturday evenings in Noida as he had to be in his parish on Sundays. Due to lack of a proper place, it was arranged in the houses of different people. In 1984, Archbishop Cecil de Sa appointed Fr. Johnson Chiryankandath, then parish priest of Bulandshahar to survey the pastoral needs of Noida. He visited Noida often for that reason. In 1985, the parishioners approached the newly appointed priest in Mayur Vihar to take Noida into the pastoral care of Mayur Vihar parish. The priest expressed helplessness as he could do nothing without consent from both the Archbishops of Delhi and Agra. Further deliberation resulted in a meeting between the two archbishops and a resolution that the people of Noida would be included in the Mayur Vihar Parish until a dedicated priest was appointed by the Agra Diocese for Noida Catholics. In 1986, Fr. Johnson was appointed as the parish priest for Noida by the Archbishop Cecil de Sa, thus including Noida in the ecclesial jurisdiction of Agra Diocese. Till then, Noida was an independent parish. In October 1986, Fr. Johnson applied for a land to build a church. The Noida Authority allotted a land in Sector-25, Noida. But due to objections from residents of Sector 25, the plot was returned. On the archbishop's advice, Fr. Johnson approached Noida authority for a Mass centre. An H.I.G. flat in Sector-27, Noida was obtained in December 1987 and inaugurated and named as \\"Maria Sadan\\" in February 1988. Maria Sadan is still used as a Mass centre by the parish. From 1996 the Orthodox Christians living in Noida were permitted to use the Mass centre till their own church was constructed and consecrated. The plot in Sector-34, where the church presently stands was allotted by the authority, in exchange for the originally allotted plot in Sector-25, in May 1990 after three years of pursuance by Fr. Johnson and the parishioners. The foundation stone for the church was laid on 15 August 1991 by the then Archbishop of Agra Diocese, Rev. Cecil de Sa. Two years later the structure was consecrated for public worship.  Geography  The church presently stands in Sector ‚Äì 34, just near the Ram Mandir. There is a local shopping complex where a Mother Dairy booth is also situated. The church is situated less than 1 kilometre from Noida City Centre metro station  Major celebrations and events  * Christmas ‚Äì 24 December midnight * Easter ‚Äì midnight celebration as per liturgical year * Good Friday ‚Äì as per liturgical year * Parochial feast day of the Assumption of Our Lady and the Independence Day of India ‚Äì 15 August * NCYS painting competition ‚Äì last Sunday of July or first Sunday of August * All Souls Day ‚Äì 1 November * Feast of Christ the King ‚Äì last Sunday of Ordinary Time  NCYS  On 10 May 1990, the then parish priest Fr. Johnson Chiryankandath founded a youth group of the parish and named it Noida Catholic Yuva Sangh (NCYS). It initially consisted of 10 members, later increasing steadily. Since 1996, the NCYS has been organizing painting competitions every year during church feasts in the nearby Assisi Convent School in Noida. Children from around Noida are invited, especially students from various schools in Noida. Although NCYS prefers pre-registration through participant schools, spot registration is also usually available. Blood donation camps are also organised by NCYS on Good Friday every year, in association with local blood banks like Rotary Club. It is meant to be an act of following Jesus symbolically, as Christians believe that He also shed his blood on the cross for others.  NCWA  The church is also one of the five major members of the Noida Christian Welfare Association (NCWA) which conducts various social activities for the welfare of the Christian community in Noida. It also organises annual Christmas processions though various areas of Noida stopping at all five member churches.  Persecutions  There have been many attacks on the priests living here. On 20 October 2008, Conrad Dominic Xavier, a call centre employee, was found murdered in Maria Sadan in Sector- 27. Dominic was allowed to live in the Mass centre along with the church helper, as he had told the priest that he was new to the place and had no one to approach in the city. Parishioners suspect that the intention was to harm the priest but Dominic became the victim by mistake. The murderer, Shailendra Chauhan, alias Uday Singh, who later admitted the crime was arrested from Delhi by the Delhi Police. In January 2009, Chauhan had attacked and critically wounded Fr. Jipson of St. Mary's Church, with a poison filled injection. The man also admitted to having vandalised a church in Sarita Vihar, Delhi.

The company was originally a subsidiary of UUNet Internet Africa which he started in South Africa with the demand for internet services.  History of Internet service in Zimbabwe  Zimbabwe may have been one of the later additions to the digital world, but this was by no means anything short of a technical advancement that has since changed the country. Delving into the history of data Control is to look back to the very founding of the first global ISPs. For this reason alone it is an important chapter of global history that needs to be documented. Data Control won an award from \\"Best Of The Planet Awards 1996 IN THE CATEGORY OF WWW INTERNET PROVIDERS\\" 2ask.com. This was a major achievement for an African company, never mind a Zimbabwean company. Data Control & Systems was the first internet service provider in Zimbabwe. They provided a technological first in Southern Africa, being the Sister company of UUnet Internet Africa born in South Africa. The main directors of the company were Clint Nursten and his father, Rob Nursten. The Network Administration was handled by Clint Sim and Scott Nursten who was also responsible for the security systems at both the host and network levels. Scott also provided web design and various programming applications for the commercial side of the company. He then went on to start s2s Ltd, a major provider of security and networking consultancy in the United Kingdom with his brother Dale Nursten. The company set out to provide Internet access to the whole of southern Africa from 1994 onwards. Its domain name was harare.iafrica.com. which used leased line access from South Africa through the Zimbabwean Posts & Telecommunications Company aka P.T.C. Eventually Data Control & Systems changed name to Internet Unlimited and was then bought out by Econet Wireless and named Ecoweb Internet. During the period of the company being named Internet Unlimited, the domain name was internet.co.zw and has remained as that domain up until 2002. As of 2005, the company provided internet access to over 50,000 Zimbabweans and many international tourists through lower level internet cafes and client computers.  Technical management and support   Server hardware and software  The ISP was based upon the Red Hat Linux 5 operating system which was the fastest at that time and Microsoft Windows NT 3.51. Later, it was upgraded to Windows NT 4 and Red Hat Linux 6 and, a radius server was implemented by Clint Sim, their administrator at that time. Unfortunately, Clint and his wife who were fatally injured in a car accident in 2004, survived by their two sons. The computer servers' hardware was based upon Dual Intel Pentium processor boards with 64 MB of RAM linked to RAID ARRAYS of SCSI disks. This type of hard drive was chosen for its independent processor usage which presented performance enhancements over the use of IDE disks which used the computer's CPU to function.  Network structure  Primary head of service originated from UUNet in USA, which was recognised as being the \\"first commercial Internet service provider and a leading supplier of a comprehensive range of Internet access options, applications, and consulting services to businesses, professionals and on-line service providers.\\" in the United States. Founded in 1987 and was the fourth largest in the world in 1997 prior to merging with WorldCom, Inc. UUNet provided a 622Mbs trunk line on Atlantic sea bed via Europe before connecting to the African routes via VSAT. The satellite signal was connected to a South African station of UUNet Internet Africa and distributed to the region by land links. In c1999 there was a project that started to implement a fibre optic route around the west coast of Africa all the way from Europe to South Africa as an under-sea project and was completed in 2012, SAT-3/WASC. The Network was broadcast overseas from London links to South Africa prior to Sat-2 being fully implemented but the cost was prohibitive to most companies. Since the arrival of SAT-3/WASC the cost of access is a lot lower, but savings not always passed on by governments to users which is why African Internet service is very expensive, especially South African internet and subsequently, Zimbabwean services. Most of Data Control's Dial-up lines came in via Livingstone Portmasters full of US Robotics and Microcom external modems and the commercial links were accessed through License-free 2.4 GHz wireless WaveLAN or leased line alternative. The bulk of the modems used were the US Robotics type modems which in 1996 were operation at around 14.4 kbit/s whilst the Microcom modems originally operated at Microcom 14.4 kbit/s Microcom 28.8 kbit/s. Within a couple of years, the technology would be outdated and replaced with the 56.6 kbit/s type modems for dial-up customers. With the lack of reliable POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) networks in the most rural areas of Zimbabwe, some farmers used cellular networks almost exclusively, albeit with an incredibly high cost. Some of those areas were so remote that not even a telephone line was installed within 10 miles of their offices. This peculiarity of African circumstance lead to the development of extended range wifi networks not seen in use in Europe or USA to any great extent, but In Africa it is widespread.  Service and support personnel  The back office service and support was headed up by Clint Sim and supported by Scott Nursten. Scott's primary duties were web design and security while Clint provided the technical expertise on Linux and Windows, the latter being an operating system he despised. The front of office Technical Support desk was manned by up to 4 technicians who answered and assisted the dial-in users with many of their problems and training issues. Since Zimbabwe had never before seen internet access locally, many people did not know what computers were useful for or how they could be implemented for their businesses. The technical support team; Sheldon, Heath, Adam and Zimbabwe's All Africa Games gold medalist Tae Kwondo fighter, Fanuel Kwande, had to deal with this infusion of knowledge to the general populace. According to Linked-In profiles, Fanuel may now be a Director of a company Fanuel Kwande and was certainly the lead support with Sheldon at the handover of Data Control to Econet. Heath went on to start up his own company Total PC after leaving Data Control, and emigrated to England after 2006. Adam left Data Control and started his own company, Visionary TechServ, which failed with the Zimbabwe economic collapse. Adam eventually emigrated to England in 2004 and started a specialist photography company in 2015. Scott emigrated to England and started his own company there.  Ownership history  The original name was UUNet Internet Africa before becoming Data Control & Systems in 1996. Data Control & Systems changed name to Internet Unlimited when Clint Nursten took over the position of managing director from Rob Nursten in 1998. After a few months, a deal with Econet Wireless (owned by Strive Masyiwa) was struck and Internet Unlimited was sold to Econet Wireless. Econet decided to re-brand the company as Ecoweb.  Competitors  With the successes of Data Control, many other people realised that Internet access was a huge opportunity to make money and create a new business type in the country before the impending Dot Com boom and bust. As part of that boom there was a very particular company that made a fantastically meteoric rise to fame and then crashed into ignominy all within the first five years of Zimbabwe's internet debut: Samara Services. All Zimbabwe's major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were based on a single block of buildings in central Harare. The buildings were namely Eastgate Centre, Harare and Southampton Life Centre. The entire block of buildings was built by the same consulting engineers company, Ove Arup & Partners of Harare. By close of 1999, Samara Services had all but evaporated and the directors disappeared. Their customers were left without services and their entire network fell into disarray in a very short period of time. Their creditors quickly seized assets and equipment as part-settlement of outstanding bills as was recorded in The Herald newspaper on Zimbabwe. The one really notable contribution to Zimbabwean internet history by Samara was that they had managed to gain the most popularity and largest user base in the little nation in a very short period of time. It was that massive growth that may have led to their downfall and the company failures on the back of many hidden issues that the public were never made aware of. Another issue leading to their demise was the backbone of the entire network was on a single operator's backbone: the PTC. Another competitor was Africa Online. It was a rather late arrival compared to the other ISPs as they had older (technologically speaking) equipment but a very much better management structure which allowed them to survive longer than was expected of other ISPs. Their advent into the world of Internet service provision at the end of 1997 was a breath of fresh air after the collapse of Samara Services. Many of the technical and administrative staff from Samara services were absorbed into Africa online as a result and it was believed that much of their equipment was from Samara Services too. Their parent service provision was from Prodigy Internet through the same leased line structure of PTC. Zimbabwe Online deserves a special mention as it was run and managed from inside the offices of Data Control and their technical staff. It was founded by Peter Lobel using a proprietary dial- up system like similar to the style of America Online very successfully. Mr Lobel then updated the method of dial-up from a managed proprietary script service to an automated user-managed service. One of the secrets of the company at that time was that they were one of the first to dabble in VSAT broadcast with their own dish on the roof of the Eastgate Centre, secretly installed with only a very select few staff and friends who knew about it. VSAT was considered an illegal installation by the government who wanted to control all and every bit of international news to do with Zimbabwe. Zimsurf surfaced on 29 May 1998 and was eventually the governmental run Internet Service Provider, administered competently by Marco Kalis. Zimsurf was to become ultimately the internet arm of Telecell. Before Zimsurf dissolved, there was a huge VSAT dish installed in the garden of one of the company's directors in Avondale. The dish was linked by leased line to their offices in the Harare CBD. In size, it was about three meters in diameter smack in the middle of his front lawn. The property was surrounded by a four-foot chicken- wire fence and the dish was plainly visible to all passers-by. Eventually, the company was ordered to disable VSAT broadcast according to local law that prohibited competition to the PTC who were the only licensed users of VSAT and the only issuers of licences for VSAT. Thus began a monopolistic war on communication in Zimbabwe. An indepth study of the Internet availability in Africa in the 1990s is available in PDF format.

Ford (nee Pfingstel; born December 28, 1920) is an American nurse and the co-founder of the first nurse practitioner program. Along with pediatrician Henry Silver, Ford started the pediatric nurse practitioner program at the University of Colorado in 1965. In 1972, Ford joined the University of Rochester as founding dean of the nursing school. Early life Loretta Ford was born December 28, 1920, in New York City. When she was young, she wanted to be a teacher, but her family's financial situation led her to choose a less costly educational path. When Ford graduated from high school at 16, she was too young to enter a postgraduate training program, so she worked at Middlesex General Hospital (now Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital) in New Brunswick, New Jersey as a nurses' aide. While working in the hospital, Ford lived and studied with nursing students, and she decided to pursue nursing as a career. After a year and a half as a nurses' aide, Ford entered the nursing program at Middlesex General and received her Diploma in Nursing in 1941. Career After graduation, Ford joined the Visiting Nurse Service (VNS) of New Brunswick. However, her tenure with VNS was short-lived. In 1942, following the death of her fiance in World War II, Ford joined the US Army Air Force. She had hoped to enter flight nurse training, but was denied due to her vision, and instead served at base hospitals in Florida and Maine. Through the G.I. Bill, Ford was then able to attend the University of Colorado (CU), where she completed a B.S. in nursing with a Public Health Nursing certificate (1949) and Master of Public Health Nursing Supervision (1951). At CU, Ford was mentored and impacted by several influential figures in nursing and public health including Lucile Petry Leone, Pearl Parvin Coulter, and Henrietta Loughran. During this time, Ford was also working as a public health nurse for Boulder County and eventually became the director of nursing at the Boulder City-County Health department. In 1961, Ford received her Doctorate in Education also from the University of Colorado. Her doctoral work was in the development of cases in public health nursing administration and was supported through a National League for Nursing fellowship. Prior to completion of her EdD, Ford was already an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Nursing in Denver, and then earned full professorship in 1965. It was during her tenure at CU that Ford co-developed the first nurse practitioner program. In 1971, she was elected to the National Academy of Medicine. Ford became the founding dean of the nursing school at the University of Rochester in 1972. At the University of Rochester, Ford developed the unification model of nursing.  Founding of nurse practitioner programs  As a public health nurse for Boulder County, Ford worked in rural Colorado in the 1940s and 1950s. Through CU's public health nursing program, Ford became one of the first test field teachers, training students from the Denver Visiting Nurse Service in these communities. During this time, she noted a deficit of care in these communities, which she and other nurses filled with temporary health clinics. This experience confirmed for Ford that nurses could independently fill gaps in healthcare if offered specialized training. Ford was given the opportunity to begin developing the specialized training she envisioned through the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education in Nursing. With this organization, Ford was part of a team of educators who developed a specialized clinical curriculum for community health, a curriculum she brought to CU to further develop. In 1965, Ford joined with pediatrician Henry Silver to create the pediatric nurse practitioner program at the University of Colorado. This was the first nurse practitioner program in the United States. The program was introduced in a Pediatrics journal article in 1967 as, \\"a new educational and training program in pediatrics for professional nurses which has been developed to provide increased health care for children in both rural and urban areas.\\" Early nurse practitioner programs faced opposition from established faculty at nursing schools. Due to the medical component of the curriculum, physicians were now involved in training nurses. Opponents were concerned this would lead to a supervisory relationship between nurse practitioners and physicians, instead of a cooperative relationship between independent colleagues. Critics felt this approach would allow medicine to usurp nursing. Additionally, there was a great deal of prejudice around the abilities of nurses that Ford worked to overcome in these first nurse practitioner programs.  Unification Model of Nursing  During her tenure as Dean at the University of Rochester, Ford developed a holistic approach to nursing education called the Unification Model of Nursing. The model is designed to include education, research, and clinical practice in the training of nurses.  Awards  In 1989, Ford received the Ruth B. Freeman Award in the Public Health Nursing Section from the American Public Health Association. In 1990, she received the Gustav O. Lienhard Award from the National Academy of Medicine. Ford was named a Living Legend by the American Academy of Nursing in 1999. In 2003, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from The Nurse Practitioner. She was honored with the Elizabeth Blackwell Award from Hobart and William Smith Colleges that same year; the award honors \\"a woman whose life exemplifies outstanding service to humanity.\\" She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2012, she was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, Loretta Ford Dr. Ford holds honorary doctorates from six universities.

Design The type was designed by William Robert Rowan, Managing Director of the Scandia Company of Copenhagen, Denmark. The design was brought to the attention of the Victorian Railways by Captain Frederick Charles Rowan, brother of the patentee and author of a book on railways for sparsely populated country districts. A feature of the design was provision for the easy removal of the power unit for repair, allowing a substitute unit to be fitted. Construction Details Rowan Car No.1 / Motor No.1 Rowan Car No.1 diagram Rowan Car No.1 was delivered complete from the manufacturer. The power unit was built by Kitson and Company (b/n T69 of 1883) of Leeds, England, who were also sole agent for the type in the Australasian Colonies. As built it was double deck with a capacity of 60 passengers and of goods. Before entering service. Victorian Railways modified it to carry 42 passengers, 12 in first class and 30 in second class, on a single deck. The overall length was and the tare weight was . It was test run on the Williamstown line on 1 June 1883. On 1 July 1883 it was test run between Lancefield Road and Sunbury where it was able to haul up to 30 tons in addition to its own weight and reach up to on level track. It ran in regular local service between Camberwell and Box Hill for one month and was also test run to Lilydale. In 1884 it was running between Maryborough and Avoca. For most of the 1880s it ran local trains between Essendon and Broadmeadows where it was known unofficially as the \\"Broady Car\\". In September 1892, the railcar was converted to a separate engine unit and trailer. The boiler pressure was reduced to and the power unit was thereafter known as Motor No. 1. Rowan Car No.2 / Motor No.2 Motor No.2. A spare power unit (Kitson b/n T70 of 1883) was delivered with Car No.1 so they could be swapped when one needed repairs. In 1888 the Victorian Railways turned it into a second steam motor called Rowan Car No.2. It could haul a conventional passenger car or up to 35 tons of goods vehicles. It operated mainly on the Outer Circle line. With the conversion of Rowan Car No.1 into Motor No. 1, from 1892 it became known as Motor No. 2. Withdrawal by VR Motor No.1 is believed to have been little used after conversion and was sold to the Melbourne and Altona Colliery Company. Motor No.2 was withdrawn in 1904. The trailer from Rowan Car No.1 was converted to a conventional passenger car which remained in service until 1926. Purchase by Sanderson and Grant One of the Kitson power units regauged to 3'6\\" gauge c1908. Both Kitson power units were purchased by the Sanderson and Grant sawmill at Forrest in 1907. Sanderson had previously tried to purchased them in 1901 and again in 1904. They were converted to gauge by narrowing the underframes and shortening the axles. One was involved in an accident on 21 November 1907 which killed Alexander Sanderson and his son Marshall. In 1919 one was taken out of use and its boiler used to power a winch. The other was withdrawn in 1923 and also used to power a winch. Model Railways HO Scale N Scale See also *Kerr Stuart steam railmotor, Motor No.3 built using the experience from the Rowan Car.

It was established in 1972 by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (, T√úBƒ∞TAK) in Gebze, Kocaeli Province bringing a number of research units of T√úBƒ∞TAK formed in the past under one umbrella. The center is currently headed by Prof. Dr. ƒ∞brahim Din√ßer. History Two years after its establishment, T√úBƒ∞TAK formed in 1965 the Operational Research Unit at the Middle East Technical University (ODT√ú) in Ankara. Founding of three more research institutions followed in 1968, namely the Electronics Research Institute at ODT√ú, the Materials Research Institute and Applied Mathematics Research Unit at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). In 1970, the Nutrition and Food Technologies Research Unit was formed at Ege University in ƒ∞zmir. In the years after 1976, research projects were conducted that were funded by UNIDO and NATO's Science for Stability Program. In the years 1982 and 1984, the number and value of contracted projects took a considerable size. And in 1991, T√úBƒ∞TAK MAM started a process of transformation adopting industrial research and development in principle as its main strategy and studies. In 1995, the center achieved a status of more dynamic and half autonomous organization. In following years, the center underwent structural changes in the organization as a result of expansion of its subordinate research units. Electronics Research Department, National Metrology Institute and Research Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology grew enough in terms of staff and business volume so that they were reorganized as separate institutes directly reporting to TUBITAK headquarters in Ankara. In July 2006, the Research Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology was subordinated back to the Marmara Research Center. In the beginning of 2009, the Chemical and Environmental Institute was split in two institutes, namely Chemical Institute and Environment Institute. And finally in 2010, the Information Technologies Institute was transferred into Turkish National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology (UEKAE), an institute of T√úBƒ∞TAK Informatics and Information Security Research Center (Bƒ∞LGEM). Organization The Marmara Research Center consists of seven institutes as follows: * Chemistry Institute * Earth and Marine Sciences Institute * Energy Institute * Environment Institute * Food Institute * Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Institute * Materials Institute See also * RV T√úBƒ∞TAK Marmara, a research vessel operated by the Environment Institute.

It lives in a burrow in the sand or mud of beaches and estuaries in intertidal zones in the north Atlantic. This species is used in research but its classification is in dispute and in the literature it is often classified as Nereis diversicolor (O.F. M√ºller, 1776). Its specific name \\"diversicolor\\" refers to the fact that its colour changes from brown to green as the breeding season approaches. Description Hediste diversicolor can grow up to in length and may have from ninety to one hundred and twenty segments when mature. The head has a pair of palps, two pairs of antennae, four pairs of tentacles and four eyes. Each body segment has a pair of bristly appendages known as perapods which are used for walking and swimming. There is a prominent blood vessel running along the dorsal surface of the animal. This ragworm is pale brown but changes to green as the gonads mature and the breeding season approaches. Distribution and habitat Hediste diversicolor is native to the north-east Atlantic. Its range extends from the Baltic Sea and North Sea southwards to the Azores and Mediterranean Sea. It has been introduced to the north-west Atlantic in the areas of Cobscook Bay, the Gulf of Maine and the Gulf of St Lawrence. It is plentiful on beaches of sand, muddy sand and mud, including areas of low salinity, where it lives in a semi- permanent \\"J\\"-shaped or \\"U\\"-shaped burrow and under adjoining stones in the intertidal zone. Biology Examination of the contents of the gut shows that Hediste diversicolor is a predator and generalist scavenger, able to adapt its diet to whatever is currently available. It spins a mucus net at the entrance of its burrow in which it traps phytoplankton, zooplankton, diatoms, bacteria and other small particles. It creates a water current through its tube by writhing about inside to draw particles through the net. Periodically it rolls the net up and swallows it before spinning another. When the availability of suitably-sized food particles is low it emerges from its burrow and hunts for small invertebrates, seizing them with its strong jaws. It also eats detritus and even animal faeces. They also draw, otherwise not edible, cordgrass seeds into their burrows and let them sprout to produce high-quality food, one of the rare examples of ‚Äúgardening‚Äù by animals.Zhu, Z., J. van Belzen, T. Hong, T. Kunihiro, T. Ysebaert, P. M. J. Herman, et al. (2016). Sprouting as a gardening strategy to obtain superior supplementary food: evidence from a seed-caching marine worm. Ecology. doi: 10.1002/ecy.1613 The sexes are separate in Hediste diversicolor, and the number of females heavily outweigh the number of males. As the breeding season approaches, the males, which were previously indistinguishable from the females, turn bright green. At the same time, the females turn a duller dark green on the dorsal surface with their earlier orange-brown pigmentation still showing through. Eggs develop within the female's body cavity. Histolysis then occurs and the body wall becomes brittle and eventually bursts, liberating the eggs into the burrow. Synchronized spawning takes place in early spring, usually at the time of the new or full moon when the water has warmed up after the winter and attained a temperature above . The timing of this event varies throughout the worm's range and more southern populations mature at a year of age while more northerly ones may be three years old before they breed. The male seems to be attracted to a burrow occupied by a female by the release of a pheromone into the water. He crawls across the seabed and liberates sperm into the water just outside the entrance of the female's burrow. The sperm is drawn into the tube by the water current that the female creates by undulating her body. Here fertilisation takes place and the larvae are brooded for ten to fourteen days. Both males and females die after spawning. Ecology Hediste diversicolor is widespread and common and is eaten by many species of birds and fish. It is the main food item for the pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), the grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola), the curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica) and the curlew (Numenius arquata). Several flatfish which live on intertidal mudflats feed on the ragworm. These include the common dab (Limanda limanda), the common sole (Solea solea), the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) and the European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Hediste diversicolor has been found to have a deleterious effect on the establishment of saltmarshes. When tests were undertaken in southern England on establishing the seagrass Zostera noltei, it was found that efforts were more successful when the ragworm was excluded from the area of transplanted material. In another planting trial, the pioneering cordgrass Spartina anglica, used to prevent coastal erosion, was similarly adversely affected. In the laboratory, ragworms were seen to pull leaves of the grasses into their burrows where they fed on them, and the disturbance to the substrate caused by their burrowing activities was also thought to contribute to the reduced establishment rates. Uses Hediste diversicolor is used as a model laboratory animal for research. It has also been used to evaluate the quality of marine sediment because it bioaccumulates certain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium and arsenic. Anglers use it for bait when sea fishing, digging it out of the substrate with a large fork. It is also available commercially.

Nicknamed \\"Little Tricky\\", he began skateboarding at the age of three in Kirkland, Washington, gaining popularity and recognition as a young talent in skateboarding. Brusco is the first skateboarder in history to successfully land a 1260, a skateboard trick where the rider makes three-and- half revolutions in the air before landing, in competition. He also has held other records involving the 1080 and the 900.  Life and career  Mitchie Brusco was born on February 20, 1997, to Mick and Jennifer Brusco. The fourth of five children, he began skateboarding at the age of three, when he saw a skateboard for sale at Target. Brusco's mother began taking him to skateparks after seeing him roll around the house on his skateboard. Impressed by his skills at his age, Brusco's first sponsorship was from a local skate shop who asked him to join their local skate team. It was also at the skate shop that Brusco received his nickname of \\"Little Tricky\\". By the age of four, Brusco competed in more than 75 skateboarding competitions. In 2002, when he was five years old, Brusco won a regional competition for children 8-years-old and under. This title also secured him the chance to compete in the 2002 Gravity Games. The same year, his family hired an agent to represent him. In July 2011, Brusco became the second skateboarder to land a 900 on a mega ramp. At the time, this also made 14-year-old Brusco the youngest person to successfully complete a 900, until Tom Schaar broke this record in October of that year at the age of 12. At the X Games XVIII, Brusco became the first X Games competitor to land a 900 in the Big Air skateboard competition. On May 17, 2013, Brusco became the second skateboarder in history to successfully land a 1080 on the MegaRamp, the first to land the 1080 in the Big Air event at the X Games, and only the third person known to have ever performed the move. In 2018, at the big air competition at X Games Minneapolis, he landed his 2nd 1080 and earned his first X Games gold medal. In August 2019, Brusco became the first skateboarder to land a 1260 (three full and one-half revolutions) in a Big Air contest.

They finished fifth in the 2011 season, the last season where the A-Division was the top flight. Although they were not formally relegated at the end of the 2011 season, they do not appear to have taken part either in the 2012 A-Division, nor consequently the 2012‚Äì13 Bhutan National League. History The first recorded mention of Choden competing in Bhutanese football is in 2005 when they won the final of the B-Division beating Rookies F.C. 3‚Äì0. The bottom two teams in the A-Division, Rigzung Club and Dzongree, for that season played off against Choden and Rookies to determine which two would play top-flight football the following season. No results are known, but from the available data from 2006, it appears that Choden were promoted from this, whilst Dzongree were relegated. Choden's first appearance in the A-Division was in 2006, although their final position is not known as only a few results are known together with a very fragmentary final table. Choden's only known result for that season was a 1‚Äì0 victory against Druk Pol. They were not relegated however, as they competed in the following season, where they finished sixth out of eight teams narrowly avoiding relegation. Again, details for this season are patchy at best. The only recorded results for Choden are a 1‚Äì1 draw with Yeedzin and a 4‚Äì0 loss to eventual champions Transport United. Their final points tally is also not known, as there is nor record of their score in their final game against Druk Pol. However, the maximum it could have been is 20 as they were on 17 points going into that game. Their final position in the next season is unknown, although the highest they could have finished was fourth as the top three finishers, Yeedzin, Transport United and Royal Bhutan Army are known. However, at the halfway stage in the season, they were in sixth place, above Druk Athletic on goal difference with six points, having won two of their seven games to that point. The only two known results for Choden in 2008 were 1‚Äì1 draws with Druk Pol and Yeedzin. They could conceivably have finished bottom in the previous season, but since no clubs were promoted or relegated, they were guaranteed top-flight football in the 2009 season. Choden recorded their best ever performance in 2009, finishing fourth, winning six and drawing four of their thirteen matches (an odd number of games was played as Royal Bhutan Army withdrew halfway through the season, in fact Choden did not play the army team at all, their first match against them being awarded to Choden 2‚Äì0 following the army's withdrawal). This strong performance included an 11‚Äì0 victory over Druk Athletic and a 5‚Äì0 win against Rigzung. Choden also performed strongly in the cup competition, as they reached the semi-finals of the 2009 Club Cup Championship, losing 4‚Äì1 to Yeedzin. In both the 2010 and 2011 seasons, their final seasons of recorded competition, they finished in fifth place. In 2010, they finished well off the pace, recording victories only against the bottom club Nangpa 2‚Äì1 and 4‚Äì2 and Druk Athletic 4‚Äì3. With only nine points for the whole season, they finished thirteen points behind fourth placed Druk Star, and having suffered a number of heavy defeats, including an 8‚Äì0 loss to Druk Pol and a 6‚Äì0 defeat against Yeedzin, they finished with a ‚àí22 goal difference. No details other than their final position are known for 2011. Again, they finished above Nangpa and Druk Athletic in a truncated season that was contested as a single round-robin set of matches in anticipation of the commencement of a full national league, which was in fact delayed by a further year. This was their last season of competition to date at the highest level of competition in Bhutan. They did not compete in the A-Division in 2012. It is unclear from the scant details available whether they played at a lower level that season, but an under-16 team competed the following year in the B-Division and an under-18 team rejoined the A-Division for the 2014 season, who could be considered successors to Choden, although they have not competed under that name.

It would appear therefore, that Pontikos, having equalled a record that had stood for over 60 years, saw it broken only a few days later. It is not known whether they competed again, and there is no record of them competing in any future season for which records exist.

History  The 7th Battalion, RNZIR was formed in 1964 during the reorganisation of the army by the amalgamation of two separate regiments: *5th Wellington Regiment *9th Hawke's Bay Regiment (which had earlier incorporated the 17th (Ruahine) Regiment) In 1948 the 7th Wellington West Coast Regiment amalgamated with the 11th Taranaki Regiment to form The Wellington West Coast & Taranaki Regiment. In 1964 The Wellington West Coast & Taranaki Regiment became the 5th Battalion, RNZIR. In 1974 further name changes occurred to reflect each units historical links - *5th (Wellington West Coast & Taranaki) Battalion, RNZIR. *7th (Wellington (City of Wellington's Own) and Hawke's Bay) Battalion, RNZIR. The respective amalgamations saw the new regiments become Territorial Force battalions of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment. This lasted until another reorganisation in 1999, which saw the TF battalions split from the RNZIR to become multi- function battalion groups. Then again in 2012 the territorial force reorganised with the battalion groups splitting and the former units rejoining their parent corps and regiments. The infantry battalions were amalgamated from six to three, this included the 5th and 7th Battalions which amalgamated to form the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment.  Regimental bands  Until 30 June 2012, both battalions each had a regimental band or regimental pipes and drums. But funding to the territorial force bands was cut in favour of keeping the full-time New Zealand Army Band. Both the former Regimental Pipes and Drums of the 5th (Wellington West Coast and Taranaki) Battalion, RNZIR and the Regimental Band of the 7th (Wellington (City of Wellington's Own) and Hawke's Bay) Battalion, RNZIR continue as incorporated societies while retaining their respective uniforms, rank, instruments and band rooms. Notably, the 7th Battalion Band performed at Government House, Wellington for the territorial force amalgamation parade in March 2013.

Early life Aubrey Mokoape was born in Johannesburg, South Africa where he grew up as a child but later moved to [Pretoria] with his family. Aubrey and his family lived in a Johannesburg location in a building that only workers lived in. He has three siblings, Walter, George, Keith and Barbara. His father worked for an old trading company known as the Elephant Trading Company. He worked as a dispatch clerk but before this he worked as a teacher. Mokoape's father was transferred to Pretoria and so was the rest of his family and this is where Mokoape partly grew up. He studied through bantu education at an elite Johannesburg high school, in one of the locations, known as Orlando High School. His years in Orlando high school were prominent due to the high level of political activity. He later studied to be a doctor at the University of Natal. Political career In 1948 Bantu education was introduced and in 1955 he and a few others, were the first to study under Bantu education however during this time pass laws were reinforced and were a lot stricter than before. There was a lot of political agitation at this time. In 1957 most of the workers in the location were asked to move out of the building and were allocated to Soweto and Mokoape and his family were asked to move out of the building and relocate to Soweto. Mokoape's 'political baptism' (as he calls it) happened for him during the Pebco bus strike and this was the first political activity he took part in. This was one of the first and popular strikes to occur since buses were boycotted and student were forced to walk 7‚Äì8 kilometres to school. His high school was a highly politicised high school where he also met senior leaders of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). They held meetings and discussions about political issues during school hours as they were a Pan Africanist school. Mokoape was the vocal student among his peers and was one of the leaders in the school. In 1958 and 1959 at the ages of 14 and 15 Mokoape had become a well known political voice in the school. He also had the privilege of being around figures such as Robert Sobukwe. Mokoape was influenced by his neighbours, his peers and his father in becoming an Africanist and was around during the formation of the PAC was being. In 1959 members of the anti-Apartheid parties were surrendering themselves for arrest, however, during this time Mokoape was working at a golf course as a caddy trying to earn a living while also attending school with important PAC members. On 21 March 1963 Mokoape and a few comrades marched with Sobukwe to surrender themselves for arrest to the police but the police did not take them seriously. While Mokoape and other activists were still at the police station, members of the police force heard that shots were being fired at the march and led to what is now known as the Sharpeville Massacre. The Sharpeville massacre generated mass calamity and Mokoape and other political member were later detained. Mokoape and 150 others were sentenced to 3 years in prison and were sent to the notorious Number four prison now but has now been restructured and turned into the South African Constitutional Court in Pretoria. Sobukwe and the other leaders were sentenced to 2 years in prison as there trial was different. After being detained at the Number four prison for a few months, they were later transferred to Benoni prison and lastly to a prison in the Free State. They were subjected to solitary confinement and also cruelty by being forced to work in the mines.

On top of building schools and day cares and taking part in other social projects, the BCM through the BCP was involved in the staging of the large scale protests and workers strikes which gripped the nation in 1972 and 1973, especially in Durban. Indeed, in 1973 the government of South Africa began to clamp down on the movement, claiming that their ideas of black development were treasonous, and virtually the entire leadership of SASO and BPC were banned Black Consciousness Movement.

The club teams currently compete in the Geelong Football Netball League, the premier league in Geelong. History The club was formed in 1927 and first tasted success with back to back flags in 1938 and 1939. After the Second World War the club spent many years in the Woolworths Cup competition of the Geelong & District Football League. Promoted to Division one from 1965 they then joined the Geelong Football League when that league was founded in 1979 and won six premierships in a row from 1995 to 2000. Some of the more influential names to play for the club through this golden era include Ron Watt, Glenn Keast, Tom Hall, Danny Warren, Simon Riddoch, David Milsome, Wade Chapman, Bill Nicholls, Travis Robertson, Chris Huxtable,Brad \\"Don't Bowl Here\\" McDougall and the mercurial Robert Alslop. Due to the removal of the salary cap by the VCFL, North Shore struggled to compete with more affluent clubs for a long period of time but in the 2017 season their hard work started to pay off finishing the season in 7th position led by coach Jason Davenport. Jason Davenport was rewarded for his efforts with a development coaching role with Carlton in the AFL. Sam Darley, a former AFL player with Greater Western Sydney and Western Bulldogs and Richmond VFL captain, is the current coach of the senior team. During 2017 they picked up the superstar Tasmanian Julian Dobosz in hopes to go on to win the 2018 Premiership. Critics aren't sure, but Dobosz's style and grace should prove prominent in the 2018 season. He has started the season off with bags of 3 and 4 in the first two rounds against quality opponents.

His first-class debut for Sussex came against Northamptonshire in the 1914 County Championship, with him scoring an unbeaten 78 on debut. He made a further appearance in that season's County Championship against Gloucestershire, before the season was curtailed by the start of the First World War. Following the conclusion of the war, Wilson returned to playing first-class cricket for Sussex in the 1919 County Championship, making seven appearances in that season, with the season including his only first-class century with a score of 134 against Northamptonshire. He played twice for Sussex in the 1920 County Championship against Warwickshire and Middlesex, as well as playing a first-class match for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South. His next first- class appearances for Sussex came in two university matches in 1923 against Oxford University and Cambridge University, before making two further appearances for the county in the 1925 County Championship against Hampshire and Somerset. Following a nine-year absence from first-class cricket, Wilson played one final first-class match for Sussex in the 1934 County Championship against Kent, scoring 69 in his final match. Described in his Wisden obituary as a \\"good bat and an especially skilful cutter\\", Wilson scored 546 runs at an average of 19.50, with three half centuries and a single aforementioned century. Additionally described in Wisden as having taken \\"hundreds of wickets in minor cricket with slow flighted leg-breaks\\", Wilson was less successful in first-class cricket, bowling 37 overs and taking two wickets for Sussex and one for the Gentlemen of the South, at an overall bowling average of 73.66.

The show, which is written, directed and executively produced by Greenberg, centers on a young man \\"learning the ways of the world from the older and more experienced men in his short-term rental complex.\\" Dominic Patten from Deadline Hollywood reported that We Are Men had been around for a few years, before it was picked up. Chris Smith was cast as Carter Thomas, the young man who befriends a group of divorced men, while Kal Penn was cast as Gil Bartis. On August 15, 2012, it was announced that Tony Shalhoub would play Frank, who is \\"a four-time divorc√© who still fancies himself a ladies man\\". Shortly after, Australian actress Rebecca Breeds joined the cast as Frank's daughter. Filming of the pilot episode was pushed back to January 2013, after casting of the fourth male lead stalled. The role of Stuart was eventually filled by Jerry O'Connell. Episodes Critical reception We Are Men was panned by critics. Metacritic gave the show an aggregate rating of 33/100; similarly Rotten Tomatoes currently has a rating of 4% (rotten) for the program. Melissa Maers of Entertainment Weekly said that the show was \\"The male version of Sex and the City with more shirtless scenes (courtesy of Jerry O'Connell) and way less wit\\", while The Hollywood Reporter was much more harsh, saying ‚Äú‚ÄòWe Are Men‚Äô is about four single guys you wouldn't ever want to be around or be related to in any way ‚Ä¶ [it] made me feel stupid almost immediately and then bitter that I'd wasted the time.‚Äù The show failed to catch an audience and actually adversely affected other programming, especially the program 2 Broke Girls. The show got the lowest rating of any premiere on CBS and was axed after just two episodes, leaving the remaining 9 episodes that were produced unaired.

Celed√≥n is a symbol of the villager native of Alava. Wearing a beret and dressed in a traditional blouse, always accompanied by an umbrella, the personage has been located by the historians in diverse environments. This man or personage opens the holidays of Vitoria-Gasteiz in the Basque province of Araba-√Ålava in Spain.  History  Celed√≥n's descent was invented in 1957 by a group of Vitorians anxious to offer the city a particular stamp. They created the decrease of the personage to establish an analogy between the doll and the peasants of the province who were approaching the city to celebrate the holidays. The tradition affirms that it was born in Zalduondo, a small village of Alava, which in today give wine. They say that the personage was called Juan Celedonio de Anzola. Other investigators aim that Celed√≥n was a brigadier of the Army Carlist born in Andagoya, whose name was Celed√≥n Aguiluz. Since the personage of Celed√≥n was created in 1957, four people have given the body to the legend: Jose Luis Isasi, who supported the title for 22 years, Enrique Oribe, who substituted in 1976, I√±aki Landa, who personified the villager of Zalduondo from 1980 until 2000, and Gorka Ortiz Urbina that made a d√©but as Celed√≥n in 2001. There is a large community of Celedon in Chile, the most well known are the Celedon Mardones.  Celedonio Alzola  In hindsight, Celed√≥n's \\"flight\\" known by the people that live in Vitoria-Gasteiz, remains the passion for the Virgen Blanca Festivities of a villager of Zalduondo in the end of the 18th century. He was called Celedonio Alzola and apparently, was proclaimed as a protagonist of the holidays as soon as he got to Vitoria. He used to invite all the persons to go with him and to enjoy all together the celebrations and the holidays of the city. It is also believed that Celedonio lived in a street called \\"The Shoe Store Street\\" between 1796 and 1866 and was a very famous bricklayer that used to go to bars with his friends. In 1957, a group of blouses designed the descent of a doll from the belfry of the Church of San Miguel up to the New Square to give the beginning of the holidays of the Virgen Blanca. The first descent was a fail so they decided to get a person to solve the problem and the idea was a success. The person who appeared was Jose Luis Isasi, in the Town hall of Vitoria. Since then only four people have been chosen by the squads of blouses and neskas who have personified Celed√≥n or the villager of Zalduondo.  50th anniversary of the descent of the Celed√≥n  2007 was the 50th anniversary of the descent of Celed√≥n, which went down for the first time in the year 1957. In his first descent the rope broke, although this fact did not prevent Isasi going out to the balcony and giving the beginning to the holidays. On the 50th anniversary Gorka Ortiz de Urbina and I√±aki Landa made an emotive opening procession together, and in the balcony they resembled Isasi, who was away because of a serious disease. Nowadays in the \\"balconada\\" of San Miguel it is possible to see Celed√≥n's sculpture; this sculpture takes the face of Jose Luis Isasi Moltalb√°n, the first Celed√≥n and one of the creators of Celed√≥n's figure.

The demands of composition of his new symphony, the Rhenish Symphony, leads to tension between him and Clara. A little later Brahms introduces a couple of his own compositions to the Schumanns and they are impressed by his compositional and pianistic skills. Allowing him to stay with them, Brahms lovingly cares for their children. Robert's work on the Rhenish Symphony continues to suffers and he struggles with an addiction to the drug laudanum, on which he is soon dependent. There is further tension between him and his wife, who is expecting another child. Shortly after the successful premiere of the Rhenish Symphony, Schumann becomes acquainted with Dr. Richartz who offers him help with his health problems. Schumann sees the talented Brahms as his successor, but Brahms leaves the Schumann household when he realizes that he feels more than just friendship for Clara. Additionally the Schumanns are troubled with financial problems. Robert tries in vain to take his own life, by jumping into the River Rhine, but accepts the offer of Dr. Richartz to be a patient at his sanatorium at Endenich in Bonn.

The Gentlemen were short of players on the second day, having used substitute fielders on the first day, with Fender calling upon his uncle to make up the numbers. It rained on both the second and third days of the match, with no play possible, meaning Herbert has the rare distinction of having never taken to the field during his first-class career, having arrived at the ground on day two, he also never saw a ball bowled. He died at Hove, Sussex on 24 January 1958.

I'll Dry is the debut and only studio album from English group Everyday People. Produced by Stewart Levine, it was released in 1990 by SBK Records. Background Everyday People were formed in 1990 by vocalist Desi Campbell, bassist Shaun Ward and guitarist Lloyd Richards. Having signed to the newly established record label SBK, the band flew out to Bearsville, New York to record their debut album with Stewart Levine as producer. In a 1990 interview, Ward said: \\"It was the same studio in which the Isley brothers cut all their big records, which made it quite special for us.\\" All songs on the album were original songs written by the group, although \\"Second Nature\\" featured a co-writing credit to Ward's brother Michael Ward as well. You Wash... I'll Dry was released in 1990 by SBK. It was not a commercial success, except in Germany, where the album peaked at No. 26. During the year, the band toured Europe extensively, however the minor success caused the band to dissolve. The album spawned five singles. The first was \\"Headline News\\" gained some minor interest, reaching No. 99 in the UK, No. 83 in the Netherlands and No. 53 in Germany. \\"I Guess It Doesn't Matter\\" followed as the second single and was the band's most successful release. The song peaked at No. 93 in the UK, No. 24 in Switzerland and No. 34 in Germany. \\"This Kind of Woman\\" failed to make any national impact. The fourth single \\"Second Nature\\" managed to peak at No. 54 in Germany. \\"Place in the Sun\\", the final single, failed to chart. Speaking of working with Levine, Campbell said: \\"We'd had enough experience with producers and would really have preferred to do it ourselves. But Stewart didn't want to change a thing. He told us at the beginning that all he wanted to do was enhance what we already had, and that's exactly how it turned out. After listening to some other guy, who said he hoped we didn't mind if he changed the odd chorus here and there it was great relief!\\" Ward added: \\"The biggest relief for us was the relaxation Stewart engendered in the studio. In England you get the feeling of fear: Look guys were spending ¬£1000 a day here, so lets get it done. Stewart wasn't like that at all. As long as we got something down on tape by the end of the day, he was happy. It never felt like work at any time.\\" Release The album was released on vinyl and CD across Europe. The CD version was purposely issued for the UK and Europe, while the LP was released across Europe in places such as Germany, Italy and Spain. Critical reception Upon release, Blues & Soul commented: \\"Although this album might not be of instant appeal to many, Everyday People have put together an album that revisits the almost sadly forgotten artform of \\"real\\" music, as in musicians actually playing instruments. This said, [they] have gone off on their own tangent coming up with their brand of unaffected gritty, raw R&B; with guitars, Hammond organs, live basses, (real) drums, etc firing on all cylinders.\\" Peter Kinghorn of the Newcastle Evening Chronicle commented: \\"Their soulful approach works best on the brass-punctuated \\"Make Him Wait\\", the slow, deliberate \\"I Guess It Doesn't Matter\\", Motown-style \\"Good as Gold\\", catchy \\"Place in the Sun\\" and punchy \\"Let Someone Love You\\".\\" CD Review felt the band had \\"evolved a sound that is a mix of styles and influences\\", adding: \\"As such, each track on the band's debut, You Wash.. .I'll Dry, comes across as wholly familiar, yet somehow fashions an identity all its own.\\" Tom Harrison of The Province stated: \\"Inevitably comes a return to values once held so dear in soul and R&B; circles - great songs, singing and spirit. These come dressed up in contemporary production considerations, but the intent is there and the lack of pretension is an unspoken plus.\\" Scott Benarde of The Palm Beach Post wrote: \\"Bursting with energy and passion, this fusion of pop, soul and R&B; is one of the sleeper records of the year. The singing is sharp and imploring. The rhythms pump and explode, propelling the soaring melodies.\\" Track listing Personnel * Desi Campbell - lead vocals * Lloyd T.

He created some 3,000‚Äì4,000 works, including as a collaborator of the Zwinger workshop.  Life  Georg Wrba was born in Munich in 1872, the son of a smith. His younger brother Max Wrba became an architect in Dresden. Wrba began his training with Jakob Bradl the Elder and his son Jakob Bradl the Younger. From 1891 to 1896 he studied at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste M√ºnchen under Syrius Eberle.Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste M√ºnchen, matriculation register After some time spent in Italy (with Egon Rheinberger), a trip made possible by a travel award from Prince Regent Luitpold, he settled in Munich as an independent sculptor in 1897 and became director of the city's school of sculpture. In 1906 and 1907 he worked in Berlin, where he created sculptures for buildings for the architects Ludwig Hoffmann and Alfred Messel. Wrba then moved to Dresden, where from 1907 to 1930 he taught at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. He brought the Dresden school of sculpture into contact with the reforming ideas of the Deutscher Werkbund and was a founding member of the Dresden Artists' Association, known as \\"Die Zunft\\" (\\"The Guild\\"). The basic aim of the \\"Werkbund\\", and also of \\"Die Zunft\\", was to achieve a collaboration between and integration of various forms of art, rejecting ornamentation for its own sake: painting and sculpture were to form integral parts of architecture. In Dresden he made, among many other works, the Marie Gey Fountain near the Dresden Hauptbahnhof in the S√ºdvorstadt, which was donated by a Dr. Heinze for his wife, a student at the Kunstakademie, who had died young. In 1910 Wrba agreed a contract for the restoration and completion of the missing parts of the Zwinger, for which he directed the work of 53 sculptors from 1911 to 1933, and himself created many groups of figures modelled from the life. Wrba died on 9 January 1939 in Dresden, where a street is named after him. He is buried in the Munich Waldfriedhof.  Selected works  Georg Wrba's works principally comprise sculptures for buildings and fountains, and small-scale figures. * 1899: Seal Fountain (Seehund-Brunnen) (bronze), Berlin, in the inner courtyard of the Rudolf Virchow Clinic * 1899: sculptural decoration on the fountain of the Bismarck Tower (Bismarckturm) on the Starnberger SeeBismarkturm am Starnberger See * c. 1900: figures and carvings in St. Maximilian's Church, MunichFigures and carvings in St. Maximilian's Church, Munich * 1900: Diana auf der Hirschkuh (\\"Diana on a Doe\\"), Kunsthalle Bremen * 1900: Europa auf dem Stier (\\"Europa on the Bull\\"), Kunsthalle Bremen * 1902: Warriors' Fountain (Kriegerbrunnen) in N√∂rdlingen * 1902: fa√ßade decoration on the extension building of the Kunsthalle Bremen * 1905: St. Mang Fountain in Kempten * 1905: marble bust of Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria * 1906: equestrian statue of Otto I von Wittelsbach, Wittelsbach Bridge, M√ºnchen * 1906: Chicken Fountain (Hennebrunnen) in Aschersleben * 1906‚Äì1908: putti for the Villa Wollner in Dresden * 1906‚Äì1911: contributions to the decorative building sculptures on the Altes Stadthaus in Berlin, including \\"Allegories of the Civic Virtues\\" and the decor of the banqueting hall (B√§rensaal ‚Äì \\"Bears' Hall\\")Return of the bear to the banqueting hall of the Stadthaus Berlin * 1907: allegorical bronze group on top of the Charlottenburg Gate by the Charlottenburg Bridge, Berlin (melted down)Restoration of the Charlottenburg Gate in Berlin * 1907: two marble portals with allegories in the entrance hall of the Kaufhaus des Westens in Berlin * 1907: portraits of Georg Treu, Hans Erlwein, Otto Gussmann, Cornelius Gurlitt, Fritz Schumacher, Martin D√ºlfer * 1908: altar figure of \\"The Good Shepherd\\" in the Church of the Reconciliation, Dresden * 1909: Bismarck Fountain on the market place in Arnstadt * 1910: group of \\"Bacchus on a Drunken Donkey\\" and two sitting bronze lions with shields on the east side, and the Hietzig Fountain on the west side, of the Neues Rathaus in DresdenKunst im √∂ffentlichen Raum (brochure produced by the Dresden City Council) 1996 * 1910: figure of Aphrodite on the Marie Gey Fountain in the Friedrich-List-Platz in Dresden * 1910: relief of \\"Siegfried's Entrance into Worms\\" on the Cornelianum in WormsGernot Schnellbacher: Nibelungen-Denkm√§ler in Worms (with a picture of the Nibelungen relief on the Cornelianum) * 1910: bronze lions in front of the Neues Rathaus in Dresden * 1911: Rathaus Fountain at the Neues Rathaus in Dresden * 1912/1913: contributions to the M√§rchenbrunnen in the Volkspark Friedrichshain in Friedrichshain, Berlin * 1911‚Äì1933: artistic director of the restoration works on the Zwinger, Dresden * 1917: \\"Large Bathing Figures\\" (Gro√üe Badende) on a mussel shell (bronze) for a country house in Klein Flottbek;
