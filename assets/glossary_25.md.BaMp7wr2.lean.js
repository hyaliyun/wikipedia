In the mid-1970s, FM radio was growing in popularity and FM stations across the country which were up to this point more of a novelty band was now being embraced for its clarity and ability to broadcast a stereo sound. WLFQ (103.9) in Crawfordsville signed-on with a country format in June 1974, directing its programming to Lafayette. WASK-FM decided to make the change to country in September 1974. It became known as \\"Indiana Country FM 105\\" utilizing Bill Robinson's \\"Music Works\\" automated radio programming service. WASK-FM began using the slogan \\"K 105\\" in the summer of 1983 shortly after being acquired by Duchossois Communications. It retained its country music format and gradually transitioned to completely live/local programming over the next two years. Former air personalities on K 105 include Ellen K., later known for her work with Rick Dees on KIIS Los Angeles, and Dean McNeil who became the program director of US-99 (WUSN) Chicago. In 1994, as a result of a pending move to place a news/talk simulcast on 1450 WASK and WASK Incorporated's newly acquired WIIZ (98.7), K 105 changed call letters to WKOA. The station first achieved its #1 ranking in the fall of 1989 and has consistently ranked #1 since, according to Lafayette's Arbitron ratings. In 2006, the station, along with sister station WASK-AM/FM, shut down its long-standing news department. On March 17, 2008 K105 and sister station WASK 98.7 formed a partnership with WLFI TV 18 to provide news content. In early April 2010, K105 started streaming online at . Schurz Communications announced on September 14, 2015 that it would exit broadcasting and sell its television and radio stations, including WKOA, to Gray Television for $442.5 million. Though Gray initially intended to keep Schurz' radio stations, on November 2, it announced that Neuhoff Communications would acquire WKOA and Schurz' other Lafayette radio stations for $8 million.

Biography Mathilde Galland was born in Como, Italy to a Swiss Protestant father and Italian Roman Catholic mother. She received her PhD in Biology from the University of Geneva, Switzerland, in 1953. In 1948, she married David Danon, an Israeli man she met at University of Geneva School of Medicine. She converted to Judaism before marriage. They had a daughter and shortly thereafter relocated to Israel. While living in Switzerland, she assisted members of the Irgun in their efforts to purchase arms from former French resistance members, prior to Israel's independence. After moving to the U.S., she was also very active in collecting donations for Israel. Medical research career From 1953 to 1959, she pursued research in cytogenetics and cancer-causing viruses at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where she was a member of the team that first developed a method for the prenatal determination of sex. After her divorce, she moved to New York and joined the research staff of Cornell University Medical School, following her 1958 marriage to Arthur B. Krim — a New York attorney, head of United Artists, later founder of Orion Pictures, active member of the Democratic Party, and advisor to Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. On May 19, 1962, the Krims hosted an exclusive celebrity-filled soirée at their home following the 45th birthday party for President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, including Marilyn Monroe. During the course of their marriage, Arthur and Mathilde Krim were very active in the American civil rights movement, the movements for independence in Rhodesia and South Africa, the gay rights movement, and in numerous other civil liberties and human rights movements. The Krims hosting John F. Kennedy (center) in 1962 In 1962, Krim became a research scientist at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research and, from 1981 to 1985, she was the director of its interferon lab. Until recently, she held an academic appointment as Adjunct Professor of Public Health and Management at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. Soon after the first cases of what would later be called AIDS were reported in 1981, Krim recognized that this new disease raised grave scientific and medical questions and that it might have important socio- political consequences. She dedicated herself to increasing the public's awareness of AIDS and to a better understanding of its cause, its modes of transmission, and its epidemiologic pattern. Contributing to the fight against AIDS, she established AIDS Medical Foundation in 1983. Later the Foundation merged with a similar organization and called the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR). With Elizabeth Taylor, she founded the American Foundation for AIDS Research contributing generous amounts of her own funds and lending her considerable skills to raising awareness about AIDS and raising funds for AIDS research. She continued working on behalf of AIDS awareness through AmfAR. Awards and recognition Krim was awarded 16 doctorates honoris causa and has received numerous other honors and distinctions. In August 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, in recognition of her \\"extraordinary compassion and commitment\\". In 2003, Krim received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

The road of Villers-le-Lac (D215) along the Doubs (river). Geography This little city is situated in a widening of the Doubs river valley. The proximity of Switzerland (11 km to Le Locle, 21 km to La Chaux-de-Fonds) gives jobs to trans-border workers, as well as providing clientele for the businesses of the Morteau valley. History The Roman expansion (200 BCE, 100 CE) began the decline of the Celts. At the Battle of Alesia, at the side of Arvernes, there were an equal number of Mandubiens, the people of Doubs. They were the best riders of Vercingetorix. =Early Middle Ages= At the end of the Roman Empire, the Alamanni invaded the region, followed by the Burgundians. The region was influenced by the Normans, the Hungarian descendants of the Huns, the Sarrasins. These Arabs stopped by Charles Martel in 732, had followed the valley of the river Saône. Locally, their name was given to the tiny village of Sarrazins above Montlebon. =Middle Ages= In 1105 the name of Morteau appeared for the first time officially. The name of Franche-Comté, however, did not appear until 1366. A half dozen Benedictine monks of the Cluny order arrived at this time to clear the mountains. They stayed with a resident of the Mondey area and quickly hired workers. They brought in whole families into five districts, each now cities in their own right: Morteau, Villers-le-Lac, Montlebon and Grand'Combe- Châteleu. Morteau had a feudal castle built on the eastern side of Mondey, it overlooked the ancient Celtic road which linked Besançon to Switzerland. The plague killed two thirds of the valley's inhabitants in 1349. The population was rebuilt by immigrants from the canton of Fribourg and the Aoste valley. =Fires= Over eight centuries, seventeen major fires occurred in Morteau, the worst in 1639, 1683, 1702, 1849 and 1865. Economy For many centuries, livestock have formed a mainstay of the economy. It is impossible to give a precise origin to the well known montbéliarde breed since all of the livestock in central Europe have similar characteristics and transborder exchanges were always common. One can see white cattle with red stops in certain provinces of the Czech and Slovak republics similar to those from Franche-Comté. The traditional smoked sausages, Morteau Sausage for example, as well as the drinks (syrups and lemonades Rième) and candies (chocolates and caramels Klaus) have made the city renowned. Smoked \\"Saucisse de Morteau\\" has to meet a long list of demanding criteria, such as the origin of the meat, how the animals have been fed with, the type of wood that has been used to smoke the sausages,the specific model of chimney. It also has to be produced in Franche- Comté only. It has recently obtained even more juridical protection in order to maintain the high quality of the product on a long term basis. Every August, a two-day celebration takes place into town, in order to determine the \\"Sausage Gold Award\\", and it has been ranked among the top three stupidest and most pointless village fete of the country, by a famous weekly French magazine. Watchmaking was for many years the principal industry of the region. In 1680, a young smith from Sagne repaired an imported English watch and decided to copy it. The watchmaker Pequignet is based in Morteau. Population Sights * Morteau has two very nice chateaus: the Château Pertusier and the current city hall. * The Château Pertusier was built in 1576 by the Cuche family. During the Swedish attack in 1639, the tower at the top of the winding staircase caught fire and the western side was shot at. One can still see the bullet scars of the biscayens Swedes. The Bole family was then the owner. During the French Revolution, a lawyer from Besançon, Jean-Charles Pertusier bought the building, which had become national property, for a sum of 900 987 pounds. The house and its grounds were bought by the commune in 1935. This building is now one of the few examples of Renaissance Architecture in the Haut-Doubs. * The city hall was built in 1590 by the Fauche family. Occupied by the officers of Saxe-Weimar, it did not suffer during the war and passed into the hands of the Benedictines, then into those of the Roussel brothers. The commune of Morteau acquired the property in 1793. It now holds some of the municipal offices as well as the famous Black Book, kept safe in the mayor's office. In 1454, a city notary wrote in this book the records of the entire priory. It contains 54 charters from 1188 to 1514, letters of charter, sentences, arrests and conventions. Brought to Switzerland during the Swedish invasion, it was recovered intact after the war. Notable * The train station in the city is the site of various scenes from the film Monsieur Batignole starring Gérard Jugnot and Damien Jouillerot (who is from the region); * It is the site of several scenes from the film L'Adversaire with Daniel Auteuil; * Laurence Semonin, known as \\"Madeleine Proust\\", is from Arces, a hamlet of Morteau; * The mathematician Jean Claude Bouquet (1819–1885) was from Morteau.

Like most New Zealand state secondary schools built in the 1960s, Glendowie College was built to the Nelson Two- Storey standard plan, with its two-storey H-shaped general classroom blocks. Education Glendowie College offers the National Certificate of Educational Achievement as its national qualification standard. An Advanced Learning Program is available in years 9 and 10 for highly intelligent students. Also, exceptionally gifted students are given the opportunity to accelerate into classes a year or two years ahead of their peers in order to progress their learning. For students Year 9-10 English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, P.E and Health are compulsory with students being able to choose from 4 options outside of these subjects. Those options are Art, Drama, Dance, Music, Chinese, German, Maori and Spanish. English is compulsory up until Year 12 and Math is only compulsory till year 11, besides these subjects students from year 11 onwards are allowed to choose six subjects (including English) in year 12 and five subjects in year 13. The Education Review Office has said that students are progressing and achieving very well. Sport Glendowie College offers a range of sporting opportunities. Glendowie College also participates in the top level of School Rowing in New Zealand. It takes part in the annual Rowing Secondary School Championship, The Maadi Cup.

Between 1961 and 2017 the four houses consisted of Asia, Europe, America and Pacific, named after four continents. At the conclusion of 2017, four new houses were created, taking their names from famous Māori myths and legends. The four houses became Rūaumoko (God of Volcanoes), Tāne Mahuta (Lord of the Forest), Tangaroa (God of the Sea) and Tāwhirimātea (God of Weather). Upon joining Glendowie College future students are assigned one of the four houses randomly. If the student has a sibling at the college, past or present, they will likely be assigned that house for ease of communication between pastoral staff and parents. 50th Jubilee On 1, 2 and 3 April 2011, Glendowie College held many events to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the school's founding.

As of April 2007, it is the oldest radio station in English Canada; second oldest overall. On the air since May 1, 1922. Originally ran as Top-40 format, today it's an \\"Oldies\\" radio station. In 1927, CHML, (900 on the AM dial), began operations as a response to censorship of political discussions by Hamilton's first radio station, CKOC. The original owners were Maple Leaf Radio Company, and the \\"HML\\" in the callsign stood for \\"Hamilton Maple Leaf\\". CHML's broadcast station is on Main Street West in the Lower City. Originally, CKOC's broadcast from the corner of King William and John Streets and was an offshoot of the Wentworth Radio and Supply Company owned by Herb Slack. He figured he could sell more radios if he also owned a radio station and in the spring of 1922 the station became only the third radio station in all of Canada. Other broadcast locations over the years for CKOC include, the 11th floor of the Royal Connaught Hotel in the downtown core, the Lister Block building on James & King Williams Streets and a studio on Garfield Avenue near King & Sherman Avenue North.

Weather helm is the opposite of lee helm. It is generally less troublesome than lee helm. Overview Weather helm is the result of a leeward and aft shift of a vessel's vector center of effort (the direction to which the force generated by the sails is pushing). This shift is caused by excess pressure on the mainsail, which overpowers the windward lateral resistance generated by the jib (or other head sail) and keel or centerboard. This results in an imbalance of force at the stern from windward, and the craft pivots about the center of drag (often near the center of the keel or centerboard), causing the bow to drive windward. Weather helm does not only result from an overpowered main; when a vessel is heeling to leeward, the lee side of the hull is further submerged than the weather side, increasing its drag. This creates a force (a turning moment) that pushes the bow to weather. As both an overpowered main and heavy heel occur in the same circumstances, it is sometimes difficult to determine the source of weather helm. While weather helm occurs on any size of vessel, but the physical movement of the craft is often more severe for vessels without a keel. This is a result of the smaller blade being very quickly overpowered by the relatively larger mainsail. In keelboats, despite the fact that weather helm is not as readily felt, it can be just as detrimental, as the lateral drag against the blade still exists, along with the need to pull the rudder to an undesirable position (see Mitigation). A slight amount of weather helm is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both from the standpoint of the \\"feel\\" of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm.\\" Some sailors believe that a small amount of weather helm is good, that the rudder at a small angle of attack contributes to the total lift generated by the boat. I contend that the rudder is nothing more than a brake which is applied each and every time it is used. Ideally one wants the rudder to simply follow the boat and not develop any lift and minimal drag.\\" Barney Harris The Complete Guide to Albacore Sailing http://usaa.albacore.org/members/techniques Weather helm also provides a form of dead man's switch--the boat stops safely in irons if the helm is released for a length of time.  Mitigation  Any action that reduces the angle of heel of a boat that is reaching or beating to windward will help reduce weather helm. Racing sailors use their body weight to bring the boat to a more upright position. Reducing or reefing the total sail area will have the same effect and, counter-intuitively, many boats will sail faster with less sail in a stiff breeze once heel and weather helm have been reduced, due to the reduction in underwater drag (see Over-canvassed sailing). Easing the sheets on aft-most sails, such as the mainsail in a sloop or cutter can have an immediate effect, especially to help with maneuvering. Moving or increasing sail area forward can also help, for example by raising the jib (and maybe lowering the staysail) on a cutter. Sailing off the wind, weather helm may be caused by the imbalance due to fore-and-aft sails all being sheeted out on the same (leeward) side of the boat. Raising a spinnaker or poling out a headsail to windward with a whisker pole can help. Yachts making ocean trade wind crossings have rigged 'twins' - double headsails poled out to opposite sides from the same forestay for extended downwind passages without a mainsail. Square rigged sails also provide relatively symmetric drive off the wind. As weather helm requires pulling the rudder through the water at an angle to the intended course, it produces drag and impedes the boat's progress through the water. In the book \\"Sailing Illustrated\\", Patrick M. Royce defines weather helm as simply a \\"heeling sailboat wanting to come head to wind.\\" The principle is the same whether the vessel is steered by tiller or wheel; turning the wheel leeward gives the same rudder effect as pulling a tiller windward.  Discussion  The fundamental cause of \\"helm\\", be it weather or lee, is the differential between the center of effort of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull. If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, a weather helm, the tendency of the vessel to want to turn into the wind, or to weather-vane, will result. If the situation is reversed, with the center of pressure forward of the center of resistance of the hull, a \\"lee\\" helm will result, which is generally considered undesirable, if not dangerous. Too much of either helm is not good, since it forces the helmsman to hold the rudder deflected to counter it, thus inducing extra drag beyond what a vessel with neutral or minimal helm would experience. See Sailing Theory and Practice by C.A. Marchaj for a mathematical analysis of the dynamics of weather helm.

He was an instrumental figure in the creation and dissemination of classical dance and ballet as an American art form. A child of the American Midwest during the Great Depression, he studied under George Balanchine and led the Kansas City Ballet in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1980 to 1995. Early life Born in Canton, Ohio on February 27, 1914, Bolender grew up in a family in which the arts, music and theater in particular, were an important part of life. The extremely lively child—one of four—was early on dubbed the dancer of the family and his physical energy channeled in lessons in acrobatic tap. In 1931, when he was 17, Bolender went to New York, which he said in an interview in 2002 seemed to him like a “kind of heaven”, to study theatrical dance. In 1933 he moved to New York for good, taking up full-time residence there at about the same time George Balanchine arrived in this country. Early years of dance Attendance at a concert by Mary Wigman led Bolender to Hanya Holm, who he said later saved him from bad teaching. Social acquaintance with Balanchine, however, made a strong impression. Under Balanchine’s supervision, Bolender studied at the fledgling School of American Ballet with such Russian teachers as Pierre Vladimiroff, Felia Dubrovska, Anatole Oboukhoff and Ludmilla Schollar. He also trained with Muriel Stuart and, pursuing a strong interest in modern dance, studied with Louis Horst and Harald Kreutzberg. The two greatest influences on his choreography, Bolender was to say later, were Wigman and Uday Shankar, both of whom he saw perform in New York in the early thirties, along with Kreutzberg. Asked why he became a ballet dancer, Bolender said simply it was the Depression and he needed a job. As a dancer, Bolender had an unusually long career, lasting from 1936 to 1972 when he performed onstage for the last time in New York City Ballet’s Stravinsky Festival, for which he also choreographed two pieces, Serenade in A and Piano-Rag-Music. Not only was he a member of every permutation of the company that became New York City Ballet, he also danced with Littlefield Ballet in the late thirties, performing in Catherine Littlefield’s Barn Dance and the first American Sleeping Beauty. He performed with Les Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo for one season (1945-46) and with Ballet Theatre for four months in 1944 before being sidelined with an injury. Bolender was a versatile dancer, originating roles in the work of Balanchine — most notably Four Temperaments, Renard, and Agon — and in much of the choreography of Jerome Robbins as well. In Lew Christensen’s work, he originated the State Trooper in Filling Station and Alias in Billy the Kid. Critic and historian Doris Hering, writing in the International Dictionary of the Ballet calls him “a superb comedian with a penchant for high camp.” Describing him in Jerome Robbins’ The Concert, she writes: “[he] was a henpecked husband who constantly escaped into daydreams of sexual conquest. Clad in a vest and long underwear and chewing on a huge cigar, he was the prototype of ... J. Walter Mitty.” Longtime New York City Ballet observer Robert Garis said of him in Agon, “[his] easy wit and charm in the first pas de trois seem unrecapturable” (ibid.) Mother Goose Suite, made in 1943, was the first of some three dozen ballets Bolender made in the course of his long career, eleven of them for New York City Ballet. Bolender’s choreography is in the repertoires of Kansas City Ballet, New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, San Francisco Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, The Joffrey Ballet, and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. His best known works, both of which are still in active repertoire, are Souvenirs and The Still Point, both made in 1955. Later career Todd Bolender's illustrious career allotted him the opportunity to work and cultivate relationships with Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and Samuel Barber. While the bulk of his choreography was for ballet companies, Bolender also choreographed for musical theater, opera and television, starting in 1952 with Time Remembered for Albi Marre Productions. In 1969, he choreographed The Conquering Hero, followed by Cry for Us All in 1970. In Turkey, where he worked in the seventies, Bolender choreographed My Fair Lady, Fiddler on the Roof, Man of La Mancha, and Showboat. In Kansas City, he choreographed for many operas, including Samson and Delilah for which the dancing got a better review than the singing. Bolender taught throughout his career in New York and as a guest teacher all over the United States as well as in Turkey, Japan, Austria, and Germany. From 1963 to 1966, he was ballet director for the Cologne Opera House and from 1966-69 he filled the same role in Frankfurt. With Janet Reed he was a founding director of Pacific Northwest Ballet in 1975 and for three years starting in 1977 he was ballet director in the Atatürk Opera House. Career in Kansas City Todd Bolender’s appointment as Artistic Director in the winter of 1981 opened a new chapter of opportunity for the Kansas City Ballet. Confident that a broader community support for classical ballet might be found, Bolender had a vision to build a company, a repertoire, and a school in the nation's heartland. Bolender did all three and at an age when most people have retired Bolender became Artistic Director Emeritus in 1996 when he retired from Kansas City Ballet and William Whitener took over as Artistic Director. In the fall of 1997, Bolender was invited to New York by the George Balanchine Foundation to officially document for videotape the choreography of the solo that Balanchine created for him in The Four Temperaments. Bolender who created the role of the Fox in the original 1947 production of Renard, resurrected this piece, which had initially vanished for a half century, in 2001 for Kansas City Ballet. Bolender has built a foundation of quality and grand proportion, scarcely imaginable in 1981 and now can enjoy the fruits of his own continuing creativity. He was active in the preservation of Balanchine’s work, coaching dancers in his roles in the repertoire for the Balanchine Foundation’s Film Archive and reconstructing Renard for the Kansas City Ballet in 1998 as part of the Stravinsky Festival. In 2006, Bolender was awarded the Dance Magazine Award for his lifetime achievement in dance. Just weeks before he was to receive the award, Bolender died on October 12, 2006 at age 92 from complications related to a stroke. The Todd Bolender Center for Dance and Creativity opened on August 26, 2011. The building is the new home for the Kansas City Ballet and the Ballet School. After 34 successful years, Kansas City Ballet performed its final Nutcracker featuring choreography by Todd Bolender during the 2014 winter season.

It is situated on the east coast of a bay named Baird Bay which opens into the north end of Anxious Bay. The locality is named after the nearby bay which is named after James Baird, who settled on the shores of Anxious Bay in 1850 before being speared by local Aboriginals on 2 November 1850. The bay was known as Beard's Bay until 5 December 1940 when it was renamed to Baird Bay by proclamation. Although the township is small, Baird Bay has garnered considerable tourist attention due to its Australian sea lion colony, with local tour guides giving interactive swimming sessions with the sea lions and dolphins. This has become one of the main tourist attractions on the Eyre Peninsula. The isolated town has very limited facilities, with only a few houses, a camping ground and boat ramp. The nearest town for supplies is Streaky Bay, around away. The remote waters of Baird Bay are also excellent for recreational fishing, as well as a number of other water based activities such scuba diving and snorkelling. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Baird Bay had a population of 3 people.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19235. Lyrics The most common modern form of the poem is: :Round and round the garden :Like a teddy bear; :One step, two step, :Tickle you under there! Origins The rhyme was first collected in Britain in the late 1940s. Since teddy bears did not come into vogue until the twentieth century it is unlikely to be any older than that in its current form, but Iona and Peter Opie speculated that it might be a version of an older rhyme, collected 1945-9, 'Round about there, went a little hare', with the lyrics: :Round about there :Sat a little hare :The bow-wows came and chased him ::Right up there! An Irish version goes: :Round and round the racecourse :Catch a little hare :One step, two steps :Thickly under there! : A South African version goes: :Round and round the mulberry bush :Like a teddy bear :One step, two step :Tickly under there! A Scottish version goes: :Round and round the garden :Like a wee mouse :Up the stair, up the stair :And in the wee house An English version goes: :Round and round the garden :Like a teddy bear :One step, two step :tickle under there Accompanying actions The nursery rhyme is accompanied by various actions, by the adult on the child or the child on the adult.

Bunraku Bay Puppet Troupe (known since 2011 as \\"Bunraku Bay Puppet Theater\\") is an American puppet troupe that performs the traditional Japanese puppet drama commonly known as ningyō jōruri or Bunraku. Based in Columbia, Missouri, the Troupe is directed by J. Martin Holman, professor of Japanese language, literature, and theater at the University of Missouri, and the first non-Japanese to train and perform in the traditional puppet theater in Japan. The original puppeteers of Bunraku Bay Puppet Troupe were trained in Japan by members of three traditional Bunraku puppet troupes: the Tonda Puppet Troupe, founded in the 1830s in Shiga Prefecture, Japan; and the 300-year-old Kuroda Puppet Troupe and the Imada Puppet Troupe of Iida, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. In recent years most members of Bunraku Bay have spent summers training with the Imada Puppet Troupe. The \\"bay\\" of the Troupe's name derives from its origins in the Bay State of Massachusetts, where it was founded in 2004, and the \\"bei\\" (pronounced \\"bay\\") of the Japanese word \\"Beikoku\\" (米国), which means America. The repertoire of Bunraku Bay consists largely of traditional pieces from Edo- period Japan and includes the Kotobuki Shiki Sanbasō 寿式三番叟 (pictured right), a lively, celebratory dance piece that opens a program of puppet theater; Yaoya Oshichi 八百屋お七 or Date Musume Koi no Higanoko 伊達娘恋火子, the story of a young woman who must climb a fire tower and sacrifice herself on a snowy night to save her lover; Hidakagawa Iriaizakura 日高川入相花王, a scene both comic and exciting in which a young woman's raging jealously transforms her into a demon serpent; the Lion Dance or shishimai 獅子舞, a puppet version of the dance performed frequently at festivals throughout Japan; The Dance of Ebisu or Ebisumai 恵比寿舞, a comic piece featuring the traditional fisherman deity; and Keisei Awa no Naruto 傾城阿波鳴門 (pictured left), the most widely performed puppet scene in Japan, in which a woman meets the daughter she had been forced to abandon as an infant ten years earlier. Bunraku Bay Puppet Troupe has performed at a range of venues, in more than 30 states across the United States, as well as in Japan and Canada. Notable performances include the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, the University of Chicago, the Orlando Puppetry Festival, the Japan Society in New York City, the Toronto Summer Music Festival, and the Iida Puppetry Festival in the city of Iida, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. The Troupe also performed for a segment on the NBC television comedy series, \\"Animal Practice\\", in which one of the characters visits the traditional puppet theater in Japan in a flashback scene. The Troupe also offers workshops on traditional Japanese puppetry and demonstrations of puppetry techniques. In October 2009, Bunraku Bay Puppet Troupe completed a US tour jointly with members of the Imada Puppet Theater, with performances at Willamette University in Oregon, the University of Colorado in Boulder, the University of Missouri in Columbia, and at Princeton University in New Jersey. Bunraku Bay again performed with the Imada Puppet Theater at the Toronto Summer Music Festival in Canada in July 2010. In April 2015, Bunraku Bay Puppet Theater was invited by the Consul General of Japan in Houston to present the auspicious \\"Kotobuki Shiki Sanbaso\\" at the opening ceremony of the Houston Japan Festival and offer performances during the two-day event, the theme of which was \\"Education through Authenticity.\\" In January 2017 the work of Bunraku Bay Puppet Theater was featured in \\"Kaiju Bunraku,\\" a film that was selected and screened at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. The 14-minute short, from the Borscht Corporation of Miami, Florida, depicts a couple, portrayed by puppets, who lives in village in pre-modern Japan that is beset by 20th-century movie monsters.

Education Slaby was born in Berlin, the son of a bookbinder. He studied at the Berlin Trade Academy, the predecessor of Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical Academy to study mechanical engineering and mathematics under Franz Reuleaux. He was employed as a housekeeper with the machine manufacturer Louis Schwartzkopff, leading to an interest in mechanical engineering. Slaby continued his studies at the University of Jena, and received his doctorate in mathematics.  Early research  Slaby taught mathematics and mechanics at a vocational school at Potsdam, where he conducted experiments on steam engines and petrol engines. He wrote his book Theorie der Gasmaschinen (Theory of Gas Engines), which had an important part in the development of Internal combustion engines. Slaby also studied with Heinrich Hertz. Electro-technology Berlin was at that time the center of electro-technology, with Werner von Siemens in a leading position. Siemens supported Slaby personally in his private studies. Slaby performed his Habilitation at the Berlin Trade Academy in 1876, and lectured on electrical motors, electrical telegraphy, and Electromechanics. In 1883, he became a tenured professor of electro-technology. In the meantime, the Charlottenburg Technical Academy had been renamed the Technical University of Berlin. Here, Slaby developed a program of theoretical lectures connected with practical work. With the generous support of an industry he established in 1844 which was an electro-technical laboratory,Chronicle of the Kgl. TH 1799–1899, pp. 190 ff making Berlin the most important training center for the recently developed field of electrical technology. Radio As a result of his personal friendship with the head of English telegraph administration, Sir William Henry Preece (1834–1917), Slaby participated with the help of his assistant Georg Graf von Arco from 1897 in Marconi's experiments with wireless telegraphy across the English Channel. He recognized immediately the meaning of this invention, and repeated the experiments in Berlin, leading to the development of essential kinetic and technical concepts. The Emperor and the military authorities were very interested by the result. The wireless telegraphy – trials took place first at the Technical University of Berlin, and then between Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow and the marine station Kongsnaes in Potsdam. On 7 October 1897, he established a 21-kilometer radio link between Schöneberg and Rangsdorf, a world record at the time. The following summer, he established a link between Berlin to Jüterbog with the end-points being over 60 km apart. Crucial improvements led to the success, not of spark gap transmission antennas as used by Marconi, but inductive antennas. Development of Telefunken Radio communications were also transmitted at several places, by Slaby at the AEG, by Marconi Wireless telegraph Co. and by Ferdinand Braun at Siemens & Halske. However Slaby's radiograms were rejected by Marconi station, because the licensing had forbidden this action. This untenable condition led to consolidation: in 1903 AEG and Siemens & Halske formed the \\"Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegrafen m. b. H. System Telefunken\\", known as Telefunken. Engagement for the Hochschule Slaby became both chairman of Verein Deutscher Ingenieure and in 1893 the first chairmen of VDE, and a personal audience with William II, German Emperor. Slaby gave lectures about technology in the Berlin Palace, and organized experimental lectures for the emperor at the TH Berlin. This accomplished the social recognition of engineers and the complete equal rights of the technical universities with the universities. Adolf Slaby became the first representative in 1898 of a TH to be a lifetime member in Prussian Herrenhaus. In 1906, Slaby retired to emeritus status. His successor was Ernst Orlich, a representative of the classical mathematical treatment of the problems of the theoretical electro-technology. Slaby was then named chairman of the board for the Akademischer Verein Hütte (Association of Students) a position he held until 18 January 1912. Memorials Charlottenburg (road of the 17.

Early career In his early career, Barry appeared in small roles in several movies starring Gene Autry, and was a featured performer in a touring Wild West Show. He gained fame as a host for a live Saturday morning and daily afternoon children's television show. Both were broadcast on television station WOOD-TV, the NBC affiliate in Grand Rapids, MI. Radio Barry was also well known to early rising factory workers in the Grand Rapids area, with his morning radio show on WOOD am 1300, which was simulcast on WOOD FM at 105.7. Barry had an encyclopedic knowledge of cowboy and American Indian lore. He started his morning show with a spirited yodeling cowboy song which he accompanied with an acoustic guitar. Barry shared stories of American Indian lore and cowboy legends, interspersed with recorded music. In his radio broadcasts, he spoke to listeners as if he were sitting at their kitchen tables. He often shared postcards from listeners on vacation, and saluted local listeners' birthdays and anniversaries. His programs were flexible rather than adhering to a strict format. Buckaroo Rodeo =Weekday broadcasts= On television, he hosted the Buckaroo Rodeo. Locally, he was as popular as Buffalo Bob or Captain Kangaroo. Initially he hosted the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday shows while Don Melvoin as Fireman Freddie covered Tuesdays and Thursdays. In time, Melvoin stepped away from his role and Barry became the Monday through Friday host. Barry used the Thunder and Lightning Polka from Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss, Jr., for his show's opening theme; he sang the Coopersville Yodel, live, at the close. During the Buckaroo Rodeo days, an audience of boys and girls sat in bleachers on the stage to watch Popeye cartoons and 3 Stooges shorts. Barry occasionally sang a cowboy song, did a rope or whip trick, or twirled his twin six guns. The sponsors provided candy, potato chips, and other snacks. Among gifts he received for being on the show were brass statuettes of Thunder, his horse. =Weekend programs= For a little while during the 1960s, Barry's show expanded to an hour on Saturday mornings on WOOD-TV 8, and featured a wider range of entertainment and games. The programs, with the pistol-packing cowboy and his white horse Thunder, ran for more than a decade from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s. The original Thunder died in a stable fire at some point during the show's run. Subsequent to the stable fire, the national network TV show named This is Your Life, hosted by Ralph Edwards, honored Barrys career. It was announced by Ralph Edwards at the show's conclusion, that enough money had been raised by the fans, allowing Barry to purchase his next horse, which Barry named Thunder II. Barry hosted the high-rated afternoon Popeye Theater (the original name of the show was the Buckaroo Rodeo), which featured repeated airings of The Three Stooges, and were often followed by admonitions from Barry, warning his children viewers not to try a particular dangerous Stooges stunt, such as hitting someone in the head with a hammer. Throughout the 1960s, Buck Barry's big Buick station wagon was well known among children in West Michigan. Gold in color, the Buick had fake wood sides with \\"BUCK BARRY\\" written in large cursive on both sides using real rope. The hood was adorned by a large pair of forward-pointing Texas longhorns. Part of the Barry show was a section called \\"Can Buck Do It?\\" where Barry attempted various feats, such as tearing a telephone book in half. Barry was known for his on- air flubs, stuttering, and malapropisms, often hopelessly but humorously mangling commercials for such long-time sponsors as BeMo Potato Chips. Retirement During his television years in Michigan, Barry was known for visiting and performing for children in local hospitals. Barry retired in the early 1970s to El Paso, Texas, where he lived for 25 years, and continued to perform occasionally. He died in 1997, preceded by his wife, Violet.

In 2007, it was merged into Norwalk Transit; local service in Whittier ended in 2011 during a series of service cuts. History Whitter is laid out in an oblong shape connected by only one major street, making crosstown trips difficult for residents without cars. In the early 1980s, local officials began agitating for local bus service in addition to existing Southern California Rapid Transit District commuter bus routes. The service began on July 8, 1985 with two routes connecting residential areas, shopping areas, and existing RTD bus stops. The system cost $100,000 in construction and $550,000 in operations subsidy in 1985, funded largely by Proposition A (a half cent sakes tax approved in 1980), with passengers paying a 25 cent fare. The service began with four buses operating on 45-minute headways. In contrast to RTD routes running only on major streets, Whittier Transit buses ran into residential neighborhoods to support local trips within the city. In the 1990s, the original buses were replaced by tourist trolleys, which were criticized for their high cost and polluting emissions. Connections were available at various locations in the town to several other operators, including LACMTA Metro Local (the 1993 successor to RTD), Foothill Transit, Montebello Bus Lines and Norwalk Transit. Competition from these other operators, which operated only on major streets but often with higher frequency, cut into Whittier Transit ridership which declined 32% between 1999 and 2005. Operations were contracted out to Norwalk Transit in 2005, which ran the two routes (still branded as Whittier Transit) on one-hour headways with a 35 cent fare. In 2007, Whittier ceased funding Whittier Transit as a separate system; the two routes were combined into Norwalk Transit Route 7. In July 2011, Norwalk Transit proposed to discontinue service on Route 7, as well as Route 8 from Norwalk to Whittier, in an attempt to balance Norwalk's transportation budget. The Norwalk lines had poor ridership due to competition from other companies. After the Whittier City Council declined to provide $1.1 million annually to fund the service, the routes were cut on September 19, 2011, ending circulator service in Whittier. Commuter and limited local bus service is provided to parts of Whittier by Foothills Transit route 274, Norwalk route 7, Montebello Bus Lines routes 40 and 90 express (formerly express 342), and Norwalk Transit routes 1 and 3.

It is the second of the Famicom Mukashibanashi series, following the release of Shin Onigashima. The game is loosely based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West. The driving force behind the series, Tatsuya Hishida of Nintendo EAD, was responsible for directing the game, creating the characters, and crafting the story line. The game consists of two disks, released on October 14, 1989 and November 14, 1989 respectively. Gameplay Yuyuki is an adventure game played by choosing from several text commands shown on screen. It resembles its predecessor, Shin Onigashima, in its implementation of the \\"Change Character\\" command, usage of traditional Japanese fairytales, and general screen layout and appearance. The story-line is a parody of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, where two main characters, Goku and Chao, embark upon separate journeys to find one another. In Yuyuki, the \\"Change Character\\" command can switch between a maximum of five different characters. However, there are very few points in the game where it can actually be used to such extent. Its main use is to switch between Goku and the others accompanying him. Like Shin Onigashima, the character in use can greatly affect the descriptive text shown on screen, and the significant increase in number of characters allowed for more variety in each scene. It is possible to enjoy the game by viewing the reactions towards choosing completely unrelated characters or commands in certain situations. While Shin Onigashima demanded rather complex puzzle-solving abilities, Yuyuki mainly focuses on having the player carefully read and understand the story- line. Puzzles are solved easily in this game, and very few choices actually lead to a \\"game over\\" screen. Easy trivia questions and simple action gameplay emerge at certain points, and players may find themselves searching for the obvious answer on screen more often than thinking hard to solve the puzzle at hand. Main changes in gameplay from Shin Onigashima include the implementation of the \\"Ittaisan\\" command, which saves progress at any point during the game, and faster animation of game text. The shortening in load time after choosing commands, and an overall decrease in difficulty allowed Yuyuki to run at a much quicker tempo than its predecessor. Plot Once upon a time, a little girl named Chao lived in a small village in China. One night, a meteor fell near Chao's home, which burst open to reveal a monkey inside. Chao named the monkey \\"Goku,\\" and took care of him for a while. However, Goku is led away and imprisoned by Oshakasama for the various crimes he has committed, and Chao sets off to find the \\"Gavel of Light\\" in order to save him. Several years later, the world is put under peril at the hands of the bull-monster Gyumaou, and Goku is called upon to save the world... =Characters= The links labelled \\"see also\\" are articles for each character in Journey to the West. Descriptions given here may differ significantly with that of the actual novel. The player has the option of choosing different names for Goku and Chao at the start of the game. The \\"Change Character\\" command can be used with the first five characters listed below. ; Goku : The hero of the game. Rough, rude, and often selfish, he attempted to take over heaven with Gyumaou but was caught and exiled to a far corner of the world by Oshakasama. He learns the importance of kindness and diligence through his travels with Chao (see also: Sun Wukong). ; Chao : The heroine of the game.

Television commercial An odd commercial for the game was aired prior to its release, featuring real-life versions of the main characters (all wearing sunglasses) visiting various locations by plane in a \\"Tenjiku Tour\\" (Tenjiku is the final destination in Journey to the West, located in India) such as Japan, Hawaii and Siberia. The most striking part was the commercial's jingle; the developers employed a strange song of no particular meaning that chanted the names of the main characters. This was the last Disk System game advertised on television. Port issues While Shin Onigashima was ported to the Super Famicom and Game Boy Advance, no talk of porting or remaking Yuyuki for other systems has ever emerged. The explanation given was that the game lacked proper copyright clearance from developers and writers, but this explanation is dubious because Shin Onigashima was created by the same company and staff. The Disk System's rewriting service ended in September, 2003, but rewriting for Yuyuki was terminated a year earlier in October, 2002. Legacy Goku and Chao made cameo appearances in the Kirby's Dream Land series. The appearances do not add to the game's storyline, but they play key roles in finishing each game. *Chao appears in the Japanese version of Kirby's Dream Land 2, which was released in 1995 (in international versions, Chao is replaced by a female version of Gooey). The player's progress is shown in percentage on the menu screen in this game, and the only way to reach 100% is to find Chao, who randomly appears in one of the bags that usually contains Rick, Coo, Kine, or Gooey. The picture shown on the sound test screen is a parody of a scene in Yuyuki. *Both Goku and Chao appear in Kirby's Dream Land 3, released in 1997. Finding Goku in a cave and reuniting him with Chao on a certain level awards the player one of the Heart Stars needed to defeat the final boss of the game. * A remix of most of the songs from the series shows up as a medley in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, released in 2018. Goku and Chao also appear as \\"Spirits\\" power-ups in the game. Makoto Asada, a video game producer at 5pb., has expressed interest in making a remake of Yūyūki.https://gematsu.com/2019/09/yu-no-a-girl-who-chants- love-at-the-bound-of-this-world-mini-interview-with-producer-makoto-asada See also * Shin Onigashima * Time Twist: Rekishi no Katasumi de... * Famicom Bunko: Hajimari no Mori References *:ja:遊遊記, Retrieved 2007-11-20 External links *Yuuyuuki at NinDB *Screenshots Category:1989 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Episodic video games Category:Japan- exclusive video games Category:Famicom Disk System games Category:Famicom Disk System-only games Category:Shenmo fiction Category:Pax Softnica games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Works based on Journey to the West ","title":"Yūyūki"},{"id":"10511033","text":"The NDN Firecracker is a single-engine aircraft designed as a military trainer. Design and development In 1976, Nigel Desmond Norman, one of the founders of Britten-Norman, the manufacturers of the Islander, set up NDN Aircraft to build the Firecracker, a single piston-engined trainer designed to replicate the handling of a jet trainer.Flight International 23 July 1977, pp. 275, 278. It was intended that the Firecracker would have a simple structure to allow it to be built under license by third-world countries to help start up local aviation industries.Field 1979, p.831. The first prototype, powered by a Lycoming O-540 piston engine, flew on 26 May 1977.Donald 1997, p.673. The aircraft configuration is a tandem two-seat aircraft with retractable tricycle landing gear. It has a low aspect ratio wing in order to give fighter-like handling and is fitted with an airbrake. After producing a single piston- engined prototype, NDN developed the aircraft by fitting a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprop engine, producing the NDN-1T Turbo-Firecracker.

Leaders of sanctuary cities say they want to reduce fear of deportation and possible family break-up among people who are in the country illegally, so that such people will be more willing to report crimes, use health and social services, and enroll their children in school. In the United States, municipal policies include prohibiting police or city employees from questioning people about their immigration status and refusing requests by national immigration authorities to detain people beyond their release date, if they were jailed for breaking local law. Such policies can be set expressly in law (de jure) or observed in practice (de facto), but the designation \\"sanctuary city\\" does not have a precise legal definition. The Federation for American Immigration Reform estimated in 2018 that 564 U.S. jurisdictions, including states and municipalities, had adopted sanctuary policies. Studies on the relationship between sanctuary status and crime have found that sanctuary policies either have no effect on crime or that sanctuary cities have lower crime rates and stronger economies than comparable non- sanctuary cities. Opponents of sanctuary cities argue that cities should assist the national government in enforcing immigration law. Supporters of sanctuary cities argue that enforcement of federal law is not the duty of localities, and that law enforcement resources can be prioritized towards better purposes. European cities have been inspired by the same political currents of the sanctuary movement as American cities, but the term \\"sanctuary city\\" now has different meanings in Europe and North America. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, and in continental Europe, sanctuary city refers to cities that are committed to welcoming refugees, asylum seekers and others who are seeking safety. Such cities are now found in 80 towns, cities and local areas in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The emphasis is on building bridges of connection and understanding, which is done through raising awareness, befriending schemes and forming cultural connections in the arts, sport, health, education, faith groups and other sectors of society. Glasgow and Swansea have become known as noted sanctuary cities. Tradition The concept of a sanctuary city goes back thousands of years. It has been associated with Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Baháʼí, Sikhism, and Hinduism. In Western Civilization, sanctuary cities can be traced back to the Old Testament. The Book of Numbers commands the selection of six cities of refuge in which the perpetrators of accidental manslaughter could claim the right of asylum. Outside of these cities, blood vengeance against such perpetrators was allowed by law. In AD 392, Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I set up sanctuaries under church control. In AD 600 in medieval England, churches were given a general right of sanctuary, and some cities were set up as sanctuaries by Royal charter. The general right of sanctuary for churches in England was abolished in 1621. United States = History = The movement that established sanctuary cities in the United States began in the early 1980s. The movement traces its roots to religious philosophy, as well as the histories of resistance movements to perceived state injustices. The sanctuary city movement took place in the 1980s to challenge the US government's refusal to grant asylum to certain Central American refugees. These asylum seekers were arriving from countries in Central America like El Salvador and Guatemala that were politically unstable. More than 75,000 Salvadoreans and 200,000 Guatemalans were killed by their governments in efforts to suppress the communist movement in those countries at the time.Bracken, Amy (Dec. 29 2016). \\"Why You Need To Know About Guatemala's Civil War\\". Public Radio International. Faith based groups in the US Southwest initially drove the movement of the 1980s, with eight churches publicly declaring to be sanctuaries in March 1982.Bauder, Harald(2017-04-01). \\"Sanctuary Cities: Politics and Practice in International Perspective.

The resolution was followed the same year by an ordinance which prohibited the use of city funds and resources to assist federal immigration enforcement–the defining characteristic of a sanctuary city in the U.S.Mancina, P. 2013 “The birth of a sanctuary-city: a history of governmental sanctuary in San Francisco”. In R.K. Lippert and S. Rehaag (Eds) Sanctuary Practices in International Perspectives: Migration, Citizenship and Social Movements. Abingdon, UK, Routledge: 205–218. As of 2018 more than 560 cities, states and counties considered themselves sanctuaries. =Terminology= thumbrightupright=1.6 *Map is based on data published by ICE in a [https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ddor/ddor2017_02-11to02-17.pdf February 2017 report] outlining jurisdictions that have declined ICE detainers. Several different terms and phrases are used to describe immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The term alien is considered insensitive by many and a LexisNexis search showed that its use in reports on immigration has declined substantially, making up just 5% of terms used in 2013.Emily Guskin, 'Illegal,' 'undocumented,' 'unauthorized': News media shift language on immigration\\", Pew Research Center (March 17, 2013). Usage of the word \\"illegal\\" and phrases using the word (e.g., illegal alien, illegal immigrant, illegal worker and illegal migrant) has declined, accounting for 82% of language used in 1996, 75% in 2002, 60% in 2007, and 57% in 2013. Several other phrases are competing for wide acceptance: undocumented immigrant (usage in news reports increased from 6% in 1996 to 14% in 2013); unauthorized immigrant (3% usage in 2013 and rarely seen before that time), and undocumented person or undocumented people (1% in 2007, increasing to 3% in 2013). Media outlets' policies as to use of terms differ, and no consensus has yet emerged in the press.Stephen Hiltner, Illegal, Undocumented, Unauthorized: The Terms of Immigration Reporting, New York Times (March 10, 2017).Rui Kaneya, 'Illegal,' 'undocumented,' or something else? No clear consensus yet, Columbia Journalism Review (December 23, 2014). In 2013, the Associated Press changed its AP Stylebook to provide that \\"Except in direct quotes essential to the story, use illegal only to refer to an action, not a person: illegal immigration, but not illegal immigrant. Acceptable variations include living in or entering a country illegally or without legal permission.\\"Andrew Beaujon & Taylor Miller Thomas, AP changes style on 'illegal immigrant', Poynter Institute (April 2, 2013). Within several weeks, major U.S. newspapers such as Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, and USA Today adopted similar guidance. The New York Times style guide similarly states that the term illegal immigrant may be considered \\"loaded or offensive\\" and advises journalists to \\"explain the specific circumstances of the person in question or to focus on actions: who crossed the border illegally; who overstayed a visa; who is not authorized to work in this country.\\" The style book discourages the use of illegal as a noun and the \\"sinister-sounding\\" alien. Both unauthorized and undocumented are acceptable, but the stylebook notes that the former \\"has a flavor of euphemism and should be used with caution outside quotation\\" and the latter has a \\"bureaucratic tone.\\" The Washington Post stylebook \\"says 'illegal immigrant' is accurate and acceptable, but notes that some find it offensive\\"; the Post \\"does not refer to people as 'illegal aliens' or 'illegals,' per its guidelines.Derek Hawkins, The long struggle over what to call 'undocumented immigrants' or, as Trump said in his order, 'illegal aliens', Washington Post (February 9, 2017). =Electoral politics= This issue entered presidential politics in the race for the Republican Party Presidential Nomination in 2008. Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo ran on an anti-illegal immigration platform and specifically attacked sanctuary cities. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney accused Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani of running it as a sanctuary city. Mayor Giuliani's campaign responded saying that Governor Romney ran a sanctuary Governor's mansion, and that New York City is not a \\"haven\\" for undocumented immigrants. Following the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco (a sanctuary city) by an undocumented immigrant, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D-NY) told CNN that \\"The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.\\" The following day, her campaign stated: \\"Hillary Clinton believes that sanctuary cities can help further public safety, and she has defended those policies going back years.\\"  Trump administration agenda  On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Justice Department sued the state of California, the Governor Jerry Brown, and the state's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, over three state laws passed in recent months, saying the laws made it impossible for federal immigration officials to do their jobs and deport criminals who were born outside the United States. The Justice Department called the laws unconstitutional and asked a judge to block them. The lawsuit says the state laws “reflect a deliberate effort by California to obstruct the United States’ enforcement of federal immigration law.”\\"Trump Administration Sues California Over Immigration Laws\\" New York Times, March 6, 2018. Retrieved March 6, 2018 The Trump administration previously released a list of immigration principles to Congress. The list included funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a crackdown on the influx of Central American minors, and curbs on federal grants to sanctuary cities. A pledge to strip \\"all federal funding to sanctuary cities\\" was a key Trump campaign theme. President Trump issued an executive order which declared that jurisdictions that \\"refuse to comply\\" with 8 U.S.C. 1373--a provision of federal law on information sharing between local and federal authorities--would be ineligible to receive federal grants. States and cities have shown varying responses to the executive order. Thirty-three states introduced or enacted legislation requiring local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE officers and requests to hold non-citizen inmates for deportation. Other states and cities have responded by not cooperating with federal immigration efforts or by showcasing welcoming policies towards immigrants. California openly refused the administration's attempts to \\"clamp down on sanctuary cities\\". A federal judge in San Francisco agreed with two California municipalities that a presidential attempt to cut them off from federal funding for not complying with deportation requests was unconstitutional, ultimately issuing a nationwide permanent injunction against the facially unconstitutional provisions of the order. On March 27, 2018, the all-Republican Board of Supervisors in Orange County, California voted to join the Justice Department's lawsuit against the state. In Chicago a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration may not withhold public safety grants to sanctuary cities. These decisions have been seen as a setback to the administration's efforts to force local jurisdictions to help federal authorities with the policing of illegal immigrants. On July 5, 2018, a federal judge upheld two of California's Sanctuary laws, but struck down a key provision in the third. Local officials who oppose the president's policies say that complying with federal immigration officers will ruin the trust established between law enforcement and immigrant communities. Supporters of the president's policies say that protection of immigrants from enforcement makes communities less safe and undermines the rule of law. On July 12, 2019 federal appeals court in Seattle in a 2-to-1 opinion overturned a nationwide injunction issued last year by a federal judge in Los Angeles. The appeals court said awarding extra points in the application process to cities that cooperate was consistent with the goals of the grant program created by Congress. Federal Law The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 addressed the relationship between the federal government and local governments. Minor crimes, such as shoplifting, became grounds for possible deportation. Additionally, the legislation outlawed cities' bans against municipal workers reporting a person's immigration status to federal authorities. Section 287(g) makes it possible for state and local law enforcement personnel to enter into agreements with the federal government to be trained in immigration enforcement and, subsequent to such training, to enforce immigration law. However, it provides no general power for immigration enforcement by state and local authorities.IIRIRA 287(g) This provision was implemented by local and state authorities in five states, California, Arizona, Alabama, Florida and North Carolina by the end of 2006.Katie Zezima, Massachusetts Set for Its Officers to Enforce Immigration Law The New York Times, December 13, 2006 On June 16, 2007 the United States House of Representatives passed an amendment to a United States Department of Homeland Security spending bill that would withhold federal emergency services funds from sanctuary cities. Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) was the sponsor of this amendment. 50 Democrats joined Republicans to support the amendment. The amendment would have to pass the United States Senate to become effective. In 2007, Republican representatives introduced legislation targeting sanctuary cities. Reps. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Fla., Thelma Drake, R-Va., Jeff Miller, R-Fla., and Tom Tancredo introduced the bill. The legislation would make undocumented immigrant status a felony, instead of a civil offense. Also, the bill targets sanctuary cities by withholding up to 50 percent of Department of Homeland Security funds from the cities. On September 5, 2007, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told a House committee that he certainly wouldn't tolerate interference by sanctuary cities that would block his \\"Basic Pilot Program\\" that requires employers to validate the legal status of their workers. \\"We're exploring our legal options. I intend to take as vigorous legal action as the law allows to prevent that from happening, prevent that kind of interference.\\" On January 25, 2017 President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13768 directing the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General to defund sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration law., He also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to begin issuing weekly public reports that include \\"a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.\\" Ilya Somin, Professor of Law at George Mason University, has argued that Trump's withholding of federal funding would be unconstitutional: \\"Trump and future presidents could use [the executive order] to seriously undermine constitutional federalism by forcing dissenting cities and states to obey presidential dictates, even without authorization from Congress. The circumvention of Congress makes the order a threat to separation of powers, as well.\\" On April 25, 2017, U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a nationwide preliminary injunction halting this executive order. The injunction was made permanent on November 20, 2017, when Judge Orrick ruled that section 9(a) of the order was \\"unconstitutional on its face\\". The judgment concluded that the order violates \\"the separation of powers doctrine and deprives [the plaintiffs] of their Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights.\\" In December 2018 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a federal law that criminalized encouraging people to enter or live in the U.S. illegally. The court said the law was too broad in restricting the basic right of free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Opponents of the law argued that it was a danger to lawyers advising immigrants and to public officials who support sanctuary policies.Thanawala, S. (2018, December 05). US law against encouraging illegal immigration struck down. Retrieved March 02, 2019, from https://www.apnews.com/344dab0d2df44a6f995f2773ed61f636United States v.

Title 8 Aliens and Nationality, U.S. Code § 1324. Bringing in and harboring certain aliens (1907). Jurisdiction Whether federal or local government has jurisdiction to detain and deport undocumented immigrants is a tricky and unsettled issue, because the U.S. Constitution does not provide a clear answer. Both federal and local government offer arguments to defend their authority. The issue of jurisdiction has been vigorously debated dating back to the Alien Act of 1798. Opponents of local level policing tend to use the Naturalization Clause and the Migration clause in the Constitution as textual confirmation of federal power. Because the Supremacy Clause is generally interpreted to mean that federal law takes priority over state law, the U.S. Supreme Court in the majority of cases has ruled in favor of the federal government. Certain states have been affected by illegal immigration more than others and have attempted to pass legislation that limits access by undocumented immigrants to public benefits. A notable case was Arizona's SB 1070 law, which was passed in 2010 and struck down in 2012 by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. States like Arizona, Texas and Nevada justify the aggressive actions they have taken to be the result of insufficient efforts by the federal government to address issues, like the use of schools and hospitals by undocumented immigrants, and changes to the cultural landscape—impacts that are most visible on a local level. Ambiguity and confusion over jurisdiction is one of the reasons why local and state policies for and against sanctuary cities vary widely depending on the location in the country. = Effects =  Crime  Studies show that sanctuary cities either have no impact on crime or that they lower the crime rate. A 2017 study in the journal Urban Affairs Review found that sanctuary policy itself has no statistically meaningful effect on crime. The findings of the study were misinterpreted by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a July 2017 speech when he claimed that the study showed that sanctuary cities were more prone to crime than cities without sanctuary policies. A third study in the journal Justice Quarterly found evidence that the adoption of sanctuary policies reduced the robbery rate, but had no impact on the homicide rate except in cities with larger Mexican undocumented immigrant populations, which had lower rates of homicide. According to a study by Tom K. Wong, associate professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, published by the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank: \\"Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to non- sanctuary counties. Moreover, economies are stronger in sanctuary counties – from higher median household income, less poverty, and less reliance on public assistance, to higher labor force participation, higher employment-to- population ratios, and lower unemployment.\\" The study also concluded that sanctuary cities build trust between local law enforcement and the community, which enhances public safety overall. The study evaluated sanctuary and non- sanctuary cities while controlling for differences in population, the foreign- born percentage of the population, and the percentage of the population that is Latino.\\" A 2020 study found that California Senate Bill 54 (2017), a sanctuary city legislation, had no significant impact on violent and property crime rates in California.  Economy  Advocates of local enforcement of immigration laws argue that more regulatory local immigration policies would cause immigrants to flee those cities and possibly the United States altogether, while opponents argue that regulatory policies on immigrants wouldn't affect their presence because immigrants looking for work will relocate towards economic opportunity despite challenges living there. Undocumented migrants tend to be attracted to states with more economic opportunity and individual freedom. Because there is no reliable data that asks for immigration status, there is no way to tell empirically if regulatory policies do have an effect on immigrant presence. A study comparing restrictive counties with nonrestrictive counties found that local jurisdictions that enacted regulatory immigration policies experienced a 1–2% negative effect in employment.  Health and well-being  A preliminary study's results imply that the number of sanctuary cities in the U.S. positively affects well-being in the undocumented immigrant population. Concerning health, a study in North Carolina found that after implementation of section 287(g), prenatal Hispanic/Latina mothers were more likely than non- Hispanic/Latina mothers to have late or inadequate prenatal care. The study's interviews indicated that Hispanics/Latinos in the section 287(g) counties had distrust in health services among other services and had fear about going to the doctor. = Laws and policies by state and city = A map of U.S. states colored by their policy on sanctuary cities, Red states ban it  Alabama  Alabama has banned sanctuary cities. The state law (Alabama HB 56) was enacted in 2011, calling for proactive immigration enforcement; however, many provisions are either blocked by the federal courts or subject to ongoing lawsuits. * On January 31, 2017, William A. Bell, the mayor of Birmingham, declared the city a \\"welcoming city\\" and said that the police would not be \\"an enforcement arm of the federal government\\" with respect to federal immigration law. He also stated that the city would not require proof of citizenship for granting business licenses. The Birmingham City Council subsequently passed a resolution supporting Birmingham being a \\"sanctuary city\\".  Arizona  Arizona has banned sanctuary cities.

As of 2010 Glasgow had accepted 22,000 asylum seekers from 75 different nations. In 2007, local residents upset by the human impact of removal seizures, organized watches to warn asylum seekers when Home Office vans were in the neighborhood.

Growing up in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, she began competing as a teenager in karting events. By her early 20s, after competing in Formula Ford and IMSA, she attracted the attention of several top-tier car owners. She was a member of the Mazda and the original North American Toyota factory-sponsored IMSA GT Championship teams. In February 1982, co-driving a factory-sponsored Mazda RX-7 with Allan Moffat and Lee Mueller, she earned a GTU class victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona. During an IMSA sports car event at Brainerd, Minnesota in July 1983, she suffered horrific injuries in a crash which ended her racing career. Noted sports car champion Brian Redman once referred to her as the only female driver he'd encountered who posed a genuine threat to win major professional automobile races. She is now a corporate safe driving instructor and speaker. From 1987 to 1994 she led safe driving and new car intros for Audi of America, Inc., driver clinics for Boeing employees through the Boeing Employees Automobile Club and did the initial instructor training for the then-new Audi Quattro Club. Kathy is also a breast cancer survivor including a stem cell transplant, trial drugs and radiation.

In languages employing register systems, differences in a distinguishing feature correlate relative to the quality of another distinguishing feature. For instance, in a system where pitch, voice quality and stress timing were distinguishing features, the meaning of a vowel-consonant cluster like \\"Pai\\" (as in the English word \\"Pie\\") may depend on whether the cluster is voiced in a high, medium or low pitch relative to the clearness, breathiness and glotteral quality of speech as well as relative to the duration of the cluster relative to other neighboring clusters. Thus, \\"Pai\\" voiced in a high tone with a breathy quality and unstressed along with other unstressed clusters would connote a different meaning if any of the three features changed relative to other features. Many register languages are tonal. However, tone is not a universal distinguishing feature among register systems and register complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a register tone systems or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system whose distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking), rather than simply their pitch relative to one another as in a register tone system. Register tone systems are found throughout Africa, such as in the Bantu languages. In some register tone systems, there is a default tone (usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system), which is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the Kru languages, but in such cases, the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register', when it is not in the phrase 'register tone', indicates vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. Burmese, Khmer and possibly Vietnamese are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases, differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation and so neither exists independently.

It was a regnal name. The ruler of Cagliari alternated between the surnames Salusio de Lacon and Torchitorio de Ugunale. (died 1130), also known by his birth name as Marianus II and surnamed de Unali, was the Judge of Cagliari from circa 1102Perhaps as early as 1091. The length of the reign of his opponent may have lasted anywhere from months to more than a decade, further complicating the issue of his dates. to his death, but initially with opposition. Torchitorio was the son of Salusio II. When Salusio died, the office of judge was still nominally electoral and Salusio's brother Torbeno seems to have pressed a claim to it. Nevertheless, Torbeno's government was short-lived and Torchitorio was soon securely in power, and the principle of hereditary succession was further entrenched in Cagliari. His return to power was the result of the aid of the Genoese, who lent six galleys under Ottone Fornari, and probably also that of the Republic of Pisa.Manno, 283 n715. Despite the claim of Gerónimo Zurita in his Anales that only the Genoese helped Torchitorio return to his throne, the subsequent evidence of Torchitorio's political acts points strongly to Pisan intervention as well. Torchitorio's first recorded public act was a donation to the Church of S. Lorenzo in Genoa in thankfulness for the aid. He also made grants to the church in Pisa. His gratefulness to the Pisans was recorded in a donation along with the names of all the noble citizens of Cagliari. The Pisans agreed to defend the peninsula of Sulcis with three of their galleys, but as this would stretch their resources, Torchitorio had to pay them an annual tribute of one pound pure gold and a shipload of salt. He also released Pisan merchants from customs dues and made later charters also in favour of Pisan commerce, always reaffirming his gratefulness for their assistance in recovering his realm. Torchitorio's politics, however, were not skewed to one republic or the other. He obtained the protection of Genoa and authorised William, Archbishop of Cagliari, to make a donation of the church of S. Giovanni d'Assemine to the church of Genoa. He also confirmed his previous acts in favour of Pisa with the consent of his son Salusio III and his wife Preciosa de Lacon.Manno, 283, n717. This act may refer to the Genoese. As to his relations with the church, Torchitorio's name is found subscribing many charters of the archbishop William in favour of Antiochus of Sulcis and S. Saturnino and he was probably a devotee of that last saint. Torchitorio was at first at odds with his deposed uncle, but he soon was back on good terms and Torbeno appears in later documents alongside the judge's other relatives. He subscribed the charter making a large donation to the church of Saint-Victor at Marseille. Torbeno left Torchitorio's court after two years to take part in the successful Pisan-Sardinian expedition against the Almoravids of the Balearic Islands. Both Torchitorio and Constantine I of Logudoro supported the expedition, the latter sending his own son Saltaro. Notes Sources *Manno, Giuseppe (1835). Storia di Sardegna. P.M. Visaj.

He was contemporaneous with Mahavira, Makkhali Gosala and the Buddha, and was a proponent of the sceptical ajñana school of thought. Teacher Sanjaya is thought to be the first teacher of the future Buddha's future two great disciples, Maha- Moggallana and Sariputta. Both of them were followers of a person named Sanjaya Parabajjaka (Sanjaya the wanderer). Sanjaya Parabajjaka is considered to be same as Sanjaya Belatthiputta by many scholars. These two future arahants ultimately left Sanjaya's tutelage as it did not address their unresolved desire to end ultimate suffering.Hecker (1994). Sanjaya Parabajjaka also had a follower named Suppiya, and so was Tattvalabdha, a minister at the court of King Ajatashatru. Thought Hecker (1994) contextualizes Sanjaya's thought as \\"a kind of dialectical existentialism\\" in juxtaposition to the popular materialist views of the day (for instance, typified by the ascetic teacher Ajita Kesakambalī.)Hecker (1994). Particularly regarding , see Chapter 2, \\"The Years of Wandering and Spiritual Search.\\" For example, in the Samannaphala Sutta (DN 2), Sanjaya is recorded as saying: :'If you ask me if there exists another world [after death], if I thought that there exists another world, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not. If you asked me if there isn't another world... both is and isn't... neither is nor isn't... if there are beings who transmigrate... if there aren't... both are and aren't... neither are nor aren't... if the Tathagata exists after death... doesn't... both... neither exists nor exists after death, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not.'Thanissaro (1997). =Commentary= In the Pali literature, Sanjaya's teachings have been characterized as \\"evasive\\"Thanissaro (1997) or \\"agnostic\\".Bhaskar (1972). In the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1), Sanjaya's views are deemed to be amaravikkhepavada, \\"endless equivocation\\" or \\"a theory of eel-wrigglers.\\"Cited in Bhaskar (1972). In Jaina literature, Sanjaya is identified as a Jaina sage (Skt., muni). It is believed that he was influenced by Jaina doctrine although Jaina philosophers were critical of Sanjaya.

Swimming career  Skinner was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and graduated from Selborne College in East London, South Africa. At the 1973 South African National Swimming Championships he won the 100-metre freestyle event and backed that up by winning the event again at the 1974 National Championships. He was awarded the title of South Africa Athlete of the Year and was also awarded South African National Colours in Swimming and Life Saving. He decided to move to the United States and attend the University of Alabama, where he was a member of the Alabama Crimson Tide swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition. Whilst there, he won gold in the 100-yard freestyle at the 1975 Division I NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships and was voted Alabama's most valuable swimmer in 1975, 1976 and 1977. He was also voted as Alabama's Athlete of the Year. In 1976, he weighed 185 pounds and stood 6 feet, 5 inches and had a good chance of taking the gold medal in the 100-metre freestyle at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, however at the time South Africa was still banned from the Olympics hence making Skinner ineligible to compete. However, after the completion of the Olympics, at the 1976 United States Summer National Swimming Championships in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and after just qualifying for the final, Skinner broke Jim Montgomery's 20-day-old world record in the 100-metre freestyle by 0.55 seconds beating home the Olympic champion and Joe Bottom who won silver in Montreal. His record stood until 3 April 1981 when Rowdy Gaines swam the distance in 49.36 seconds in Texas. In addition to his world record, he set three American records in the 100 yards freestyle. In 1985, he was recognised by the swimming world when he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an Honor Swimmer.  Coaching career  Skinner began his coaching career in 1978 when appointed assistant coach of University of Alabama's swim team. After three years he moved to California and became the head coach of the San Jose Aquatics Club where under his guidance the club won five junior national championship team titles and in 1986 took the national championship team title at Phillips 66 Long Course Senior Nationals. He served as head coach until 1988. He returned to the University of Alabama in 1988 as assistant head coach, and then took over the reins as the head swimming and diving coach of the men's and women's teams in 1990. From 1994 to 2000 Skinner served as USA Swimming's resident team coach, which involved coaching some of the nation's top swimmers at the elite national and international level. From 2000 to 2008 Skinner served as USA Swimming's Director of National Team Technical Support, which involves co- ordinating all of the testing, tracking and assessment of the national team athletes. He currently operates Athletic Intelligence Consulting and is an UpMyGame coach. In May 2012 he rejoined the University of Alabama swimming and diving team as an assistant coach.

During his lifetime, he became well known for traditional Chinese paintings and traditional Chinese music. He was also one of the few remaining descendants of the royal family of the Qing Dynasty. He was the great-great grandson of the Daoguang Emperor. Art career In 1957 Aisin Gioro Yuhuan joined the Artists' Association of China. In 1981 his name was added to The Dictionary of Great Chinese Artist. He won many art prizes in China. His works are classed as Traditional Chinese Art; his themes include mountain landscapes, people, close-ups of flowers, and bamboo. Aisin Gioro Yuhuan was the only son of Aixinjueluo Pu Shu Ming and lived in the Prince Gong Mansion for some time after the forming of the Republic of China and the downfall of the Qing Dynasty. Ties to his uncle Pu Xin-Yu, who was a famous traditional artist in China, provided Aisin Gioro Yuhuan with access to art lessons which helped develop his appetite for painting in the traditional art styles of China. While still in junior high school, he began publishing his comics in newspapers. As his interest in traditional art grew, Aisin Gioro Yuhuan applied and was accepted into the Arts Department of the Beijing Normal University. At university he was instructed in European or so-called western art forms and techniques. Music career Aisin Gioro Yuhuan was also a sanxian musician. His lessons with traditional Chinese instruments started when he was a child, still living in the Prince Gong Mansion. At the time of his death Yuhuan had mastered many difficult pieces. He continued to perform into his late sixties. At the age of eight, Aisin Gioro Yuhuan began his music career with lessons on the sanxian, a three-string, a 500-year-old plucked instrument. The first piece of music he learned was a classic of the Qing Dynasty. The piece consisted of many segments—what might be called movements in classical western music, each segment was 20–45 minutes long. He was unable to learn the entire piece of music because his tutor only knew thirteen segments; even so, with a course of one 2-hour lesson per week, it took Aisin Gioro Yuhuan two years to master those 13 segments. Later in life, he passed on his knowledge of that particular piece of music to a lecturer at the Central Conservatoire of Music in Beijing, Tan Longjian. Influences Many national leaders and foreign ministers met with Aisin Gioro Yuhuan and purchased his works or received his paintings as donations or presents; those countries include: Hungary, Germany, USA, Canada, Japan. Yuhuan lectured at many universities in Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia. Galleries and exhibitions of his work have been presented to and/or hosted by many of the above countries. Family Aixinjueluo Yuhuan had three children: Aixinjueluo Yu Yue (Screenwriter); Aixinjueluo Yu Kai (Artist); and Aixinjueluo Yu Jun (IT specialist). Their given names all begin with 'Yu', the same as their father, and not the supposed 'Heng' as would have been family tradition. This was due to the events of the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution many families of royal blood or with Kuomintang associations lived in fear of the Red Guards. Therefore, Aisin Gioro Yuhuan's children were given the name 'Yu'.

The Search for New Facilities Although the 'Clubs had a strong and enthusiastic membership, their challenge to secure a new site where their social purpose of inclusion and independence could continue for a second century was thwarted. Student Management Training The Stanford Eating Clubs provided an excellent training ground for student managers. Each Club had two managers who collectively form a Board of Directors that in turn hire a General Manager, Financial Manager, and Social Manager. In addition, each club's managers organized individual club events. In this environment, managers learn aspects of the business ranging from inventory and food cost control to staff management and special events planning. History: The First One Hundred Years The Stanford Eating Clubs have been a part of the Stanford tradition almost since the University's inception. Throughout their history, they have seen many changes in location, size and character, all the while remaining an integral part of the Stanford community. Although they were founded to provide a dining alternative for students, over the years the Eating Clubs developed into an organization of students looking for a sense of community without the enforced social or political agendas of other campus groups. This unique contribution to the student body is the reason the Eating Clubs have survived decades of change, and why they will undoubtedly continue to attract students in the coming century. A concise history of the first fifty years of the Stanford Eating Clubs is found in the 1963 Stanford Eating Clubs rush manual: > The Stanford Eating Clubs began before the turn of the century, formed by > congenial bands of like minded men who were unhappy with the food and > service offered by the University-sponsored Stanford Inn. Even before the > first Club was formed, some students were eating at the mess hall of \\"The > Camp,\\" a crude barrack community built on the site of the student union. It > was here, in 1894, that the first Club — Brookfarm Eating Club — was > founded. Brookfarm lasted only one year, but it was a beginning, and the > \\"eating club\\" concept continued to grow. Other co-operative eating groups > were formed at \\"The Camp\\" and in nearby Palo Alto and Mayfield (now the > California Avenue area of Palo Alto). \\"The Camp\\" was closed in 1902, but it > didn't dampen the Club spirit, and the leading students of those days > continued to trek off campus three times a day for their meals. In 1907 > several of the Clubs with houses in College Terrace — Snell, Welakahao, > Marchmount, and Entre Nous — banded together to form the Terrace Club. With > one exception, these Clubs all subsequently disbanded. Entre Nous, however, > founded in 1901, became the first of the seven present Clubs. The name was > changed to Los Arcos in 1922. In 1909 Breakers Club was organized in a small > cottage on Stanford Avenue near its intersection with Escondido Road. > Breakers remained there for one year before moving to the Frenchman's House, > located on Escondido Road. El Campo and El Toro were also founded in these > early years of the century. In the fall of 1912 the \\"Little Quad\\" was > completed and Breakers, El Campo, and El Toro moved into this small U-shaped > building next to Encina Hall near the last Club building. Construction of the Present Building: The \\"L\\" In 1920 Encina Commons was opened, with separate dining rooms for the other Clubs. El Capitan and El Cuadro were organized in 1921 and together with Los Arcos (then still known as Entre Nous) moved to the Commons. El Tigre was organized in 1922, and shared a Commons room with El Capitan. Until World War II there were three Clubs in the Little Quad and four in Encina Commons. After the War, veterans returned to find the \\"Little Quad\\" had been condemned and demolished. Encina Commons was too crowded with freshmen to provide individual dining rooms for each Club, so all seven Clubs were jammed into one large dining room. Faced with conditions they considered intolerable, the Clubs began a concentrated effort to build their own facilities. A fund drive was launched, proved successful, and in 1951 the last Club building was dedicated on Big Game day. From the new location, referred to as \\"The L\\" due to its shape, the Eating Clubs took on a new dimension, becoming an integral part of the life of adjacent Toyon Hall. Toyon's men were all 'Club members, and the social and intellectual life of the dorm was next door in the dining rooms and lounges of the 'Clubs. The Eating Clubs started many internal traditions, and some that became enduring legacies for Stanford as a whole. For instance, it was an El Toro member (and ASSU president) who began the Axe tradition. The Eating Clubs by this point continued to be a necessary alternative to the exclusionary policies of the fraternity system. They explained their philosophy as follows: > Our uniqueness allows us to do our own thinking and planning. We have no one > to imitate, no national affiliation to determine our traditions and > policies. Our independence, even from University control, gives our members > the chance they need and deserve to do with their talents as they wish. > [From the Stanford Eating Clubs President's Report, 1974]. The Clubs go Co-Ed Coeducational housing started on a limited scale at Stanford in 1966. When Toyon became coed, the Clubs chose to abandon their male only policy, and welcomed female members. The last Eating Club to become completely coed was El Toro in 1977. The membership policy of the Clubs was decidedly, and intentionally, egalitarian: On the first day of the academic quarter, a sheet was appended to the door of each club with the number of open positions, anyone wishing to join the Club had merely to sign the sheet. This was in contrast to the process of \\"rushing\\" found in fraternities and sororities.

It is refuge for the world's largest population of great one-horned rhinoceros. Kaziranga has the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. The park has large breeding populations of elephant, wild Asiatic water buffalo and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International for conservation of avifaunal species. The park has achieved notable progress in wildlife conservation with respect to other protected areas in India.Kaziranga was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 Kaziranga is a vast stretch of tall elephant grass, marshland and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests crisscrossed by four main rivers — Brahmaputra, Diphlu, Mora Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri and has numerous small water bodies. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, documentaries and songs. The park celebrated its centenary in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest. Local legend tells about a village girl named Ranga and a young man named Kazi from Karbi Anglong who fell in love. Their parents would not give consent to the affair, so the couple continued to meet each other in the forest. One day, they went into the forest and never returned. Since that day, the people call the forest Kaziranga. Biomes Kaziranga is one of the largest tracts of protected land in the sub-Himalayan belt, and due to its high species diversity and presence of high-visibility species, has been described as a \\"biodiversity hotspot\\". The park is located in the Indomalayan realm, and the two ecoregions of the park are Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests of the Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, and the frequently-flooded Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands of the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. Fauna A rhinoceros grazing at Kaziranga National Park The park contains significant breeding populations of 35 mammalian species, out of which 15 are threatened mammals according to the IUCN Red List. 479 species of birds (both migratory and resident) have been spotted at the park, including 25 globally threatened and 21 near threatened species. The park has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by Birdlife International for the conservation of the avifaunal species. A total of 42 species of reptile have been reported from the park. These include the endangered gharial and the rare Assam roofed turtle. =Mammals= In 2006 Kaziranga had 1,855 Indian rhinoceros, about 70% of the world's total wild population, The critically endangered Indian Javan rhinoceros was probably also an inhabitant of Kaziranga. WWF article , Retrieved on 2007-02-26 Assam was part of the historical range of the critically endangered pygmy hog. Even though wild boar are present in Kaziranga, the pygmy hog is no longer found here. Kaziranga contained as many as 1,206 Indian elephants in 2005, a 25% increase from 1,048 in 2002. The combined Kaziranga–Karbi Anglong Elephant Reserve has as many as 1,940 elephants. The 2001 park census counted 1666 wild Asian water buffalo,'Wild buffalo census in Kaziranga', The Rhino Foundation for Nature in NE India, Newsletter No. 3, June 2001 up 146% from 677 in 1984. The eastern swamp deer had 468 individuals in 2002, down 38% from 756 in 1984. This may be a reflection of the increasing tiger population. Other significant populations of large herbivores include 30 gaur in 1984, and 58 sambar in 1999. Smaller herbivores include 100 Indian muntjac in 1972, 431 wild boar in 1999, 5,045 hog deer in 1999 and barking deer. Kaziranga has the rare distinction of being one of the very few places in the world which contain breeding populations of three big cats outside Africa -- the royal Bengal tiger, the Indian leopard and the clouded leopard. Kaziranga had a population of around 30 Bengal tigers during the 1972 census, which grew 187% to 86 in the 2000 census, distinguishing Kaziranga with one tiger for each five km2 of park area, the highest tiger density in the world. Kaziranga formally became a tiger reserve in 2006. According to Dr. Melvin Sunquist of University of Florida, who himself conducted a field study and measurement of Bengal tigers in Chitwan National Park, Nepal in the 1970s, a recent camera trap survey inside Kaziranga National Park has revealed some very large looking tigers, in fact, the largest Bengal tigers he's ever come across. Due to Kaziranga's higher prey density compared to other parks of India,Sunquist, Mel and Fiona Sunquist. 2002. Wild Cats of the World. University Of Chicago Press, Chicago the tigers in here may grow to a larger size as a result. The park is also home to sloth bears and the lesser felids: jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. Other small mammals include the rare hispid hare, Indian gray mongoose, small Indian mongoose, large Indian civet, small Indian civet, Bengal fox, golden jackal, Chinese pangolin, Indian pangolin, hog badger, Chinese ferret badger, particolored flying squirrel and bats. The park has a large variety of primates including all free roaming primates in India with the exception of the endemic Western Ghats primates and the newly discovered Arunachal macaque. This includes the vulnerable and rare species of Bengal slow loris, Assamese macaque, capped langur, golden langur and the only ape found in India -- the hoolock gibbon. Kaziranga's rivers are home to the highly endangered Ganges dolphin. =Birds= An Indian roller at Kaziranga Waterfowl which breed in or pass through Kaziranga include several rare species of geese (lesser white- fronted goose), and ducks (ferruginous pochard, Baer's pochard). Other rare riverine birds include kingfishers (Blyth's kingfisher), herons (white-bellied heron), pelicans (Dalmatian pelican, spot-billed pelican), shanks (spotted greenshank) and terns (black-bellied tern). Rare migratory storks and cranes are also seen wintering in the park (lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black- necked stork, Asian openbill). Kaziranga hosts a large number of raptors, considered a sign of a healthy ecosystem. This includes the rare eastern imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle, white-tailed fishing eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle and the lesser kestrel. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. About 99% of the stable vulture population was killed by kidney failure caused by consuming the veterinary drug diclofenac in domestic animal carcasses. Of these, the red-headed vulture, and Eurasian black vulture are still near threatened due to their large range, but the Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture and the Indian white-rumped vulture have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have similar losses -- the griffon vulture and the Himalayan griffon, but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of this many vultures creates a critical void in the scavengers ecological niche in Kaziranga.R Cuthbert, RE Green, S Ranade, S Saravanan, DJ Pain, V Prakash, AA Cunningham (2006) \\" Rapid population declines of Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus) in India\\", Animal Conservation 9 (3), 349–354. . Retrieved on2007-02-26 Rare game birds (which were once hunted) include partridges (swamp francolin), bustards (Bengal florican) and pigeons (pale-capped pigeon). Several other important families of birds inhabit Kaziranga, including rare species of hornbills (great Indian hornbill and the lesser risk wreathed hornbill), Old World babblers (Jerdon's babbler, marsh babbler) and weaver birds (the common baya weaver and the threatened Finn's weaver), thrushes (Hodgson's bushchat), Old World warblers (bristled grassbird). Other threatened species include the black-breasted parrotbill and rufous-vented prinia. =Reptiles, amphibians, and fish = Two of the largest snakes in the world (the reticulated python and the rock python) as well as the longest venomous snake in the world (the king cobra) are common inside the park. The park also contains Bengal monitor and water monitor populations. The park is home to the rare monocled cobra, as well as three of the Big Four — Indian cobra, Russell's viper and common krait. In all, Kaziranga is home to 15 species of turtles, including the endemic Assam roofed turtle, and to one species of tortoise — the brown tortoise. The regional Assam garden lizard is present. 42 species of fish are found in the Kaziranga area, including the unusual ocellated pufferfish.

None of the decisions appearing in the first volume and only a few in the second volume of United States Reports are actually decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Instead, they are decisions from various Pennsylvania courts dating from the colonial period and the first decade after independence. Alexander J. Dallas, a Philadelphia lawyer and journalist, had been in the business of reporting these cases for newspapers and periodicals. He subsequently began compiling his case reports in a bound volume, which he called Reports of cases ruled and adjudged in the courts of Pennsylvania, before and since the Revolution.Cohen, Morris and O'Connor, Sharon H. A Guide to the Early Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States, (Fred B. Rothman & Co, Littleton Colorado, 1995 This and the three additional volumes he later produced would come to be known as the Dallas Reports. When the Supreme Court along with the rest of the new federal government moved in 1791 to the nation's temporary capital in Philadelphia, Dallas was appointed the Supreme Court's first unofficial and unpaid Supreme Court Reporter. (Court reporters in that age received no salary, but were expected to profit from the publication and sale of their compiled decisions.) Dallas continued to collect and publish Pennsylvania decisions in a second volume of his Reports, and when the Supreme Court began hearing cases, he added those cases to his reports, starting towards the end of the second volume, 2 Dallas Reports. Dallas would go on to publish a total of four volumes of decisions during his tenure as Reporter. In 1874, the U.S. government created the United States Reports, and numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of that series, starting from the first volume of Dallas Reports. The four volumes Dallas published were retitled volumes 1-4 of United States Reports.Hall, Kermit, ed.

Its honorary sangō prefix is . History Tōfuku-ji was founded in 1236 by the imperial chancellor Kujō Michiie.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). Kyoto: The Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869, p. 152. He appointed the monk Enni as founding priest, who had studied Rinzai Zen Buddhism in China under the monk Wuzhun Shifan. The temple was burned but rebuilt in the 15th century according to original plans. Tofuku-ji was one of the five temples of the Five Mountain System. =Abbots= In 1486 Ryōan Keigo became the 171st abbot of Tōfuku-ji. At the end of the 16th century Ankokuji Ekei was appointed abbot. From 1980 to 2009 Tōfuku-ji has been led by head abbot Keidō Fukushima.Harris, Ishwar C. et al. (2004). The Laughing Buddha of Tofukuji: The Life of Zen Master Keidō Fukushima, p. xi. Architecture The main gate Tōfuku-ji's main gate is the oldest sanmon in Japan. It is a National Treasure of Japan. It is two stories high and five bays wide. The central three bays are doors. Currently, the Tōfuku-ji complex includes 24 sub-temples, though in the past the number has been as high as 53. Artwork Tōfuku-ji's large nehan-zu painting depicts Buddha on his death bed. This massive image (7 x 14 meters) is the second largest in Japan. The image at nearby Sennyū-ji is the largest of its kind in Japan, measuring 8 x 16 meters. Both images are rarely displayed, most recently in 2003 for three days only. \\"Kansai: Who -- What: Giant Buddhas shown for three days only,\\" Japan Times Online. March 9, 2003. A 1238 portrait painting of Wuzhun Shifan along with an inscription by an anonymous author was brought to the temple by Enni in the 1240s and remains there today. Plaques of Wuzhun's calligraphy is also kept at Tōfuku-ji. In 1933 the Nihonga painter Inshō Dōmoto painted the large and vivid \\"Blue Dragon\\" ceiling painting for one of the halls, which he painted in 17 days.http://www.kyoto-magonote.jp/en/zen-2016/zen-2016.html Garden The moss garden There are a number of gardens in the various precincts of Tōfuku- ji. The current garden was designed by landscape architect Mirei Shigemori in the 1930s. The moss garden in particular has been emblematic of the renewal of Japanese gardening principles in the 20th Century. The temple features a large number of Japanese maple trees, and is most crowded during the autumn season when people flock to see the autumn foliage. It is a tradition to view the leaves from the Tsūten-kyō bridge.

There is evidence of its cultivation as long ago as the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley for the production of cotton textiles. This species of cotton was also introduced into East Africa and was grown by the Meroe civilization in Nubia. The shrub was included in Linnaeus's Species Plantarum published in 1753. The holotype was also supplied by him, which is now in the Linnean Herbarium in the Swedish Museum of Natural History. It is a sister species of Gossypium herbaceum. Description Tree cotton is a shrub attaining heights of one to two metres. Its branches are covered with pubescence and are purple in colour. Stipules are present at the leaf base and they are linear to lanceolate in shape and sometimes falcate (i.e. sickle- shaped). The leaves are attached to the stem by a 1.5 to 10 cm petiole. The blades are ovate to orbicular in shape and have five to seven lobes, making them superficially resemble a maple leaf. The lobes are linear to lanceolate, and often a tooth is present in the sinus. Glands are present along the midrib or occasionally on the adjacent nerves. The leaves are glabrescent, meaning the pubescence is lost with age, but when it is present on young leaves, it is both stellate (i.e. star-shaped) and simple. The flowers are set on short pedicels (i.e. flower stalks). An epicalyx is present, which is a series of subtending bracts that resemble sepals. Its large, ovate segments are dentate (i.e. toothed along the margins), though sometimes only very slightly so. They are cordate (i.e. heart-shaped) at the base and acute at the apex. The true calyx is small, measuring only about long. Its shape is cupular, and five subtle dentations are present. The corolla is a pale yellow on colour, sometimes with a purple centre, and occasionally entirely purple. It measures long. The staminal tube bears the anthers and is 1.5 to 2 cm in length. The fruit is a three- or four-celled capsule measuring across. It is ovoid or oblong in shape and glabrous (i.e. hairless). The surface is pitted and a beak is present at the terminal end. The seeds within are globular and are covered in long white cotton. Gossypium arboreum var. neglecta, locally known as \\"Phuti karpas\\", is the variant used to make Muslin in East India, now Bangladesh. The variation could only be grown in an area south of Dacca, along the banks of the Meghna River. It could be spun so that individual threads could maintain tensile strength at counts higher than any other variant of cotton.Islam, Khademul. 2016. Our Story of Dhaka Muslin. AramcoWorld.

The Royal Hobart Showground is located 10 km north of Hobart, between the junction to Brooker Highway/Goodwood Road and the Main Road in Glenorchy. Royal Hobart Show The Royal Hobart Show is an annual event held at the Royal Showgrounds in October. The event focuses on the rural exploits of Tasmanians with events such as livestock judging and wood chopping. Also popular at the event are show bags and rides. In many ways it can be considered similar (although smaller) to the Sydney Royal Easter Show. The show runs for four days, Wednesday through to Saturday, ending on the fourth Saturday in October. History The first show was in January 1822, in the Old Market Place, just in front of the present State Parliament House. The venue of the Royal Hobart Show has varied over the past 184 years and has included Salamanca Place, Bridgewater, New Town, Tattersalls Park and even the Hobart Town Hall. In 1903, the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania purchased the of bushland then known as the \\"Elwick Knoll\\" at a cost of ₤2525. The following year the first Show was held at its current location, the Elwick Showground. In 1922 His Majesty King George V approved the granting of the prefix ‘Royal’ to the Society and in turn became known as The Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania. A $4 million redevelopment of the Showgrounds took place in 1980 and provided Pacing and Greyhound Racing facilities, an upgraded arena suitable for a variety of events, and the enclosed Grandstand and Amenities building which includes bars, restaurants, betting hall, meeting rooms and offices. The 1981 Inter Dominion was held at the Showgrounds. From 2004-2008, Greyhound and Pacing facilities have been merged with Thoroughbred Racing at Elwick Racecourse, just down the road. =Future redevelopment= In April 2012 the RAST (Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania) board of management announced plans to redevelop large sections of the showgrounds, including parcelling out sections for commercial use and the demolition of the current Poultry, Dog, Cat and other exhibition pavilions to be replaced with just two pavilions for companion animals and livestock during the show.http://www.hobartshowground.com.au/redevelopment/docs/hobart_showground_redevelopment_media_release.pdfhttp://www.hobartshowground.com.au/redevelopment/docs/hobart_showground_redevelopment_presentation.pdf Other uses In addition to the Royal Hobart Show that is conducted annually, The Showgrounds hosted the Royal Hobart International Wine show, the second largest Wine Show in Australia and the only Wine Show in the world believed to be conducted in line with ISO 9001 quality management system certification standards. In recent years the showground has hosted the Royal Hobart Fine Food Awards and the Tasmanian Vineyard of the Year Competitions, as well as attracting music events like the Southern Roots Festival in 2007 and the Eskimo Joe live show in 2006. Since May 2007, the grounds have been the site of the headquarters of Football Federation Tasmania. In addition, various animal fancy events, including exhibits of cats, dogs, poultry, rabbits and guinea pigs, are held by animal fancier clubs at venues in the showgrounds.http://www.abc.net.au/rural/tas/stories/s1157023.htm  References   External links  * Hobart Showground website Category:Landmarks in Hobart Category:Sports venues in Hobart Category:Music venues in Australia Category:Culture in Hobart Category:Tourist attractions in Hobart Category:Glenorchy, Tasmania Category:Showgrounds in Australia ","title":"Royal Hobart Showground"},{"id":"10511702","text":"John Young Brown III (born June 2, 1963) is a Kentucky politician.

The cotton produced by this plant is short, about long and is firmly attached to the seed, which is covered in hairy down. An acre of cotton can be expected to produce about . Uses Cotton fibres grow from the surface of the seeds and can be separated from these by hand or mechanically; the long fibres are called lint. The cotton fibres are constituted of nearly pure cellulose. The main use of cotton lint is as textile for clothing. The fibres are spun into yarns and these are woven into fabrics, in the farm or house or in factories. Cotton as a fabric is much appreciated because of its comfortable, breathable properties, its resistance and also because it is easily stained. The cotton plant itself has medicinal uses, and can be cultivated traditionally, in house backyards, for, e.g., women's menstrual cycle pains and irregular bleeding. It is also known to be used after birth to expel the placenta and to increase the lactation, as well as for gastrointestinal issues, such as hemorrhages and diarrhea, for nausea, fevers and headaches. In the Levant seeds of Gossypium herbaceum were also used for food, feed or oil extraction. Cotton seeds, containing up to 20% oil and 20% proteins, are potentially highly rich as food or feed. Nevertheless, small glands present in all the plant organs of the Gossypium species, except the roots, and especially abundant in the seeds, contain toxic chemicals, in particular the polyphenolic compound Gossypol. The gossypol is highly toxic to animals and is an element of the plant direct defence system against herbivorous arthropods. It can cause severe growth and development disorders in humans as well as domestic animals, particularly monogastric animals, while polygastrics are more or less tolerant. For this reason, using oil or whole seeds for human nutrition is dependent upon some way of elimination of the gossypol, through heating or other treatment. The gossypol extracted from cotton seeds has a potential use as a male contraceptive but can cause irreversible infertility after repeated use. In lab rat studies, it has been able to stop early pregnancies.Khan S, Balick MJ. Therapeutic plants of ayurveda: A review of selected clinical and other studies for 166 species.

It serves as a connector between Interstate 40 (I-40)/ U.S. Route 421 (US 421) and Piedmont Triad International Airport (via I-73). On its routing from Thomasville to Stokesdale, NC 68 passes through urban High Point, the western outskirts of Greensboro, and the town of Oak Ridge. The segment from just north of the I-40/US 421 interchange to Pleasant Ridge Road in Guilford County is a limited access freeway. Route description Beginning in the south at Business I-85/US 29/US 70, the route travels north out of Thomasville in Davidson County as National Highway, a name which referred to the former routing of US 29/70 (later US 29A/70A) along this segment. Crossing from Davidson County into neighboring Guilford County and the city of High Point, NC 68 is cosigned with English Road. Approximately within the city limits, NC 68 turns left onto Westchester Drive, a boulevard that bypasses High Point's downtown area. Arriving at the Main Street interchange, NC 68 continues onto Eastchester Drive, another boulevard. After passing Oak Hollow Mall, I-74 (High Point East Belt), and the Wendover Avenue interchange, NC 68 and Eastchester Drive continue north into neighboring Greensboro. Shortly after entering Greensboro, NC 68 meets Interstate 40/US 421, and becomes a limited access freeway after a traffic signal at Triad Center Drive. Continuing north as a divided four-lane highway, NC 68 has junctions with W. Market Street (Colfax exit) and I-73, the exit for Piedmont Triad International Airport. The road downgrades to an undivided primary road at the Pleasant Ridge Road junction. From there, the route heads north through the heart of Oak Ridge, North Carolina, passing the Oak Ridge Military Academy at the route's intersection with NC 150\\\\. After crossing the Haw River into Stokesdale, NC 68 crosses US 158 and joins NC 65 for a short concurrency, before splitting to the northeast en route to its northern terminus at US 220 in Rockingham County. This interchange doubles as the current northern terminus of I-73 though no direct access is provided between I-73 and NC 68. History The first NC 68 was an original state highway that traversed from NC 60, in Millers Creek (west of Wilkesboro), northwest through Glendale Springs, Jefferson and Crumpler, before crossing into Virginia. By 1928, NC 68 was rerouted west of Jefferson onto new primary routing west to the Tennessee state line; the old alignment becoming NC 681. In 1929, all of NC 68 was replaced by an extension of NC 16. The second and current NC 68 was established in 1930 as a new primary routing from US 70/US 170/NC 10, northeast of High Point, to NC 65, in Stokesdale. In 1936, NC 68 was rerouted south through High Point to US 29A/US 70A (Lexington Avenue); its old alignment, along Penny Road, became a secondary road. In 1941, NC 68 was extended north on new primary routing to US 220 (Sylvania Road). In 1952, NC 68 was extended north to its current terminus with the then new US 220 bypass, replacing part of old US 220 (Sylvania Road). Between 1950-1953, NC 68 was extended south to English Street. In 1956 or 1957, NC 68 was extended to its current southern terminus, sharing a concurrency with US 29A/US 70A, until 1991. In 1982, NC 68 was placed on new freeway connecting I-40 and the Piedmont Triad International Airport, its old alignment along Bull Road (today's Regional Road) a secondary road. Future Future NCDOT plans call for the construction of a new four-lane highway connecting NC 68 and US 220\\\\. Starting with a new interchange with I-73 (near Pleasant Ridge Road), improvements will be made along a short section of existing NC 68 before going northwest onto new construction that will bypass east of Oak Ridge and connect with US 220 in Summerfield. This section will become part of I-73. North of Oak Ridge, safety improvements are to be done between East Harrell Road (SR 2111) and Bartonshire Drive (SR 4831). The estimated cost is $1.96 million. Property acquisition is expected to start in December 2014.

Liu Bei was quite impressed by Ma Zhong and praised him highly, comparing him to the recently defected Huang Quan, Zhong was trusted and respected by the following head of the gouvernement Zhuge Liang, Jiang Wan and Fei Yi. After Liu Bei's death, he served under Zhuge Liang during the Southern Campaign and helped to quell the rebellion. He was appointed as the area commander in the south after Li Hui's death. He spends most of his life pacify the region and protecting the people of the south often with the help of Zhang Ni. Ma Zhong was known as a generous and whimsical man but he was also decisive in handling affairs. Hence the southern tribes both feared him and respected him. His duty in the south could be comparable to Wang Ping in the north and Deng Zhi in the east. After his death, the foreigners sorely missed him and later established a temple in his honor. Early life Ma Zhong was a man of Langzhong in Bāxī. When Ma Zhong was a child, he was raised and adopted by his mother's family, hence he was surnamed Hú and named Dǔ. Ma Zhong afterward returned to his surname (back to Mǎ), and changed his name to Zhōng. He became a commandery clerk, at the End of the Han dynasty (196-220). After distinguishing himself in civil affairs, Ma Zhong was later nominated as xiàolián “filial and incorrupt” and sent out as Chief of Hànchāng.(馬忠字德信，巴西閬中人也。少養外家，姓狐，名篤，後乃復姓，改名忠。為郡吏，建安末舉孝廉，除漢昌長。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Meeting Liu Bei When Liu Bei led an eastern campaign in 222 and was defeated at the Battle of Xiaoting. The Administrator of Bāxī, Yan Zhi sent from all the various counties soldiers. And raised 5000 men as replacements for losses during the battle. Then, he put them under Ma Zhong's command to deliver them. Liu Bei had already returned to Yufu County (魚復縣; present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing), which he renamed \\"Yong'an\\" (永安; literally \\"everlasting peace\\"). While he was there and under the recommendation of his Director of the Secretariat Liu Ba, he personally met Ma Zhong and spoke with him of political affairs. Liu Bei was so impressed by Ma Zhong that he said to Liu Ba : Service under Zhuge Liang When Liu Bei died in 223, he named Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents to support Liu Shan. The Chancellor Zhuge Liang opened his office and heard of Liu Bei's endorsement of Zhong's talents. So, he appointed him as Commander Beneath the Gates or supervisor of the palace guards. Zhuge Liang was further impressed by Ma Zhong's good conduct.(三年，亮入南，拜忠牂牁太守。郡丞朱褒反。) ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. In 225, Zhuge Liang launched a campaign against Yong Kai (雍闓)’s rebellion also known as Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign, and appointed Ma Zhong as the Grand Administrator of Zangke, which had been in rebellion since the commander Deputy Zhu Bao (朱褒) defected in 223. After two years of constant revolt, the commandery was unruly yet Ma Zhong quickly quelled the rebels and pacified the region. As the Grand Administrator, he remained in the commandery and helped the region to recover. He proved his skills as an administrator as he brought relief and a harmonious government. Among the people of the region, Zhong deeply had authority and kindness.(叛亂之後，忠撫育卹理，甚有威惠。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. For the next five years, Ma Zhong stayed in Zhangke and helped to restore peace and prosperity to the commandery. However, in 230, Zhuge Liang summoned him to be an Advisor to the Army in Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions, and assisted the Chief Clerk Jiang Wan’s in the gouvernement's affairs during the defense of Shu. For his accomplishments, Zhong was given an office as Advisor in Provincial Internal Government.(八年，召為丞相參軍，副長史蔣琬署留府事。又領州治中從事。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Next year, in 231. Zhuge Liang set out against the foreign tribes Qíshān. Zhong visited where Zhuge Liàng was and helped him in the military affairs. Zhong led the army with the brave Commanding General Zhang Ni and others to quelled the rebelling Qiāng in Wènshān commandery.(明年，亮出祁山，忠詣亮所，經營戎事。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Subjugating southern tribes In 233, the southern foreigner Liu Zhou gathered support among the many tribes and rebelled. His rebellion was such that it disturbed most of the commanderiess. The Commander of Láijiàng Zhang Yi (Bogong) was unable to quell the rebellion and summoned back. However before returning, Zhang Yi gathered supplies to helped Ma Zhong and make sure his army was well provided. Zhong was sent to succeed him. Ma Zhong thereupon led his army and defeated the rebelled army, and finally beheaded Liu Zhou. With his victory, he pacified the southern lands. Ma Zhong was given additional office as Supervisor of the Army and General Exerting Authority with a fief as Marquis of Bóyáng Village.(軍還，督將軍張嶷等討汶山郡叛羌。十一年，南夷豪帥劉冑反，擾亂諸郡。徵庲降都督張翼還，以忠代翼。忠遂斬冑，平南土。加忠監軍奮威將軍，封博陽亭侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Before Zhong arrived and during Yong Kai's rebellion. In Jiànníng commandery, the rebels killed the Administrator Zheng Ang and bounded the other Administrator Zhang Yi (Junsi) but they did not dare to kill him so instead they sent him as a captive to Eastern Wu therefore the Commander by fear had always garrisoned away in Píngyí county. But when Zhong became Commander, he would not do this and moved his headquarters to Wei County, Handan residing among the Han population and foreigners. Also Yuèxī commandery had long been lost territory. And so to retake it, Ma Zhong led with the vanguard general Zhang Ni a victorious campaign against the various tribes and was able to restore the old commandery. For his help, Ma Zhong was promoted to General Who Stabilises the South (安南將軍) and advanced in fief to Marquis of Péngxiāng Village (彭鄉亭侯).(初，建寧郡殺太守正昂，縛太守張裔於吳，故都督常駐平夷縣。至忠，乃移治味縣，處民夷之間。又越嶲郡亦久失土地，忠率將太守張嶷開復舊郡，由此就加安南將軍，進封彭鄉亭侯。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Later life In 242, Laixiang was again a calm territory and Ma Zhong was called back to Chengdu to the Court. After, he was sent to Hànzhōng and met the Marshal-in-Chief Jiang Wan to help oversee the defenses against Cao Wei and deliver an Imperial Order. Jiang Wan also promoted him to Senior General Who Guards the South (鎮南大將軍).(延熙五年還朝，因至漢中，見大司馬蔣琬，宣傳詔旨，加拜鎮南大將軍。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Two years later, in the spring of 244. A large Wei army under the command of Cao Shuang attacked Hanzhong at the Battle of Xingshi. Wang Ping commanded the initial defenses however the General-in-Chief Fei Yi wanted to lead reinforcements to the north. During this time, Ma Zhong was put in charge of the gouvernement affairs in Chengdu, Zhong repaid Yi's trust and did well during his absence. When Fei Yi returned, he sent Zhong back protect the south against the raid of the tribal tribes.(七年春，大將軍費禕北禦魏敵，留忠成都，平尚書事。禕還，忠乃歸南。禕還，忠乃歸南。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Ma Zhong stayed in the south and kept the land peaceful for another 5 years.He died in 249 and was greatly mourned by all of the people of Laixiang, foreign clans and Han. His son Xiū succeeded him. While Xiū's younger brother Huī has his son Yì as a Jìn Administrator of Jianning County.(十二年卒，子脩嗣〔一〕。) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Family Ma Zhong had three sons: Ma Xiu (馬脩), Ma Hui (馬恢) and Ma Rong (馬融). Ma Hui's son, Ma Yi (馬義), served as the Administrator of Jianning Commandery during the Jin dynasty. Appraisal and successors Ma Zhong as a man was generous and had magnanimity but was whimsical, teased and greatly laughed. However when furious it did not show on his face. Yet, in handling affairs he could be decisive and was both authoritative and kind.Therefore the foreigners both feared and loved him. When he died, none of them did not personally go the funeral hall, weeping with utmost sorrow and they established for him a Temple with sacrifices, which up to now [~290] is still present.忠為人寬濟有度量，但詼啁大笑，忿怒不形於色。然處事能斷，威恩並立，是以蠻夷畏而愛之。及卒，莫不自致喪庭，流涕盡哀，為之立廟祀，迄今猶在。)Sanguozhi vol. 43. Zhang Biao was at the time was a famous scholar whose reputation for refinement surpassed Zhong. Yet with the possible exception of Li Hui (Three Kingdoms), Zhong was the most popular area commander for Shu-Han's southern lands. Yan Yu showed ability for achievement and in affairs was meticulous and diligent. Hence with Biao, they continued administering the south after Ma Zhong's death but their authority and merits both did not match those of Ma Zhong.(張表，時名士，清望踰忠。閻宇，宿有功幹，於事精勤。繼踵在忠後，其威風稱績，皆不及忠。 )Sanguozhi vol. 43.

He was also the maternal grandfather of President Theodore Roosevelt and a great-grandfather of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Life and career James Stephens Bulloch was born in Savannah, Georgia to a planter family. His parents were Ann (née Irvine) Bulloch (1770–1810) and her husband, Captain James Bulloch II (1765–1806). He had an elder brother, John Irvine Bulloch, and two younger sisters, Jane and Ann Bulloch. He was educated to become a planter and learned about managing crops and working with overseers to deal with slave labor. =Cotton mills and development of Roswell= Major Bulloch moved his family from Savannah in 1838 to north Georgia to partner with Roswell King in establishing a cotton mill in the piedmont near the fall line. They used water power for their mills. There in what developed as the town of Roswell, Bulloch built Bulloch Hall in 1839 with the labor of African-American slaves and craftsman. Today, his plantation house known as Bulloch Hall has been restored and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Bulloch also developed a plantation in the uplands, where his workers cultivated and processed short-staple cotton, the chief commodity crop. This cotton had been made profitable by invention of the cotton gin, and was planted throughout the piedmont.

The corps was raised from volunteers by German-born Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenbüttel (1771–1815). The Duke was a harsh opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte's occupation of his native Germany. Formed in 1809 when war broke out between the First French Empire and the Austrian Empire, the corps initially comprised a mixed force, around 2,300 strong, of infantry, cavalry and later supporting artillery. Most units of the corps wore black uniforms, leading to the \\"black\\" nicknames of the unit, though some light units (such as sharpshooters and uhlans) wore green uniforms. The Brunswickers wore silvered skull \\"totenkopf\\" badges on their hats. Their title originated from Duke Frederick William, who claimed the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, which the French had abolished in order to incorporate its lands into the French satellite Kingdom of Westphalia. The Black Brunswickers earned themselves a fearsome reputation over the following decade, taking part in several significant battles including the prelude to the Battle of Waterloo, at Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815, where the Duke lost his life. However, recruiting, the replacement of casualties, and finance had always been problematic, and the corps was disbanded in the early 1820s. The exploits of the Brunswickers caught the British Victorian public's imagination: an example of this can be found in John Everett Millais's painting The Black Brunswicker. Completed in 1860, the painting depicts a Brunswicker in his black uniform bidding goodbye to an unnamed woman. Formation and early years =War of the Fifth Coalition= Braunschweiger Totenkopf (Brunswick skull) badge In 1806 the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Charles William Ferdinand, was fatally wounded during the Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. Following Prussia's defeat and the collapse of the Fourth Coalition against Napoleon, his duchy remained under French control. Rather than permit the Duke's heir, Frederick William, to succeed to his father's title, Napoleon seized the duchy and, in 1807, incorporated it into his newly created model Kingdom of Westphalia ruled by his brother Jérôme. Two years later in 1809 the Fifth Coalition against Napoleon was formed between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom. The dispossessed Frederick William, who had been a strenuous critic of French domination in Germany, seized this opportunity to seek Austrian help to raise an armed force. To finance this venture he mortgaged his principality in Oels. In its initial incarnation (dated to 25 July 1809), the 2300-strong 'free' corps consisted of two battalions of infantry, one Jäger battalion, a company of sharpshooters, and a mixed cavalry contingent including hussars and uhlans. Despite a successful campaign with their Austrian allies, the defeat of the latter at the Battle of Wagram on 6 July 1809 led to the Armistice of Znaim on 12 July. William refused to accept this and led his Schwarze Schar (\\"Black Host\\") into Germany, succeeding in briefly taking control of the city of Brunswick. Faced with superior Westphalian forces, the Brunswickers conducted a remarkable fighting retreat across Germany, twice holding off the pursuing armies, at the Battle of Halberstadt and the Battle of Ölper; finally being evacuated by the Royal Navy from the mouth of the River Weser. Landing in England, the Duke was welcomed by his cousin and brother-in-law, the Prince Regent (later King George IV) and the Black Brunswickers entered British service.Haythornthwaite, Philip J (1990), The Napoleonic Source Book, Guild Publishing, (p. 147) During the next few years, the Brunswickers earned themselves a sound reputation through service with the British in the Peninsular Campaign. However, steady attrition in battles and skirmishes through Portugal and Spain, combined with a lack of political support and financial difficulties, led to a situation where the unit's imminent disbandment looked likely. =Peninsular War= When organized for British service, the corps was renamed the Brunswick Oels Jäger and Brunswick Oels Hussar regiments. Prussians represented a large part of the original officer corps, while the enlisted men were motivated by German patriotism. However, once the Oels entered English service, they were cut off from their natural recruiting grounds. Compelled to enlist men from the prisoner of war camps to fill up the ranks, the quality of soldiers in the Oels decreased. Also, the King's German Legion obtained the best of the German recruits, leaving the Oels with the less desirable ones. In addition to Germans, the Oels recruited Poles, Swiss, Danes, Dutch, and Croats. Charles Oman, the Peninsular War historian, calls the Oels a \\"motley crew, much given to desertion\\" and records one occasion where ten men were caught deserting in a body. Of these, four were shot and the rest flogged. Nevertheless, the Brunswick Oels Jägers gave a good account of themselves during the war. The regiment — really a single battalion—arrived in Portugal in early 1811. The Duke of Wellington distributed one company to the 4th Division and two companies to the 5th Division as skirmishers, while the remaining nine companies served in the newly formed 7th Division. The Oels remained in this organization until the end of the war in April 1814. During this period, the Oels served in most of the major battles including Fuentes de Onoro, Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, the Nive, and Orthez. Waterloo campaign Following Napoleon's failed invasion of Russia in 1812, and his subsequent retreat back into France, William was able to return to Brunswick in 1813 to reclaim his title. He also took the opportunity to replenish the ranks of his Black Brunswickers. Upon Napoleon's escape from Elba in 1815 he once more placed himself under the Duke of Wellington's command and joined the allied forces of the Seventh Coalition in Belgium. The \\"Brunswick Corps\\", as it is called in the order of battle for the Waterloo Campaign, formed up as a discrete division in the allied reserve. Its strength is given as 5,376 men, composed of eight infantry battalions: one advance guard or Avantgarde, one life guard or Leib-Bataillon, three light and three line battalions. They were supported by both a horse and foot artillery battery of eight guns each. Also included were a regiment of Brunswicker hussars while a single squadron of uhlans were often attached to the allied cavalry corps. =Battle of Quatre Bras= Quatre Bras was a hamlet at a strategic crossroads on the road to Brussels. French control of it would not only threaten the city, but divide Wellington's allied army from Blucher's Prussians. At 14:00 on 16 June 1815, after some initial skirmishing, the main French force under Marshall Ney, approached Quatre Bras from the south. They came up against the 2nd Netherlands Division who had formed a line well in advance of the crossroads. Facing three French infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the Dutch and Nassau troops were forced back but did not break. Reinforcements arrived at 15:00, being a Dutch cavalry brigade, Picton's 5th British Division, followed closely by the Brunswick Corps. The sharpshooters of the Brunswick Advance Guard regiment were sent to support Dutch skirmishers in Bossou Wood on the allied right (western) flank; the rest of the corps took up a reserve position across the Brussels road.Battle of Quatre Bras: Allies' reinforcements The Duke reassured his inexperienced troops by walking up and down in front of them, calmly puffing on his pipe.Von Pivka 1973 (p.23) Brunswick line infantry at Quatre-Bras. Jagers of the advance guard are on the left. A French infantry attack was halted by the allied front line, which was attacked in turn by French cavalry. Wellington moved the Brunswick infantry into the front line, where they were subjected to intense French artillery fire, forcing them to fall back a short distance. As a mass of French infantry advanced up the main road, the Duke led a charge by his uhlans, but they were beaten back. Swept by canister shot at short range, the Brunswickers broke and rallied at the crossroads itself. At this point, the Duke, who was reforming his troops, was hit by a musket ball, which passed through his hand and into his liver. He was rescued by the men of the Leib Regiment, who carried him back using their muskets as a stretcher. He died shortly afterwards. The Duke's final words, to his aide Major von Wachholtz, were: Colonel Elias Olfermann was the Duke's adjutant general, who assumed immediate command of the corps.Anglo-Allied Army in Flanders and France - 1815: Changes in Command and Organization Wellington then ordered the Brunswick hussars to make an unsupported counterattack on the French light cavalry brigade, but they were driven off by heavy fire. Later in the battle, French cuirassiers broke the allied front line and were only prevented from taking the crossroads by the Brunswick infantry who had formed themselves into squares. By 21:00, allied reinforcements, including the newly arrived Brunswick 1st and 3rd light regiments, had driven the French back to their starting positions.Battle of Quatre Bras: Wellington's offensive Brunswick losses that day amounted to 188 killed and 396 wounded.Von Pivka 1973 (p.24) =Battle of Waterloo= Only two days later, on Sunday 18 June, the Duke of Wellington positioned his Anglo-allied army along a ridge near the village of Waterloo, in order to block Napoleon's advance along the road to Brussels. The Brunswick Corps formed part of Wellington's reserve corps, under his personal command. In that capacity, they were kept well behind the crest of the ridge and avoided casualties during the opening French bombardment. In the early part of the afternoon, the British Foot Guards moved down the slope to reinforce the Château d'Hougoumont, which was under fierce French attack; the Brunswick Corps was brought forward to take their place. At about 16:00, Ney decided to attempt to break the centre right of the Anglo-allied line with his cavalry. Some 4,800 French horsemen charged up the hill and into the allied infantry, who had formed themselves into squares to resist them. In all, 9,000 cavalry were involved in repeated attacks on the allied squares but were unable to break any of them, including the Brunswickers, who some British officers regarded as \\"shaky\\". The Brunswick hussars and uhlans, who formed part of the 7th British Cavalry Brigade, made harrying attacks on the French whenever they retired to regroup. Eventually, Ney had no choice but to abandon the attacks. The French capture of the fortified farm of La Haye Sainte had left a gap in the centre of Wellington’s line, and the Brunswick infantry were brought along to fill it. It was here that Napoleon sent one of two attacks by his imperial guard in a last effort to break Wellington’s army. Faced with the veterans of the grenadiers of the middle guard, the inexperienced Brunswickers broke from the line and \\"fell back in disorder\\", but rallied when they reached the cavalry reserve in the rear. The same fate befell the Nassau Infantry Regiment and two British battalions. Finally, the guards were halted and thrown back when they were surprised by a flank attack from allied troops. The Brunswick Corps had recovered sufficiently to participate in the allied “general advance” that swept the French army from the field. British sources give the number of Brunswickers killed in action that day as 154 with 456 wounded and 50 missing.Von Pivka 1973, p. 29. In the following days, they escorted 2,000 French prisoners back to Brussels and then marched on to Paris. They finally returned to Brunswick on 6 December 1815.The Black Brunswickers, Ludwig Baer Brunswick Oels infantry and sharpshooters (right), 1809 Brunswick Oels uhlans (left) and a hussar, 1809  Uniform  The Brunswickers were awarded various nicknames by their contemporaries, including the Black Crows, the Black Legion and the Black Horde. However, although the uniforms of the individual units that comprised the corps were, as the names suggest, predominantly black, they varied in their details. *Infantry units in 1809 wore a black polrock or \\"Polish coat\\", a type of frock coat derived from a Lithuanian garment called a litewka which had six pairs of black lace fastenings down the front. Trousers were black with a side stripe of light blue. A tall collar and shoulder straps also in the regimental colour. The backpack and other equipment were of Austrian design and manufacture.Von Pivka, p.33 The Sharpshooter companies wore a dark green Prussian-style coatee and a tall hat of Austrian origin with an elongated brim turned-up at one side.Von Pivka, p.34 In the Peninsular War, the polrock was replaced by a short black koller or cavalry-style tunic. Equipment and badges of rank were of British pattern. Trousers were black with a side stripe of light blue; footwear was black shoes with buttoned gaiters. They wore a shako on their heads, with a death's head badge for the Leib battalion or a hunting horn badge for light infantry. The hussar cavalry were garbed in a black, light blue collared dolman, sometimes with a black pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight breeches of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black Shako. The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design.Von Pivka, p.36 The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being a copy of the Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a red and yellow pennon.Von Pivka, p.35 By 1815, the Uhlans were wearing all-black uniforms, the czapka was now topped light blue and piped and crossed on top in yellow.Philip Haythornthwaite, Uniforms Of Waterloo In Colour, Blandford Press Ltd, Poole, 1974, (p. 125) For the 1815 Waterloo Campaign, three new line battalions and three new light battalions were added to the ducal forces. These units wore the black koller, with black trousers with a side stripe in each regiment's facing colour; footwear was black shoes with buttoned gaiters. They wore a shako on their heads, with white metal \\"amazon\\" style plates for the line battalions or a white metal hunting horn badge for light infantry. The line battalions wore a short light blue over yellow \\"carrot\\" pompom; that of the light battalions was yellow over light blue and the Leib Battalion continued to wear the falling black horsehair plume and the death's head badge. Artillerymen wore similar clothing to the cavalry: mostly black in colour with a koller and black trousers. They were additionally equipped with a standard hussar sword should they have need to defend their guns. There are a number of speculative theories on the origin of the Brunswickers' dark and seemingly grim choice of garb. It has been suggested that black was chosen to mourn Duke Frederick William's late father; as a sign of respect for the Duke; or in mourning for the Duke's occupied homeland. Colonel Augustus Frazer, who had served alongside the Brunswickers, reported that black was adopted in mourning for the Duke's wife, Princess Marie of Baden, who had died in 1808, and that the black uniforms would not be put aside until Brunswick had been finally liberated. The black clothing of the Brunswicker soldier became closely associated across Germany with the liberation movement of 1813. Accordingly even after Brunswick became a member of the North German Confederation in 1866 and the German Empire in 1871 the military units of the Dukedom retained the special privilege of wearing uniforms in black, in marked contrast to the Prussian blue of most of the other member states. This distinction lasted until April 1892 when a new military convention between Brunswick and Prussia did away with the special status and uniforms of the Brunswick regiments. The Black Brunswicker by John Everett Millais, painted in 1860 Inspired art The Black Brunswicker (1860), by John Everett Millais was inspired in part by the exploits of the Brunswickers and in part by the contrasts of black broadcloth and pearl-white satin in a moment of tender conflict. The artwork took an estimated three months to paint, and it was greatly admired at the time. It was also bought for the highest price Millais had received from dealer and publisher Ernest Gambart - the lucrative sum of 100 guineas. Later, in 1898, William Hesketh Lever purchased the work for his private collection. Charles Dickens' daughter Kate was used as a model for the woman seen in the painting. Later years A single infantry regiment and the hussars were maintained by the Duchy of Brunswick after the end of the Napoleonic War. In 1830, the uniform colour was changed to blue, but reverted to black in 1850.Prebben Kannik, Military Uniforms in Colour, Blandford Press 1968 (p.224) The Brunswick units were integrated into the Prussian Army in 1866 with the titles: Braunschweigisches Infanterie-Regiment Nr.92 and Braunschweigisches Husaren Regiment Nr.17 following the Prussian regimental numbering sequence. Both units kept the skulls with the crossed bones on their helmets and caps and carried the battle honours \\"Peninsula-Sicily-Waterloo\\" until the end of World War I in 1918, when they were disbanded.Wilson History & Research Centre: The Black Brunswickers by Ludwig Baer At that time, a collection of artefacts and uniforms from the Napoleonic era were presented by the officers of the corps to the Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum, where they remain.Von Pivka (1973) p.9 The historic black of the Brunswick Corps was retained by the Husaren Regiment Nr.17 in full dress parade uniform until the outbreak of war in August 1914. The Brunswick Infanterie-Regiment Nr.92 however adopted the dark blue tunic of the Prussian line infantry.Verlag Starnberg, \\"Die Uniformen der Deutschen Armee\\", Sources See also * The Sacred Band (1821) set up by Alexander Ypsilantis had uniforms inspired by the Black Brunswickers Further reading * Hugo von Franckenberg-Ludwigsdorff: Erinnerungen an das Schwarze Corps, welches Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm von Braunschweig-Oels im Jahre 1809 errichtete.

Halimeter was introduced in the early 1990s as an adjunct method for determining halitosis (bad breath, oral malodor) levels, alongside human assessment of odor levels (the latter is considered the gold standard). The instrument measures parts per billion levels of hydrogen sulfide and, to a lesser extent, methyl mercaptan, two gases which were previously shown to be associated with bad breath using gas chromatograph by Dr. Joseph Tonzetich in the late 1960s. The Halimeter is manufactured by Interscan Corp. in California, and based on their earlier model 1170 portable sulfide monitor. This was the model used in the two original studies. These studies, conducted for the first time by Dr. Mel Rosenberg, showed a significant correlation between monitor levels and oral malodor scores. The small size, simplicity of use, and price (relative to gas chromatograph) of the Halimeter made it popular among dentists seeking to diagnose and treat bad breath, as well as scientific researchers. Much of the published research on bad breath over the past dozen years has employed this instrument. The electrochemical sensor is sensitive to alcohol vapors, and requires recalibration over time. The Halimeter has been the only VSC monitor for the diagnosis of halitosis for years, but now that its patent has expired, it faces competition from other sulfur monitors recently introduced into the marketplace. More recently, the portable gas chromatograph, \\"OralChroma\\" has been recommended in the diagnosis of halitosis, as the Halimeter does not detect dimethyl sulfide, which is thought by some to be elevated in extraoral causes of halitosis. The OralChroma detects dimethyl sulfide in a semi objective manner, and hence is able to differentiate between oral malodor (intraoral halitosis) and extra-oral halitosis. The halimeter is therefore not indicated if extra-oral halitosis is suspected (its use will only be able to rule out intra-oral halitosis), but is useful for diagnosis and clinical monitoring of intra-oral halitosis.

Lauren Bacall was originally cast in the part eventually played by Rogers. Bacall turned it down and was put on suspension by Warner Bros. for her defiance.. Plot Marsha Mitchell (Ginger Rogers), a traveling dress model, stops in the town of Rockpoint to see her newlywed sister, Lucy Rice (Doris Day). Within minutes of entering the town she notices unusual behavior by the townsfolk, such as dozens of people closing up shop and getting out of sight. As she walks down the almost-pitch-black main street, she hears loud noises coming from the police station. She hides but sees a drunken KKK mob, beating and berating a man whom they had just broken out of jail. The man untangles himself from their clutches, and he starts to run but goes only a few yards before someone in the mob twice fires a shotgun, killing him by striking him in the torso and the head. The mob, confused, approaches the fallen man, arguing among themselves. Marsha, hiding around a corner from the crime scene, gets a good look at two of the men, who have removed their hoods during the violence. After the mob quickly leaves the scene, Marsha runs to the nearby bowling alley, where her sister works. Lucy quickly notices the shocked and horrified look on her sister's face and inquires. Marsha tells her about the murder she just witnessed, which causes Lucy to tell her about the undercover work of Walter Adams, who, she believes, must have been the slain man. She explains that Adams arrived in town recently and got a job with the phone company, but he was secretly a journalist, writing critical material about the town's klavern. The police decided to put an end to his reporting and arrested him on a false charge of driving while intoxicated. Lucy takes Marsha to her home and encourages her to tell her husband, Hank, about what Marsha saw. However, there is a problem: As soon as Marsha meets Hank, she recognizes him as one of the two men who removed their hoods. Within minutes, while Marsha and Lucy are alone (at least she thinks they are alone), Marsha tells her sister that her husband was one of the Klansmen. Hank, eavesdropping, with a clear look of guilt on his face, denies everything. However, he's not able to hold his own against Marsha's insistence, so he confesses. He sobs and says that he was drunk and was forced to go with the other men to the scene, and did not intend for the man to die. All they wanted to do, according to Hank, was to talk to the guy and persuade him to leave and to stop criticizing their town. Hank then desperately tries to persuade Marsha to keep her mouth shut for the sake of his life and his marriage to her sister, who is pregnant. Lucy forgives her husband and decides that he was simply a part of something beyond his control. Marsha, still viewing him as a vile person, reluctantly agrees to leave town and \\"forget\\" about the incident. District Attorney Burt Rainey (Ronald Reagan) arrives at the murder scene and asks the police about how they could let a mob break through their doors and kidnap one of their prisoners, reminding them of their duty to protect the inmates. They claimed that they were simply outnumbered; Rainey, however, feels skeptical of that excuse, and he suggests that they were accomplices. He then arrives at the bowling alley and questions Charlie Barr (Hugh Sanders), the Imperial Wizard of the town's KKK, but he gets no answer. He then learns about Marsha and requires her to meet him in his office the next morning. Many townsfolk try to dissuade Rainey from investigating the case, for fear of his destroying the town's reputation and economy. At Rainey's office he questions Marsha and gets a half-truth - that she saw Klansmen but did not get a look at their faces because of their hoods. Rainey feels satisfied, and he believes that the mere fact of her having seen Klansmen is enough to bring them down. He hands her a subpoena for the inquest, which will take place that afternoon. Under pressure from both her sister and the Klansmen, she decides to lie in court, allowing the coroner's jury to decide that Adams died at the hands of one or more assailants unknown. The KKK, along with the sympathetic locals, celebrates at the bowling alley, while berating those against them. Disgusted with herself, Marsha packs up her stuff at Lucy's house so that she can leave town. However, Hank, drunk, arrives home and corners her, asking her repeatedly why she dislikes him. He then becomes violent and tries to rape her, but Lucy arrives and interrupts. Lucy finally denounces him, then Marsha tells him that she has rethought her testimony, and that she will turn him in to Rainey and the police. Furious, he kidnaps her and takes her to the KKK rally, where a functionary starts to whip Marsha until Lucy, Rainey, and the police arrive. Barr orders his men to hide Marsha and keep her quiet. While Rainey stands before Barr, the latter threatens him and tells him to leave. Rainey ignores him and snoops around, finding Marsha, weeping, in the custody of a couple of Klansmen. He then confronts Barr and demands answers. Desperate, Barr names Hank as the murderer. Hank, stealing a sidearm from one of the Klansmen, shouts in fury, condemning everyone, and he shoots his wife, then a cop shoots Hank with an automatic weapon, killing him. Scared and disillusioned, the rest of the Klansmen, many of whom drop their costumes, flee the scene, leaving Barr, the grand wizard, to fend for himself. The police arrest Barr, and the film ends with Lucy's dying in Marsha's arms and Rainey's comforting Marsha.

Unfortunately, an all-too-familiar conventionality of elements and plot is evident in the screen play which Daniel Fuchs and Richard Brooks have prepared. The forces opposing the prosecutor line up just as you feel they will, his key witness fails him as you figure—at first, that is—and then she falls in line when she sees how horribly and unjustly her silence permits the villains to behave. The consequence is a smoothly flowing, mechanically melodramatic film, superficially forceful but lacking real substance or depth.\\" Critic Dennis Schwartz believed the film trivialized the topic of bigotry. He wrote, \\"A Warner Brothers social conscience film that's good on spectacle but trivializes the serious subject of race hatred with an inadequate depiction of the KKK, as it pays more attention to the melodrama than to any message. Stuart Heisler (The Glass Key/Dallas/Tulsa) tries to weave a well-intentioned anti-Klan film by working into the plot various forms of violence and intimidation the KKK exerts on a small Southern town ... It has the look and spark of the usual Warner Bros. crime drama, but delivers the public safety message that Americans won't or shouldn't tolerate in their neck of the woods a thuggish organization like the KKK (sort of like their 'crime doesn't pay' messages they leave with their formulaic bloody gangster pics). Surprisingly the racial hate message of the Klan is never touched upon. These Ku Klux Klan members seem to be only interested in keeping outsiders away from their town, dressing up in their robed costumes to act tough while in disguise and using the Klan to hide their thieving criminal activities.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

(2001). 성철스님 시봉이야기. Seoul: 김영사. (Wontek. (2001). Seongcheol Seunim Sibong Iyagi. Seoul: Kimyoungsa.) He was a key figure in modern Korean Buddhism, being responsible for significant changes to it from the 1950s to 1990s. Seongcheol was widely recognized in Korea as having been a living Buddha, due to his extremely ascetic lifestyle, the duration and manner of his meditation training, his central role in reforming Korean Buddhism in the post-World War II era, and the quality of his oral and written teachings. Life =Early life= Born on April 10, 1912 in Korea under the name of Yi Yeongju(이영주), Seongcheol was the first of seven children of a Confucian scholar in Gyeongsang province. He was rumored to have been an exceptionally bright child who read constantly, having learned to read at the age of three, and being proficient enough to read such Chinese classics as Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Journey to the West by age ten. His enthusiasm for reading was such that he once traded a sack of rice for Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a teenager.인터넷 사바세계와 함께 하는 성철큰스님 Having read numerous books on philosophy and religion, both Western and Eastern, he reportedly felt dissatisfied, being convinced that these could not lead him to truth. One day, a Seon monk gave Seongcheol a copy of Song of Enlightenment (Hangul: 증도가, Hanja: 證道歌), a Seon text written by Yongjia Xuanjue (永嘉玄覺) in the Tang dynasty. Seongcheol felt as if \\"a bright light had suddenly been lit in complete darkness,\\" and that he had finally found the way to the ultimate truth. Immediately, he started meditating on the \\"Mu\\" gong-an (Japanese: koan) and started ignoring all his responsibilities at home. Deciding that his parents' house had too many distractions, he promptly packed his bags and went to Daewonsa (Daewon temple). After obtaining permission to stay in the temple, the young Seongcheol started to meditate intensively. Later in life, he would say that he attained the state of Dongjeong Ilyeo (see Teachings below, Hangul: 동정일여, Hanja: 動靜一如) at this early point in his life in only forty-two days. The rumor of a lay person meditating so intensely naturally spread to the main temple of Haeinsa(해인사). Under the recommendations of renowned Seon Masters Gim Beomnin and Choe Beomsul, the young Seongcheol left for Haeinsa in the winter of 1936. At the time, Seon Master Dongsan was the spiritual leader of Haeinsa, and recognizing Seongcheol's great potential, he recommended he become a monk. But Seongcheol refused, stating that he had absolutely no intention of becoming a monk and that only intense meditation was important. But Dongsan master's dharma talk during the following retreat season changed his mind: :\\"There is a way. No one will reveal the secret. You must enter the door yourself. But there is no door. In the end, there is not even a way.\\" In March 1937, Yi Yeongju received his dharma name of Seongcheol, forsook all relations with the outside world, and became a monk, writing this poem: =Enlightenment= In the tradition of Korean Buddhist monks, Seongcheol wandered from one temple to the next after each meditation retreat. In the summer of 1940, he went into deep meditation at the Geum Dang Seon Center and attained enlightenment. Having become a monk at the age of 25, he had attained his true nature in only three years. He went on to write his enlightenment poem: Having attained enlightenment, Seongcheol began pilgrimages to various temples in order to validate his experience and to examine other monks and their levels of attainment. But he was frequently disappointed, noticing that inka (validation of a monk's attainment by a master) was given too carelessly, thereby falsely recognizing many monks as having fully attained enlightenment. During his retreat at Songgwangsa, he was also dismayed at Jinul's theory of Dono Jeomsu (sudden enlightenment, gradual training), and how it was the widespread theory during the time. Later during the 1980s and 1990s, his contribution to the revival of Hui Neng's traditional theory of Dono Donsu (sudden enlightenment, sudden training) would have a significant effect on the practice of Seon in Korea, China, Japan, and other countries where Seon/Zen is practiced. =Growing reputation and recognition= Seongcheol's reputation soon began to spread. Numerous factors contributed to his growing recognition. One of the more famous anecdotes is Seongcheol's Jangjwa Bulwa (Hangul: 장좌불와, Hanja: 長坐不臥). Literally translated as 'long sitting, no lying,' it is a meditation technique that some monks employ to intensify their practice. Sitting meditation is equivalent to most other practices, except that the practitioner does not lie down to sleep, but stays in the lotus position even during sleep, with the intention of minimizing sleep through the position. Seongcheol was known to have practiced this for eight years after his enlightenment. He reportedly never once laid down and denied sleeping at all. Another anecdote recounts how while Seongcheol was staying in Mangwolsa in Dobong mountain, an old monk by the name of Chunseong refused to believe this. He wanted to catch Seongcheol dozing off to sleep, so spied on him secretly throughout one night. But having witnessed the truth of the rumor, Chunseong was struck with amazement and himself started employing the technique. It is said that the stress of the practice and the old age at which he started the technique caused all of his teeth to fall out later in life. Seongcheol's reputation for intensive practice was not limited only to his meditation per se. He was also known to be completely indifferent to the outside world, focused intently only on meditation and guiding fellow monks to enlightenment. His indifference was so thorough that he even refused to see his mother when she visited him at Mahayunsa in Kumgangsan mountain. \\"No need to see her\\" was reportedly his reply to her visit, to which his fellow monks burst out in anger, stating that although they were monks devoted to asceticism and meditation, refusing to see his own mother was too extreme an action. Afterwards, Seongcheol accompanied his mother, showing her the sites of Kumgangsan mountain. =Reformation of Korean Buddhism= Bong Am Sa On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered unconditionally, thereby ending World War II and the occupation of Korea. The events offered an invaluable opportunity for the reformation of Korean Buddhism, which had been severely oppressed during the Japanese occupation. As an emerging leader of Korean Buddhism, Seongcheol joined the nascent discussions on the emerging plans to reform the religion. Forming a partnership with such luminaries as the venerable Jawoon, Cheongdam, and Hyanggok, the future leaders of Korean Buddhism chose Bong Am Sa temple of Heui Yang mountain. There, they formed a pact to live strictly according to the Vinaya, the Buddhist code of ethics. The members agreed upon rules of conduct (Hangul: 공주규약, Hanja: 共住規約) and required strict adherence to it amongst themselves: #To follow the Vinaya and practice the teachings of the patriarchs in order to attain the great enlightenment. #With the exception of the Buddhist teachings, no personal opinions or philosophies will be tolerated. #The necessary items for daily living should be obtained on his own, without dependence on lay people, including daily chores of field work, firewood, etc. #Absolutely no assistance from the lay people in terms of cooking, clothing, alms, or gifts. #To eat only gruel in the morning, and to not eat at all after noon. #The monks' sitting order follows the dates of ordination. #To only meditate and be silent in the rooms. The reformation movement started around a small group of monks centered on Seongcheol, but quickly grew by reputation, attracting monks all over the country who were also intent on bringing back the Korean tradition of intense meditation, strict celibacy, and study of sutras. Among these younger generations were Weolsan (월산), Ubong (우봉), Bomun (보문), Seongsu (성수), Dou (도우), Hyeam (혜암), Beopjeon (법전), etc. Not only did this group become the future leaders of Korean Buddhism, but produced two Supreme Patriarchs (Hyeam, Beopjeon) and three chief administrators of the Jogye order. Post-Bong- amsa Unfortunately, the Bong Am Sa experiment ended prematurely in 1950 when the Korean War broke out on the peninsula. With constant bombing raids and the presence of soldiers of both sides around the temple, it was impossible to continue the strict monastic life of Bong-amsa. Some of the reforms that occurred during this period were: *unification of robes, including the color (mostly grey), cut, and seasonal variants *rectification of the Jogye order's bylaws *unification of Buddhist services *instatement of the monastic educational curriculum After the war, the reformation gained momentum and significant changes were set in motion, although it would be years until they were solidified. Central to the reformation was the issue of celibacy. While all the Buddhist canons emphasized the celibacy of monks, Japanese Buddhism had undergone significant changes during the Meiji Restoration, most notably the end of monastic celibacy. During the Japanese occupation, Korean Buddhism was severely oppressed and the Japanese style was advocated, thereby converting most Korean monks into little more than monastic residents officiating over ceremonies, married, with a business and income. Seongcheol and the new leaders were very critical of the Japanese style of Buddhism, maintaining that the tradition of celibacy, hermitage, poverty, and intense meditation were not only central to Korean Buddhism but to the true spirit of Buddhism as a whole. Korean post-war sentiments towards Japan could not have been worse at this time, and with the help of the populace and president Syngman Rhee, the traditional Korean style began to take hold and became the dominant form of Buddhism by the 1970s. Seongcheol insisted on giving away all monastic assets to the public and reverting to the original Buddhist way of wandering and begging for alms while investing all energy into meditation. He contended this was the only surefire way for true reforms to take place, warning that otherwise, full-scale conflict could ensue between bikkhus and married monks fighting over temples. The leaders of the reformation refused to follow, stating that his assertions were too extreme. Seongcheol's predictions, though, did come true and Korean Buddhism has had numerous conflicts between monks over temple jurisdiction ever since then up to the present day, many of them escalating to violent measures by both sides (e.g. paying gangsters to physically harm opponents). Many ordination restrictions were loosened by the bikkhus in order to increase their numbers in their efforts to assume control over temples such that men of questionable social standing (e.g. former convicts and criminals) were ordained as bikkhus, leading to more violent fights amongst monks. A particularly embarrassing chapter in Korean Buddhism was in the late 1990s when monks fought over Jogyesa, the main administrative temple in Seoul, by not only employing gangsters but joining the fight themselves using weapons, including Molotov cocktails, to violently subdue each other.Violent clashes in the Jogye order =Ten years as a hermit in Seongjeonam= In 1955, Seongcheol was appointed as the patriarch of Haeinsa, but disappointed by the direction that the reformation was taking, Seongcheol declined, removing himself from the forefront and moved to a hermitage near Pagyesa in the Palgong mountains near Daegu to deepen the meditative and enlightened stage that he had attained. The hermitage was named Seongjeonam and it was here that Seongcheol began to build the scholarly foundations that would later support his spiritual teachings. Seongcheol surrounded the hermitage with barbed wire so as to keep outsiders out (except for a few assistants) and himself within its boundaries. Never leaving the boundaries of the small hermitage for an incredible ten years, he deepened his meditation and studied the ancient Buddhist canons, Zen texts, sutras, modern mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and even taught himself English so as to keep current on international affairs. This decade of self-education would affect his future teachings significantly. =Haeinsa and the Hundred-Day Talk= Seongcheol finally opened the doors of Seong Juhn Am hermitage in 1965. The temple he visited was Gimyongsa, where he gave his first dharma talk in a decade. In 1967, with the insisting of Jawoon, Seongcheol became the patriarch of Haeinsa temple. That winter, he started his daily two-hour dharma talks to monks and the lay people, thereby beginning his famous Hundred-Day Talk (Hangul: 백일법문, Hanja: 百日法門.) Applying his decade of scholarly studies, he began to break the stereotype of the \\"boring and stuffy\\" dharma talks and transformed them into an electrifying hybrid of Buddhism, spiritualism, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and current affairs, ushering in a new kind of dharma talk aimed at reaching the modern audience living in an age of globalization and intellectual diversity. =Supreme Patriarch of the Jogye order= Ushering in a revival of the Seon tradition of intense meditation and strict monastic lifestyle, Seongcheol spearheaded the reformation of modern Korean Buddhism from the rubbles of Japanese colonialism into an epicenter of meditation training. During his tenure as patriarch of Haeinsa, the temple transformed into a training ground for meditation, sutra studies, and Vinaya studies, attracting monks from all over the country. The meditation center averaged approximately 500 monks per biannual retreat, which was unheard of since the days of Hui Neng and Ma Tzu. During the 1970s, the political climate became even more militaristic and dictatorial, eventually leading to a purge of many Buddhist monks suspected of political involvement. With his increasing reputation as a living Buddha both by the lay and the monastic, the Jogye order looked toward Seongcheol and nominated him as the next Supreme Patriarch of the order. \\"If I can help reform and improve Korean Buddhism, I will humbly accept\\" was the response he gave. His inauguration speech brought him from a little known monk, only known by monks and devout lay people, into the limelight as the official leader of Korean Buddhism, bringing his teachings to the entire nation: Declining all formal ceremonies as Supreme Patriarch from inauguration to his death, Seongcheol never left the mountains, stating that a monk's true place was in the temple. There was initially a huge protest against his semi-hermetic policy, but this was eventually replaced by sense of respect that had been lacking since the Joseon period, and helped to vastly improve the image and treatment of monks in Korea. During his years as patriarch of Haeinsa and as Supreme Patriarch of the Jogye order, Seongcheol's reputation kept growing. Amongst monks, he was famous for being a very strict teacher, being called the tiger of Kaya mountain. When monks would nod off to sleep during meditation, he would beat them with wooden sticks while yelling, \\"Thief, pay for your rice!\\" (referring to the donations of the lay, and the monks' debts to society and therefore his duty to practice to the utmost of his abilities). He was also known for his unique three thousand prostrations. After the Korean war, Seongcheol built a small cave-hermitage near Anjungsa temple and named it Cheonjegul. Around this time, many people came to pay their respects to him, and to further guide the pilgrims in their practice, Seongcheol first started using his famous 3000 prostrations. Nobody could visit with him unless the person completed 3000 prostrations in front of the statue of the Buddha in the main hall. Later, some lay people would accuse Seongcheol of arrogance, but he maintained that this practice was used to help guide practitioners in their own practice by helping them destroy their ego and more easily attain one-mindedness (N.B.: the 3000 full prostrations are actually a mainstay of the Korean Buddhist training regimen, performed at most temples in Korea on a monthly basis. It would take approximately eight to twelve hours, depending on the experience of the practitioner, and the technique is used frequently to \\"clear the mind,\\" instill a sense of humility, and increase the awareness and focusing power of the practitioner). As his fame and reputation grew, the prostrations became more necessary as more and more people asked to meet with him. What was unique was that this requirement was uniform, i.e., he would never make any exceptions regardless of the person's wealth, fame, or power. A famous anecdote serves to illustrate the daunting task of the 3000 prostrations and Seongcheol's strict adherence to his own rules. When Park Chung-hee, the president of Korea, was opening up the new highway between Seoul and Pusan, he happened to visit Haeinsa. Hearing that the president was visiting, the head administrative monk quickly sent word to Seongcheol to come down from his hermitage to greet the president. But true to form, Seongcheol demanded the president go to the main Buddha hall and perform the 3000 prostrations before meeting with him. Park refused and the two never met. =Publications= During the latter years of his life, Seongcheol presided over many publications, including eleven books of his lectures and 37 books that translated many Zen classics not well known to the general public (see official website). The former included the full transcriptions of the Hundred- Day Talk, lectures on Huineng's sutra, Shin Sim Myung (Hangul: 신심명, Hanja: 信心銘), Jeung Do Ga (Hangul: 증도가, Hanja: 證道歌), Illumination of Sudden Enlightenment (Hangul: 돈오입도요문론, Hanja: 頓悟入道要門論), and his dharma talks. The latter was called Seon Lim Go Gyung Chong Suh (Hangul: 선림고경총서, Hanja: 禪林古鏡叢書) and was a collection of Chinese and Korean Zen classics that until publication was known mostly only to monks. These publications helped to spread his teachings to the general public and raise the general awareness and knowledge of Buddhism. English translations of Great Master Seongcheol's work include \\"Echoes from Mt. Kaya\\", Changgyonggak Publishing, Seoul, 1988 (currently out of print), and \\"Opening the Eye\\", Gimmyeong International Co., Seoul, 2002. Both are translations from Korean by Brian Barry. =Death= On November 4, 1993, Seongcheol died in Haeinsa Toesoeldang, the same room in which he had first become ordained as a monk. His last words to his followers were: \\"Meditate well\\". His parinirvana poem was: Seongcheol had this explanation for the cryptic poem: His death was followed by the largest funeral ever seen in Korean history for a monk, with over 100,000 people attending. His cremation took over thirty hours and his sarira numbered over a hundred. Teachings Seongcheol's teachings can be summarized into five big categories: =Sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation= Citing Taego Bou (太古普愚: 1301-1382) as the true successor of the Linji Yixuan (臨済義玄) line of patriarchs rather than Jinul (知訥: 1158-1210), he advocated Hui Neng's original stance of 'sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation' (Hangul: 돈오돈수, Hanja: 頓悟頓修) as opposed to Jinul's stance of 'sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation' (Hangul: 돈오점수, Hanja: 頓悟漸修).퇴옹 성철.

Whereas Jinul had initially asserted that with enlightenment comes the need to further one's practice by gradually destroying the karmic vestiges attained through millions of rebirths, Huineng and Seongcheol maintained that with perfect enlightenment, all karmic remnants disappear and one becomes a Buddha immediately.퇴옹 성철.

Haeinsa Baekryun'am (Korea): Jang'gyung'gak.) , =Middle Way= He also expounded on the true definition of the Middle Way (Hangul: 중도, Hanja: 中道), stating that it was not limited to avoiding the two extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification as many understood, but that it was also an explanation of the state of nirvana where all dualities fuse and cease to exist as separate entities, where good and bad, self and non-self become meaningless. He compared this to the common misconception that had ruled pre- Einsteinian physics, that energy and mass were two separate entities, but which Einstein had elucidated as interchangeable dual forms with the relationship described by E=mc², thereby proving the equivalence of one to the other. He also compared this to the fusion of space and time into spacetime, and also formed the analogy of ice and water. The Middle Way is not the 'middle' or 'average' of ice and water, but the true form of each, H2O, and maintained that the state of nirvana was also like this, a state where the true form of all dualities is revealed as equivalent. =Gong'an practice= Seongcheol strongly advocated the gong'an (Hangul: 공안, Hanja: 公案) meditation technique, asserting that it was the fastest and safest way to enlightenment. The most common gong'ans he would give to the lay and his followers were: #Not mind, not a thing, not Buddha, what is this? (Hangul: 마음도 아니고, 물건도 아니고, 부처도 아닌 것, 이것이 무엇인고?, Hanja: 不是心, 不是物, 不是佛, 是什麼?) #A monk once asked Dongsan Chan Master,\\"What is Buddha?\\" Dongsan replied, \\"Three pounds of flax\\" (Hangul: 마삼근, Hanja: 麻三斤). =In deep sleep, one mind= Seongcheol also set a clear benchmark that the practitioner could apply to gauge his level of practice. Throughout his life, many followers came to him to obtain acknowledgement of their enlightenment. He was dismayed at the number of people who thought they had attained perfect enlightenment by experiencing some mental phenomenon during their practice. He therefore reiterated that every enlightened person from the Buddha and on had asserted the same definition of what enlightenment is. True attainment, he quoted, came only after going beyond the level of being able to meditate in deep sleep. Only after being able to meditate on a gong'an continuously, without interruption, throughout the waking state, then the dreaming state, and finally in deep sleep, one reaches the state where enlightenment can become possible. Before any of this, one should never claim to have become enlightened, even though there may be many instances of weird mental phenomena that happen during one's practice. The levels he identified were: #In the waking state, one mind (Hangul: 동정일여, Hanja: 動靜一如): the state where the practitioner can meditate on a gong'an continuously throughout the day without interruption, even through talking and thinking. #In the dreaming state, one mind (Hangul: 몽중일여, Hanja: 夢中一如): the state where the practitioner can meditate on a gong'an continuously in the dreaming state. #In deep sleep, one mind (Hangul: 숙면일여, Hanja: 熟眠一如): the state described above, where the practitioner can meditate on a gong'an continuously through even the deepest sleep. #In death, attain life (Hangul: 사중득활, Hanja: 死中得活): from the previous state where all thoughts are overtaken by the gong'an (therefore, the practitioner is considered mentally \\"dead\\"), the moment of attaining enlightenment, that is, \\"life.\\" #Great, round, mirror-like wisdom (Hangul: 대원경지, Hanja: 大圓鏡智): the state of perfect enlightenment, using the analogy of the bright mirror for the great internal wisdom that comes forth during enlightenment. The final state where the practitioner loses the sense of self, is liberated from his karma, and therefore, all future rebirths. =Criticism of the Japanese style of meditation= Seongcheol was very critical of the Japanese style of Zen meditation. The Japanese style favors a gradual study of many gong'ans, similar to a curriculum where the practitioner would improve from an easier gong'an to a more difficult one as he mastered each one over time. Seongcheol, and many other masters,용화선원 stated that this would achieve nothing since the whole point of meditation was to rid one's mind of all divergent thoughts, which was the cause of karmic rebirths and its concomitant suffering, by focusing the mind deeply on only one gong'an until it destroyed all other thoughts. By studying gong'ans like a curriculum, one was only exercising the mind even more, which was diametrically opposed to the original goal of extinguishing the mind. Thus, this gradual style of meditation was not only similar to Jinul's gradual cultivation, it was a complete waste of time to the practitioner in that Zen became nothing more than an exercise in sophistry, with higher positions being given to those who could solve more riddles. Gong'ans can never be solved with such rational, or even intuitive methods, and only the final, perfect enlightenment could give the solution to the gong'an, and simultaneously all gong'ans. Therefore, Seongcheol repeatedly made clear that the study of many gong'ans was antithetical to true meditation. He stated that attaining perfect enlightenment was equal to becoming a Buddha, and this was also equal to definitively solving the gong'an, remarking that this was not his unique teaching, but that of numerous masters including Huineng, Ma Tzu, all the way down to current masters. Being able to solve multiple gong'ans was pure delusion believed by many practitioners, and Seongcheol devoted much of his teachings to elucidating this point. =Quotations= Legacy Seongcheol played a key role in revitalizing Korean Buddhism which had been in deep disarray from the Japanese occupation. He was one of the leaders in the reformation, bringing back celibacy, strict practice, monasticism, and mendicancy back to Korean Buddhism. Later in his life, with his growing recognition, he helped to rectify Buddhism's discredited reputation amongst the general public, from a group of nominal monks who would get married, own businesses, and frequently collude with the Japanese occupiers, to that of serious practitioners, who never got married, and owned no possessions. Seongcheol also contributed significantly to bringing back Huineng's 'sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation,' and clarified the notions of gong'an practice, meditation, monasticism, and enlightenment. More than a decade after his death, his books are still widely read and respected, and pilgrimages to Haeinsa are a mainstay for Buddhists.

Statutory Structure The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) was created under the Jobs Through Exports Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. §2421) to “promote United States private sector participation in development projects in developing and middle-income countries” and to “provide opportunities for the use of United States exports.” With these Congressional mandates, USTDA’s dual mission is unique among foreign assistance agencies: while the Agency promotes outcomes in infrastructure and economic development, it is mandated to help create American jobs through exports. History USTDA’s roots date to the 1970’s, when the Agency for International Development (USAID) coordinated a government-wide “Reimbursable Development Program” (RDP) to provide foreign countries continued access to U.S. development advice, U.S. technical assistance, U.S. equipment, and U.S. technology “even after they have reached the stage where they no longer need to rely on concessional financing for their further development.” USAID Office of Reimbursable Development Programs FY 1980 Budget Submission at 4. Though well-intentioned, RDP became lost in USAID’s mission and culture of international economic and humanitarian assistance. The Congressional Research Service described the problem as follows: “…AID’s expenditures for [RDP program] activities linking U.S. business to development in 1976 and 1977 fell to only about $1 million annually. By the end of the 1970’s, however, there was a growing sense in Congress that the U.S. private sector should be more active in development programs. In 1978, Congress directed AID to increase emphasis on U.S. private sector involvement in development assistance.” “The Trade and Development Agency,” CRS Report No. 93-717 F, August 5, 1993, at 4 (Emphasis supplied). In 1980 and 1981, USAID and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) were linked in the International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) – an “umbrella agency tasked with coordinating U.S. development assistance programs.” RDP was carved out as a “separate part” of IDCA and re-named the Trade and Development Program (TDP) to “further underscore the link between private sector and U.S. development activities.” Id (Emphasis supplied). Congress codified these actions in 1981. P.L. 97-113, Title III, § 312(b), 95 Stat. 1536. In 1988, in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, P.L. 100-418, Title II, Subtitle B, Part I, § 2204 (b), 102 Stat. 1329. Congress again reaffirmed its support of the TDP and its dual missions by making the program a separate component agency within the IDCA, headed by a Presidential appointee. The complete separation from USAID was underscored by transferring to TDP a tied aid credits program earlier administered by USAID that was meant to assist U.S. companies competing against subsidized foreign competition. Congress also made clear its intention that “The Trade and Development Program should serve as the primary Federal agency to provide information to persons in the private sector concerning trade and development and export promotion related to bilateral development projects.” USTDA as an Independent Agency The 1992 Jobs Through Exports Act P.L. 102-549, Title II, § 201, 106 Stat. 3655. renamed TDP as the Trade and Development Agency and revised and expanded its mission, charter and authorities. In taking these actions, Congress described USTDA as “one of the most successful government export promotion programs,” House Report No. 102-551, reprinted in [1992] U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News 3255, 3263 (Emphasis supplied). and increased USTDA’s budget authorization, saying “By increasing the amount of funding available, [Congress] is not only demonstrating its support for the program, but acknowledging the increased need for its services.” USTDA’s independence and special character were again reaffirmed when Congress said it “would expect that the increase in TDA’s authorization will discourage attempts by other agencies and departments within the executive branch to duplicate the work of the TDA.” Id. At 3264 (Emphasis supplied). USTDA’s charter has not changed much since its establishment in 1992, with the exception of a 1999 Congressional designation of energy, transportation, telecommunications and environment as “special emphasis…economic sectors with significant United States export potential”.

See 22 USC 2421. USTDA's mission is to “promote economic growth in developing and middle income countries, while simultaneously helping American businesses to export their products and services, thereby creating U.S. jobs”. USTDA's programs are designed to help countries establish a favorable trading environment and a modern infrastructure that promotes sustainable economic development. According to USTDA, the agency's development assistance has always involved building partnerships between U.S. companies and overseas project sponsors to bring proven private-sector solutions to developmental challenges. As part of its programs, USTDA funds various forms of technical assistance, early investment analysis, training, orientation visits, and business workshops in the areas of trade capacity building and sector development, and project definition and investment analysis.USTDA: Program & Activities.

The series first aired on TV Tokyo on April 1, 2007 and ended on September 30, 2007, with 26 episodes. On July 23, 2007, a manga adaptation began serialization in Kodansha's Magazine Z. Though the story is the same, it is told from the point of view of Iolaous. Five official guidebooks were also published and had consecutive monthly releases from July to November 2007. Premise The story's theme is based on stories in Greek mythology, especially those surrounding Heracles, upon whom the main character is based, and his Twelve Labors. Many of the other characters are also based on Greek mythological figures; characters share similar names to their Greek counterparts, and how their relationship is defined with others correspond with Greek stories. The title of the series, Heroic Age, is also a slight testament to the similarities to Greek mythology, referring to the time of the Heroic Age. The tribes featured in the anime are loosely based on Hesiod's Five Ages of Mankind. Storyline The Golden Tribe watching the universe. The show is set in a futuristic universe, controlled by a few races or \\"tribes\\" that possess the capabilities for interstellar travel. The universe had once been ruled by a \\"Golden Tribe\\" (黄金の種族 Ougon no Shuzoku), who had since left the current galaxy long ago; they passed on their knowledge to the humanoid , the insectoid , and the gigantic . The latter was later punished by the Golden Tribe for causing havoc in the universe and made to serve the other tribes as - extremely powerful beings that play a key role in the story. Before the Golden Tribe departed, Humanity answered the call of the Golden Tribe and was dubbed the . Viewed as a threat to the order of things, the Silver Tribe decided to annihilate the Iron Tribe with the aid of the Bronze Tribe. However, humanity survived their assault on Earth and scattered their numbers across the stars in order to preserve their race. The story follows the voyages of the starship Argonaut and its crew to find a means to bring peace to the universe. The ship carries the young human clairvoyant princess Dhianeila, who is on a mission to find the mythical savior of the human race. This savior is expected to aid humanity in their war against the Silver and Bronze tribes, who are bent on humanity's extermination. Initially, the expedition finds a child-hearted boy called Age on a partially destroyed planet. When the Argonaut is attacked by the Bronze tribe, Age is shown to transform into a \\"Nodos\\" form, Bellcross, a gigantic and immensely powerful being. He easily fends off the superior attacking force. Having found their messiah, the Argonaut starts its way back to Dhianeila's home-world, Duey. During their journey home, the Silver Tribe launches several attacks on the Argonaut to prevent the ship from returning to their home-world, but Age always managed to stop them. During the many attacks on the Argonaut the crew begins to warm up to Age, they had been fearful of his powers as a Nodos. The Silver tribesman Phaetho O assigns himself the role of \\"testing\\" Age, destroying the Argonaut and all the Iron Tribe on it. After Age drives Phaetho O away and saves his tribe they all begin to accept him. Iolaous Oz Mehelim of the Yunos knights is jealous of Age but warms up to him after the attack on Titarros. Once they escape the battle against Phaetho O at Titarros the Argonaut crew arrives near the Cemetery belt where they are again attacked by Phaetho O and the Bronze Tribe accompanying him, here Age fights another Nodos whom had visited him on Titarros. During the fight the Argonaut manages to escape however in order to do so Age had to stay behind to fight. The Argonaut warps to what they think is an unoccupied place and end up running into stragglers from the Bronze Tribe, rather than fight they attempt to run only to be cornered by an enormous fleet. the fleet is also Iron Tribe, after saving the Argonaut that fleet accompanies them and they leave to help Age. After reaching back to Duey, word had spread throughout humanity of the Argonaut's success and Dhianeila's brothers used the momentum to successfully convince humanity to launch a counter-offensive against the Silver and Bronze Tribes. With humanity united under the Junos family, the Silver Tribe throws the full might of their forces along with their 4 Nodos's to destroy humanity. As the fighting intensifies, the humans move towards the Golden Tribes' old home world. At the last moment, contact is made both between the Silver Tribe, humanity, and the Nodos of each side. Dhianeila brings the Silver Tribe to accept a ceasefire and Age is shown to be the \\"key\\" to opening a portal to the universe into which the Golden Tribe has moved. When this portal is opened, the Silver Tribe moves on to this other universe and passes all of its knowledge to humanity, including the ability to control the Bronze Tribe. However, during the battle, Age is missing after he opened the gateway; some believed he died in the process, while others believed he'll return one day. Honoring Age's wish, Dhianeila dedicated the next few years of her life to restore Age's home planet. Four years later, Humanity has now brought order throughout the universe. With the Silver's Tribe's technology, humanity had advanced further and rebuilt Earth. Dhianeila and the Argonaut's team has succeeded in restoring Age's home, but through it all, she missed Age the most. Just as she was about to leave the only planet that gives her some comfort, the Golden Tribe's gateway opened and revealed that Age was alive, and he and Dhianeila were reunited.

Her essays have sometimes been required readings in academic courses dealing with the abortion debate and they are frequently cited in major publications like Peter Singer's The Moral of the Story: An Anthology of Ethics Through LiteratureSinger, Peter. The Moral of the Story: An Anthology of Ethics Through Literature; Oxford: Blackwell Publishing (2005); and Bernard Gert's Bioethics: A Systematic Approach.Gert, Bernard/ Culver,Charles M./Clouser,K. Danner (2006); Bioethics: A Systematic Approach; Oxford University Press. She was sometimes described as a feminist, largely due to her pro-choice writings. Warren also wrote on the implications of sex selection and about animal treatment. She was a professor of philosophy at San Francisco State University for many years. Mary Anne Warren died on August 9, 2010 from cancer, aged 64. Criteria of personhood In response to whether a thing can be said to be a person, and so have moral standing, Warren suggested the following criteria: # Consciousness (of objects and events external and/or internal to the being), and in particular the capacity to feel pain; # Reasoning (the developed capacity to solve new and relatively complex problems); # Self-motivated activity (activity which is relatively independent of either genetic or direct external control); # The capacity to communicate, by whatever means, messages of an indefinite variety of types, that is, not just with an indefinite number of possible contents, but on indefinitely many possible topics; # The presence of self-concepts and self-awareness, either individual or racial, or both. # Moral agency (the capacity to regulate one's own actions by thinking about moral principles or ideals) She stated that at least some of these are necessary, if not sufficient, criteria for personhood (which is necessary and sufficient for moral standing). She argued that fetuses do not meet any of these criteria, therefore they cannot be persons, and cannot have moral standing, and so abortion is acceptable.

As a Capuchin Franciscan friar he helped smuggle approximately 4,000 Jews into safety from Nazi-occupied Southern France. On 1 December 1966, he was honored with the Medal of the Righteous among the Nations for his courage and self-sacrifice. His actions to save Jews during the Holocaust were the reason for his epithet Father of the Jews (). Life before World War II Born Pierre Péteul, Father Marie-Benoît served in World War I in North Africa, and was wounded at Verdun. He received the distinction of five citations and a Cross of War. After the war he joined the Capuchin Fransciscan Order and earned a doctorate in theology at Rome. In 1940 he returned to france Franciscan Capuchin Order and became a priest stationed in Marseille. Actions in wartime =In Marseille= In Marseille in 1940, he found thousands of refugees trying to escape the horrors of World War II. He was determined to help them because, in his own words, > We Christians claim to be spiritual children of the patriarch Abraham. This > should be enough reason to exclude any kind of anti-Semitism whatsoever, > anti-Semitism being an ideology which we Christians cannot in any way share > and be part of. Father Marie-Benoît's operation focused on finding ways to successfully smuggle Jews out of an increasingly hostile France. Marie-Benoît transformed the Capuchin monastery in Marseille, at 51 Rue de la Croix de Régnier, into his first headquarters. There he organized a massive forging operation, installing and improvising printing facilities to create fake passports, baptism certificates, and other documents that aided hundreds of refugees in crossing the border to Spain and Switzerland. This was often done with the collaboration of Jewish organizations and members of the French resistance. In November 1942, the Nazis had occupied France's Free Zone, which included Marseille. This precluded the option of helping Jews escape to Switzerland and Spain. Accordingly, Father Benoît turned his attention to the Riviera and Haute-Savoie, occupied by the Italians. =In Nice= Traveling to Nice, he persuaded Italian officials to permit Jews to cross into the Italian zone. Specifically, he met with Guido Lospinoso, the Italian commissioner of Jewish affairs, whom Mussolini had sent at the Germans' insistence. Father Benoît persuaded Lospinoso to refrain from action against the 30,000 Jews who lived in the vicinity of Nice. Also in Nice, Father Benoît met Angelo Donati, a Jewish banker and director of the French-Italian Bank of Credit. Donati had a plan to transport over the Italien Jews to North Africa by boat. However, in order to approach the Italian authorities, he needed the cooperation of the Holy See. =In Rome= In July 1943, Father Benoît traveled to Rome to seek the help of Pope Pius XII in transferring Jews to northern Africa. A meeting was arranged between Father Benoît and the pope. When Father Benoit explained that the police in Vichy France were acting against the Jews, Pius XII was surprised, saying, \\"Who could ever expect this from noble France?\\" He promised to diligently deal with the situation. However, the North African plan was eventually foiled when the Germans occupied northern Italy and the Italian- occupied zone of France. Father Marie-Benoît returned briefly to France in order to carry out \\"the Spanish part of his plan\\". With authority from the Spanish government of Francisco Franco to decide which French Jews qualified as being of Spanish descent, he managed to save another 2,600 people; there is no record of how many of them actually had any Spanish blood. Upon the urging of his friends, Father Marie-Benoît disappeared from France and resurfaced in Rome as Padre Benedetti. He was elected to the board of DELASEM (Delegazione Assistenza Emigranti Ebrei: \\"Delegation for the Assistance of Jewish Emigrants\\"), the central Jewish welfare organization in Italy of which he eventually became president. Marie-Benoît transferred the DELASEM headquarters to the International College of the Capuchins, and inaugurated an operation to forge documents there. His office was raided several times by the Gestapo, early in 1945, with the arrest, torture, and execution of most of the rest of the DELASEM leadership, Father Benoît was persuaded to go into hiding. Against everyone's expectations, he actually survived the war. Recognition When Rome was liberated in June 1944, the Jewish community—led by Rabbi Israel Zoller—held an official synagogue ceremony in honor of Father Benoît, \\"shower[ing] him with praise.\\" Years later, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson delivered a speech in which he said that Father Benoît's \\"wonderful actions\\" should \\"inspire the American people in the protection and preservation of the rights of citizens, irrespective of race, color or religion.\\" On 1 December 1966, Yad Vashem officially recognized Father Benoit as a Righteous Among the Nations. Overall, he helped thousands of Jews to reach Switzerland and Spain from the South of France, or escape by other means. Even while pursued by the Gestapo, he escaped to Rome, where he continued his efforts for the Jews.

He is the chairperson and cofounder of Adva Center, an editor and cofounder of Haokets.org, and teaches philosophy at the Open University. Dahan is an expert in labor law, workers' rights and global justice, theories of social justice, the right to education and educational justice. Biography Yossi Dahan was born in Morocco and immigrated to Israel in 1960. His family lived at first at the Beit Shemesh transition camp (ma'abara) and later at the Bat Yam transition camp, from which it moved to Holon where he graduated from the Kugel High School. Dahan studied for a BA in philosophy and psychology at Tel Aviv University. In 1976-1979, he moved to the United States to continue his studies and completed his PhD studies at New York City's Columbia University. His PhD thesis was titled \\"Political Equality in Democratic Theories\\", supervised by Thomas Pogge and Sidney Morgenbesser. Dahan received his law degree in 1999 at the College of Management Academic Studies (COMAS) in Rishon LeZion, Israel. Dahan is an associate professor at the Department of Law at the College of Law and Business, where he is also Head of the Human Rights Division. He is also Philosophy and Political Science Teaching Coordinator at the Open University. In 2006 Dahan was a research associate at Oxford University’s Centre for the Study of Social Justice, and in 2011-2012, he was a visiting scholar at New York University’s Taub Center for Israel Studies. Dahan cofounded Adva Center for Information on Equality and Social Justice in Israel and has been its acting chair ever since. In 2003, together with Dr. Yitzhak Saporta, he founded the Haokets website – a critical platform on socioeconomic, political, media, cultural and other issues, and has been editing and writing in it ever since. Dahan has acted as a public representative of workers at the National Labor Court. Since 2003, he has been a member of the editorial board of Van Leer Jerusalem Institute’s Theory and Criticism journal. In 2005-2009, Dahan chaired Van Leer’s research groups on Class and Identity. He is a board member in the Association of Environmental Justice in Israel, and a member of the general assembly and board of the College of Law and Business. In 1992-1996, Dahan served as a member of the academic team consulting Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Ora Namir. In July 1989, he was a member of the Mizrahi delegation for the Toledo Meeting for Israeli-Palestinian Dialogue, and later of the delegation for the negotiations with the PLO in Stockholm in 1990. In 1992-1993, together with Professor Yossi Yonah, Yitzhak Shapira and Yael Fishbein, Dahan headed the education team of the Special Committee for Social Development in Yitzhak Rabin’s Prime Minister’s Office. He cofounded the Forum for Social Justice and Peace which operated in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the auspices of the International Center for Peace. The Forum held training programs for community leaders for mixed populations: Arabs and Jews, residents of cities and development towns, new immigrants and long-time residents. As part of his activities at the Forum, Dahan and Professor Yossi Yonah headed the academic steering committee of its training programs. Dahan cofounded the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition. Dahan had opinion columns in the Hadashot and Yediot Ahronot daily newspapers. Yossi is married to Miri, a graphic designer, and has three children: Ayelet, Nili and Noam. Dahan’s book Theories of Social Justice was first published in Hebrew by the Ministry of Defense Publications in 2007. The book provides an extensive and critical review of major contemporary social justice theories (John Rawls’s theory of justice, libertarianism, Amartya K. Sen’s and Martha Nussbaum’s capability approach, desert theories of justice, Michael Walzer’s theory of justice, global justice, justice and feminism, and justice and multiculturalism). An updated, extended edition of the book, with a new chapter on justice and democracy, was published in Hebrew by the Open University in 2013. Dahan wrote the postscript to the Hebrew translation of Rawls’s 1985 Justice as Fairness, published in 2011 by Books in the Attic and Miskal. Since 2008, Dahan is involved in a series of studies on workers' rights in international labor law in collaboration with Dr. Hanna Lerner of the Tel Aviv University Department of Political Science and Dr. Faina Milman-Sivan of the Haifa University Department of Law. This normative and empirical research project develops a theory of shared responsibility and principles of responsibility allocation designed to justify the protection of workers' rights in global chains of productions controlled by multinational corporations. The project is funded by the Israeli Science Fund (ISF). Hitherto, it has led to the publication of several articles in legal and philosophical journal. In early 2015, a collection of articles edited by the researchers will be published by Cambridge University Press under the title International Labor Rights and Global Justice. In 2009, together with Dr. Milman-Sivan, Dahan also edited a special edition the Law & Ethics of Human Rights journal, titled “Labor Rights in an Era of Globalization”. In the course of his studies on education, Dahan published a series of articles on equal opportunities and privatization in Israeli and international journals. Among other things, he published several articles together with Professor Yossi Yonah of Ben Gurion University in the Negev describing and critiquing ideological and normative aspects of the neoliberal reforms carried out since the 1980s in education systems in Israel and many other countries. In 2018 Dahan published the book 'On Educational Justice, Privatization, and the Aims of Education' the book was published by Van Leer institute and Hakibuoz Hameuchad. The book examines from a normative and empirical perspective different approaches to educational justice, different conceptions of privatization and their policy applications, and reviews different approaches to the questions of what should be the aims of an educational system in a democratic society. Finally, together with Professor Henry Wasserman, Dahan edited To Invent a Nation – a collection of articles on modern theories of nationality. The book was published in Hebrew in 2006 by the Open University as part of a series in the course Issues in the Study of Nationalism, together with Hebrew translations of Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities, Ernst Gellner’s Nations and Nationalism, and Partha Chatterjee’s Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World: A Derivative Discourse.

It was designed primarily to decrease the time needed to align millions of mouse genomic reads and expressed sequence tags against the human genome sequence. The alignment tools of the time were not capable of performing these operations in a manner that would allow a regular update of the human genome assembly. Compared to pre-existing tools, BLAT was ~500 times faster with performing mRNA/DNA alignments and ~50 times faster with protein/protein alignments.  Overview  BLAT is one of multiple algorithms developed for the analysis and comparison of biological sequences such as DNA, RNA and proteins, with a primary goal of inferring homology in order to discover biological function of genomic sequences. It is not guaranteed to find the mathematically optimal alignment between two sequences like the classic Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithms do; rather, it first attempts to rapidly detect short sequences which are more likely to be homologous, and then it aligns and further extends the homologous regions. It is similar to the heuristic BLAST family of algorithms, but each tool has tried to deal with the problem of aligning biological sequences in a timely and efficient manner by attempting different algorithmic techniques.  Uses of BLAT  BLAT can be used to align DNA sequences as well as protein and translated nucleotide (mRNA or DNA) sequences. It is designed to work best on sequences with great similarity. The DNA search is most effective for primates and the protein search is effective for land vertebrates. In addition, protein or translated sequence queries are more effective for identifying distant matches and for cross-species analysis than DNA sequence queries. Typical uses of BLAT include the following: *Alignment of multiple mRNA sequences onto a genome assembly in order to infer their genomic coordinates; *Alignment of a protein or mRNA sequence from one species onto a sequence database from another species to determine homology. Provided the two species are not too divergent, cross-species alignment is generally effective with BLAT. This is possible because BLAT does not require perfect matches, but rather accepts mismatches in alignments; *BLAT can be used for alignments of two protein sequences. However, it is not the tool of choice for these types of alignments. BLASTP, the Standard Protein BLAST tool, is more efficient at protein-protein alignments; *Determination of the distribution of exonic and intronic regions of a gene; *Detection of gene family members of a specific gene query; *Display of the protein-coding sequence of a specific gene. BLAT is designed to find matches between sequences of length at least 40 bases that share ≥95% nucleotide identity or ≥80% translated protein identity.  Process  BLAT is used to find regions in a target genomic database which are similar to a query sequence under examination. The general algorithmic process followed by BLAT is similar to BLAST's in that it first searches for short segments in the database and query sequences which have a certain number of matching elements. These alignment seeds are then extended in both directions of the sequences in order to form high-scoring pairs. However, BLAT uses a different indexing approach from BLAST, which allows it to rapidly scan very large genomic and protein databases for similarities to a query sequence. It does this by keeping an indexed list (hash table) of the target database in memory, which significantly reduces the time required for the comparison of the query sequences with the target database. This index is built by taking the coordinates of all the non-overlapping k-mers (words with k letters) in the target database, except for highly repeated k-mers. BLAT then builds a list of all overlapping k-mers from the query sequence and searches for these in the target database, building up a list of hits where there are matches between the sequences (Figure 1 illustrates this process). Figure 1: Example showing the creation of non-overlapping k-mers from the target database and overlapping k-mers from the query sequence, for k=3. Coordinates of the database sequences are used to clump the matches into larger alignments (full process not shown). = Search stage = There are three different strategies used in order to search for candidate homologous regions: #The first method requires single perfect matches between the query and database sequences i.e. the two k-mer words are exactly the same. This approach is not considered the most practical. This is because a small k-mer size is necessary in order to achieve high levels of sensitivity, but this increases the number of false positive hits, thus increasing the amount of time spent in the alignment stage of the algorithm. #The second method allows at least one mismatch between the two k-mer words. This decreases the amount of false positives, allowing larger k-mer sizes which are less computationally expensive to handle than those produced from the previous method. This method is very effective in identifying small homologous regions. #The third method requires multiple perfect matches which are in close proximity to each other. As Kent shows, this is a very effective technique capable of taking into consideration small insertions and deletions within the homologous regions. When aligning nucleotides, BLAT uses the third method requiring two perfect word matches of size 11 (11-mers). When aligning proteins, the BLAT version determines the search methodology used: when the client/server version is used, BLAT searches for three perfect 4-mer matches; when the stand-alone version is used, BLAT searches for a single perfect 5-mer between the query and database sequences.  BLAT vs. BLAST  Some of the differences between BLAT and BLAST are outlined below: *BLAT indexes the genome/protein database, retains the index in memory, and then scans the query sequence for matches. BLAST, on the other hand, builds an index of the query sequences and searches through the database for matches. A BLAST variant called MegaBLAST indexes 4 databases to speed up alignments. *BLAT can extend on multiple perfect and near-perfect matches (default is 2 perfect matches of length 11 for nucleotide searches and 3 perfect matches of length 4 for protein searches), while BLAST extends only when one or two matches occur close together. *BLAT connects each homologous area between two sequences into a single larger alignment, in contrast to BLAST which returns each homologous area as a separate local alignment. The result of BLAST is a list of exons with each alignment extending just past the end of the exon. BLAT, however, correctly places each base of the mRNA onto the genome, using each base only once and can be used to identify intron-exon boundaries (i.e. splice sites). *BLAT is less sensitive than BLAST.  Program usage  BLAT can be used either as a web-based server-client program or as a stand-alone program. = Server-client = The web-based application of BLAT can be accessed from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site.UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site Building the index is a relatively slow procedure. Therefore, each genome assembly used by the web-based BLAT is associated with a BLAT server, in order to have a pre-computed index available for alignments. These web-based BLAT servers keep the index in memory for users to input their query sequences. Once the query sequence is uploaded/pasted into the search field, the user can select various parameters such as which species' genome to target (there are currently over 50 species available) and the assembly version of that genome (for example, the human genome has four assemblies to select from), the query type (i.e. whether the sequence relates to DNA, protein etc.) and output settings (i.e. how to sort and visualise the output). The user can then run the search by either submitting the query or using the BLAT \\"I'm feeling lucky\\" search. Bhagwat et al. provide step by step protocols for how to use BLAT to: *Map an mRNA/cDNA sequence to a genomic sequence; *Map a protein sequence to the genome; *Perform homology searches.  Input  BLAT can handle long database sequences, however, it is more effective with short query sequences than long query sequences. Kent recommends a maximum query length of 200,000 bases. The UCSC browser limits query sequences to less than 25,000 letters (i.e. nucleotides) for DNA searches and less than 10,000 letters (i.e. amino acids) for protein and translated sequence searches. Figure 2: Using web-based BLAT to search a target database with a DNA query sequence. The search parameters can be seen above the query sequence The BLAT Search Genome available on the UCSC website accepts query sequences as text (cut and pasted into the query box) or uploaded as text files. The BLAT Search Genome can accept multiple sequences of the same type at once, up to a maximum of 25. For multiple sequences, the total number of nucleotides must not exceed 50,000 for DNA searches or 25,000 letters for protein or translated sequence searches. An example of searching a target database with a DNA query sequence is shown in Figure 2.  Output  A BLAT search returns a list of results that are ordered in decreasing order based on the score. The following information is returned: the score of the alignment, the region of query sequence that matches to the database sequence, the size of the query sequence, the level of identity as a percentage of the alignment and the chromosome and position that the query sequence maps to. Bhagwat et al. describe how the BLAT \\"Score\\" and \\"Identity\\" measures are calculated. For each search result, the user is provided with a link to the UCSC Genome Browser so they can visualise the alignment on the chromosome. This a major benefit of the web-based BLAT over the stand-alone BLAT. The user is able to obtain biological information associated with the alignment, such as information about the gene to which the query may match. The user is also provided with a link to view the alignment of the query sequence with the genome assembly. The matches between the query and genome assembly are blue and the boundaries of the alignments are lighter in colour. These exon boundaries indicate splice sites. The \\"I'm feeling lucky\\" search result returns the highest scoring alignment for the first query sequence based on the output sort option selected by the user. = Stand-alone = Stand-alone BLAT is more suitable for batch runs, and more efficient than the web-based BLAT. It is more efficient because it is able to store the genome in memory, unlike the web- based application which only stores the index in memory.

Named for Bulloch County, Georgia, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-509 was laid down on 7 October 1943 at Jeffersonville, Indiana by the Jeffersonville Boat & Machine Company; launched on 23 November 1943; sponsored by Lieutenant (j.g.) Dorothy L. Nims, USCG(W); and commissioned on 20 January 1944 with Lieutenant J. B. Malcom, USNR, in command. During World War II, LST-509 was assigned to the European Theater and participated in the Invasion of Normandy in June, 1944. Following the war, LST-509 returned to the United States and was redesignated USS Bulloch County (LST-509) on 1 July 1955. She was recommissioned in 1966 and served in the Vietnam War until she was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Navy in April 1970. She was used primarily for provisioning forward coastal and river US Marine bases such as Tân Mỹ Base (now Thuan An) and Cửa Việt Base located in I Corps and bases further south such as Vung Tau, Cam Ranh Bay and Nha Trang. Other duties included coastal picket and resupply duty during Operation Market Time in which she resupplied and provided off-patrol berthing for Patrol Craft Fast crews interdicting Viet Cong communication and supply routes. The starboard screw and rudder were once damaged by a floating mine in the Cua Viet River. She continued operations on one screw until another could be fitted at Da Nang. She suffered serious enough storm damage during a typhoon during a voyage to Okinawa in 1969, to require emergency repairs while beached and more complete repairs in a graving dock at Sasebo, Japan. On 8 April 1970, the ship was decommissioned and leased to the Republic of Vietnam under the Security Assistance Program for service as Qui Nhon (HQ-504). After 1975, she served in the Vietnam People's Navy with new registration as HQ-505. In 1988 she was heavily damaged in the Johnson South Reef Skirmish by the Chinese frigate Yingtan. The Vietnam People's Navy, in an effort to save her, tried to bring her to Cam Ranh Bay for repair but she sank south of Great Discovery Reef in the Spratly Islands area. The ship and her crew were granted the title of Hero of the People's Armed Forces. LST-509 earned one battle star for World War II service.

Herzog ultimately became celebrated internationally for his pioneering street photography, his understanding of the medium combined with, as he put it, \\"how you see and how you think\\" created the right moment to take a picture. Life and Career Fred was born Ulrich Herzog in Stuttgart, Germany in 1930 and spent his childhood in Rottweil, Germany. He lost both of his parents during and directly after the war, and in 1946 Herzog went to work as an apprentice in his grandparents' hardware store. Disillusioned by the ravages of war and the situation in Germany, he emigrated to Canada in 1952 and settled in Vancouver in 1953. During the next several years. Herzog studied photography magazines while working aboard ships for the CPR steamship line, and in 1957 he was hired as a medical photographer at St. Paul's Hospital. In 1961, he became the head of the Photo/Cine Division in the Department of Biomedical Communications at UBC, and in 1970 was appointed Associate Director of the Department. Herzog was also hired as an Instructional Specialist in the Fine Arts Department at Simon Fraser University in 1967, and in 1969 became an instructor in the Fine Arts Department at UBC. Herzog had a walking route through Vancouver that enabled him to build friendships with other photographers and neighbourhood residents and gave him an acute understanding of the daily life and soul of Vancouver. Over the course of several decades, Herzog produced a substantial body of colour photographs, taking urban life, second-hand shops, vacant lots, neon signage and the crowds of people who have populated city streets over the past years as his primary subjects. Herzog's use of colour was unusual in the 1950s and 60s, a time when fine art photography was almost exclusively associated with black and white imagery. Additionally, Herzog photographed using Kodachrome slide film that was notoriously difficult to print. For decades he remained virtually unknown until his mid-seventies when printing technology caught up, allowing him to make archival pigment prints that matched the exceptional colour and intensity of the Kodachrome film. A retrospective exhibition, Fred Herzog: Vancouver Photographs, was held at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2007 and was the first major recognition of Herzog's body of work. Herzog exhibited his work both in Canada and internationally, including the exhibitions Fred Herzog: Photographs, C/O Berlin, Germany (2010), Fred Herzog: A Retrospective, Equinox Gallery, Vancouver (2012), Eyes Wide Open! 100 Years of Leica Photography, Haus der Photographie, Hamburg, Germany (2015), Photography in Canada, 1960-2000, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa (2017), and many others. In 2010 Herzog received a Honorary Doctorate from Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and in 2014 he received the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts. An artist profile on Herzog was featured on the Knowledge Network for the series Snapshot: The Art of Photography II in 2011. In 2014, Herzog's photograph Bogner's Grocery (1960) was released as a limited edition stamp as part of Canada Post's Canadian Photography Series. Herzog passed away on September 9, 2019 at age 88 .

The community is located east of North Branch at the junction of State Highway 95 (MN 95) and Chisago County Road 12 (Park Trail). Nearby places include North Branch, Center City, Sunrise, and Taylors Falls. ZIP codes 55012 (Center City), 55056 (North Branch), and 55084 (Taylors Falls) all meet near Almelund. Almelund is located 51 miles north-northeast of Minneapolis. History The first European visitors to the area were French traders, who bought furs from the resident Ojibwa Indians in the 17th century. Yankee settlers moved to Amador Township in the 1850s living along the St. Croix River, which also had the first post office. Dr. Carmi P. Garlick platted the village as Amador (in Minnesota) in conjunction with the village of Sebetana (in Wisconsin) across the river from each other. He took the name Amador from Amador County, California where he had panned for gold. In 1857 he built a saw mill on the St. Croix River. Swedish immigrants arrived in the township in the 1870s to buy farm land. The village of Almelund was founded in 1887 by Swedish Immigrant John Almquist who heard Swedish settlers were building a Lutheran Church in this area. Almquist knew these settlers would need supplies, built a general store and operated it there for thirty years until it burned down in 1911. The first wood-frame one-room school was built in 1890 and is today used as the Amador Town Hall. A two-room brick school was built in 1910 which is now the Amador Heritage Center, a museum which also includes three log cabins, a log barn and log granary. The Almelund Apple Festival is held there the third Sunday in September each year. http://www.amadortownship.com/heritage.htm Amador Heritage Center]. Still in a prominent place at the center of town is Immanuel Lutheran Church. Originally known as the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Emmanuel Church, the current building was built in 1926. Community Almelund is bordered on the north and east by the St. Croix River and Wild River State Park. The township formerly was predominantly farmland with farm families raising corn, soybeans, dairy and beef cattle, and feed for those cattle. Many were descendants of the original Swedish immigrants. Today most of the township is no longer as farm oriented - many local residents commute to the Twin City area for employment. The area is also known for its water sports and other outdoor recreation. Almelund is three miles south of Wild River State Park and west of Wild Mountain Recreation Area. Almelund is also well known throughout east–central Minnesota for hosting the annual Threshing Show, known by people in the area as the \\"Threshing Show\\". It is a sixty-year-old celebration of vintage tractors, old farm equipment and traditional threshing methods. The third Sunday in September, the Almelund Apple Festival, another heritage festival, is held at the Amador Heritage Center Museum.

His stage name refers to the so-called Lost Tribe of Shabazz, which is based on the teachings of Wallace Fard Muhammad.  Career  As an artist signed with Tuff City, Lakim first gained recognition when he provided vocals for the 45 King's “The 900 Number.” Further collaboration with the 45 King was to follow with the EP titled The Red, Tthe Black, the Green. Then later, in 1988, his debut album Pure Righteousness was released as an introduction-style album with a \\"the 45 King presents\\" moniker on the cover sleeve. This album was relatively well received and has become an iconic release of the period in hip hop where the Nation of Gods and Earths style of the late 1980s/early 1990s is concerned. Shabazz released two albums, recorded for Aaron Fuchs's Tuff City Records, featuring production by The 45 King, and his militant lyrics were predominantly about his love of the Nation of Islam and his dedication to the Nation of Gods and Earths, the latter of which he was a member. After his second album, he worked with Diamond D briefly and disappeared. He lives in New Jersey and makes occasional appearances at Five-Percenter Show and Prove events. In 2015, Shabazz was featured on the Shady Corps' track \\"Lost Souls\\".  Influences  In an interview with AllHipHop, Lakim said, \\"I came up listening to Cold Crush, Treacherous Three, Jazzy Five.

The plant at dusk History The plant used to power the Twin City Rapid Transit electrical lines. The plant was constructed in 1903 to provide electricity for the Twin City Rapid Transit street railway system. It supported the area's major form of public transportation for 50 years. Minneapolis converted to buses in 1949-1954, and in the early 1950s, Northern States Power Company (now Xcel Energy) acquired the building. The University of Minnesota purchased the plant in 1976 for $1. Operation The buildings of the U of M's Minneapolis campus The facility heats 94 buildings (nearly all of the university's Minneapolis campus), provides electricity to cool 19 of those buildings, and provides steam to the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minnesota State Board of Health and Cedar Riverside People's Center. Captured as the steam leaves the plant, pressure powers the plant and provides 20% of the university's electricity. The plant's steam is transported through an 18-mile (29 km) network of tunnels to the campus buildings and would be enough to heat 55,000 homes. Each student pays about $200 for energy and those in residence halls pay $375 a year for heat and air conditioning, water heating and dining services. The plant is university building #059. The university's Energy Management department, part of Facilities Management, oversees the plant. Foster Wheeler Twin Cities was contracted with the U of M to operate it from 1992 to 2016, when Veolia North America took over. Just upstream is the Hennepin Island Hydroelectric Plant operated by Xcel Energy. The university's Saint Paul, Minnesota campus three miles (5 km) away has its own plant. In addition the university has generators, pumps and boilers powered by diesel and natural gas, most used only in emergencies, with 11 used as peak shaving units. Rehabilitation Before pipes were reinsulated, employees needed breaks once an hour to work in the tunnels which reached 115 °F (46 °C). Insulation reduced the ambient temperature to 80 °F (27 °C), and the loss of energy from 10% to 4%, and over time resulted in a 25% campus-wide decrease in energy consumption. The university closed the Southeast plant to gut and rebuild the interior, and in 2000, reopened it and closed down its old coal-burning power plant. Completed in 2005, exterior rehabilitation won a local historic preservation award, presented to the university and Miller Dunwiddie Architects, McGough Construction, Hess Roise Historical Consultants, Meyer Borgman Johnson, Michaud Cooley Erickson, INSPEC, Akiba Architects, and Kimley Horn. Boilers, fuel and emissions Among the \\"cleanest burning power plants in the country,\\" the high temperature fires almost completely consume its fuels—natural gas, fuel oil, coal, and wood waste. The plant has tested and been approved for oat hull biofuel, a renewable resource that would reduce each student's fees by about $21. Four boilers are operational. A fluidized bed boiler (CFB) is seven stories high and capable of burning fuel oil, coal, wood, oat hulls or natural gas. There are two natural gas boilers, and one pulverized coal boiler, that can also fire fuel oil. There is a spreader stoker coal boiler, also capable of burning fuel oil and possibly oat hulls that is decommissioned. During May and October, the periods of lowest demand, the CFB boiler is not in use. The CFB controls emissions of the acid gases sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride and particulate matter (PM) with limestone injection and a fabric filter. The pulverized coal and spreader stoker boilers are equipped with dry gas scrubbers (spray dryers). Two boilers have no control equipment but have flue gas recirculation to limit nitrogen oxide emission. The plant emits almost zero sulfur and mercury. The unloading terminal for rail cars and its conveyors are enclosed and equipped with baghouse filters. The outdoor coal bunker is shielded from the wind by concrete retaining walls. Storage silos for ash have fabric filters. Criticism Environmental groups including the Save Our Riverfront Coalition and Friends of the Mississippi Inc. attempted and failed to move the plant off the river in 1996. Elected officials Phyllis Kahn and Larry Pogemiller, Arne Carlson who was governor of Minnesota, and Sharon Sayles Belton who was mayor of Minneapolis supported the move. Concerned about potential emissions and noise from deliveries, some neighborhood associations and a condominium developer at the nearby Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill criticized the plant's 2005 application to amend its permit to allow tests of alternative fuels. Biofuel The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency approved use of biomass fuels, specifically oat hulls in 2006 but the three years necessary for testing and the approval process lost the source of the hulls. General Mills, makers of the oat cereal Cheerios, had signed a contract by then with U.S. Steel for use in their facility on the Iron Range in northern Minnesota.

After murdering General Asquith, played by Rupert Vansittart, in \\"Aliens of London\\" (2005), this Raxacoricofallapatorian assumed his identity, which he maintained until his presumed death in \\"World War Three\\" (2005). =Chief Scientist= The Chief Scientist, played by Vernon Dobtcheff, was the alien responsible for the mental conditioning of the humans held in the war zones, as seen in The War Games (1969). =Chip= Chip, a tattooed force-grown clone played by Sean Gallagher, was Lady Cassandra's manservant, as seen in \\"New Earth\\" (2006). He voluntarily became Cassandra's final host after they developed the psychograft. Chip's clone body had a half- life and began to fail. Before dying, Chip (with Cassandra's consciousness) was taken by the Doctor to a party to meet Cassandra's past self, telling her she is beautiful, which Cassandra had remembered as the last time anyone had said that to her. =Condo= Condo served the evil surgeon Solon in The Brain of Morbius (1976). Upon finding Condo shipwrecked, Solon amputated Condo's hand and replaced it with a hook, claiming that the amputation was medically necessary in order to save his life. Condo later discovers that his hand had secretly been amputated on purpose by Solon for the Frankenstein-like body created to eventually house the brain of the evil timelord Morbius. =Mr. Crane= Mr. Crane, played by Colin Spaull, was responsible for converting humans into Cybermen in Battersea Power Station, as seen in \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" (2006). He turned against his boss, John Lumic, in \\"The Age of Steel\\" (2006), when he tried to have him converted into a Cyberman. Crane damaged Lumic's life support system and was then killed by a Cyberman. Crane's actions prompted the Cybermen to \\"upgrade\\" Lumic prematurely, converting him into a Cyber Controller. Actor Colin Spaull previously appeared in Doctor Who as Lilt in Revelation of the Daleks (1985). =Crozier= Crozier, played by Patrick Ryecart, was a human scientist who led the experiments in mind transference, as seen in Mindwarp (1986), seeking to save Lord Kiv from brain compression. After experimenting on a Raak, the Matrix evidence shown at the Doctor's trial indicated that Crozier was successful in transferring Kiv's mind into Peri's brain. It was his work that prompted the High Council of Gallifrey to interfere with events. The Matrix evidence showed that the Time Lords' interference resulted in King Yrcanos attacking Crozier's lab, killing him and Peri, the new host of Kiv's mind. It was later revealed that the Matrix evidence had been falsified by the Valeyard and that Peri had in fact survived and married Yrcanos. Crozier's ultimate fate is therefore unclear. D =Dalek Caan= :Main article: Dalek Caan =Dalek Jast= =Dalek Sec= =Dalek Thay= =Dalek Trooper= The Dalek Troopers were human slaves to the Daleks in the Fifth Doctor story, Resurrection of the Daleks (1984). They were planning to attack a prison spaceship to free Davros and performed their orders without question, but were ultimately killed by the Daleks. =Lucius Petrus Dextrus= Lucius Petrus Dextrus was a Roman soothsayer in The Fires of Pompeii. He breathed in dust from Mount Vesuvius, which was created by the Pyroviles, and gave him false predictions of a brighter future for Pompeii. His right arm was turned to stone, a process which, if carried out completely, would have turned him into a Human-Pyrovile hybrid. He helped the Pyroviles assemble circuitboards they needed to transform Earth into a new Pyrovilia. He was presumably inside the volcano when it erupted. Petrus Dextrus translates from Latin as Stone Right Arm. He was portrayed by Phil Davis. =Mr Diagoras= Mr Diagoras, played by Eric Loren, headed the construction of the Empire State Building for the Daleks in \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\" (2007). He fought in the Great War, which left him damaged by the horrors he had seen. He raised himself from being a foreman to being the wealthy, ruthless businessman seen in this episode. Believing Diagoras to be the most Dalek-like human they had encountered, Dalek Sec chose to merge with him against his comrades' wishes to become a Human Dalek. The other members of the Cult of Skaro had doubts about the Human/Dalek project, so they later assumed Dalek Caan in charge. Sec/Diagoras saved the Doctor's life, getting in the way of a Dalek death ray, aimed at the Doctor. =Dibber= Dibber, played by Glen Murphy, was Sabalom Glitz's partner in The Mysterious Planet (1986). He didn't reappear in Dragonfire, suggesting Glitz sold or killed him, or they had a falling-out. Actor Glen Murphy had previously appeared in Doctor Who as an uncredited Kinda Tribesman in Kinda (1982). =Mother Doomfinger= Mother Doomfinger, played by Amanda Lawrence, was a Carrionite involved in the plot to begin a new Carrionite Empire on Earth, as seen in \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" (2007). She was capable of stopping a man's heart simply by touching him. She, along with the other Carrionites, was eventually captured inside a crystal ball, which the Doctor stored on a shelf inside the TARDIS. F =Mr Fibuli= Mr Fibuli, played by Andrew Robertson, served The Captain in The Pirate Planet (1978). G =Chancellor Goth= :Main article: The Deadly Assassin A high-ranking Time lord politician, Goth was in fact a willing servant to the Master who was killed by the Doctor through a mental battle via the Matrix. =Gwendoline= H =Gatherer Hade= Gatherer Hade, played by Richard Leech, as seen in The Sun Makers (1977), ruled over the city of Megropolis One on Pluto and organised the collection of the taxes paid by the citizens to the Company. The pompous official lauded praise upon the Company and his Usurian boss, the Collector. Challenging the revolutionaries that had broken out onto the roof of the city, Hade was thrown off the building to his death. =Novice Hame= Novice Hame, played by Anna Hope, was a member of the Sisters of Plenitude first seen in \\"New Earth\\" (2006) and in its accompanying TARDISODE. She was looking after the Face of Boe whilst he was hospitalised on Ward 26. She was eventually arrested by New New York Police Department for having kept the Sisters' secret, that they had built a farm of cloned humans infected with all known diseases in order to research cures. \\"Gridlock\\" (2007), set 30 years after the events of \\"New Earth\\", revealed that in the intervening time she was ordered to attend the Face of Boe as penance for her part in the Sisterhood. After the airborne 'Bliss' virus killed the New New York Senate and most of the New Earth population, Hame, (who had been saved from the virus by the Face of Boe in his smoke), aided the Face in sealing off the Under-City of New New York, thereby saving those on the Motorway and in the streets there. Having been sent to find the Tenth Doctor by the Face of Boe, she found him deep in the Motorway as he was looking for Martha Jones. She teleported him to the New New York Senate so that the Face of Boe could deliver his final message. After helping the Doctor and the Face of Boe save the Under-City civilians from eternal imprisonment on the Motorway, Hame was with them as the Face died, after imparting his final words to the Doctor. Her fate after this point is unknown, but the Doctor later says to Martha that \\"they've got Novice Hame\\", suggesting she will subsequently have a larger role in the governance of New New York and/or New Earth. =Captain Hardaker= Captain Hardaker, played by Geoffrey Palmer in \\"Voyage of the Damned\\", was the Captain of the S.S. Titanic, a ship from Max Capricorn Cruiselines modelled after the Earth ocean liner of the same name. Hardaker was a veteran officer in the company and long-time Captain of his ship. With a terminal illness, he accepted a large sum of money (to leave behind for his family) from Max Capricorn to crash the Titanic into the Earth. This was key to Capricorn's scheme to frame the board of directors for mass murder. Hardaker facilitated this by dismissing all officers from the bridge, but Midshipman Alonzo Frame refused to go, citing the regulation that two officers were required on the bridge at any one time. Despite Frame's interference, Hardaker lowered the shields and magnetised the hull to draw in a meteor storm. The meteors struck the ship, dealing tremendous structural damage and killing many of the passengers. A support structure on the bridge collapsed and killed Hardaker, leaving Frame helpless to prevent the Titanic from plunging toward Earth. Geoffrey Palmer appeared twice before in Doctor Who. In the 1970 serial, Doctor Who and the Silurians (over 35 years before \\"Voyage of the Damned\\"), and in the 1972 serial The Mutants. =Councillor Hedin= Hedin was a high-ranking and respected Time Lord politician who was said to have been a good friend of the Doctor before he left Gallifrey. In fact, Hedin was in league with the renegade and powerful Time Lord Omega because he believed Omega deserved freedom and recondition for his achievements to Time Lord history. The Doctor knew this was a mistake and tried to reason with Hedin, who was suddenly killed by saving the Doctor's life from a shot fired by one of the Castellan's guards. =Sir George Hutchinson= K =Daisy K= =Karen= Karen is a character in Big Finish Productions series of Eighth Doctor New Adventures originally on BBC7 radio. She is played by Louise Fullerton. She first meets the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller in Human Resources. She and Lucie believed they were working in a simple modern day office in Telford. But in truth, they were partially hypnotised war strategists inside a giant battle robot that walked an alien world fighting the Cybermen. Despite being a simple human with a humble job, some Time Lords believed Karen had the potential to become an oppressive dictator. This fact drew the attention of a villain-for-hire named The Headhunter, who hired Karen as her assistant. The next time the Headhunter appears, Karen is at her side, helping to steal an alien diamond in Grand Theft Cosmos. Karen returned in The Eight Truths/Worldwide Web; however, she was played by a different actress, Kelly Godliman. L =Lytton= Commander Lytton is a mercenary whom the Doctor encountered twice. He was born on a satellite called Riften 5, orbiting the planet Vita 15 some centuries in the future. The novelisation of Attack of the Cybermen states that his first name is Gustave. When the Fifth Doctor met Lytton during Resurrection of the Daleks (1984), he was working for the Daleks in a plot to rescue Davros from imprisonment following the events in Destiny of the Daleks. It transpired that all the Daleks' humanoid operatives were clone-duplicates (with the memories of the originals downloaded), ensuring their obedience—but the conditioning proved unstable and the destroyed originals' minds could reassert control. Lytton, who soon turned against his masters, was presumably an example of this. When Davros altered some of the Daleks to be loyal to him and tried to seize control from the Dalek Supreme, Lytton was one of the few survivors of the ensuing battle. Though he attempted briefly to shoot the Doctor, they did not meet and he escaped from the carnage in the guise of a policeman. The Sixth Doctor then encountered Lytton planning to rob a diamond merchant in the story Attack of the Cybermen (1985). The sewers through which he planned to make his heist also contained a squad of Cybermen, and Lytton's actions helped revive them. After being taken to Telos with Lytton and the Cybermen, the Doctor encountered the Cryons, who revealed that Lytton was in fact working for them. The Cybermen had travelled back in time to prevent the destruction of their home planet Mondas in 1986. However, once they did so the Cybermen intended to destroy and leave Telos. Lytton's mission was to prevent this by stealing the time machine. Once Lytton's treachery to the Cybermen was exposed, the Cyber Controller ordered that Lytton undergo the cyber-conversion process. When the Doctor tried to free Lytton from his fate as a Cyberman, a partially converted Lytton died fighting the Cyber Controller, who snapped his neck. The Doctor later admitted that he had badly misjudged Lytton, though their encounters had been severely limited. A video on the official website for The Sarah Jane Adventures mentions that Sarah Jane Smith investigated a criminal group called the \\"Lytton Gang\\" in 1985, including a woman who claimed to be carrying Lytton's alien baby. The gang was attempting to loot the Bank of England.BBC – Sarah Jane Adventures – Mr Smith M =Gilbert M= Gilbert M, played by Harold Innocent, created the sadistic Kandy Man, as seen in The Happiness Patrol (1988). Unhappy with Helen A's control of the planet, Gilbert fled with her husband Joseph B; both had left behind terrible things, the Kanyman and Fifi. =Theodore Maxtible= Theodore Maxtible is an antagonist from The Evil of the Daleks (1967). He was played by Marius Goring. =Mr Magpie= Mr. Magpie's televisions, on location during filming. Mr Magpie played by Ron Cook, as seen in \\"The Idiot's Lantern\\" (2006), owned Magpie Electricals, a shop selling electrical devices such as televisions. The Wire arrived on Earth in one of this televisions, briefly taking Magpie's face; however, she put it back, with a burning pain \\"behind [his] eyes\\", forcing him to cooperate. When the Wire begins feasting on the minds of those watching the coronation, Magpie reminds her that she promised him peace; she cruelly tells him that he will have peace, vaporising him at the cost of overexerting herself. =Mordred= N =Nimrod= =Nyder= Nyder, played by Peter Miles, was the Security Commander for the Kaled Scientific Elite and an assistant to their chief scientist Davros, as seen in Genesis of the Daleks (1975). Nyder was killed by the Daleks after he attempted to carry out one of Davros's instructions against the will of the Daleks. Actor Peter Miles had previously appeared in Doctor Who as Dr. Lawrence in Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970) and as Professor Whitaker in Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974). Miles reprised his role as Nyder in 1992 and again in 2005 serving as a witness for Davros in the theatrical production The Trial of Davros. In 2006, he played Nyder as a younger Lieutenant for the Big Finish Productions audio drama I, Davros: Guilt.  O  =Adeola Oshodi= Adeola Oshodi in \\"Army of Ghosts\\" Adeola Oshodi, known familiarly as \\"Adi\\" (played by Freema Agyeman in \\"Army of Ghosts\\") was a technician at Torchwood One, where she worked on its free energy project. When finding a place to make a romantic liaison with her co-worker Gareth Evans, she was seized and cyber-converted by Cybermen from a parallel universe, who had slipped through the Void through a breach in space-time and infiltrated Torchwood Tower. Her \\"upgrade\\" was internal, through an earpiece linked with connective tissue directly to her brain. She was killed definitively when her earpiece was overloaded by a signal from the Tenth Doctor. Freema Agyeman later appeared as Adeola's cousin and companion to the Tenth Doctor, Martha Jones. Martha mentioned her deceased cousin in her debut episode \\"Smith and Jones\\". The Doctor felt guilt for not being able to save Adeola, and apologised to Martha. P =Mrs Pritchard= R =Mr Ratcliffe= Mr Ratcliffe, builder's merchant and head of fascist group 'The Association', as played by George Sewell and seen in Remembrance of the Daleks (1988), was allied to the Renegade Daleks in London in 1963. He was enlisted by them to help with retrieving the Hand of Omega. After assisting in the killings of those the Daleks opposed, he attempted to abscond with the Renegade Daleks' time controller and was killed by the girl slaved to their battle computer. Mr Ratcliffe associated with Sergeant Mike Smith. =Robomen= Robomen were brainwashed human males forced to serve the Daleks in The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964) controlled via helmets. The mind control technique was unstable and Robomen would eventually go insane and commit suicide. Craddock, played by Michael Goldie, was converted into a Roboman during The Dalek Invasion of Earth and was electrocuted after fighting Ian. Phil Madison was similarly converted and was killed by his brother, Larry, played by Graham Rigby, after Phil shot and mortally wounded him. Larry stirred Phil's memory, his dying word being \\"Larry...\\" The surviving Robomen were eventually liberated by the Doctor, Susan, Barbara and David Campbell and they fought against the Daleks. Peter Badger and Martyn Huntley played two of the Robomen. Martyn Huntley had previously played the First Human in The Sensorites (1964) and reappeared in Doctor Who as Warren Earp in The Gunfighters (1966). Robomen reappeared in the Big Finish audio production The Mutant Phase, in which the Fifth Doctor (played by Peter Davison), accompanied by Nyssa (portrayed by Sarah Sutton), arrive on Earth during the Dalek Invasion, in 2158. They also appear when the Daleks invade Earth again in the Eighth Doctor story Lucie Miller / To the Death. The graphic novel The Only Good Dalek featured several Robomen on a space station where various objects and lifeforms related to the Daleks were housed, with the Robomen eventually joining in the Dalek assault on the station. The Robomen have a small role in Energy of the Daleks, where the Fourth Doctor and Leela face a Dalek time squad from the future in 2025, the Doctor explicitly stating that the use of Robomen is a sign that the Daleks' resources are limited. In the audio Masters of Earth, the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown arrive on Earth in 2163 where they became involved in a Dalek plot to create a new, more efficient form of Robomen, although the Doctor is forced to kill the subjects of this experiment when they try and use the Robomen technology to augment humanity to oppose the Daleks, the Doctor concerned that this approach will make humanity the new Daleks. In Doctor Who: The Third Doctor Adventures Volume 3: The Conquest of Far, the Third Doctor and Jo stop a Dalek plan to deploy a massive transmitter that will enable mass conversion of the opposing human army into Robomen, the Doctor using the transmitter to overload most of the Dalek army so that the rest can be dealt with more conventionally. Robomen also featured in the cinematic version of this story Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD (1966), as did the ill-fated character of Craddock, then played by Kenneth Watson who went on to appear in the television series of Doctor Who as Bill Duggan in The Wheel in Space (1968), co-starring the original Craddock, Michael Goldie, as Elton Laleham. S =Lucy Saxon= Lucy Saxon, played by Alexandra Moen, is the wife of Harold Saxon (the Master) during his tenure as Minister of Defence and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. When confronted by journalist Vivien Rook about her husband's fictitious life history, Lucy reveals the Master's presence in the room; Rook is then murdered by the Master's Toclafane allies. The Master refers to Lucy as his \\"faithful companion\\". Despite apprehension and occasional squeamishness, she appears to be his willing accomplice and confidante. She does not display concern at the obvious severity of the Master's plans, and is seen dancing to \\"Voodoo Child\\" while six billion Toclafane descend upon the Earth. The tie-in website archived from haroldsaxon.co.uk describes Lucy as the youngest child of Lord Cole of Tarminster (in \\"The Sound of Drums\\", she refers to her gratitude for \\"all [Mr. Saxon] did for my father\\", and is said to be \\"of good family\\" by Rook) but never planned to follow her father's footsteps into politics. She went to Roedean School (Rook describes her as \\"not especially bright but essentially harmless\\"). She was on the Sussex netball team and studied Italian at St Andrews. She met Saxon during the publication of his autobiography and they married in 2007, the year prior to the events of \\"The Sound of Drums\\". In \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", set a year later, Lucy appears in a more opulent costume than before (a red evening dress and with red nail varnish), but with bruises around her right eye and a less enthusiastic attitude, suggesting physical and emotional abuse by the Master. When Martha confronts the Master and humans start to chant \\"Doctor\\", Lucy joins their chanting. She later shoots the Master, killing him, and is imprisoned soon after at Broadfell Prison. In \\"The End of Time\\", Lucy is used against her will to provide the Master's biometric imprint to complete his resurrection. Aware of the Master's plan, Lucy used her connections to develop a potion to sabotage the Master's resurrection, causing an explosion that kills her, destroys the prison, and leaves the Master in a dying body. =Scorby= Scorby is the mercenary and chief henchman of the millionaire and plant-collector Harrison Chase. He is sent by Chase, to a scientific research base in Antarctica, along with the scientist Arnold Keeler, to steal a newly discovered plant pod found buried in the ice there. He attempts to kill the Doctor, Sarah Jane, and several others in an explosion, as a means to eliminate them all as witnesses, and obscure traces of the theft. The plant pod turns out to be the seed of a dangerous plant-based alien life-form known as a Krynoid. Later, when it becomes apparent to him that his employer is now possessed by the alien Krynoid, Scorby reluctantly helps the Doctor, Sarah and UNIT remove all the plants from Chase's laboratory, as they may come under Krynoid control, whilst they are all under siege from the rapidly growing Krynoid. Scorby then meets his end when he panics, and attempts to flee the besieged mansion via the garden, only to come under attack from the Krynoid-controlled plants there and be dragged into the pond and drowned by the weeds. =Mr Sin= Mr Sin Mr Sin, played by Deep Roy, aids Li H'sen Chang in The Talons of Weng-Chiang (1977). Originally known as the Peking Homunculus, it is a cyborg from the 51st century that has the cerebral cortex of a pig. Designed as a toy, it almost causes World War Six when its organic parts assert themselves and it kills the Commissioner of the Icelandic Alliance and his family. It later accompanies Magnus Greel when he escapes to the 19th century. Its love of slaughter and hatred of mankind eventually lead it to betray Greel, after which it is deactivated by the Doctor when he disconnects the fuse circuit in its back. Mr Sin returns in the Virgin Missing Adventures novel The Shadow of Weng-Chiang. In a retcon, the book claims it was originally an assassination device disguised as a toy by enemies of the Icelandic Alliance. After being used by a tong with connections to Greel, it is deactivated again, and destroyed by K-9. The canonicity of the novels is unclear. It is possible that Mr. Sin was based on the Chinese dwarf god Kui Xing. The incident with The Commissioner of the Icelandic Alliance is played out in the 2012 prequel audio story The Butcher of Brisbane, in which the Fifth Doctor averts the world war, after allowing Greel and Sin to escape in their time cabinet. =Sergeant Mike Smith= Sergeant Mike Smith, seen in Remembrance of the Daleks (1988) as played by Dursley McLinden, was an RAF non-commissioned officer who served under Group Captain Gilmore. He struck a bond with Ace, whom he met in a café—a bond that was shattered when he was revealed to be a fascist in league with associate Mr Ratcliffe and the Renegade Daleks in pursuit of the Hand of Omega. Along with Mr Ratcliffe, Mike attempted to abscond with the Renegades' time controller. He was killed at his mother's boarding house by a girl possessed by the Renegade Daleks' battle computer. Unusually for a character killed in Doctor Who, the Doctor and his companion were seen to attend his funeral, although they left early. =General Smythe = General Smythe was an antagonist in The War Games (1969). He was played by Noel Coleman. =Slab= Slabs are slaves that were used in the episode \\"Smith and Jones\\" as henchmen for a creature known as a Plasmavore. The Doctor mentions that the Slabs are made of leather throughout their entire bodies. In external appearance, they appear as humanoid forms wearing leather all over and a black motorcycle helmet with the visor down, bearing a resemblance to motorcycle delivery-men which is noted by various human characters. Slabs (or similar creatures) also appeared in The Sarah Jane Adventures story Warriors of Kudlak. =Squawk= Squawk is a robot parrot from Pheros, voiced by Toby Longworth in The Infinite Quest (2007). He eats gold, and is the son of the deceased Caw. T =Lady Thaw= Lady Sylvia Thaw, played by Thelma Barlow, was the partner both personally and professionally of Professor Richard Lazarus in the episode \\"The Lazarus Experiment\\" (2007). She was an old lady associated with LazLabs Finances. She was liaising with Mr Saxon. After Lazarus successfully rejuvenated himself, she wanted to be first in line for rejuvenation. Lazarus rejected her saying he had grown tired of her. When Thaw threatened to complain to Saxon, Lazarus transformed into a large, scorpion-like monster and sucked the life out of her ultimately killing her. =Maylin Tekker= The word \\"Maylin\\" being his rank, Tekker was a Karfelan who was a henchman of the Borad in the 1985 serial Timelash, promoted after the previous Maylin, Renis, was killed by the Borad. Upon hearing of the Borad's genocidal plans to wipe out his people, Tekker defected from the Borad's side, only to be instantly killed by a weapon of the Borad's that caused rapid ageing. V =Captain von Weich= Captain von Weich, played by David Garfield, was the alien who headed the German troops held in the First World War zone and Confederate troops in the American Civil War zone in The War Games (1969). He was shot dead by Private Moor. W =Mr Wagner= Mr Wagner, played by Eugene Washington, was the alias of a Krillitane who posed as a Maths teacher at Deffry Vale School in \\"School Reunion\\" (2006). He was presumed killed when the school exploded. In one deleted scene he is seen going organic after having eaten nothing but rats.

Before the end of martial law, it was, with the Kuomintang and the China Democratic Socialist Party, one of three legal political parties in Taiwan.  History  The Young China Party was founded by a group of Chinese students in Paris on 2 December 1923. Their name was inspired by the Young Turks. Given China's weakened condition in the early 1920s, the YCP's primary platform was to advocate the elimination of China's warlords and the establishment of a strong central government. It also promoted a nationalist agenda which focused on the abolition of the special privileges and extraterritoriality which foreign powers had obtained in China during the final years of the Qing Dynasty. It was also strongly anti-communist. The party was made up largely of landlords, school teachers, and businessmen, similar to the Nationalist Party. Zeng Qi, the party's first chairman, and other YCP founders such as Li Huang, He Luzhi (何魯之) and Li Buwei (李不韙) returned to China starting in 1924. The YCP then established party organizations in Shanghai, other major Chinese cities, and among overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. From its foundation, the YCP's rank and file strength consisted mainly of students and intellectuals. Initially called the China National Youth Corps, the YCP acquired its current name during its fourth national convention in September 1929. During the Northern Expedition, the party supported the northern warlords because they opposed the Communists within the First United Front. After the anti-communist purge, they still resisted the KMT because of its one-party state. The party was banned after the Nationalists came to power in 1928 and the YCP refused Chiang Kai-shek's offer to merge the two parties. The Nationalists denounced them as a warlord party due to their early failed attempts to recruit Wu Peifu and their opposition to the Northern Expedition. The Communists called them fascists because their leaders had ties to a French fascist and their strident anti-communism. The YCP considered itself to be a conservative parliamentary democratic party. They were based in Manchuria under the protection of Zhang Xueliang. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the YCP called for an immediate declaration of war, in contrast with the Nationalist government's resistance to a formal war declaration and initiating hostilities. The YCP joined the anti-Japanese United Front in 1937 to support the national government. After the initiation of the full-scale war, the YCP cooperated closely with the Kuomintang (KMT) in fighting Japanese military aggression. It joined the China Democratic League, an umbrella group of small democratic parties. In the early years of the war, the Youth Party became the third largest party, after the GMD and the CCP, yet one informed historian called the party organization \\"extremely weak.\\" The members were either personal friends of Zhang Junmai, many of whom had been followers of Liang Qichao, or his former students. Qian Duansheng criticized Zhang as \\"neither an organizer himself not a man able to pick capable men to organize for him.\\" John Melby, an American diplomat who knew Zhang during the war, felt that Zhang was as \\"unrealistic\\" as his brother, Chang Kia-ngau, was hard headed. As a scholar, Melby conceded, Zhang was \\"highly intelligent and well educated,\\" but as a politician he was \\"utopian\\" and \\"ineffectual.\\" In April 1945, one of the YCP's founders, Li Huang was appointed as one of the Republic of China's delegates to the San Francisco Conference at which the United Nations organization was created. The party left the CDL when it became pro-Communist after the war. During the 1947 Republic of China National Assembly election, the YCP won more than 100 seats in the National Assembly and 16 seats in the Legislative Yuan. During the formation of the first cabinet of the constitutional government in 1948, the YCP's Chen Qitian (陳啓天) was appointed minister of commerce and industry, and party head Zuo Shunsheng (左舜生) was appointed minister of agriculture and forestry. After the 1949 communist revolution in China, many of the YCP's leadership and members moved overseas or relocated to Taiwan with the central government, though the YCP's headquarters were officially moved to Taipei only in 1969. The YCP cooperated closely with the KMT after 1949 and continually obtained seats in the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan well into the late 1980s. Given its intellectual foundations, the YCP placed great emphasis on periodicals and printed several reference books on party history and platforms. These include Brief History of the Young China Party, Biography of Past Members of the YCP, Fifty Years of the Young China Party and The Essay on Nationalism, all published in the early 1970s around the party's 50th anniversary. The YCP also published periodicals such as the fortnightly Democratic Tide, and the monthly the Modern Nation, National Tribune and Awakened Lion. For basic background on the YCP, please refer to the Republic of China 1987 - A Reference Book, published by the Government Information Office of the Republic of China. In the 1990s, the party lost all of their seats and failed to gain elected representation after Taiwan's democratic transition. Continuing as a minor force in politics, it intends to participate in the 2020 Legislative Yuan election. The party supports Chinese reunification but rejects One Country, Two Systems.

K-196's western terminus is at Interstate 135 (I-135), U.S. Route 81 (US-81) and K-15 just south of Newton and the eastern terminus is at K-254 just east of El Dorado, Kansas. The highway runs along the south border the town of Whitewater and bypasses Potwin to the south. K-196 was first established as a state highway on March 29, 1937, and at that time ran from US-81 and K-15 south of Newton to US-54 and US-77 in El Dorado. Then between 1957 and 1968, K-254 was extended along K-196 through El Dorato to US-54 and US-77. The overlap with K-254 was removed on May 6, 1994, and K-196 was truncated to end at K-254 west of El Dorado. Route description K-196 westbound K-196 begins at a diamond interchange with I-135 exit 25, which is co-designated as US-81 and K-15. It begins heading east through rural farmlands as it crosses Jester Creek. About past here it crosses West Wildcat Creek at South Woodlawn Road. Another east it crosses Wildcat Creek at Webb Road. About east from here, K-196 crosses Gypsum Creek. The highway then passes north of Whitewater Cemetery, crosses U.P. S.Y.S Railroad, then crosses into Butler County. As K-196 enters the county, it passes south of Whitewater, and then curves east-southeastward. It then passes by Brainerd and soon crosses Dry Creek, then Whitewater River about later. The highway then curves east as it passes south of Potwin. Past Potwin, K-196 curves to a more southeast direction, then crosses Fourmile Creek. Just over past Fourmile Creek, it crosses Rock Creek. After another it curves south as it passes to the west of Baker Cemetery. After curving south it continues roughly , then curves southeast for then ends at a diamond interchange with K-254 west of El Dorado, near I-35/Kansas Turnpike. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 1430 vehicles near Potwin, 2280 vehicles near the western terminus, to 2380 vehicles near the eastern terminus. K-196 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-196 does connect to the National Highway System at each terminus. As of 2017, the portion of the route in Harvey County is paved with partial design bituminous pavement and the portion of the route in Butler County is paved with full design bituminous pavement. History =Early roads= Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. K-196's western terminus (I-135, US-81, K-15) closely follows the Meridian Highway and South West Trail. The former eastern terminus (US-77, US-54) was part of the Atlantic and Pacific Highway, Fort Scott Wichita Road and Kansas-Oklahoma- Texas Highway. =Establishment and realignments= K-196 was first established as a state highway on March 29, 1937, by the State Highway Commission of Kansas, now known as Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). In an April 10, 1946 resolution, K-196 was slightly realigned in Butler County northwest of El Dorado. Before mid 1953, K-196 followed the railroad through Oil Hill, then in a May 19, 1953 resolution, K-196 was moved slightly southwest to a new alignment. By June 1957, Butler county had finished projects on the new K-254 and in a June 26, 1957 resolution, it was established as a state highway from the Sedgwick-Butler County line to K-196 west of El Dorado. Then sometime between June 26, 1957 and 1968, K-254 was extended along K-196 through El Dorato to US-54 and US-77. In an October 8, 1958 resolution, K-196 Alternate (K-196 Alt.) was created on the west end of El Dorado. In a January 27, 1967 resolution it was approved to build I-35W from the Sedgewick-Harvey County line north to the Harvey-McPherson County line and then realign K-15 and US-81 onto I-35W. Then by 1970, I-35W was built and K-196 was truncated to it current western terminus. I-35W was remembered to I-135 on September 13, 1976. Then sometime between 1975 and 1981, K-196 Alt. was decommissioned. The overlap with K-254 was removed on May 6, 1994, and K-196 was truncated to end at K-254 west of El Dorado.

Biography Born in Irajá in Rio de Janeiro (a traditional samba neighborhood which also brought us Zeca Pagodinho, among others), Nei Lopes graduated as an attorney at law from the University of Brazil, but at the start of the 70's abandoned his recently begun legal career to dedicate himself to music and literature. A professional composer since 1972, Nei Lopes became prominent especially through his partnership with Wilson Moreira and by their work, recorded by almost all interpreters of traditional samba. In the 80's, Nei, already acclaimed, was one of the supporters of the Pagode movement, which took samba back to the airwaves after an eclipse period. In the 90's, Nei started partnerships with people identified with the MPB label, such as composer Guinga and Zé Renato. He also has a song with Chico Buarque. Nei is the author of a vast book opus concerning Afro-Brazilian thematics, and samba thematics in particular.

Her Indian name was Pamahas, which translates to \\"Meadows\\" in the Northern Paiute language.\\"The Town Meeting.\\" National Park Service. (retrieved 7 Dec 2009) Her parents were Louisa and Mack Tom. Her maternal grandparents were Mono Lake Paiute Captain Sam and Mono \\"Yosemite Paiute\\" Susie Sam. She and her family lived in Yosemite Valley and at Mono Lake. As a child, Telles played near Galen Clark's cabin. To supplement her family's income, she caught fish in the Valley to sell to hotel keepers. Telles' first husband was Jack Parker, a Paiute. In 1902 they had a son, Lloyd Parker, but shortly after he was born, Jack died. She later married John Telles, a Mexican-American from Texas. John worked as a truck driver and laborer for the Yosemite Park & Curry Company, and the couple lived in Yosemite Valley. Lucy Telles was one of a group of Mono-Paiute women that \\"became known for their exceedingly fine, visually stunning and complex polychrome baskets.\\" Other basket weaving artists in this group included Nellie Charlie and Carrie Bethel. Art career woven basket made by Lucy Telles (National Museum of the American Indian) Telles, who learned basket weaving as a child, was well known for her fine basketry during her lifetime. Her innovations in basket weaving had a lasting influence on Yosemites weavers. While traditional Miwok baskets had one color, she used two colors per basket. She created black from bracken fern root (Pteridium aquilinum) and red from split redbud twigs. She created new basketry designs, some inspired by Plains Indian geometric beadwork. Lucy sold her baskets to Yosemite visitors. By the 1920s, Telles was regarded as the best basket weaver in Yosemite Valley. In 1924, she won a prize of $100 for her baskets. Her most famous basket was the largest known to have been woven in Yosemite Valley. It sold for $250 in 1939. An enormous basket with a 36\\" diameter that took her four years to weave took first prize at the 1933 World's Fair. In 1950, Telles raffled off this basket, her son won it, and the National Park Service purchased it for their Yosemite Museum. Lucy demonstrated basket making to park visitors from 1930 until her death in 1955 or 1956. She taught her grandson's wife, Julia Peter Parker (Kashaya Pomo) how to weave baskets. She was one of the most prolific California and Yosemite – Mono Lake Paiute basket makers. Several of her baskets are featured at the Yosemite National Park Indian museum.  Legacy  Two of her baskets were part of an exhibition on the art of Yosemite which appeared at the Autry National Center, the Oakland Museum of California, the Nevada Museum of Art and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art from 2006 to 2008. One of her baskets from the collection of the California Academy of Sciences, is currently on exhibit at the California Museum in Sacramento.

It was formed through the merger of the former Chinese National Socialist Party (; their preferred shorthand name was \\"Socialists\\"; no relation to the German Nazi Party) and the Democratic Constitutionalist Party (), both of which had survived the years of Japanese aggression by generally supporting the Kuomintang-led national government. The new party's first head was Carsun Chang.  Ideology  The CDSP's platform was to promote democratic socialism in China, world peace, individual freedoms, economic development, a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor, and equal rights for women. The party also sought the implementation of a social welfare system for public health and social security.  History  Both the Socialists and the Democratic Constitutionalists had strong ties to Liang Qichao's defunct Progressive Party. The former were based in China as part of the China Democratic League while the latter was made up of overseas Chinese and expatriates. Most of their members were middle-age to elderly. They never actively recruited and most of their members were friends or relatives of each other. Their small numbers meant they lacked influence but also allowed them to operate under the radar of the Kuomintang and prevent infiltration by other parties. After the promulgation of the Republic of China's constitution in January 1947, the CDSP established branches in several provinces and cities around China and participated in the first elections to the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan. The party also postulated Hsu Fu-lin as candidate for vice-president in the First National Assembly of 1948 in Nanking. After the ROC Government's retreat from mainland China, key members, including elected representatives and party leaders, followed the Kuomintang to Taiwan. Carsun Chang moved to the United States and was replaced as party head by Hsu Fu-lin until Hsu's death in 1958. Chang was elected party chairman by a national congress of the CDSP held in 1959. The CDSP was one of three authorized political parties in the Republic of China after the transfer to Taiwan and imposition of Martial Law, the other two being the ruling Kuomintang and the minor Young China Party. The party held a small number of seats in the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, but failed to gain elected representation after Taiwan's democratic transition in the 1990s. In 29 April 2020, it was reported that the party was disbanded by the Ministry of the Interior due to a failure to re-register after changes in law regarding political parties.

After the Battle of Austerlitz (1805), he carried out successful diplomatic missions to France and Sweden and served with distinction in battles of 1812 and 1813. Chernyshyov rose through the ranks to the role of Russian Minister of War (1827–1852), chairman of the State Council and Cabinet of Ministers (1848–1856), and acquired the styles from Count (1826) to Serene Prince (1849). Biography =Austerlitz and Friedland= Alexander Chernyshov was a son of Lieutenant General and senator, Ivan Lvovich Chernyshov. As soon as Alexander was born, his influential father \\"enlisted\\" him to the elite Mounted Guards Regiment (Конногвардейский полк) of Russian Imperial Guard. He joined the real service in Chevalier Guards in 1802, already favorably known to Emperor Alexander I. A lieutenant of the Guards (гвардии поручик) since September 1804, he served with distinction in Battle of Wischau and Battle of Austerlitz, earning combat Order of St. Vladimir for the latter. During the War of the Fourth Coalition, Chernyshev again excelled at Battle of Heilsberg and Battle of Friedland, and was awarded Order of St. George, fourth class, and an honorary Golden Sword for Bravery. However, the coalition lost the battle and the war, and Tsar Alexander settled on diplomacy instead of fighting. =Diplomatic career= In 1808, Emperor Alexander sent Chernyshov as his private messenger to Napoleon, who at that time started the Peninsular War in Spain. Chernyshyov reached him in Bayonne, taking notes of French military development on his journey. He managed to establish a personalized link between two emperors and earned Napoleon's trust. Next year, tsar Alexander assigned Chernyshyov to be his permanent private envoy to Napoleon (parallel to regular Ambassador of Russia). Chernyshyov, a member of Napoleon's retinue, accompanied French headquarters throughout the War of the Fifth Coalition, and received the Légion d'honneur for the Battle of Wagram. In October 1809, he was promoted to the rank of Rittmeister of the Guards, next year - to Colonel. As the military attaché of Russia in Paris (1810 - end of 1811), Chernyshyov was in charge of intelligence operations. His best known success was hiring a clerk of French General Staff, who regularly supplied the Russians with complete copies of French troop disposition. As a result, the Russians were well aware of concentration of French troops. Another successful operation was his mediation of talks between Swedish envoys led by Karl Otto Mörner and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who was elected Crown Prince of Sweden in August, 1810 and eventually ascended to the Swedish throne in 1818 as Charles XIV John of Sweden. Mutual understanding between Chernyshyov and Bernadotte became an asset in January 1812, during their negotiations about Sweden's stance in the anticipated French invasion of Russia. However, Russian diplomacy failed in recruiting Bernadotte into military coalition, and the talks culminated in the Treaty of Åbo (August 30, 1812), which upheld Sweden's friendly neutrality. =Campaign of 1812= In the end of September 1812, Admiral Pavel Chichagov assigned Chernyshyov to lead a mobile detachment into the Duchy of Warsaw (south-eastern Poland), to destroy enemy food dumps and disrupt French supply lines. Chernyshyov's force included 7 squadrons of regular cavalry, three Cossacks regiments and a regiment of Kalmyks, a total of 1800 soldiers. October 11, they intercepted their first target south from Brest-Litovsk. Austrian commander Count Schwarzenberg, launched the hunt for Chernyshyov's corps. Chernyshyov responded with separating his force: while smaller detachments set up a screen diverting Austrians, the main force was plundering French and Austrian supplies and taking prisoners north. In the end, Austrians intercepted some of their property back, but Chernyshyov managed to evade the trap and returned to Russian base in Włodawa October 18. In November, Chichagov, based in Slonim, discovered imminent danger from an Austrian pursuit corps, and dispatched Chernyshyov to rear guard. November 8, Chernyshyov established contact with advancing Austrians near Volkovyssk. Cossack units destroyed existing bridges over Neman River and the Austrian supply of timber. Next day, Chichagov ordered Chernyshyov to march through the enemy territory and make contact with Russian corps of general Peter Wittgenstein. For five days, his regiment marched at night and made daytime ambushes against French communications; in one of these ambushes, Chernyshyov's cossacks released general Ferdinand Wintzingerode and three Russian officers held prisoners by the French. This raid promoted Chernyshyov to Major General. December 31, 1812, Chernyshyov defeated Eugène de Beauharnais at Marienwerder, earning his second Order of St. George. =Campaigns of 1813-1815= Chernyshyov, based in Poland, met with resistance from Napoleon's Lithuanian troops; these were defeated in January–February 1813. He advanced on Berlin and was the first to capture the city, earning Order of St. Anna, first class. In 1813, he was engaged in action at Lüneburg, Kassel and Battle of Hanau. This was followed by a cavalry raid in Westfalen. In 1814, he was distinguished for assault on Soissons; in 1815 - for taking Chalon; in between the two campaigns, he was tsar Alexander's aide at the Congress of Vienna. Chernyshyov became Lieutenant General in March, 1814, at the age of 27. =Political career= His peacetime career in the reign of Alexander slowed down; since 1819 Chernyshyov was assigned to the Don Cossack Troops Commission and headed this institution in 1821–1835. In 1821, he became the commander of Light Division of Imperial Guards, and established close contact with Nicholas, the future tsar of Russia. Accession of Nicholas to the throne and the aftermath of Decembrist revolt accelerated Chernyshyov's career, who joined the close circle of tsar's most trusted officers. Nicholas appointed Chernyshyov to the commission investigating the revolt, and rewarded this service with titles of Count (1826), General of Cavalry (1827), a seat in State Council, and the appointment as acting Minister of War. \\"Acting\\" status was replaced with proper Minister of War appointment in 1832, which he held until 1852. Nicholas relied on Chernyshyov's personal experience in 1812 guerilla warfare in his handling of Caucasian War. In 1848, Chernyshyov consolidated the roles of Chairman of State Council (senate of Russia) and Cabinet of ministers, being the highest-ranking statesman of Russian until 1856. Ageing Chernyshyov was sent to honorary retirement upon ascension of Alexander II of Russia, which coincided with the final stage of the disastrous Crimean War. Chernyshyov, the chief of land forces throughout most of Nicholas I period, bears full responsibility for the performance of Russian military in Crimea.

It was founded as the brother institution for St George's College,Harare and from 1962 to 1971 it was all-male however the nuns of Congregation Jesu helped bring female scholars only for Advanced Level. The College's sister school is nearby St Dominic's Secondary School which meets frequently for social and co-curricula events. In its 57 years of inception it has garnered a name as the hub of profound education maintaining a hold within the top ten list of the national examinations. It linked to St Ignatius' College in England in its founding (1962) and has continuing links to St Augustine, Edinburgh, and Boston College, Massachusetts. Its traditional rival is St Francis Xavier's Kutama College.  History  St. Ignatius College was founded by the Jesuit Fathers after they had seen the need to educate marginalised black students. According to Sister Stephanie, IBVM, (a founding member of Mary Ward House) the black community faced a number of challenges due to the draconian policies of the colonial racist regime. The college was meant to cater for the educational needs of the marginalised black people. The first building to be constructed was the administration block in 1961 which housed the Jesuits before the construction of the Community House later in 1967. The next buildings to be constructed were the ZJC Block and Junior House. In 1967 the St. Ignatius College Chapel was constructed. In 2013 St, Ignatius College placed sixth nationally in O-levels with a 95.95% pass rate. There is a scramble to get into the 6th form at St,Ignatius, as many of the top students in the nation apply.

The concept was defined by David Teece, Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen, in their 1997 paper Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management, as \\"the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments\\". The term is often used in the plural form, dynamic capabilities, emphasizing that the ability to react adequately and timely to external changes requires a combination of multiple capabilities.  Overview  The phrase \\"dynamic capabilities\\" was introduced in a working paper by David Teece, Gary Pisano, and Amy Shuen.The final, peer-reviewed version was published in 1997. The idea of dynamic capabilities is similar in some ways to the previously existing concept of operational capabilities; the latter pertains to the current operations of an organization, whereas the former, by contrast, refers to an organization's capacity to efficiently and responsively change these operations and develop its resources. The main assumption of this framework is that an organization's basic competencies should be used to create short-term competitive positions that can be developed into longer-term competitive advantage. Nelson and Winter, in their 1982 book An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, link the growth of the concept of dynamic capabilities to the resource-based view of the firm and the concept of \\"routines\\" in evolutionary theories of organization. Douma and Scheuder describe it as a bridge between the economics-based strategy literature and evolutionary approaches to organizations. The resource-based view of the firm emphasizes sustainable competitive advantage; the dynamic capabilities view, on the other hand, focuses more on the issue of competitive survival in response to rapidly changing contemporary business conditions. Strategy scholars Gregory Ludwig and Jon Pemberton, in one of the few empirical studies on the topic, called for clarification of the specific processes of dynamic capability building in particular industries to make the concept more useful to senior managers who set directions for their firms. Dynamic capabilities theory concerns the development of strategies for senior managers of successful companies to adapt to radical discontinuous change, while maintaining minimum capability standards to ensure competitive survival. For example, industries which have traditionally relied on a specific manufacturing process can't always change this process on short notice when a new technology arrives; when this happens, managers need to adapt their own routines to make the most of their existing resources while simultaneously planning for future process changes as the resources depreciate. Similarly, the kind of changes that the theory is emphasizing are the internal capabilities rather than only looking into the external business forces. The New Dynamic Capabilities framework, posed by Amy Shuen in her analysis of Web 2.0, focuses on the firm's ability to quickly orchestrate and reconfigure externally sourced competences, ranging from Apple, Google Android, IBM Linux developer ecosystems to crowdsourced, crowdfunded open innovations such as the Obama08 mobile app—while leveraging internal resources such as platforms, know-how, user communities and digital, social and mobile networks. The New Dynamic Capabilities framework takes into account digital, information and network economics and the fall of the transaction costs of involved in using specialized services. According to Philip Cordes-Berszinn and Basiouni, though, more research is needed in order to measure the \\"capabilities\\" and to appropriately apply the ideas to practical management situations. Many scholars have argued that the dynamic capability theory is vague and tautological . This is a critical issue, and while the theory remains very helpful when addressing how to respond to the business changing environment, it may fail to describe exactly how. Further, Lawson and Samson suggest that the capabilities of the theory are difficult to identify and/or operationalize, and in some cases, those very capabilities can lead to a core capability becoming core rigidity. As such, the use of the theory in its current state is difficult without being able to further specify, develop, and identify those capabilities. Wheeler Zahra et al. proposed an operationalization of the dynamic capabilities and to be further tested across different settings and countries. To further clarify concepts related to the dynamic capability and absorptive capacity theories, Wheeler introduced an application derived from the dynamic capability theory for net-enablement. Wheeler's Net-Enabled Business Innovation Cycle facilitates understanding and predicting how firms transform dynamic capabilities associated with net- enablement into customer value using the dynamic capability theory. These net- enabled firms are able to “continually reconfigure their internal and external resources to employ digital networks to exploit business opportunities” through their “routines, knowledge, analysis and rules to create customer value from their net-enablement capability” (p. 128). Accordingly, and based on Wheeler's NEBIC model, Williams have qualitatively developed instruments to measure the dynamic capabilities and Basiouni developed the measurements quantitatively and tested them on many settings and in different countries such as Canada and Saudi Arabia.  Processes  A detailed description of processes and theoretical roots is provided by Arndt, Pierce, and Teece (2017). Teece, Pisano, and Shuen proposed three dynamic capabilities as necessary for an organization to meet new challenges: the ability of employees to learn quickly and to build new strategic assets; the integration of these new strategic assets, including capability, technology and customer feedback, into company processes; and lastly the transformation or reuse of existing assets which have depreciated. Teece refers to successful implementation of these three stages as developing \\"corporate agility\\". =Learning= The first stage, learning, requires employees and managers to reorganize their routines to promote interactions that lead to successful solutions to particular problems, to recognize and avoid dysfunctional activity and strategic blind spots, and to make appropriate use of alliance and acquisition to bring new strategic assets into the firm from external sources. A practical example of this is provided by Jean-Pierre Jeannet and Hein Schreuder, in their book From Coal to Biotech, which lays out how the Dutch company DSM transformed itself twice using 'strategic learning cycles'. = New assets = In his 1988 book Managing Quality, David A. Garvin states that quality performance depends on organisational routines for gathering and processing information, for linking customer experiences with engineering design choices and for coordinating factories and component suppliers. Increasingly competitive advantage also requires the integration of external activities and technologies through alliances and partnerships. = Transformation of existing assets = Economists Amit and Schoemaker pointed out in 1993 that success in fast changing markets depends on reconfiguring the firm's asset structure to accomplish rapid internal and external transformation. Firms must develop processes to make changes inexpensively while accomplishing reconfiguration and transformation ahead of the competition. This can be supported by decentralization, local autonomy and strategic alliances. =Co-specialization = Another \\"dynamic capabilities\\" concept is co-specialization. For example, the physical assets, human resources and the intellectual property of a company, having developed together over time, are more valuable in combination than separately, and give a firm a sustainable competitive advantage. =Distinction between dynamic capabilities and ordinary capabilities = Dynamic capabilities are closely related to the concept of ordinary capabilities as they both are organizational capabilities, yet both are distinct in nature. The resource-based view of the firm and the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) have focused on two broad categories of organizational capabilities that are essential for firm performance: zero-order ordinary capabilities needed to exploit a firm's current strategic assets through day- to-day operations (Winter, 2003) and higher-order dynamic capabilities required to alter a firm's resource base by integrating, building, and reconfiguring competences (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Teece et al., 1997). Qaiyum and Wang (2018) show that ordinary and dynamic capabilities are needed in different contexts.

Greek) is the medical application of physics. It provides an explanation for medical practices with mechanical principles. It was a school of medicine in the seventeenth century which attempted to explain physiological phenomena in mechanical terms. Believers of iatromechanics thought that physiological phenomena of the human body followed the laws of physics. It was related to iatrochemistry in studying the human body in a systematic manner based on observations from the natural world though it had more emphasis on mathematical models rather than chemical processes.  Background  The Age of Enlightenment was an era of radically changing ways of thought in Western politics, philosophy, and science. Major sociological changes occurred in the Enlightenment, as well as industrial and scientific. In medicine, the Enlightenment brought several discoveries and studies that were impacted by changing ways of thought. For example, discovery of capillaries were made by Marcello Malpighi. Jean Baptiste von Helmonni (1577-1644) also was the first to consider digestion a fermentation process. He also identified hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Pathological anatomy and clinical observation were also being integrated into the medical curriculum. The Enlightenment also directly influenced the field of Iatrophysics through the development of Antonie von Leeuwenhoek's microscope, the advancement of the field of ophthalmology through the use of physics by René Descartes, and Newton's law of universal gravitation and idea of gravitational force.  Subfields  Iatrophysicists drew inspiration from various established physical phenomena in order to explain how certain biological processes took place and how this can be applied towards medicine. = Particles = A key component of iatrophysical anatomy was the study of particles. This was particularly influenced by 17th century developments in microbiology, the most prominent being the microscope. Antonie von Leeuwenhoeck was a Dutch scientist who is known for his use of the microscope for identifying single-celled organisms. He was also the first to observe muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa and blood flow in capillaries. Another famous figure in microbiology at the time was Robert Hooke, an English scientist most famous for his use of the microscope for the discovery of cells. In his most famous work, Micrographia (1665), he attributed “occult properties” as elementary “contrivances of nature”. Like Galileo Galilei, he shared an iatrophysical viewpoint and saw living organisms as groups of small machines. The development of the microscope was largely influential in this view. = Mechanics = Machines were used as models by Iatrophysicists to quantitatively describe linear and rotational motion of various biological systems such as human limbs and animals. Some models came into existence before Isaac Newton's formulation of his three laws in classical mechanics, drawing on basic principles of statics and dynamics to represent how a biological system behaved. Giovanni Borelli was prolific in applying mechanics to a wide variety of humans and animals in different degrees of activity, drawing upon an array of simple machines and models for translational and rotational motion and equilibrium. = Fluids = Iatrophysicists were also interested in studying how bodily liquids and gases were processed. They sought to understand how blood circulated throughout the body and what effects it made on the body. System consisted of arteries, veins, and vasculature verified through experiment and microscope by Marcello Malpighi's observations of capillaries in animal lung tissue. Albrecht von Haller, as did Borelli, postulated that friction from the blood on vessel walls lead to body heat and even fever. A hydraulic model for motion by René Descartes implied the body had a system that maintained flow between the brain and muscles in equilibrium state through nerves and blood vessels.  Iatrophysicists  Starting in the 17th century, quantitative fields such as physics and mathematics began gaining legitimacy as a means of studying the natural world with the advent of theory, practices, and instruments. Static principles and simple machines were already in use to create various objects and buildings and thus were established tools that could be used to inspire models of biological systems. The development of medical instruments and techniques, such as the microscope and detailed dissections, changed how natural philosophers thought about how to explain the human body's properties. By enabling more detailed study of aspects of biology, let alone the human body, instrumentation and methods to directly study organic tissue allowed more opportunities for natural philosophers, Iatrophysicists in this case, to postulate and verify their theories. With inspiration from established explanations of natural phenomena and new informative means to study the human body available, iatrophysicists aimed to describe the human body and assert their explanation of various systems of the human body. One example is the muscle and contraction. Various explanations on a macroscopic and microscopic scale were made to explain how muscles contracted and thus performed movements together. On a macroscopic scale through observation and anatomy, some iatrophysicists such as Borelli focused on explaining how muscles worked in conjunction together to form movements with dynamics or physical models. On a microscopic scale via observation and dissection, the contractility of muscle was to be explained by pneumatic expansion, a popular explanation supported by Descartes and Borelli, or inherent shape deformation, postulated by Nicolas Steno and Albrecht von Haller to an extent, based upon principles of fluids and statics. Other aspects of the human body such as circulation and digestion saw a number of explanations, and thus conflicting views based on the methodology used to derive and obtain an explanation, arise in the 17th and 18th centuries. = Prominent Iatrophysicists = One prominent iatrophysicist was Giovanni Borelli, who modeled the human body, various animals, and their motions using mechanical principles. A colleague of Marcello Malphigi, Borelli was a mathematician who made connections between what he observed in living things and inanimate but relatively simple systems. He dissected animals and examined how muscles were to increase mechanical advantage, observed how a variety of living things performed different movements and activities such as running, carrying loads, swimming, and flying naturally rather than by his intervention, and devised simple methods to calculate a person's center of mass. He also devised relatively simple experiments and devices to make his observations such as a plank and rod for center of mass and a spirometer for volume of air. At the end of his life, his work culminated in De Motu Animalium (1679), a publication showcasing his investigations in similarities and differences in muscles across living things and his understanding of the underlying mechanism of muscle contraction, expansion via influx of fluids or gases released from nerves. He also attempted to describe more complicated processes such as nerve transmission and digestion. Another notable iatrophysicist was the French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, who, as a consequence of his philosophy asserting that the human body and soul are two dual entities, treated the human body as a machine that could be quantified, disassembled, and studied. He attempted to model various phenomena such as the brain, movement, sleep, circulation, and senses with analogies to inanimate objects such as reservoirs, pipes, lenses and steam engines that often sought to maintain an equilibrium for certain states. Some of his claims often were independent of physical observation of the organ or body in question and emphasized what he deemed as \\"simple\\" or \\"rational\\" rather than reality. For example, he asserts that blood circulates throughout the body by expanding as vapor by the heart's heat rather than from contraction. William Harvey postulated blood flow as a closed, continuous loop that run throughout body that contained a certain quantity of blood. To test his claim, Harvey dissected human corpses and animals and, based on his anatomical findings, devised a simple demonstration of how arteries and veins continuously carried blood throughout the body. Taking advantage of the fact that arteries and veins were at different depths below the skin, he tied a person's arm and had them squeeze a bar to shunt blood from arteries to veins, indicating that blood somehow traveled along arteries and into veins. His claim was elucidated by Malphigi's discovery of capillaries and how they were interconnected with arteries and veins. One of the most influential iatrophysicists was Hermann Boerhaave, a Dutch physician and chemist at the Leiden University. Like other iatrophysicists, he viewed physiology as a mechanism. While he disagreed with the idea that the body and the mind were connected, he attributed everything related to the body to extension, impenetrability, or motion. Francis Glisson was known for his work on circulation of the blood, the mechanisms of the nervous system, and hereditary diseases. He was largely influenced by Harvey's work on the sentient nature of blood and his work demonstrates iatrophysical ideology particularly through his views of attraction and irritability, or the concept of how the body fibers react to irritation. In his work, Anatomia hepatis, he argues that branches cross, and carried blood is separated in the liver. This in turn is sucked up by biliary vessels through an attraction that Glisson attributes as similar, magnetic, or natural. Albrecht von Haller was another prominent iatrophysicist, who like Glisson, focused on physiology as mechanisms of body fibers. He shared Glisson's views on irritability, but unlike Glisson, attributed the reaction to external stimuli solely to body fibers, and not in the inherent power of matter as Glisson had suggested. In his work Physiologiae Corporis Humani (1757–1766), he described organs and muscles of the body as interwoven fibers. His viewpoints on muscles were that they had a contractile tendency which he termed vis mortua, or dead power. He attributed this muscle contraction to irritability, which he described as being an inherent power. He particularly made the distinction between irritability and sensibility, irritability being the power of muscular contraction and sensibility being nerve impulse. Therefore, a part was irritable if it contracted upon contact, and sensible if the contact impacted the mind. = Other Iatrophysicists = Santorio Santorio was a Venetian doctor who, in attempt to quantify human digestion, carefully measured his food/water intake and excretion weight over many years. To establish a mathematical relationship between food/water intake and excretion, Santorius designed a special chair that had a balance that weighed a subject's meal and consequent excrement. Based on these measurements, he then calculated the net change in weight for each day. In addition to knowing what he took in, he also analyzed the contents of his excretions and secretions, categorizing it by type and origin. He also made other clinical instruments to measure other medical quantities such as temperature and pulse. Nicolas Steno was a Danish scientist who developed a purely mechanical and geometrical model of muscle. In this model, he treated a muscle as an interwoven yet simple network of long fibers, forming a uniform and robust geometric shape. Contraction was then explained as the reshaping of this network to either shorten or lengthen along one direction, thus the muscle changed shape at a fixed volume by only changing the angles between each fibre. This explanation of contraction, and his consequent theory that the heart contracted by many of its fibers shortening and lengthening, was considered radical. The most popular explanation, supported by well known Iatrophysicists such as Descartes and Borelli, asserted that the heart contracted from its fibers inflating themselves through a chemical reaction.  Relationship with Iatrochemistry  Similar to iatrophysics, iatrochemistry was a school of thought that related medicine and anatomy to chemistry, instead of mechanics. Iatrophysics and iatrochemistry were closely related. Many prominent iatrophysicists such as Borelli and Descartes utilized chemistry in order to explain physiological processes. Particularly, Franciscus Sylvius was an adamant believer in chemical processes as an explanation for the body. He emphasized fermentation and effervescence for the input of chemistry and circulation into physiology. Iatrochemistry and iatrophysics had similar ways of thinking, and went hand- in-hand in many aspects. But they also conflicted at times. For example, the concept of fermentation arose from an iatrochemical background. Like the Parisian apothecary Henri Louis de Rouvière, who connected fermentation with health in his book titled: Reflexions sur la Fermentation, et sur la Nature du Feu (1708). However, this publication also dismissed the relationship of mechanics with health and the mechanistic model of the body. Another conflict arose in explanation of digestion. While iatrophysicists explained the event through mechanistic terms, iatrochemists argued for fermentation as the reason for the digestive processes in the body. Furthermore, while iatrophysicists rejected acid-base theory as an explanation for bodily processes, iatrochemists embraced the theory.  Influence on Medicine  In the Middle Ages, Galenic anatomo-physiology prevailed as the leading medical thought. Furthermore, Aristotelian natural philosophy had dominated for centuries, including the humoral system as a primary method of medical thought. However, the philosophies of Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen began to wane in popularity, replaced by anatomical and philosophical schools of thought based on mechanics and chemical naturalism. Ideologies such as iatrophysics and iatrochemistry began to prevail. The decline of Galenic philosophy-based medicine coupled with the rise of new ideologies was spurred by the advent of new discoveries in anatomy and physiology, such as that of William Harvey's work centered on circulation of the blood. His idea that pulse, respiration, and nutrition were all working components of a unified system revolutionized preexisting ideas about blood, nutrition, and heat. The discovery of the circulation of the blood was crucial in the development of iatrophysics in that it was the first that related “circulations” to physiological functions. This led to the advent of new discoveries such as the circulation of nutritive fluid, circulation of lymph, and circulation of nervous juice, all of which relate a machine-like mechanism to anatomy. Traditionally, physiological functions were believed to be regulated by purposeful tendencies. However, the advent of the new medicinal schools of thought transformed the way physiology was approached. Secretion and excretion were no longer due to attractive tendencies, the function of the lungs were now due to the mixing of different parts of the blood, digestion was seen as a process of grinding and mincing, and health and disease were associated with movement, obstruction, and stagnation of the various bodily fluids running through the body. The body increasingly became viewed as a function of a machine, especially with the development of Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation and motion. Newtonian physics came to widely influence the way the body was viewed, and physiology was increasingly focused on a clockwork mechanism, and the later hydraulics was even applied to the movement of bodily fluids. Furthermore, with the publication of Newton's Opticks in 1704, physiologists increasingly depended on the notions of ether and effluvia in their anatomical observations.

It now houses the Cornell chapter of the Delta Phi fraternity.  House  Llenroc (\\"Cornell\\" spelled backwards) was built for Ezra Cornell between 1865 and 1875. It is a fine and well preserved example of masonry Gothic Revival architecture. The house is constructed of \\"Llenroc limestone\\", a name used for the limestone quarried as building material taken from west of Libe Slope. Artisans from around the world created the many elaborate fixtures of the house including: English woodcarvers responsible for the carved interior molding on the first and second floor and stonemasons from Germany completed the exterior stonework. Irish, Scottish, Italian, and Indian craftsmen also made significant contributions. Eight complete marble fireplaces were also imported from Europe to be placed throughout the house. At the suggestion of Andrew Dickson White, the university's co-founder and first President, the phrase \\"True and Firm\\" was carved over the entrance to the house. Ezra Cornell died in 1874 as Llenroc neared completion. His wife and children lived there for 32 years, but vacated it in the early 20th century, as it was too extravagant for their needs. In 1911, Cornell's daughters Mary and Emma sold the house to the Delta Phi fraternity. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Construction According to The History of Llenroc and Pi Chapter, construction on Llenroc began in 1867. Ezra Cornell hired an Albany firm, Nichols and Brown, to design the plan for the house, which borrowed heavily from rural Gothic Villa and High Victorian Gothic styles of architecture. Cornell was also forced to open a rock quarry to acquire grey Lockport limestone (colloquially known as Llenroc limestone) with which to build the house. German artisans were commissioned to carve elaborate designs into the limestone, while English artisans were hired to carve the woodwork for the house. Irish, Scottish, Italian and Indian immigrants, were employed as laborers for the construction project. The house has 17 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms (one large bathroom to accommodate the house's many residents). Up to 26 people may make their residence at the house at any one time. Since the initial construction, a number of renovations have been carried out. In 1946, a major overhaul of the house was performed, during which time the house's basement was converted into a living area, complete with a bar. In 1955, a garage was erected adjacent to the house (although it was subsequently torn down). In 1967, the upstairs bathroom was renovated. In 2007, the kitchen was renovated. Notable features There are a number of notable aspects to the Llenroc property, other than the actual house. In 1925, the Delta Phi Memorial Staircase, at the southernmost extreme of the property, was donated to the Delta Phi fraternity by Arthur Baldwin in commemoration of his son, Morgan Smiley Baldwin, who was killed in World War I. The property also boasts tennis and basketball courts on its of land. Inside the house, hand-made twin chandeliers hang in downstairs living spaces, in the living and music rooms.  Fraternity chapter  The Pi chapter of the Delta Phi fraternity was founded in 1891 on the Cornell campus. After a brief stint in downtown Ithaca at 405 East State Street, the brotherhood moved to 515 Stewart Avenue. In 1911, the brotherhood made its last move, into the current residence of the Pi Chapter: Llenroc .

Syrian Civil War  Smoke rises in Tabqa after the city was hit by a Syrian Air Force airstrike in June 2013 On 26 November 2012, during the Syrian Civil War, a main route from Raqqa to Aleppo passing through al-Thawrah along the Euphrates was dotted with both government and Syrian rebel checkpoints. On 11 February 2013, rebel groups including the al-Nusra Front and Liwa Owais al-Qorani took over the city. On 21 November, there was fierce fighting between government troops and rebels in the town, but by 25 November, the rebels were back in control.

It is the only living species in the genus Georychus. Description Cape mole-rats closely resemble other African mole-rats in physical appearance. They have cylindrical bodies with short limbs, and large feet with leathery soles. The head is large and rounded, and the tail is short, with only a few sparse hairs. As with other mole rats, the eyes are very small, and external ears are absent. Adults are around in head-body length, with a tail, and weigh around . Females have three pairs of teats. Cape mole-rats can most easily be distinguished from other species of mole-rat by their fur. This is russet in colour over most of the body, with clearly distinct, silvery-white underparts. The head is darker, sometimes even a charcoal grey shade, with prominent white markings around the ears and eyes, and a smaller amount of white fur on the muzzle. The hair on the feet is also white. Unlike the related Damaraland mole-rats, Cape mole-rats have no guard hairs, although there are slightly longer stiff hairs around the mouth and feet, and the animals do have stubby whiskers. Lacking guard hairs, the fur is thick and woolly in texture. Distribution and habitat Cape mole-rats inhabit forested and savannah regions across the coastal regions of Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces in South Africa. Isolated populations have also been reported from KwaZulu-Natal, just east of Lesotho, and from Mpumalanga. Although there are no formally recognised subspecies, this may be due to limited research on the species, and it has been proposed that the mole rats of KwaZulu-Natal may represent an entirely distinct species. They apparently prefer sandy loam, alluvium, or clay soils. Fossils of Cape mole- rats are known from the middle Pleistocene of Elandsfontein in the Western Cape. Fossils referable to the genus Georychus, but not to the living species, have been identified from the lower Pleistocene at Swartkrans. Behaviour Like other mole-rats, Cape mole-rats rarely travel above ground, and spend most of their lives within excavated burrow systems. Their burrows typically range from in length, with tunnels about wide. They are herbivorous, feeding on the bulbs, corms and tubers of plants such as Star-of-Bethlehem, Cape tulips, and wood-sorrels, among others. They obtain this food by digging foraging tunnels to reach plant roots; these tunnels are narrower than their main tunnels and may be as little as below the surface. Food may also be taken to deeper storage chambers to store up for hard times, or when a female is raising young. They have no need to drink, being able to obtain all the water they need from their diet. In order to feed on bulbs, Cape mole-rats hold the food item in their fore-paws, chew away the base, and then peel away the husk with their teeth, moving from the tip to the base, in the manner that humans peel bananas. They have an enlarged caecum, and, like rabbits, are coprophagic, passing food through their digestive tract twice. In addition to storage chambers, the centre of the tunnel system includes a nest, and a separate latrine chamber. The tunnels are entirely closed off from the surface, although their presence may be evident from dome-shaped mounds of excavated material similar to mole hills. As a result, there is little circulation of air within the tunnels, which are therefore hypoxic and humid, but are protected from extremes of weather. The mole rats occasionally travel above ground to forage for surface vegetation, and to disperse to found new burrow systems. Despite spending almost their entire lives underground, and having very poor eyesight, Cape mole-rats exhibit distinct diurnal rhythms in time with the hours of daylight on the surface, and are primarily nocturnal. Unlike some other species of mole-rat, they are solitary animals, and, except when a female is raising young, only one individual inhabits each burrow system. They are highly aggressive towards other members of their own species outside the breeding season. When encountering a rival, they adopt a rigid posture with the head thrown back and jaws open, chattering their teeth and occasionally making short leaps in the direction of their opponent. Because burrow systems can approach within of each other, burrowing animals warn away rivals using sex-specific seismic signals. Cape mole-rats become alarmed if they sense a breach in their tunnel system, moving cautiously towards the break, and making characteristic 'pumping' motions with their hindquarters, of unknown significance. Predators that may enter the tunnel system to feed on Cape mole-rats include mole snakes and Cape cobras. They are particularly vulnerable while travelling above ground, where they may also fall victim to jackals, mongooses, owls and grey herons. Reproduction During the summer mating season, both sexes drum on the sides of their tunnels with their hind feet, using a different signal than when warning off potential intruders at other times of the year. The drumming is loud enough to be heard above ground at a distance of up to away. Once the male finds a partner, courtship and mating are brief, and interspersed with bouts of grooming. Gestation lasts 44 to 48 days, and a litter of three to ten young are born between August and December. The young are born hairless and blind, weighing only , and in length. The fur begins to grow on day seven, and the eyes open on day nine. The young grow rapidly, and begin to take solid food around day seventeen, being fully weaned at four weeks of age. By five weeks, siblings begin to show aggression towards one another, and they leave to establish their own burrows at around seven weeks. Cape mole-rats reach sexual maturity at eighteen months of age, and live up to five years. References * Animal Diversity Web (ADW). Accessed 7 April 2007.

While playing only a minor role in ethanol metabolism in average individuals, MEOS activity increases after chronic alcohol consumption. The MEOS pathway requires the CYP2E1 enzyme, part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, to convert ethanol to acetaldehyde. Ethanol’s affinity for CYP2E1 is lower than its affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase. It has delayed activity in non-chronic alcohol consumption states as increase in MEOS activity is correlated with an increase in production of CYP2E1, seen most conclusively in alcohol dehydrogenase negative deer mice.Chales S. Lieber. 2004. The Discovery of the Microsomal Ethanol Oxidizing System and Its Physiologic and Pathologic Role. Drug Metabolism Reviews 36:511-529. The MEOS pathway converts ethanol to acetaldehyde by way of a redox reaction. In this reaction, ethanol is oxidized (losing two hydrogens) and O2 is reduced (by accepting hydrogen) to form H2O. NADPH is used as donor of hydrogen, forming NADP+.Robbins and Cotran: Pathologic basis of disease (8th edition) This process consumes ATP and dissipates heat, thus leading to the hypothesis that long term drinkers see an increase in resting energy expenditure.Francisco Santolaria and Emilio González- Reimers. 2003.

The increase in rest energy expenditure has, according to some studies, been explained by indicating that the MEOS \\"expends\\" nine calories per gram of ethanol to metabolize versus 7 calories per gram of ethanol ingested.

Guam) is a United States territorial court with jurisdiction over the United States territory of Guam. It sits in the capital, Hagåtña. Appeals of the court's decisions are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It is not an Article III court, and therefore its judges do not have life tenure.  History  Courthouse in Hagåtña The District Court of Guam was established in 1950 by the Guam Organic Act to have the same jurisdiction as a United States district court. Under Section 22(a) of the Guam Organic Act, the Court was granted: * in all causes arising under the laws of the United States, the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States as such court is defined in section 451 of title 28, United States Code; * original jurisdiction in all other causes in Guam, jurisdiction over which has not been transferred by the legislature to other court or courts established by it, and; * such appellate jurisdiction as the legislature may determine. In 1951, the Guam Legislature created Commissioners' Courts, the Police Court, and the Island Court, decisions from which were appealable to the District Court. In 1974, the Legislature consolidated these courts into the Guam Superior Court. The legislature also created a Guam Supreme Court to hear appeals from the Superior Court. However, the Ninth Circuit found in 1976 that the appellate jurisdiction of the District Court could not be transferred without authorization by Congress, and the Supreme Court of the United States upheld this ruling in a 5-4 decision in 1977. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the dissenting opinion, in which he argued that Congress had plainly authorized the enactment of the challenged legislation.Guam v. Olsen, 431 U.S. 195 (1977). Further legislation divested the District Court's appellate jurisdiction over local matters in 1994. The District Court was housed in the Guam Congress Building from 1950 to 1968, in the Courthouse of Guam from 1968 to 1978, in the Pacific News Building from 1978 to 2000, and since then in the United States Courthouse Building.

Solitary and aggressive,Bennett, Nigel C.; Chris G. Faulkes. (2000) African Mole-Rats: Ecology and Eusociality. Cambridge University Press. p. 12. little is known about its ecology or behavior. It is monotypic in the genus Heliophobius. A common species, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Skull of a silvery mole-rat This is a medium-sized mole-rat with soft, silky silvery-grey fur. The head is paler around the eyes, the sides of the face and the snout, and some individuals have a small white patch on the forehead. The long, slightly-curved incisors lie outside the lips. The upper parts of head and body are silvery-grey to tan, the fur being up to in length, and the underparts are pale silvery-grey. The feet and claws are not enlarged for digging and are pale, with a fringe of stiff hairs around the margin of the digits. The tail is a pale colour and is less than 10% of the head-and-body length. In Malawi, the size of males is about 15% larger than females, but elsewhere there is little sexual dimorphism. Distribution and habitat The silvery mole-rat is native to Kenya, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Malawi in East Africa. Its typical habitat is open grassy woodland, including Combretum-Brachystegium woodland, as well as sub-montane grassland and rocky slopes at altitudes of up to . It is adaptable as to soil types, both sandy and black \\"cotton\\" soils being acceptable. Ecology Like other mole-rats, the species lives underground in a burrow which it digs with its incisor teeth. Like most other mole-rats, it is solitary. The diet is vegetarian and consists largely of roots, bulbs and corms, especially the roots of the leguminous Dolichos spp. and Vigna spp., with Vigna being a key foodstuff that attracts it to an area. Agricultural fields are sometimes invaded and rootcrops are eaten. They engage in coprophagy, consuming up to twelve faecal pellets at a time. Their foodstuffs are gathered underground by means of a long feeding passage running parallel with the surface and extending in one instance for over . Rather deeper in the ground, at about , is a nesting chamber containing a hollow ball of grasses, corn husks and root skins. Deeper still, at about , is a bolt hole for escaping from danger. There are also food-storage chambers, and blind burrows which are used as latrines. Silvery mole-rats are territorial and fairly aggressive, driving off other mole-rats. When cornered, they adopt a defensive stance with head thrown back and incisors exposed. Breeding takes place at different times of year in different parts of the range. Courtship can be quite vocal and is initiated by the male, which follows the female about, sniffing at her genital region. When he is accepted, they face each other and lock teeth or nibble each other gently with their elongated incisors before copulating. The gestation period is between 87 and 101 days, and the litter size is usually between two and five.

(28 May 1881 – 16 November 1968), was a German Jesuit priest and scholar at the Pontifical Gregorian University specialising in biblical studies and biblical archeology. He also served as the personal confessor of Pope Pius XII. In 1959, Pope John XXIII made him a cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as the first president of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity from 1960 until his death. Bea was a leading biblical scholar and ecumenist, who greatly influenced Christian-Jewish relations during the Second Vatican Council in Nostra aetate. Bea published several books, mostly in Latin, and 430 articles. Biography =Early life and education= Bea was born in Riedböhringen, today a part of Blumberg, Baden-Württemberg;\\"Cardinal Augustin Bea\\", Scarboro Missions his father was a carpenter. He studied at the Universities of Freiburg, Innsbruck, Berlin, and at Valkenburg, the Jesuit house of studies in the Netherlands. On 18 April 1902, he joined the Society of Jesus, as he \\"was much inclined to the scholarly life\\".Time. The Supreme Realist 6 July 1962 Bea was ordained a priest on 25 August 1912, and finished his studies in 1914. =Priestly ministry= Bea served as Superior of the Jesuit residence in Aachen until 1917, at which time he began teaching Scripture at Valkenburg. From 1921 to 1924, Bea was the provincial superior of Germany. Superior General Wlodimir Ledochowski then sent him to Rome, where he worked as the superior of the Biennial House of Formation (1924–1928), professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute (1924–1949), and rector of the Institute of Superior Ecclesiastical Studies (1924–1930). In 1930, Bea was named rector of the Pontifical Biblical Institute, a post in which he remained for nineteen years. =Consistory and episcopal ministry= Raised to the rank of cardinal before his episcopal consecration, Bea was created Cardinal-Deacon of S. Saba by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of 14 December 1959. On 6 June 1960, he was appointed the first president of the newly formed Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity, a Curial organisation charged with ecumenical affairs.Rafferty SJ, Oliver. \\"Augustin Bea: Scholar, Teacher, Cardinal\\", Jesuits in Britain, 2014 It was not until two years later that, on 5 April 1962, Cardinal Bea was appointed a bishop: the Titular Archbishop of Germania in Numidia. He received his consecration on the following 19 April from John XXIII himself, with Cardinals Giuseppe Pizzardo and Benedetto Aloisi Masella serving as co-consecrators, in the Lateran Basilica. He resigned his post as titular archbishop in 1963, one year after the Second Vatican Council was convened. Cardinal Bea was one of the electors in the 1963 papal conclave which elected Pope Paul VI, and was confirmed as the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity (renamed the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988) on 3 January 1966.

Recent Events 22 November 1968 He was buried in the apse of the parish church of Saint Genesius in his native Riedböhringen, where there is a museum honoring him. Impact and legacy Bea was highly influential at the Vatican II Council in the 1960s as a decisive force in the drafting of Nostra aetate, which repudiated anti-Semitism. In 1963, he held secret talks with Abraham Joshua Heschel, promoting Catholic–Jewish dialogue.Remembering Abraham Joshua Heschel, the Man — Forgetting “Imagining Heschel,” the Play, The Forward John Borelli, a Vatican II historian, has observed that, \\"It took the will of John XXIII and the perseverance of Cardinal Bea to impose the declaration on the Council\\".Tracing the Contemporary Roots of Interreligious Dialogue During a session of the Central Preparatory Commission, he also rejected the proposition that the Council Fathers take an oath composed of the Nicene Creed and the Anti-Modernist Oath.Time Magazine. The Supreme Realist 6 July 1962 After Alfredo Ottaviani, the heavily conservative head of the Holy Office, presented his draft of the schema on the sources of Divine Revelation, Bea claimed that it \\"would close the door to intellectual Europe and the outstretched hands of friendship in the old and new world\\".Time Magazine. The Cardinal's Setback 23 November 1962 He served on numerous ecumenical bodies and was the author of nine works, including The Church and the Jewish People (New York: Harper & Row, 1966). Bea was a confessor to Pope Pius XII from 1945 until Pius's death in 1958. The encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu was very much shaped by Bea and Jacques- Marie Voste, O.P.

The court sits in both St. Croix and St. Thomas. Unlike United States district courts, judges on the District Court of the Virgin Islands do not have life tenure, as the court is not an Article III court. Instead, the court is an Article IV court, created pursuant to Congress's Article IV, Section 3 powers. Appeals of the court's decisions are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia. The District Court used to have jurisdiction over all local civil actions brought in the Virgin Islands, but in 1976 the Virgin Islands Legislature--as allowed by the Revised Organic Act of 1954--gave a portion of this jurisdiction to the former Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands, at that time the local trial court. The jurisdiction of the Territorial Court was expanded to all civil actions in 1990. Similarly, the Legislature gave the Territorial Court jurisdiction over certain criminal actions brought under Virgin Islands law in 1985 and expanded that jurisdiction to all criminal cases in 1993, although the United States Attorney may still bring certain criminal actions in the District Court in some circumstances. In 2004 the Territorial Court was renamed the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. Before the creation of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands in 2007, the Appellate Division of the District Court heard appeals from the Superior Court in three-judge panels. From 2007, the Supreme Court hears these appeals exclusively, with its decisions subject to review by the United States Supreme Court if that court decides to grant certiorari.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and was the older brother of Canned Heat bassist Larry Taylor. Musical career After drumming with Boris Pickett and Herb Alpert, Taylor joined the Ventures in 1962 to fill in for Howie Johnson, who had been severely injured in an automobile accident. Johnson played with a neck brace for a period, but didn't want to be away from his family (in Washington state) for long periods, so he opted to be replaced. Taylor's distinct, harder-edged rock style so impressed the members of the band that they asked him to become a permanent member of the group. Taylor released a solo album in 1965 (\\"Mel Taylor & The Magics In Action\\"). In 1972, he decided to leave the Ventures to pursue a solo career, forming the band Mel Taylor & the Dynamics. During this time, they released four albums: \\"007 James Bond\\", \\"Sand, Sea and Love\\", \\"Mel Taylor in Japan\\", and \\"Roll over Beethoven\\". Taylor rejoined the Ventures in 1979, and remained their drummer until his death in 1996. After Mel died, his son Leon Taylor replaced him, and has been the Ventures' drummer ever since. Drumming style Taylor used the traditional grip as opposed to the matched grip. He originally started out with The Ventures on a 4-piece drum kit with just hi-hats and a single cymbal. Towards the end of the 1960s, he expanded his kit to include multiple tom-toms and double bass drums; he eventually added numerous crash cymbals to his set as well. Taylor used many drum kits over the years including Rogers, Ludwig, Gretsch, and Canopus. Taylor preferred Zildjian cymbals, Pro-Mark drumsticks, and Remo drumheads. Influences Taylor mentioned in many interviews that Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, and Louie Bellson were some of his biggest influences while he was growing up, and that he got the double bass idea from Louie Bellson. Personal life Only two weeks elapsed between Taylor's cancer diagnosis until his death at the age of 62 in Tarzana, California.

Systematics The genus name Dactylomys derives from the two Ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"finger\\", and (), meaning \\"mouse, rat\\", and refers to the middle two digits especially elongated relative to lateral ones as observed in these rodents. The genus contains three species: * Dactylomys boliviensis (Bolivian bamboo rat) * Dactylomys dactylinus (Amazon bamboo rat) * Dactylomys peruanus (Montane bamboo rat) Phylogeny Dactylomys is a member of the Echimyini clade of arboreal Echimyidae rodents. The closest relative of Dactylomys is Olallamys, and then Kannabateomys. These South American bamboo rats share unique features and are grouped under the informal clade name of \\"Dactylomyines\\". The dactylomyines are the sister genera to Diplomys and Santamartamys. All these taxa are closely related to the genera Echimys, Phyllomys, Makalata, Pattonomys, and Toromys. In turn, these genera share phylogenetic affinities with the clade containing Lonchothrix and Mesomys, and with Isothrix.

Grossfeld has represented the United States as a gymnastics competitor or coach in seven Olympic Games, seven World Championships, six Maccabiah Games, and five Pan American Games — in addition to many other major gymnastics events. Early life Born in New York City, Grossfeld was an excellent athlete in many sports from a young age. He won gold medals in two Jr. Olympic Cycling Championships, (1949–50). He also won the New York City 4 X 50 relay team title at Madison Square Garden in 1949, and the Bronx High School high jump and standing long jump titles in 1949. Grossfeld was also Captain of his high school swimming team, and competed mostly in the 50 yd. and 100 yd. freestyle events. In addition, he helped the team as a diver, and also swam and competed unattached in the NYC Boys’ Swimming Championships, winning gold in the 100 and silver in diving in 1949. He was awarded the “New York Maritime Benevolent Association Medal” in 1951 for saving a human life in peril. When he was 16 years old, he dove into an ice filled river in New York to save a drowning five-year-old. Gymnastics career =College= Grossfeld finished 2nd in the individual all-around at the 1957 NCAA Championships (he attended the University of Illinois, class of 1960). He received a master's degree from the school in 1962. Grossfeld received the Dike Eddleman Athlete of the Year Award for 1959 as a member of the Illinois Fighting Illini men's gymnastics team. At the NCAAs he won four gold - AA, FX, two HB titles, and three silver and three bronze medals. He finished in the top three in 10 of 16 events, (1957–59). At the Big Ten Championships he won seven gold medals - 3 AA, FX, R, PB, & HB (1957–59). At the national AAU Championships he was four times the horizontal bar champion (1955–61). =World Championships= He competed in the World Championships in 1958, finishing 7th in the team competition and 53rd in the individual all-around. Four years later, Grossfeld again competed in the World Championships, when the U.S. team placed 6th and Grossfeld finished 85th in the all-around. =Olympics career= Competing A two-time Olympian for the United States' men's gymnastics team, Grossfeld first competed at the 1956 Melbourne Games. While the U.S. finished 6th overall in the team competition (271.5 points, only 5 points behind Czechoslovakia for the bronze medal), Grossfeld finished in 39th place in the individual all-around competition (107.75 points). During the Games, he also placed 13th in the horizontal bar, 23rd in the free-standing exercise, 34th in the rings, 48th in the parallel bars, and 52nd in the pommel horse. Four years later, at the 1960 Summer Olympics, the U.S. team finished 5th and Grossfeld placed 36th in the all-around. Coaching After retiring from international competition, he coached the American gymnasts at the 1964, 1972, 1984, and 1988 Olympics. His 1984 team, with Mitch Gaylord, won the combined exercises championship. =Pan American Games= He had more success at the Pan American Games, competing in 1955, 1959, and 1963. He won 15 medals (eight golds; including three for Horizontal Bar championships), including the gold in the individual all-around in 1959. =Maccabiah Games= Grossfeld also dominated the Maccabiah Games in 1953, 1957 (winning 7 golds in 7 events; AA, R, PH, FX, HB, PB, & V), and 1965, winning a combined 17 gold medals. Coaching After retiring from competition, Grossfeld turned to coaching. He served as head coach of U.S. men's gymnastics team at five World Championships (1966, 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1987), and head coach of the U.S. team at Pan American Games in 1983 and 1987. He was also the head coach of the men's team at the 1986 Goodwill Games. In addition, he coached the U.S. gymnasts in three Maccabiah Games: 1973, 1977 (men and women), and 1981. His 1981 squad won three team gold medals. During this time, he also became a professor of physical education and became head gymnastics coach at Southern Connecticut State University, helping the program become one of the best in the country. He coached four Nissen Award winners (akin to football’s Heisman Trophy), three NCAA Div. II championship teams, 10 Consecutive Eastern Collegiate Conference (EIGL) team championships (1975-’84), and 148 gymnasts who achieved All-American status. Among those he coached were Peter Kormann, first U.S. Olympic individual gymnastics medalist since 1932; John Crosby, two World Cup individual gold medals; and three Pan American individual gold medal winners (1971 & ’75).

Biography Grow received his medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in 1909. In August, 1915 Dr. Grow met Dr. Edward Egbert, Chief Surgeon of the American Red Cross Hospital in Kiev, in Washington, D.C. Dr. Egbert convinced Grow to travel with him to Saint Petersburg, Russia, to assist in the Russian war effort. Dr. Grow was commissioned Lt.Colonel in the Imperial Russian Medical Corps and served as regimental surgeon in the First Division of the First Siberian Army Corps in Galicia. Surgeon Grow twice distinguished himself and received the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 3rd class with swords, and was awarded the Cross of St. George, 4th class for gallantry in action. Dr. Grow left Russia after the February Revolution of 1917, and entered the U.S. Army Medical Service later the same year. While chief flight surgeon of the Army Air Corps from 1934 to 1939 he (in conjunction with Major General Harry G. Armstrong) founded the Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. In July 1943, General Grow received the Legion of Merit for developing body armor to protect combat crews. A study of wounds incurred by members of combat crews showed that nearly 70 percent were caused by missiles of relatively low velocity. He led the way in developing a light body armor and steel helmet that saved many lives and materially improved combat crew morale. In May 1944, General Grow was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for developing a device to protect gunners from windblast; electrically heated clothing, gloves, boots, handwarmers and casualty bags for wounded; wind and fire resistant face and neck protectors; and a special combat ration for use on long bombing missions. Frostbite cases decreased and flight efficiency increased. After a study of psychiatric failures in combat, he helped institute rest homes, a new special pass system, and special training for medical officers in tactical units. As a result, every casualty of this type was returned to duty. Such efforts, especially in research, won for him the John Jeffries Award in 1947, the Gorgas Medal in 1950 and many others, including many from other nations. Just prior to his retirement, he received an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts in promoting the study of aeromedicine, airborne medical equipment, and organizational planning. Grow was appointed acting air surgeon for the Army Air Forces in 1945 and Air Surgeon in 1946. He served as the first Surgeon General of the United States Air Force from July 1, 1949 to November 30, 1949. =Retirement and death= He retired from the Air Force on December 1, 1949, and died October 20, 1960.

(rel.). - (rel.)] to fund the building of a centre for lectures and international exchanges in mathematics and theoretical physics. The Institute was inaugurated on 17 November 1928 and named after French mathematician Henri Poincaré (1854-1912). The institute's objective has been to promote mathematical physics, and it soon became a favourite meeting place for the French scientific community. In the 1990s, the IHP became a thematic institute modeled on Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) and a place for contact making, exchange and diffusion of knowledge. Organization The IHP's governing board has about 25 members. There are no permanent researchers other than the director and the deputy director. Since 2009, the institute has been headed by mathematician Cédric Villani (director), Fields Medals laureate in 2010. The current deputy director is the French cosmologist Jean-Philippe Uzan. Together with the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES), the Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques (CIRM) and the Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées (CIMPA) it is a member of the Carmin LabEx (Laboratory of Excellence), which aims at facilitating exchanges between mathematicians by building infrastructures for pooling skills and information. Main entrance of the Institute Scientific activities As a venue for national and international mathematical exchanges, the Institute organizes \\"thematic quarters\\" (three-month programmes on specific topics), intensive short-time collaborations, high-level PhD training courses, conferences and seminars in mathematics or related fields, such as physics, biology or computer science. Topics are selected by the IHP's Scientific Steering Committee. The IHP welcomes around 11,000 mathematicians each year. In 2013, the Institute launched the \\"Poincaré Chair\\", a research program designed to foster the international careers of talented young researchers. Numerous seminars or series of lectures take place at the IHP, such as the Bourbaki and Bourbaphy Seminars, the History of Mathematics Seminar, as well as some more specialised lectures in algebra, number theory, mathematical physics and elliptic curves. The institute also publishes three international scientific journals, the Annals of the Institut Henri Poincaré (Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics, Probability and Statistics and Non Linear Analysis), with original advanced fundamental research articles. A fourth journal is under consideration. General public The Institute co-organises and sponsors numerous, scientific and cultural events aimed at the general public (2011 : Mathematics, a Beautiful Elsewhere at the Fondation Cartier ; 2011 : A tribute to Evariste Galois ; 2012 : Centenary of Henri Poincaré's Death...). it has close ties with the associations and societies for the promotion of mathematics housed in its premises. Mathematical designs The library of the Henri Poincaré institute holds a collection of some 400 mathematical models and designs that come in different materials: glass, plastic, cardboard, wire, sewing thread on a rigid frame, plaster. This collection, which started with a donation by Martin Shilling, has been enhanced over the years, notably by wooden models built between 1912 and 1914 by lecturer Joseph Caron of the École Normale Supérieure.

Club career Born in Lorient, Morbihan, Ouédec was a product of FC Nantes's famous youth academy. He made his Ligue 1 debuts at the age of 17. He finished joint-top scorer in the 1993–94 season, netting 20 goals to help his team qualify for the UEFA Cup as fifth; he added a further 18 the following season, and the Canaries won the seventh national championship of their history. After two solid campaigns at Spain's RCD Espanyol, Ouédec moved to Paris Saint-Germain FC, and from there his career never improved: two-and-a-half seasons at Montpellier HSC (where he reformed, with little impact, Nantes' attacking trio which also comprised Patrice Loko and Reynald Pedros) and one with Belgian club R.A.A. Louviéroise with only nine goals combined. He retired from football after representing two sides in China, aged 32. International career A France international on seven occasions, Ouédec was, however, never selected for any major tournament's final stages. He earned his first cap on 29 May 1994, coming on as a 71st- minute substitute for Éric Di Meco in a 4–1 win against Japan for the Kirin Cup.

Early life and education David was born in the Clayoquot village of Opitsaht (on Meares Island off the west coast of Vancouver Island). His father Hyacinth David, an elder of the Clayoquot Nation, gave him a strong grounding in his cultural heritage. As a child, he attended a mission boarding school. While there, David visited the school's chapel for quiet and solitude. He saw that the carved altar in the chapel was similar to the artwork of his people in the awe and respect that it inspired. He studied art in the Job Corps, attended art school in San Marcos, Texas and Seattle, and worked briefly as a commercial artist (among other places, for Seattle's Bon Marché department store) before, in 1969, turning more specifically to Northwest Coast Native art after he was visiting the Burke Museum collection of Northwest Native art, curated by Bill Holm. Of this collection, David said \\"Here was this collection that Bill Holm had curated and understood and treated properly -- it was like, wow! This was not the academic, Mickey Mouse stuff. I was just blitzed. It was just between the eyes, like man, I've got to not only study and learn this, but I've got to master it.\\" In 1971, he met Duane Pasco, who encouraged his interest in two- dimensional representation and experimentation with Northwest Coast styles.\\" Artwork He was one of the innovators of serigraphy featuring traditional Northwest Coast Native motifs, and has worked in a variety of media, including carving totem poles. In the 1981 documentary \\"Spirit of the Mask,\\" David expresses his love of the wood and the tools with which he works. His eclecticism has involved an interest not only in his native traditions and the broad mainstream of contemporary North American culture, but also in other Native American traditions (he participates annually in a Sun Dance in the southwestern United States) and, for example, by Maori art. Rejecting the view that traditional Northwest Native cultures should somehow remain frozen in time, he has remarked \\"The fact is, there is always change and our people have always been comfortable with it.\\" He emphasizes that his work is not a tribute to the past, but to a living culture.

Accessed last April 7, 2007. from the screenplay by Aloy Adlawan. The film stars Jolina Magdangal, Iza Calzado, Rhian Ramos and Judy Ann Santos haunted by a spirit they accidentally unleashed while playing an Ouija board. This is the second film co-produced by GMA Films and VIVA Films years after VIVA withdrew from GMA. The joint production between the two companies was proven a success since fans believe that there is still chemistry among the two companies and it led to more jointly produced movies that became box-office hits. Plot Half-sisters Aileen (Judy Ann Santos) and Romina (Jolina Magdangal), along with first cousins Sandra (Iza Calzado) and Ruth (Rhian Ramos), reunite in Camiguin to bury their grandmother. Accompanied by Sandra's friend, Lucy (Desiree Del Valle), the five girls dare to call on the spirits of the dead when they find their old Ouija board from when they were kids. The Ouija board is burned by accident before they are able to finish the ritual, trapping a murderous entity around them. As they begin to realize the terror that they have brought upon themselves, Aileen and Romina's hostile relationship becomes even more strained, while Lucy's sanity brings a heavy burden on Sandra, and Ruth's boyfriend, Gino (JC De Vera), is unknowingly pulled into the danger and horror that awaits all of them. Aileen, a criminal advocate, accidentally kills a rape victim who was also haunted. Confronted by imminent death, the girls have nowhere to go unless they can identify the spirit and find out where it is buried. It is only by leading the spirit to its burial ground that they will be able to release the spirit from the Ouija board and survive its fatal hauntings. Using the Ouija board, the girls find that the ghost of a girl named Magda the Snake (she is called “The Snake” because she had the skin of snake at birth) is haunting them. They find the dead body of Magda from under the sea and made the spirit free with the help of a Christian priest. Magda was murdered by her envious twin sister Melda, because their parents loved Magda more. At the end it is revealed that it was Melda's spirit who haunted the girls and Magda's spirit was trying to protect them. Since they freed Magda's spirit, there is no one to protect them from Melda. At the end of the movie, Melda has killed every girl.

The football side is part of a larger sports association that has departments for basketball, bowling, boxing, gymnastics, team handball, ice hockey, swimming, tennis, table tennis, and volleyball. In January 2007 the Metropol Cricket Team Berlin joined the club as its cricket department.  History  The club was established 28 January 1891 as the gymnastics club Turn Verein Reinickendorf. To honour the memory of Adolf Dorner, who played a leading role in promoting gymnastics within German schools, the club was renamed Turnverein Dorner in September 1893. As the association grew to include departments for other sports it became Turn- und Sportverein Dorner. In November 1937 TSV Dorner joined Reinickendorfer Fußball Club Halley-Concordia and the Reinickendorfer Hockeyclub to create Turn- und Rasensportverein Reinickendorf. RFC Halley-Concordia was the product of the 1925 union between Reinickendorfer FC Halley 1910 and Concordia 95. This club made a brief two season appearance in top-flight Berlin football competition, from 1929 until 1931. Logo of Reinickendorfer FC Halley Concordia ca. 1931 In the aftermath of World War II most associations in the country, including sports and football clubs, were dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. Most of the former membership of Tura was re-organized as SG Reinickendorf Ost in late 1945, while the footballers formed SG Felsenbeck. In April 1947 SG Reinickendorf Ost gave rise to today's club, Berliner Turn- und Sportverein von 1891 Reinickendorfer Füchse. Felsenbeck became RFC Halley – Borussia in July 1948 and on 1 December the same year, joined BSTV.  Football  The club rose up out of lower-level local competition to third-division play in the Amateurliga Berlin (III) in 1958. After the formation in 1963 of the Bundesliga, Germany's first professional football league, Reinickendorf joined the new second-division Regionalliga Berlin on the strength of a third-place finish. A lower-table side there, the team was relegated after a 16th-place finish in 1969. They continued to play as a third-tier side for nearly three decades, finally slipping out of what had become the Regionalliga Nordost (III) to the Oberliga Nordost-Nord (IV) in 1998. During that time Die Füchse captured two Amateur Oberliga Berlin (III) titles, in 1989 and 1990, but performed poorly in the subsequent promotion rounds for the 2. Bundesliga. In seven seasons in the Oberliga Nordost-Nord, Reinickendorf generally earned ordinary results until finally being sent down to the Verbandsliga Berlin (V) in 2005, where they played until 2008, earning promotion back to the NOFV- Oberliga Nord. Throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium, the team has enjoyed some success in cup competition, winning Berlin's Paul Rusch Cup in 1997 and 2003 in addition to making two other losing cup final appearances. The club announced on 26 April 2012 that all sports departments of the club would form under the new name Füchse Berlin Reinickendorf. The football team was relegated from the Berlin-Liga to the Landesliga Berlin after finishing sixteenth in 2013–14, but bounced back to the higher league after finishing second in 2014–15.

The PJSA was formed in 2001 as a result of a merger of the Consortium on Peace Research, Education and Development (COPRED) and the Peace Studies Association (PSA). Both organizations focused on peace, conflict and justice studies. PJSA is dedicated to bringing together academics, K-12 teachers and grassroots activists to explore alternatives to violence and to share visions and strategies for peacebuilding, social justice, and social change. It also serves as a professional association for scholars in the field of peace and conflict resolution studies. It is the North American regional affiliate of the International Peace Research Association (IPRA). For reasons of language, Mexico is part of IPRA's South American affiliate. In 2010, PJSA became a bi- national organization with Canada, holding its first Canadian conference in Winnipeg, sponsored by the University of Winnipeg, Menno Simons College, and Canadian Mennonite University. Since then, PJSA has committed to holding its annual conference in Canada every third year. Today, more than 20% of PJSA's 22 board members are Canadians, who are also well represented on the board's executive committee. Presently, about 10% of its membership is Canadian, and this has been rising steadily. PJSA's broad membership helps to facilitate research that is highly relevant, and it allows the association to quickly disseminate the latest findings to those who will be among the first to implement new policies. PJSA's abilities to do this have been greatly enhanced in recent years with the formation of a speakers bureau, a syllabus collection project, and the creation of a very active publications committee. PJSA's current Executive Director is Dr. Michael Loadenthal who began in 2016. Mission and values The PJSA works to create a just and peaceful world through: # The promotion of peace studies within universities, colleges and K-12 grade levels # The forging of alliances among educators, students, activists, and other peace practitioners in order to enhance each other's work on peace, conflict and non-violence # The creation and nurturing of alternatives to structures of inequality and injustice, war and violence through education, research and action. Their members share many of the following values and beliefs: * Active nonviolence as a positive force for social change * Critical analysis of institutions and social structures * Societal transformation toward justice * Equitable sharing of world resources * Life-long education: community-based and service learning * Innovative and effective pedagogy * Liberatory use of technology and media research in support of community needs * Effective networks and alliances Resources and conferences The PJSA publishes a newsletter, The Peace Chronicle, maintains a member network and listserv, circulates employment, educational, and publishing opportunities via its member-access website, publishes a directory of peace studies and conflict resolution programs, manages a book series, maintains a syllabi repository, co-published the scholarly journal Peace & Change, offers a Speakers' Bureau of experts in the field, and hosts a website which houses a large library of resources for practitioners, academics, and other members of its community. The association also acts as a hub for the distribution of relevant employment opportunities, calls for papers, and funding opportunities, as well as a mechanism for members and supporters to organize, discuss, and announce projects. The organization hosts an annual conference on issues pertinent to its mission and values. Since 2002, PJSA has hosted 17 conferences, listed below: *2002: “Confronting Injustice, Ending War: The Role of Peace Educators and Activists After 9/11,” at Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.) *2003: “Fostering Alternatives to Violence,” at Evergreen State College (Olympia, WA) *2004: “The Challenge of Globalization: Incorporating Peace, Justice and Human Rights,” at the University of San Francisco (San Francisco, CA) *2005: “In Solidarity: Engaging Empire in Activism, Education and Community Strategies,” at Goshen College (Goshen, IN) *2006: “Who Speaks for the Common Good?” at Manhattan College (Bronx, NY) *2007: “Cultural Identity in a Mass Culture World,” at Elizabethtown College (Elizabethtown, PA) *2008: “Building Cultures of Peace,” at Portland State University (Portland, OR) *2009: “Exploring the Power of Nonviolence,” at Marquette University (Milwaukee, WI) *2010: “Building Bridges, Crossing Borders: Gender, Identity, and Security in the Search for Peace,” at Menno Simons College and the Global College (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) *2011: \\"A Living Movement: Toward a World of Peace, Solidarity, and Justice,\\" at Christian Brothers University (Memphis, TN; in partnership with the Gandhi- King Conference) *2012: \\"Anticipating Climate Disruption: Sustaining Justice, Greening Peace\\" at Tufts University (Boston, Massachusetts) *2013: \\"Peace Studies between Tradition and Innovation\\" at Wilfrid Laurier University (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) *2014: \\"Courageous Presence: Shifting Stories and Practices of Peace\\" at the University of San Diego (San Diego, California) *2015: “Cultivating the Just and Peaceable Self: Understanding Transformation and Transforming Understanding in Research and Practice” at James Madison University (Harrisonburg, VA) *2016: “Obstructing the Old or Constructing the New?

Cloud 9 is one of the feature characters in the 2011 six-issue limited series Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt. Fictional character biography Abby first demonstrates her powers while flying on a cloud in Evanston, Illinois. She is spotted by the Initiative program and was recruited into it by War Machine, who informs her that if she wants to continue flying, she needs a license. Once at the base, Abby is revealed to be very shy. Self-conscious about her body, she compares it to the other girls' bodies there whom she feels look like Vogue magazine models. During a uniform exchange, Abby accidentally enters the boys' showers and is found by fellow new hero MVP. He takes a liking to her and watches as she trains. However, when the training with another new hero Armory produces a mishap, MVP is shot by one of Armory's blasts when he tries to protect Abby from harm. Armory was grounded from superhero-ing and expelled out of the base.Avengers: The Initiative #1 (June 2007) Abby is one of the cadets sent on an emergency mission to protect the President from an assassination attempt by HYDRA.

Along with a group of fellow Initiative members, she travels to the Van Patrick home, attempting to convince the first MVP clone to download his memories into a device that will transmit them into KIA's brain, essentially reprogramming KIA, but possibly leaving the first clone mindless. Cloud 9 manages to distract KIA by playing on the latent memories of the original MVP and kissing him, allowing her to fill his lungs with her vapor. The MVP clone, rather than wipe his own mind, instead places the helmet on KIA, leaving him an empty shell. Abby and the clone decide to start things over, with Abby acknowledging that the clone is not the MVP she knew. When Cloud 9 completed her Initiative training, she was assigned to Freedom Force, the Montana team. She is then seen in action alongside Challenger, Think Tank, Equinox, and Spinner.Avengers: The Initiative #12 (May 2008) When Equinox is revealed to be a Skrull infiltrator, it is Cloud 9 who kills him.Avengers: The Initiative #18 Initiative instructor Tigra expresses concerns about Cloud 9 having developed a detached attitude towards killing in the line of duty after graduating to active service.

Early life Wallada was the daughter of Muhammad III of Córdoba, one of the last Umayyad Cordoban rulers, who came to power in 1024 after assassinating the previous caliph Abderraman V, and who was assassinated himself two years later in Uclés. Her early childhood was during the high period of the Caliphate of Córdoba, under the rule of Al- Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir. Her adolescent years came during the tumultuous period following the eventual succession of Aamir's son, Sanchuelo, who in his attempts to seize power from Hisham II, plunged the caliphate into civil war. As Muhammad III had no male heir, Wallada inherited his properties, and used them to open a palace and literary hall in Córdoba. There she offered instruction in poetry and the arts of love to women of all classes, from those of noble birth to slaves purchased by Wallada herself. Some of the great poets and intellectuals of the time also visited. Poet and controversial figure Wallada was an ideal beauty of the time: blonde, fair-skinned and blue-eyed, in addition to being intelligent, cultured and proud. She also was somewhat controversial, walking out in public without a hijab and in the fashion of the harems of Baghdad, she wore transparent tunics and embroidered her verses on the trim of her clothing. Her behavior was regarded by the local Imams as perverse and was strongly criticized, but she also had numerous people who defended her honor, like Ibn Hazm, the famous author of The Ring of the Dove. A Cordovan custom of the time was for poets to compete in finishing incomplete poems. Wallada gained recognition for her skill, particularly as a woman in what was almost entirely a male competition. One example of Wallada's work is her 'Taraqqab idha ja'a l-zalamu ziyarati' (When night falls, anticipate me visiting you), addressed to Ibn Zaydun. The poem is in the tawil metre (14-syllable hemistichs comprising alternating 3-syllable and 4-syllable feet of a short syllable followed by two or three long ones, rhyming in -ri) Relationship with Ibn Zaydún It was during one of these poetry competitions that she met the great love of her life, the poet Ibn Zaydún. Zaydún was also a poet and a nobleman with great political influence who had been making measured political strides towards Cordoba. Because of this and Zaydún's ties with the Banu Yahwar — rivals of her own Umayyad clan — their relationship was controversial and had to remain a secret. Eight of the nine poems preserved from Wallada were written about their relationship, which apparently ended under contentious circumstances. Written as letters between the two lovers, the poems express jealousy, nostalgia, but also a desire to reunite. Another expresses deception, sorrow and reproach. Five are sharp satires directed against Zaydún, whom she criticized for, amongst other things, having male lovers. In one writing, it was implied that the relationship ended because of an affair between Ibn Zaydún and a \\"black lover\\". The verse was as follows: :You know that I am the moon of the skies :But, to my disgrace, you have preferred a dark planet. Some say that the lover was a slave girl purchased and educated as a poet by Wallada, while others speculate that it could have been a male. A third possibility is that the poem was written in response to the times, as infidelity with black lovers was a common theme in Islamic poetry.Wallada: A Fateful Woman of the 11th Century , Segunda Republica January 24, 1999. Retrieved 2007, 04-07. The last of the nine poems alludes to Wallada's liberty and independence. Relationship with Ibn Abdús After her split with Zaydún, Wallada entered a relationship with the vizier Ibn Abdús, who was one of Zaydún's major political rivals. Abdús, who was completely enamored with Wallada, would end up seizing Zaydun's properties and having him imprisoned. Soon afterwards Wallada moved into the vizier's palace, and although she never married him, he remained by her side and protected her until his death, well into his 80s. Death Wallada died on March 26, 1091, the same day that the Almoravids entered Cordova. Legacy Among Wallada's most outstanding students was Muhya bint al-Tayyani, the young daughter of a fig salesman, whom Wallada welcomed into her house. After Wallada's death, Muhja would go on to write a number of kind satires about her. References Other sources *Dozy, R. P. Historia de los musulmanes en España . Madrid, Turner, 1988. *Garulo, T.

After the entry of the Mughals into the subcontinent, the region fell to Mughal authority as well. Later, due to internal conflicts within the Mughal dynasty the rulers of the hill provinces took complete advantage. Kangra regained its independence under Maharaja Sansar Chand who ruled for nearly 50 years. He was one of the most powerful administrators of the region. After he took the formal possession of Kangra fort, Maharaja Sansar Chand began to expand his territory. The states of Chamba, Suket, Mandi, and , Guler, Jaswan, Siba and Datarpur came under the direct control of Maharaja Sansar Chand.  Anglo gorkha war  The Gorkhas (martial tribe) came to power in Nepal in 1768. The gorkhas consolidated their military power and expanded their territory. Over a period of time the Gorkhas annexed Sirmour and Shimla hill states. Under the leadership of Amar Singh Thapa, Gorkhas laid their siege to Kangra. They defeated Maharaja Sansar Chand who was the ruler of Kangra, in 1806 with the help of hill chiefs. However, Gorkhas were not able to capture Kangra fort which came under the direct control of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh in 1809. After the defeat the Gorkhas began to expand towards the southern provinces. This lead in the Anglo-Gorkha war. They came into direct conflict with the British along the tarai belt after which the British expelled them. The British slowly emerged as the paramount powers in this conflict.  Anglo Sikh war  After the Anglo-Gorkha war the common border shared by the British domain and Punjab became extremely sensitive. Both the Sikhs and British wanted to avoid a direct conflict, but after the death of Ranjit Singh, the Khalsa army fought numerous wars with the British. In 1845 when the Sikhs invaded the British territory by crossing the Satluj river, the rulers of many hill provinces sided with the British. Many of these hill state rulers entered into the secret communication with the British. After the first Anglo-sikh war, the British didn't restore the hill territory departed by the Sikhs to their original owners.

It is written using Microsoft's .NET framework and uses the Microsoft Sync Framework. Features Users initially need to create a \\"folder pair\\" that represents the two folders (\\"left\\" and \\"right\\" folders) to be compared and synchronized. These folders can be on the local drive, on an external device such as a flash drive, or on a network share from another computer. SyncToy supports UNC paths. It provides a Browse option to find the folder or network share, or users can type it in directly. SyncToy offers two safeguards to ensure that the user does not lose files permanently when they are deemed unnecessary during a sync. Firstly, a user can preview what is going to happen when the sync takes place, without actually changing anything; secondly, any deleted files are optionally moved to the Recycle Bin. SyncToy defines three different types of operation to synchronize two folders: * Synchronize takes the two folders and makes sure they have exactly the same files. To do this, SyncToy may copy files in either direction and may delete or rename files in either folder. In the case that a file has been updated in both the left and right folders, the version with the later modification date is considered the winner. The other version will be overwritten (but can be recovered via the Recycle Bin if one's settings specify that all deletions go to the Recycle Bin). * Echo looks for changes (file modifications, new files, renames, deletes) in the left folder and makes the right folder match the left folder in every way. * Contribute is like an Echo, but it does not delete any files. SyncToy supports 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. (Note: the publication date given here is for the software, not the webpage.)  History  SyncToy started as a Powertoy for Windows XP. Initially releases took version numbers 1.x, culminating in version 1.4. These versions were written in Microsoft's .NET framework but contained their own code for folder synchronization. They included the same actions as the present version, plus two additional actions (labelled Subscribe and Combine): *Subscribe would update any file in the left folder that also exists in the right folder and is found to be older. No new files would be copied, only existing files updated, if needed. *Combine was similar to synchronize except that no files would be deleted between the pairs. If a file on one side is out-of-date it is renamed then the newer file copied, so both the updated copy and the older version are retained in that folder. And any file deleted in either of the paired folders is not deleted in the other folder. Only copy (and rename) operations occur. In November 2008 version 2.0 was released. This was a rewritten version built to use the Microsoft Sync Framework. Compared to version 1.4 it included better support for unattended synchronization runs, x64 compatibility, support for synchronizing encrypted files, file and folder exclusion based on both names and file types, renaming folder pairs and detection of drive letter reassignment. SyncToy 2.1 was released on November 10, 2009, and includes several minor enhancements and fixes for several bugs, including a serious issue where data on NAS would be corrupted, and another where deletes would not be synchronized when in Echo mode.

The fictional characters appearing in the manga and anime series xxxHolic were developed by Clamp, a group of four manga artists. The series takes place in modern Japan and focuses on various supernatural themes, with most of the main characters being humans with magical powers, supernatural creatures, or spirits. Published concurrently with Clamp's Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle manga, the two manga's plotlines and character cross over. The series' protagonist is Kimihiro Watanuki, a high school student plagued by yōkai and ayakashi spirits. One day, when running away from the spirits, he accidentally enters the shop of witch Yūko Ichihara, who has the power to grant wishes for a price. Yūko decides to grant his wish of making his demons go away in exchange for having him work as her assistant in her shop. Working at Yūko's shop, Watanuki encounters various spirits and also gets to know his classmates Shizuka Dōmeki and Himawari Kunogi better. Although Watanuki comes to value his new life at the shop, he begins to worry about Yūko and eventually promises that he will try to grant her wish, should she have one. The characters from xxxHolic were designed by Clamp's members Mokona and Tsubaki Nekoi. Some of their designs were inspired by Ukiyo-e art style. The series' characters' interactions and personalities, as well as the designs, have been met with positive critical reception. On the other hand, the designs featured in the animated adaptations have received mixed reviews. Creation and style The artwork of xxxHolic is influenced by the Ukiyo-e art style. A notable theme of the work, which recurs in other Clamp works, is the use of one-eyed or blind characters to express a feeling of loneliness and perhaps parallel Nanase Ohkawa's own poor right-eye vision. Likewise, in xxxHolic's crossover series, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, the loss of eyesight is also a theme, and Tsubasa includes artwork influenced by Ukiyo-e. The series' female characters are designed by Mokona, while Tsubaki Nekoi draws the males and spirits. The characters were named so that different people would find different meanings in them. Main characters =Kimihiro Watanuki= is a high school student plagued by his ability to see spirits. One day he stumbles, seemingly by chance, upon the wish-granting shop of Yūko Ichihara. She promises to remove his ability to see spirits if he works part-time in her shop until his work equals the worth of his wish. Since he lives by himself, he is experienced in cooking and cleaning, much to Yūko's pleasure. Besides doing domestic tasks for Yūko, Watanuki also often completes jobs of a spiritual or magical nature. Shota Sometani play Watanuki in the upcoming live action TV series. =Yūko Ichihara= is a witch who runs a shop that grants wishes to customers in exchange for something of equal value to the wish. Yūko takes anything from precious objects to abstract concepts, such as love or luck, in exchange. She is usually free-spirited and somewhat immature, drinking constantly, typically seen smoking a kiseru and forcing difficult tasks upon Watanuki. However, when giving customers or Watanuki advice, she is much more stern and offers cryptic messages that serve as warnings of impending danger. She constantly speaks of inevitability (\\"hitsuzen\\") and how nothing is a coincidence. The actress and model Anne Watanabe plays the role of Yūko in the live action TV series. =Shizuka Dōmeki= is a schoolmate of Watanuki. He lives in a shrine owned by his late grandfather Haruka Dōmeki, a Shinto priest who taught Shizuka about folklore and Shinto practices during his childhood. However, despite his heritage, Dōmeki does not have the ability to see ghosts or spirits, though he can sense them and has a natural ability to exorcise them. He is part of the school's kyūdō club and excels in school competitions. Dōmeki barely speaks unless explaining folklore or asking Watanuki for meals. Despite Watanuki's initial dislike for him, Yūko often makes Dōmeki join Watanuki in his jobs as his ability to exorcise spirits negates Watanuki's ability to attract them. Utilizing Yūko's shop, Watanuki gives Domeki half of his eye after he loses his right eye's vision to the spirits, which allows Dōmeki to see and experience what Watanuki goes through. He also gives Watanuki a large amount of his blood, which, according to Yūko, causes their personalities to change. Yūko gives Domeki a magic egg obtained by Sakura while working for her; however, Dōmeki does not know what it does or when he should use it. Four years after Yūko's death, Dōmeki is a university student studying ancient history. He often visits Watanuki in the shop. Because Watanuki cannot leave the shop, Dōmeki provides assistance both with Watanuki's work and by providing essentials, such as food. After six more years, Dōmeki graduates and has become an assistant to one of his professors at the university. In the xxxHolic Rō Adayume OVA it is revealed that Dōmeki is engaged with Kohane Tsuyuri, having delivered his wedding's invitation to Watanuki. After more than one hundred years have passed since Watanuki inherited the shop, Dōmeki's great grandson is Watanuki's new assistant and still possesses the egg Yūko gave to his great grandfather. Masahiro Higashide play Dōmeki in the upcoming live action TV series. =Himawari Kunogi= is Watanuki's love interest and classmate. She is very cheerful and friendly around Watanuki and Dōmeki. However, though Watanuki is very open in showing his feelings and admiration for her, she appears oblivious to the fact that he likes her. Watanuki often invites her to join him for various outings, but Himawari usually has some prior engagement, which comically and inadvertently leaves Watanuki alone with Dōmeki. Watanuki originally believes that she is his \\"goddess of good luck\\", though Yūko seems to think otherwise, often dropping cryptic hints about Himawari's true nature. It is eventually revealed that Himawari emanates misfortune that affects everyone around her except her parents and those with spiritual abilities, such as Dōmeki and Yūko. Her bad luck causes Watanuki to fall from a second story window and nearly die as a result of the fall and shattered glass. Yūko has them rush Watanuki to her shop, where they manage to save his life. Himawari offers to take on any physical scars Watanuki would have received from the accident as a payment for keeping him alive. After revealing this to Watanuki, she attempts to cut all connections with him. Watanuki, however, tells her that he is truly happy around her no matter what and refuses to stop seeing her. He later gives her a small bird he names that is immune to her bad luck. The small bird comes from an egg that was retrieved by Sakura from an alternate Tokyo in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. After Watanuki tells Himawari that he loves her and is glad to have met her, Himawari begins to develop feelings for him. She is the only main character not shown visiting Watanuki after he inherits the shop; she attends a university far away from the shop, and because her natural misfortune causes problems with the shop's magic, she promises only to enter the shop on Watanuki's birthday, though she calls occasionally. Himawari ends up marrying a businessman whose identity is unknown. She was played by Karen Miyazaki in the xxxHolic TV drama. =Kohane Tsuyuri= is a young girl who has been featured on many paranormal TV shows as a child prodigy, medium and exorcist. After first developing her powers, she helped her mother learn that her father was having an affair, which caused her mother's personality to drastically change. As a result, her mother refuses to touch her, refer to her by name, or socialize with others; she also takes away any objects or food not considered \\"pure\\". She tries to get Kohane onto as many TV shows as possible, and uses the earnings to buy extravagant material possessions. Nevertheless, Kohane thinks that her mother's behavior is her fault for developing supernatural powers. Due to her family life, Kohane is quiet and lonely, though she attempts to stay strong for her mother's sake and takes the blame for the family's problems. She eventually meets Watanuki and forms a bond with him. Despite protests from Kohane's mother, Watanuki continues to contact her and make her happy. It is later revealed that Kohane's powers of exorcism developed from one of Sakura's magical feathers, though her ability to see spirits is natural. She asks Yūko to grant her happiness, which Yūko does by fixing the various external problems in her life, such as her reputation, in exchange for her exorcism ability. However, Yūko cannot fix her issues with her mother, as a person's true character can only be changed by their own will. Four years after Yūko's death, Kohane is a student at Tsuji Academy and often visits Watanuki in his shop. She continues to live with the grandmother fortune teller. After six years, she is a student of folklore at the same university as Dōmeki. In the xxxHolic Rō Adayume OVA it is revealed that Kohane is engaged with Dōmeki, who states that even so, Watanuki is Kohane's most important person. Secondary characters =Zashiki-warashi= is a spirit girl who lives on a mountain with pure spiritual energy. She is very shy and prone to crying, which causes her tiny Karasu-Tengu Guardians to defend her. Ironically, the guardians will come to her aid even if she weeps tears of joy. Zashiki-warashi develops a crush on Kimihiro Watanuki as his endeavors become known among spirits, and she first meets him when she accidentally steals Shizuka Dōmeki's soul while attempting to get a good Valentine's Day gift for Watanuki. He later sees her while giving her a White Day present, while restoring the pipe fox spirit to his smaller form. Watanuki later rescues her from Lady Jorōgumo, who captures her after a failed attempt to recover Watanuki's eye, and she appears again briefly with her friend, Ame- warashi, after Watanuki recovers from a near death experience. =Ame- warashi= is a high-ranking rain spirit who has a very hostile attitude toward humans due to the fact that \\"humans have no care or regard whatsoever with living nature\\". She is somewhat close and protective of Zashiki-warashi and often teases Watanuki despite him helping to fulfill her request. She owned the creature Kudagitsune, which later becomes Watanuki's guardian. She gives it to Yūko Ichihara as a compensation for fulfilling her wish to revive the sick hydrangea. Ame-warashi is played by Aoi Morikawa. =Kudagitsune= , later named by Watanuki, is a tube fox spirit given to Yūko as payment by Ame- warashi for Watanuki's help. It quickly becomes attached to Watanuki, and protects him during dangerous situations. It is generally a small snake-like being with a fox's head, but it can transform into a traditional nine-tailed fox when it reveals its true power. It is able to create \\"Foxfire\\" in the form of large fireballs, and it can detect evil spirits. It takes a large amount of pure spiritual energy to revert it to its initial form. =Maru and Moro= and , whose respective real names are and , are two artificial beings that keep Yūko's shop in existence. They are energetic and often speak in unison and repeat the words of others. They cannot leave the shop, as they have no souls. They help Yūko around the shop most of the time, but often go into long periods of hibernation due to the difficulty of keeping the shop in existence. Yūko uses the last bit of her power to revive Maru and Moro and send them back to the shop. After Watanuki becomes the new shop's owner, Maru and Moro become his assistants. Later it is shown that they have developed a very close bond with Watanuki, similar to the one they had with Yūko. Played by Ririka Kawashima in the drama series. Played by Tsumugi Hatakeyama in the drama series. =Mokona Modoki= refers to a pair of two rabbit-like creatures created by Yūko and Clow Reed in preparation for the events in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic. The white Mokona travels with Syaoran's group, while the black Mokona stays in Yūko's shop. Both are based upon the original Mokona of Magic Knight Rayearth, whom Yūko and Clow encountered while Mokona was traveling through different worlds. Mokona provided Yūko and Clow with the knowledge of alternate dimensions. The black Mokona, whose real name is , acts as a liaison between the Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle protagonists and Yūko. Mokona likes to be around Yūko, who treats Mokona as a \\"drinking buddy.\\" He also likes to be around Watanuki and play with Maru and Moro. While allowing the two groups to speak, Mokona can also teleport and receive items from the white Mokona by swallowing them. Like the white Mokona, he has a single earring. It is a blue gem made by Clow Reed and has the ability to seal magical power, and it also holds Sakura's memories of Syaoran and Watanuki's memory of his past. =Haruka Dōmeki= is the deceased grandfather of Dōmeki, and a former Shinto priest who taught Shizuka Dōmeki many of his practices. He has the ability to destroy evil spirits and cross into dreams, and often appears to Watanuki's dream, taking on the appearance of a teenager. As a teenager, he looks exactly like Dōmeki, though he has a somewhat more cheerful and outgoing personality than his grandson, and he is always smoking. He acts like a guide to Watanuki as Yūko does, often giving him advice, telling him about Dōmeki, and helping him work out problems. Before her death, Yūko visits Haruka in a dream requesting that he keep protecting Watanuki. In the xxxHolic Rō Adayume OVA, Haruka becomes Watanuki's client as he wants him to free Dōmeki from nightmares. =Syaoran= refers to two identical teenagers who appear across the series. The first one is from a parallel dimension and visits Yūko's shop to help him save his childhood friend Sakura. He gains the ability to travel across dimension with the white Mokona in order to recover the memories Sakura lost and remains in contact with Yūko. The second Syaoran shortly visits Yūko, as he is sent to another world. While Watanuki does not know him, Syaoran paid a price to save Watanuki from dying after being affected by Himawari's bad luck, and constantly he can hear him yelling him not to die. It is later revealed that the second Syaoran was responsible for creating Watanuki when he wished turn back time, but at the price of losing his freedom to the sorcerer Fei-Wang Reed. Watanuki was used to replace Syaoran in his world, sharing the same parents, but forgot all of this, when he paid Yūko with his memories to locate Fei-Wang. Watanuki later learns of their relationship in the ending of Tsubasa when both are imprisoned by Fei- Wang's curse. To free each other Syaoran has to travel across dimensions forever. Both Syaorans are voiced by Miyu Irino. =Sakura= comes from another dimension in a catatonic state while under the care of the teenager Syaoran. As Sakura is about to die due to losing her soul, Syaoran goes on a search across dimension to save her. However, the usage of the white Mokona Modoki to travel across dimension requires Sakura to pay to Yūko with all her memories regarding Syaoran, her most important person. As the series continues, Sakura recovers and gives Yūko an egg as part of a job which then becomes two and are given to Watanuki and Domeki. Her soul is later separated from her body and appears in the Dream World where she meets Watanuki. Befriending him, Sakura finds Watanuki similar to the other Syaoran, and later disappears from the Dream World. She is voiced by Yui Makino. Reception The characters from xxxHolic have been well received by publications from manga and anime. Although Watanuki's character was initially seen \\"a little bit weak to be the lead character\\", his interactions with other characters and his development across the series has been praised. Todd Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk agreed, focusing in the characters in general and how they were developed across the anime. The emotional focus on the series has also been well- received due to its comedy and the way characters deal supernatural elements. Yuko has also been called the \\"star performer\\" from the series, and her death has received mixed feelings; although writers found events following her death to lack the main characters' comedy, the way Watanuki dealt with her role was enjoyed. The connections between the characters from xxxHolic and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle has also received positive comments as how in both series, an important connection between two characters from the two series is hinted. However, the lack of reading the other series would confuse the readers or it would persuade them to read the other series. The manga's character designs have been labelled as \\"striking\\", with focus on the notable traits that Clamp gives to all their characters. Additionally, the large number of outfits characters tend to wear was praised for being notable from each other. Critics have found issues with anime's character designs due to how the limbs were notably extended in most episodes, leading to superdeformed. Nevertheless, such designs have been found comical with every character still noted to be distinctive. The voice casting for the English release of the series has been found remarkable with comments focused on the work from Colleen Clinkenbeard as Yuko and Todd Haberkorn as Watanuki; although the former was enjoyed, the latter received mixed responses.

The writer, Brian Michael Bendis decided that a genetically mutated spider would be the source of Peter's power, rather than a radiated one, to update Spider-Man for the 21st century. Origins The OZ formula is created by Osborn Industries as part of their research into super soldiers for S.H.I.E.L.D.. Despite being imperfect, Norman Osborn garners much interest in the OZ formula, while not revealing what it actually is. Osborn subsequently begins to fail, as it is unable to deliver on Norman's promises. The drug is developed prior to Ultimate Spider-Man #1 and has begun animal testing. As of in Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man #6, it's revealed that the OZ formula has power of immortality, such as reviving Peter Parker and Norman Osborn from death. It is unknown if the immortality effects extends to other users presumed dead. Peter Parker (Spider-Man) While on a science field trip to Osborn Industries, Peter Parker is bitten by an escaped spider mutated with OZ. The OZ mutates Parker's blood. The effects of the OZ treated spider venom manifest as: *Enhanced strength *Enhanced agility *Enhanced reflexes *Enhanced stamina *Enhanced durability *Immortality **Healing factor *Wall-crawling *\\"Spider-sense\\", warning him of danger. Osborn realises Peter was infected by the spider, and attempts to give himself powers using OZ. The OZ Explosion In the experiment Norman Osborn performs in an attempt to give himself powers, there is an explosion which exposes several people to OZ. =Norman Osborn (The Green Goblin)= The only person who was intentionally affected by the OZ (in this instance), Norman Osborn had it injected into his mainline as a solution of his blood. He may have caused the explosion with his new abilities. The effects of the OZ treated blood manifest as: *Ability to change to Goblin form at will (discovered in the Ultimate Six limited series. Prior to this OZ injections were used mainline) *Greatly enhanced strength while in Goblin form *Enhanced durability while in Goblin form *Super-leaping while in Goblin Form *Advanced healing factor while in Goblin form *Can throw fire- balls while in Goblin form His Green Goblin persona appears as a green, slightly draconic goblin. He is originally only green in the face, but later \\"evolves\\" and gains full green coloration. He also appears to continue his mutation, becoming more in control as time passes, as well as increasingly lethal. =Otto Octavius (Doctor Octopus)= Norman Osborn's head scientist who uses a set of mechanical arms for multi-tasking and handling hazardous substances. In the initial explosion these arms are fused to his body. It is first thought that he controls only the arms, but this is later disproven. The OZ explosion grants Doc Ock ferrokinesis (the ability to control metal). =Harry Osborn (The Hobgoblin)= Harry Osborn was caught in the explosion while visiting his father at work. There has not been confirmation of the OZ mutation being caused by the explosion, or during the Hobgoblin arc when he is led to a bunker containing OZ, or both. The effects of the OZ exposure manifest as: *Ability to change to Hobgoblin form at will *Greatly enhanced strength while in Hobgoblin form *Bullet-proof exoskeleton while in Hobgoblin form *Advanced healing factor while in Hobgoblin form *Can use limited pyrokinesis while in Hobgoblin form, e.g., self-immolation and fire projection The appearance of his Hobgoblin persona is somewhat similar to his father's Goblin persona, but is orange in coloration and far more demonic. If exposed to OZ further, his mutation will most likely continue, like his father's. Mary Jane Watson After the exposure to an unspecified quantity of the OZ formula courtesy of a clone of Peter Parker, Mary Jane becomes a similar being to the Osborns, except for long red hair all over her body. She is known as the DemogoblinNo Ultimate Spider-Man No. 101 thread? (SPOILERS) – Page 3 – Jinxworld Forums The process left her with post-traumatic stress. The Effects of the OZ infusion manifest as: *Ability to change to Demogoblin form when suffering from severe anger, stress or panic. *Greatly enhanced strength while in Demogoblin form *Enhanced durability while in Demogoblin form *Enhanced reflexes while in Demogoblin form *Enhanced stamina while in Demogoblin form *Powerful claws while in Demogoblin form Mary Jane appears to be cured a short time after infection by Dr Franklin Storm. This cure is later seen wearing off, when her fingers turn to claws watching Peter talk to Kitty Pride.

The campaign was created by Joe Lawson and Noel Ritter while working at The Martin Agency. According to an episode of the public radio show 99% Invisible, \\"It's so easy a caveman could do it\\" was first coined by Ritter. The inspiration for the campaign came from \\"Pastoralia\\", a short story by George Saunders – the story revolves around two employees, a man and a woman, who work as \\"cave-people\\" for a failing theme park. In 2004, GEICO began an advertising campaign featuring Neanderthal-like cavemen in a modern setting.Geico Caveman Commercials at youtube.com The premise of the commercials is that GEICO advertises that using their website is \\"so easy, a caveman could do it\\"; and that this slogan offends several cavemen, who not only still exist in modern society but live as intelligent, urbane bachelors. The first three GEICO commercials to feature cavemen were \\"Apartment\\", \\"Apology\\", and \\"Boom Mic\\". Jeff Daniel Phillips and Ben Weber played the two earliest cavemen and continuously reprise their roles. Actor John Lehr appears most frequently as the caveman, while Ben Wilson has also portrayed one of the characters. The makeup effects for the caveman include facial prosthetics, dental veneers, lace hairpieces, and body hair, and were designed and created by Tony Gardner and his special effects company Alterian, Inc. In an online interview with Esquire, Joe Lawson said that one aspect of the ads is a critique of modern political correctness. The cavemen have been honored by the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame. Television advertisements # As a fake, caveman-insensitive commercial is being filmed, the boom operator turns out to be a Neanderthal caveman who stops the filming and yells \\"Not cool!\\" # Two cavemen in their apartment watch the ad from commercial # 1 on TV, and take offense at its condescending tone, as it makes cavemen seem less intelligent. # A spokesman meets with two cavemen in a restaurant to apologize for the promotion, explaining that \\"we had no idea you guys were still around.\\" One of the cavemen tells the waiter, \\"I'll have the roast duck with the mango salsa.\\" Considered as a subtle jab at AFLAC, for its duck mascot (AFLAC once televised a humorous commercial; having duck served in an Asian restaurant to potential buyers of the insurance programs). The other caveman informs the waiter that \\"I don't have much of an appetite, thank you.\\" (Writer Ron Rosenbaum called the roast-duck line \\"the iconic moment\\" of the ad series, due to \\"the surreal contradictions\\" of cavemen \\"au courant enough to be unimpressed by now antiquated nouvelle cuisine.\\")The Geico Caveman Finally Jumps the Shark , Pajamas Media, January 26, 2007 # A caveman on a moving sidewalk at an airport spots a GEICO billboard featuring an overly silly representation of a caveman, along with the insulting phrase. The album- version of the Röyksopp song \\"Remind Me\\" plays in the background. # A follow up to the fourth commercial shows the same caveman talking on his cell phone, complaining about the offending billboard, saying \\"I'm looking right at it!\\". # A caveman in a psychotherapy session complains to his therapist, played by Talia Shire, about GEICO's attitude towards cavemen. The therapist says that an ad that said \\"So easy a therapist could do it\\" wouldn't make sense to her. # Continuing the therapy session, the therapist says \\"No one said it was going to be easy.\\" The caveman replies that if Geico had taken that attitude, \\"I wouldn't be having an existential meltdown right now.\\" Another concurrent psychotherapy commercial has the caveman role playing with a stuffed doll caveman. He says, \\"He's just a doll!\\" # All three cavemen are at a high-rise- apartment party. On the balcony, two of them discuss one caveman's decision to purchase GEICO's insurance because of its low price. The second caveman doesn't entirely fault him, but states that \\"a little loyalty would be nice\\" in their opposition to the company. During their discussion, the third caveman interrupts from inside, exclaiming excitedly \\"Tina's here; we're getting back together!\\" The first caveman quickly snaps at him, exclaiming, \\"Hey! Give us a minute!\\" # A caveman on a news-type talk show debates a human expert about whether or not cavemen \\"have failed to adapt.\\" The expert insults the caveman by saying, \\"It looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the rock.\\" # The continuation to the tenth commercial, the woman on the bottom right says about how ego in our society is at the forefront. The man on the left asks the caveman, \\"Response?\\". The caveman's response is \\"Uhhhh, what?!?!\\" # The cavemen watch the show Cavemen, and ridicule the series. This ad premiered during Super Bowl XLII; the show itself had already been canceled. # A caveman dances in various styles in a rather ridiculous manner, remarking how hard it is to dance in such a style, making such exclamations as \\"GEICO probably thinks this is easy, too!\\" # \\"Match\\": Focusing on GEICO's sports marketing efforts, a caveman faces Billie Jean King in a tennis match. The caveman is winning handily, but when he looks at the scoreboard he realizes that it shows him losing 0-6, 0-6, 0-5. He doesn't understand, until he realizes the tournament is sponsored by GEICO. Feeling set up and humiliated by GEICO, he stands up and says \\"I get it! I quit, but I get it!\\" He then notices the chair he was just sitting in also bears a bold GEICO logo. # \\"Plane Banner\\": A caveman and his girlfriend arrive at the beach. As the lady begins to disrobe to her bikini a plane flies by with a GEICO banner. The distraught caveman takes his sunglasses off and says \\"I'll be in the car\\". # \\"Walkin'\\": Two cavemen ride up to an outdoor bar on motorcycles. At the bar, they see two typically beautiful girls who are clearly impressed by the bikers. The bikers then see a billboard similar to the one in ad #4 (although, since this ad targets motorcycle insurance, the caveman is on a motorcycle). They suddenly lose interest in the women, heading back to their bikes; the women seem confused by the sudden change in the cavemen's demeanor. The song \\"Hurt You\\" by The Sounds plays in the background. # \\"Number 1 Fan\\": A caveman is shown on a Jumbotron at a basketball game as the \\"GEICO Ultimate Fan.\\" He rejects the congratulations of those sitting around him, although he just won court-side seats. As the commercial ends, the arena announcer plugs GEICO, using the \\"so easy\\" phrase. # \\"Metal Detector\\": A caveman is walking on the beach with his girlfriend, looking for treasure with a metal detector. The device beeps, exciting the couple. The caveman digs into the sand with a net and pulls out a set of car keys with a GEICO key chain attached. He throws the keys and metal detector on the ground and walks away in disgust. # \\"Breaking Point\\": A caveman who is dressed as a caricature of Modern Man sees an advertisement for Geico on many televisions through a window and can't take it anymore; he takes off his glasses, unties his ponytail, and takes off his coat, and runs away acting like his former caveman-self set to \\"Let Me Be Myself\\" by 3 Doors Down. This scene was used in part for the music video of the same song. # \\"Bowling\\": The continuation of the 18th commercial, the caveman comes across a bowling alley and sees two of his caveman buddies there and joins the game with them. The caveman who just came in went first, and one of his buddies went second. While the second caveman's pin sweeper is sweeping the pins, it shows on the pin sweeper an advertisement for Geico with the \\"So easy\\" phrase, along with the GEICO logo on the pinsetter. This was also set to \\"Let Me Be Myself\\" by 3 Doors Down. This video served as the ending to the music video of the same song. # \\"Glovebox\\": This is a commercial for a Geico iPhone App called \\"Glovebox\\" which is demonstrated by a hand model (with an unusually hairy hand). The end of the commercial's script states the app is \\"So Easy a Caveman Can Do It\\", which angers the hand model, who is revealed to be a Caveman as he storms off, saying, \\"Where's my coat? It was suede, with the fringe!\\" # \\"Fire\\": Part of a separate series of Geico commercials where in which actor Mike McGlone walks into an empty room and asks a rhetorical and/or obvious question. In the commercial, his question is \\"Could switching to GEICO really save you 15 percent or more on car insurance? Did the Cavemen invent fire?\\" The scene then cuts to one of the Cavemen on a bed reading with a woman, he looks at the camera and sighs, then picks up his remote and turns his fireplace on. Also, at the time of the launch of the Caveman's Crib website, a short advertisement featuring all cavemen at the \\"hip party\\" featured on the website was added after every Caveman commercial that was currently airing. Recently, one of the Cavemen was spotted filming a new commercial (or series of commercials) in Homer, Alaska on the Time Bandit boat (from The Deadliest Catch TV series). The Mayor of the city presented the caveman with a key to the city.http://www.homernews.com/stories/031710/news_1_002.shtml Television sitcom spin-off On March 2, 2007, Variety reported that a sitcom based on the cavemen characters, simply titled Cavemen, was being developed for ABC.GEICO Cavemen Will Be Focus of New ABC Sitcom, FOXNews.com, March 2, 2007 The magazine reported, \\"'Cavemen' will revolve around three pre-historic men who must battle prejudice as they attempt to live as normal thirtysomethings in modern Atlanta.\\" ABC announced this series for their fall schedule in May 2007. Originally it featured none of the Cavemen from the commercials, but Jeff Daniel Phillips later agreed to join the cast. It premiered on October 2, 2007. In the face of sagging ratings, it was quietly cancelled, automatically being the shortest lived ABC sitcom of the season. In February 2008, a new series of Caveman commercials featured two of the characters spoofing the premise of the show.

Main characters are a student, who has returned to his home in Nouadhibou, an electrician and his child apprentice, and the local women. The film is characterized by a succession of scenes of the daily life of the characters which are unique to their particular African and Arab cultures, while borrowing from tropes of Tayeb Saleh's Season of Migration to the North (موسم الهجرة إلى الشمال). The viewer must interpret the scenes without much help from narrator or plot, while the structure of the film hangs on a series of mundane but visually arresting moments, many of which are repeated in other works in Abderrahmane Sissako's opus, including scenes at a barber shop and a photo booth, also present in his earlier La Vie Sur Terre and later Timbuktu. The film presents typical Mauritanian moments of beauty, struggle, alienation, and humor, which are experienced by groups socially divided from each other, such as Bidhan women drinking tea and gossiping, West African migrants passing through Mauritania to get to Europe (and finding an unsuccessful comrade washed ashore). The young protagonist who has returned interacts with all of these groups as an outsider, as he struggles to remember even his own Hassaniya Arabic dialect, but prefers instead French. Many of the themes and characters presage Sissako's 2014 film Timbuktu, and both explore liminal Sahel identities authentically situated in everyday life. Waiting for Happiness premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section.

Background Ćuška is a village close to the city of Peć. The village had 200 houses and about 2,000 residents, predominantly Albanians. In the early morning of May 14, 1999, Serbian security forces descended on the small village of Ćuška. Once there the women and children were separated from the men, private property was systematically stolen, and identification papers were destroyed. The forces then divided the men into three groups of about ten and taken into three separate houses, where they were gunned down with automatic weapons. Each of the houses were then set on fire. In each of the three houses, one man survived. The motivation for the massacre at Ćuška remains unclear. Agim Çeku, a Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander, was a village native and his father who was residing there was killed in the massacre; however many from the Serb forces stated that his death was not the primary purpose of the attack. Court proceedings On 13 March 2010 Serbian War crime prosecution office arrested nine members of paramilitary of the \\"Jackals\\" paramilitary group. Serbian War crime prosecution office has for now, launched investigation against 26 individuals for murder and theft at Cuska. On 20 January 2012 a district court in Stockholm, Sweden sentenced Milić Martinović, a 34-year-old former Serb policeman, to lifetime imprisonment for his role in the massacre. Martinović, who was arrested in Sweden in April 2010, was ruled guilty of aggravated crimes against humanity, including murder, attempted murder and aggravated arson, in connection with the massacre, the Stockholm District Court said. Martinović had been a member of the special PJP police force that entered Ćuška on 14 May 1999 in search of \\"terrorists\\". Armed and in uniform, he was among the troops who took a large number of people captive, killed 29 of the 40 people murdered there that day, attempted to kill three others, burned down houses and manhandled civilians, the court said in its judgment. The court documents describe how he repeatedly stood guard as his comrades shot and killed civilians and how he fired at the ground and forced residents to hand over gold and other valuables, but they do not show Martinović to have killed any victim. Newspaper reports in Sweden state he was expected to appeal the judgment.

Current coat of arms The current coat of arms exists in two forms: the coat of arms proper and the so- called \\"big\\" coat of arms. Its basic element is a cartouche-decorated Spanish shield bearing the symbols found on the current flag of Kirovohrad and topped with a golden mural crown. The shield follows the colours of the flag and is divided into three parts by a reversed dark blue pall, the first and the second fields being yellow and the third being crimson. Overall there is a yellow six-bastioned fort one point up superimposed by the red monogram of St. Elizabeth. The big coat of arms of Kropyvnytskyi adds to this two supporters: silver storks set on the compartment made up of four wheat ears and a dark blue scroll with a motto in Ukrainian: \\"З миром і добром\\" (English \\"With peace and good\\"). The composition of the shield uses the elements found on the old coat of arms of Yelisavetgrad (see below). The golden colour symbolizes the affluence and the fertility of local lands, while crimson one is the traditional colour of Ukrainian cossacks to whom the lands of present-day Kropyvnytskyi once belonged. Three dark blue bands are said to symbolize the junction of three rivers: Inhul, Suhokliya and Bianka in whose vicinity the precursor of the city, Fort of St. Elizabeth was founded. The latter is represented on the coat of arms by means of the golden six-bastioned fort with black rim. The red monogram of St. Elizabeth is directly influenced by the one of Elizabeth of Russia depicted on the previous emblem of the city. The silver storks are allegoric figures hinting at the personality of cossack Stepan Leleka ('leleka', \\"лелека\\" is a Ukrainian for \\"a stork\\"), the founder of zymivnyk (settlement) Lelekivka, now within the city boundaries. A mural crown is a usual element for the regional centre coats of arms in Ukraine. The coat of arms of Kropyvnytskyi can be blazoned in the following way: * ARMS: Per Pall reversed Azure Or and Gules (Crimson), a six-bastioned Fort, axis crosswise, Or fimbriated Sable, overall a Monogram of St. Elizabeth Gules. * CREST: a Mural Crown Or. * SUPPORTERS: On either side a Stork Argent beaked Gules all resting on a Scroll Azure and four Ears of Wheat Or. * MOTTO: 'З ДОБРОМ І МИРОМ' – With peace and good. The coat of arms was designed by the architect and heraldry expert Vitaliy Kryvenko and adopted by the Kropyvnytskyi City Hall on February 28, 1996. Previous designs =Coat of arms of Yelisavetrgad= Coat of arms of Yelisavetgrad The first city's coat of arms ever was adopted by Yelisavetrgrad City Hall on April 6, 1845. It was a French shield parted horizontally with a yellow field above bearing the Minor State Seal of the Russian Empire and a red field below bearing the yellow contour of the six-bastioned Fort of St. Elizabeth with her personal monogram inside between the figures \\"17\\" and \\"54\\" which meant the year of the fortress' foundation. The coat of arms of Yelisavetgrad could be blazoned in the following way: Per fesse Or and Gules, in chief a two-headed eagle displayed Sable gorged with Order of Saint Andrew and an Escutcheon Gules St. George proper mounted and defeating the Serpent, charged on wings with Arms of Astrakhan, Siberia, Georgia, Finland, Kiev-Vladimir-Novgorod, Taurica, Poland and Kazan, ensigned by three imperial crowns, in base a six-bastioned Fort, axis crosswise, Gules fimbriated Or, on a Fort Gules a Monogram of Elizabeth of Russia accompanied by \\"17\\" and \\"54\\" Or. =Bernhard von Koehne's project= Coat of arms of Yelisavetgrad (Bernhard von Koehne's unadopted project) In the second half of the 19th century Yelisavetgrad's authorities got the proposal of the then Head of the Arms Division (Heraldry Department) Bernhard Karl von Koehne to change the city's coat of arms. The new project had a red French shield with a yellow contour of the six-bastioned Fort of St. Elizabeth (now much simplified and more resembling a six-pointed mullet) and the escutcheon of the Kherson Province (to which Yelisavetgrad belonged) in the canton. The shield was topped with a silver mural crown and surrounded by two golden ears of wheat entwined with a red ribbon of the Order of St. Alexander. It was never adopted by the city authorities. Bernhard von Koehne's project could be blazoned in the following way: Gules a six-bastioned Fort, axis crosswise, Gules fimbriated Or, in Canton Azure a \\"Russian\\" Cross radiant Argent between three Imperial Crowns Or, ensigned with Mural Crown Argent. =Soviet emblem= Soviet emblem of Kirovohrad The coat of arms of Soviet Kirovohrad was adopted on January 14, 1969. Technically this totally new symbol of the city wasn't a real coat of arms designed according to the principles of heraldry. The emblem looked like a French shield of dark blue colour with silver rim and bearing a golden stylized ear of wheat superimposed with the half of the golden cog-wheel. The chief of the shield (as well rimmed with silver) had two stripes: a dark blue one (2/3 of the chief) and a red one, and was superimposed with a silver circle bearing golden hammer and a sickle crossed diagonally. The base of the shield was green with silver rim and golden cannon with three golden balls. The emblem utilized well-known Soviet symbols. The chief followed the colours of the UkrSSR flag and bore the elements of the USSR coat of arms. The ear of wheat and cog-wheel spoke about the agroindustrial character of Kirovohrad's economy. The cannon with balls symbolized the past of the city. One could try to blazon the emblem in the following way: Azure fimbriated Argent an Ear of Wheat Or overall Half of Cog- Wheel Or, on Chief Gules and Azure also fimbriated Argent a Plate with a Hammer and a Sickle both Or in saltire, on Base Vert fimbriated Argent a Cannon Or with three Cannon Balls Or. In order to comply with decommunization laws Kirovohrad was renamed in July 2016 by the Ukrainian parliament to Kropyvnytskyi.Goodbye, Lenin: Ukraine moves to ban communist symbols, BBC News (14 April 2015) Verkhovna Rada renamed Kirovograd, Ukrayinska Pravda (14 July 2016) References External links * The Ukrainian Heraldry Society * Ukrainian Heraldry * A non-commercial Internet project on Heraldry and Vexillology Category:Kropyvnytskyi Category:Coats of arms of cities in Ukraine Category:Coats of arms with birds ","title":"Coat of arms of Kropyvnytskyi"},{"id":"10514957","text":"Crook in 1968 Reginald Douglas Crook, 1st Baron Crook (2 March 1901-10 March 1989), was a British civil servant and United Nations official.

In 1934, she was approached by Irving Mills and vaudeville agent Alex Hyde to lead an all-girl orchestra, the Melodears, As part of the group's formation, Mills asked her to change her name. The group included trumpeter Frances Klein, Canadian pianist Ruth Lowe Sandler, saxophonist Jane Cullum, guitarist Marian Gange, trumpeter Mardell \\"Owen\\" Winstead, and trombonist Alyse Wells. The Melodears appeared in short films and in the movie Big Broadcast of 1936. They recorded six songs, sung by Hutton, before disbanding in 1939.

Career Fatma Gadri was born to a poor family of a merchant acolyte in Odessa (present-day Ukraine). At age 9, she started earning money by working as a full-time nanny for a child from a rich family. At her mother's insistence, she enrolled in a local madrasah (religious school) to receive primary education. In 1922, she was admitted to two post-secondary institutions simultaneously: the Azerbaijan Theatre School and a teachers college, from both of which she graduated in 1926. Choosing the artistic path as her future career, Gadri started working as an actress at the Turkic Labour Theatre in Baku and Ganja. After an unsuccessful surgery on her neck, she was allowed to quit her job at the theatre in order to recover. After a brief period of acting at the Baku Russian Theatre, she was hired to the Azerbaijan State Drama Theatre in 1935, where she worked for the next 24 years. Soon she was also elected to the Baku City Council and started teaching at the Azerbaijan Theatre School and at a music school in Baku. In 1943, she became People's Artist of Azerbaijan. Physically weak and exposed to illnesses, she often acted out her roles despite bodily pain. This led to emaciation in 1958, when Fatma Gadri suddenly fell unconscious at the Pushkin Moscow Drama Theatre, right before her final act in War and Peace by Sergei Prokofiev, during the troupe's tour in Moscow. After receiving medical treatment for seven months, the doctors forbade her from going up on stage again fearing for her health.Fatma Gadri: The Aftermath and the Eternal Silence by Z.Farajova.

Her first marriage in the early 1920s did not last long, and her only son died in his teenage years. Gadri's second husband died of pneumonia in 1932. These tragic events added to her unstable health and psychological condition. Unable to get over severe depression after being forbidden to perform in theatres, 60-year-old Gadri died by committing suicide in her apartment in 1968.

On 2011 EMBnet has 37 nodes spread over 32 countries. The nodes include bioinformatics related university departments, research institutes and national service providers. Operations The main task of most EMBnet nodes is to provide their national scientific community with access to bioinformatics databanks, specialised software and sufficient computing resources and expertise. EMBnet is also working in the fields of bioinformatics training and software development. Examples of software created by EMBnet members are: EMBOSS, wEMBOSS, UTOPIA. EMBnet represents a wide user group and works closely together with the database producers such as EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Swiss-Prot), the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS), in order to provide a uniform coverage of services throughout Europe. EMBnet is registered in the Netherlands as a public foundation (Stichting). Since its creation in 1988, EMBnet has evolved from an informal network of individuals in charge of maintaining biological databases into the only worldwide organization bringing bioinformatics professionals to work together to serve the expanding fields of genetics and molecular biology. Although composed predominantly of academic nodes, EMBnet gains an important added dimension from its industrial members. The success of EMBnet is attracting increasing numbers of organizations outside Europe to join. EMBnet has a tried-and-tested infrastructure to organise training courses, give technical help and help its members effectively interact and respond to the rapidly changing needs of biological research in a way no single institute is able to do. In 2005 the organization created additional types of node to allow more than one member per country. The new category denomination is \\"associated node\\".  Coordination and organization  EMBnet is governed by the Annual General Meetings (AGM), and is coordinated by an Executive Board (EB) that oversees the activities of three project committees: *Education and Training committee (E&T;). Educational support includes a series of courses organised in the member countries and languages, the committee works as well on the continued development of on-line accessible education materials. *Publicity and Public Relations committee (P&PR;). This committee is responsible for promoting any type of EMBnet activities, for the advertisement of products and services provided by the EMBnet community, as well as for proposing and developing new strategies aiming to enhance EMBnet’s visibility, and to take care of public relationships with EMBnet communities and related networks/societies. *Technical Manager committee (TM). The TM PC provides assistance and practical help to the participating nodes and their users. Achievements  EMBnet had the first gopher and World Wide Web servers in biology (CSC BioBox) EMBnet was the first to come up with solutions for daily database updates using Internet (NDT), distributed computing (HASSLE) and efficient database browsing and linking (Sequence Retrieval System, SRS). The Ping project was created as a means to obtain continuous information about network efficiency across the whole of Europe. EMBnet is committed to bringing the latest software algorithms to the user free of charge (Extended GCG or EGCG) and continues to develop state of the art public software (EMBOSS). EMBER: a European Multimedia Bioinformatics Educational Resource. EMBER was a European Union (EU) funded project aiming to develop a suite of multimedia bioinformatics educational tools . EMBER comprises a self-contained, interactive Web tutorial in bioinformatics, & the equivalent stand-alone course on CD-ROM. The EMBnet community was involved in the creation of the peer reviewed journal Briefings in Bioinformatics (BiB). BiB was also supported by an educational grant from EMBnet. The Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET) was formed as a nonprofit foundation at the 2012 EMBnet annual meeting. Journal Starting from 1994 and up to 2009 EMBnet published EMBnet.news. Its primary goal was to bring information and report on the latest news and developments from the network to the user community. Established in 2010 as the successor of the EMBnet.news (with volume numbering continuing uninterrupted), EMBnet.journal is a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal publishing original research and technical papers in bioinformatics. The journal contains two main sections, one for research articles, reviews, and technical notes, and one for non-peer-reviewed commentary, reportage, user-guides, training information, and news. EMBnet.journal publishes also conference proceedings and meeting abstracts as supplements.

The counties found it difficult to meet the quotas. Some offered high cash bounties to inexperienced volunteers (mostly inexperienced landsmen), creating resentment among the regular seamen who, despite their experience, had received only a small fraction of that bounty on their own volunteering (and none if they were pressed). Sometimes, the counties resorted to sending convicted criminals in lieu of punishment, further creating ill feeling among ships' companies and sometimes introducing typhus (otherwise known as gaol fever). Britain ended the quota system, along with impressment, in 1815 at the close of the Napoleonic Wars, when much of the fleet was decommissioned and the supply of unemployed seamen was more than adequate to man the remaining ships.

The site was formerly occupied by the \\"Pisan Loggia\\" and the \\"Chiese de Santa Cecilia\\" Florence Monuments While the architecture of the palazzo is undoubtedly inspired by that of the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, also in Florence, the Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali was never intended to be a private house but the local headquarters of the General Insurance Company which was founded in Trieste in 1831. The Generali Group There are other Palazzi delle Assicurazioni Generali in other Italian cities most notably Rome and Milan. During the latter half of the 19th century the Assicurazioni Generali (commonly known as \\"Generali\\") were expanding not only in Italy but also throughout Europe. The Assicurazioni Generali generally employed retrospective architectural style to reflect the surroundings of their offices in Rome the palazzo imitates the Palazzo Venezia which it faces, while in Milan the Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali is in a form of 19th century Baroque Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali, Milano known as Beaux Arts. The Florence Palazzo delle Assicurazioni unsuccessfully vies for dominance in the piazza with the more historical and architecturally important Palazzo Signoria, today known as the Palazzo Vecchio.

With Obedska bara and Carska Bara one of the major wildlife refuges and one of the last authentically preserved wetlands in Serbia. In the 2000s it became a popular attraction with the successful reintroduction of beavers, which had become extinct 100 years before.  Location  Zasavica is located just several kilometers across the Sava river from the town of Sremska Mitrovica. The entire Zasavica system is located in the Mačva region and is administratively divided between the province of Vojvodina (northern part; municipality of Sremska Mitrovica) and Central Serbia (southern part; municipality of Bogatić. It roughly extends between the settlements of Crna Bara, Banovo Polje, Ravnje, Zasavica I, Zasavica II, Salaš Noćajski, Noćaj and Mačvanska Mitrovica.  Geography  Canal-tributaries to Zasavica The Zasavica bog is a marshy lowland in the floodplain of the Sava river. It is a typical elongated oxbow (in Serbian: mrtvaja, dead [water]). The fossilized, parallel bed of the Sava is so elongated that it actually stretches almost to the Drina river. In time, Zasavica river was formed from the subterranean waters from the Drina and from several streams, most notably, Duboka Jovača and Prekopac canal (gravitationally, from the Cer mountain. The final section connecting Zasavica and Sava has been channeled (Bogaz canal). The river slowly meanders into and through the bog, widening from meters to almost . The marsh, consisting of several connected bogs, covers an area of . During normal water levels, the bog is deep on average, but it can get up to deep. The marshland's altitude varies from 76 to 82 meters (250 to 270 ft). The entire biotype includes also the Batar stream and several other canal- tributaries to Zasavica, and consists of an ecological row of water and marsh systems with fragments of flooded meadows and forests. Zasavica site Through the rivers Sava and Danube, the Zasavica biotype belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin.  Human history  Remains show that humans were already settled the marshy areas of Mačva in 5000 BCE. They made canals and water alleys in the marsh, using them both for irrigation and drainage. That way, they participated in the volatile process of constant change of the Sava and Drina rivers directions, creation of meanders, change of the landscape, etc. Time erased memories of the first recorded settlers and the remains of their work was attributed by the later settlers as the work of giants, creating one of two popular legends in Zasavica. Other legend connected to the area is that of winged dragons. Ancient Celtic maps show area of Zasavica as one of eight dragon-inhabited places in the Balkans. From recent history, Zasavica is known as both the hiding place and a battle ground of Zeka Buljubaša, one of the heroes of the First Serbian Uprising. He was finally defeated and killed by the Ottomans in Zasavica in 1813. In 2017-2020, a dozen of sculptures of the animals which inhabit the reserve were carved and exhibited in the open, including beaver, umbra fish and donkey. They were made by the artistic team of archaeologist Zoran Đajić. In September 2020, a massive, 15-ton heavy sculpture of \\"Serbian ox\\" was placed at the main entry. Celebrating importance of oxen in older Serbian history, the sculpture was carved from one slab of hard, ancient Brazilian stone, formed over 1 billion years ago. Author is sculptor Velimir Karavelić.  Preservation  Special reservation of nature of Zasavica was formed in 1997 and placed under the state protection as the category I natural treasure of exquisite value. It includes the bog and surrounding terrains, with a total area of 18.25 square kilometers. Of that, or 37% is placed under the level I of protection and the rest is in levels II and III. The majority of the protected area covers the water surfaces of the rivers and canals Zasavica, Jovac, Prekopac and Batar. Zasavica has a priority nomination to become a Ramsar site. It is proclaimed an Important Bird Area and since 2001 it is a member of the Europark Federation, federation of the national parks od Europe.  Wildlife  Mute swan 210px 210px Eurasian coot Great reed warbler Grass snake = Plants =  Flowering plants  There are over 600 species of plants are recorded in the reservation. Several of them are endangered natural rarities and listed in the Serbia's Red Book of Endangered Species: European white water-lily, yellow waterlily, water soldier, fringed water-lily, marsh nettle, sweet flag, aquatic bladderwort, triangular club-rush, common mare's tail, water violet, greater spearwort and the endemic Pannonian plain species of Pannonian cornflower. In the Valjevac section of Zasavica a rare and endangered marshland bio-community Acoro- Glyceretum maximae is found.  Fungi  150 species of Fungi has been widely distributed in the entire reservation, in every eco-system (ground, trees, logs, meadows, pastures, etc.). Many are edible, including the rare species of morel. Poisonous mushrooms are rare and few, including panther cap, death cap and yellow-staining mushroom.  Trees  Though dozens of species of trees are found, forests, which make % of the reservation, are mainly made of narrow-leafed ash and to the lesser extent of white poplar, willow or black alder. Alluvial slopes are inhabited by pedunculate oak, European hornbeam, linden and European Turkey oak. Since 1962 a plantations of willow and hybrid poplars were planted. White orchid also lives in Zasavica. = Invertebrate =  Plankton  Phytoplankton is represented with 234 species and zooplankton with 220. Representatives of the first group are the Batrachospermnum algae, fresh water sponge (Spongilla lacustris) and fresh water jellyfish (Craspedacustra sowerbii). Out of the second group, 21 taxa are new and recently discovered in Serbia.  Insects  250 species of insects live in Zasavica and 15 of them are protected. There are several rare species of longhorn beetle (out of 35 living in Zasavica) and endemic Balkan species including three recently discovered in Serbia: Syrian longhorn beetle (Arhopalus syriacus), Morimus asper and Agapanthia lais. Species of Cerambyx cerdo and Morimus funereus are protected. Endemic and rare cricket Zeuneriana amplipennis, living only in Serbia, is also found. = Vertebrate =  Fish  In Zasavica live 23 species of fish, categorised in 8 families and 20 genera. The most common are members of the carp family. Of those, 20 species ar autochthonous and three are imported (two from North America, one from China), though even the common carp had been introduced by Romans. Seven species are protected: Umbra krameri, Rhodeus sericeus amarus, loach (Misgumus fossilis), Cobitis tenia, etc. Six species are classified as endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare. As part of the \\"Return of the autochthonous species of fish\\" project, the wels catfish has been reintroduced into Zasavica.  Herpetofauna  Zasavica hosts 27 species of reptiles and amphibians, of which all 12 amphibian and 4 reptilian species are protected and some of them are on the preliminary list to be included into the Red Book. Six amphibian and seven reptilian species are also classified as the endangered species by the Bern Convention. Two endemic Balkan species live in Zasavica: Danube crested newt and eastern sub-species of the sand lizard, Lacerta agilis bosnica, which is European Protected Species.  Birds  There are 185 species of birds in the reserve, of which 120 are resident. Because of such large number of birds, including rarities like night heron and spotted crake, Zasavica is included in the list of IBAs, (important bird areas). Since 1998, 20 artificial nesting platforms have been placed throughout the reserve. Other species include common moorhen, little grebe, Eurasian coot, great reed warbler, little bittern, mallard, common quail, white stork, black stork, Eurasian bittern, white-tailed eagle, western marsh harrier, common kestrel, mute swan, northern lapwing, etc.  Mammals  So far, 45 species of mammals are found in Zasavica. It is ideal for the water-bound species like Eurasian otter or wildcat, which are protected all over Europe. Otters were not spotted for years though. Recent but unconfirmed sightings of otters recently prompted the ecology organisations from Sremska Mitrovica to announce an award for those who capture otter on camera. Fur animals also live in Zasavica, most notably muskrat. Eurasian shrew, striped field mouse, fat dormouse and several species of bats are listed as rarities in Serbia.  Special residents of Zasavica  = Balkan donkey = Zasavica is the location of the only farm of the Balkan donkey on the territory of former Yugoslavia. The farm was founded in the early 1990s and holds some 120 donkeys. They are kept for meat but mostly for their milk, which is used to make the pule cheese, one of the most expensive in the world with the price of 1,000 euros per kilogram (there are farms of the Balkan donkeys in Italy, Belgium and France with over 700 animals). Meat is used for the sausages and kulen while the milk is also used in the cosmetic industry (creams, soaps) but for the cream liqueur, too. Every April, a festival called World's Donkey Day is held. Teams from several countries (Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, etc.) compete in the preparation of the donkey stew, while other meat and milk products are being exchanged and tasted. = Beavers = The main attraction in the reservation are the reintroduced beavers. Zoologist Alfred Brehm wrote in 1887 that a beaver has been spotted on the right bank of the Sava, near Sremska Mitrovica. Extinct in the early 1900s, four families with five members each, plus 11 single animals (31 in total) were reintroduced in 2004 with the help from the Bavarian Science Society. From Serbian side, project is conducted by the Biology Faculty of the Belgrade University. Each animal has a subdermal tracking microchip implant. Initial fears that the beavers will not adapt proved to be groundless as very soon first dam was spotted and the animals began to reproduce. A dam is long and tall (of that, above the water) and located at the Batar's mouth into Zasavica. In the late 2006 a dam in the canal Glušci, which flows into the Zasavica, was discovered and the beavers, though not the dams, are spotted in the river of Jadar some to the south down the Drina. As the area surrounding the Zasavica is entirely agricultural, farmers don't share the excitement of the biologists as they claim the beavers ruin their crops saying that was the original reason for their extinction a hundred years ago, though they were also hunted for the valuable fur and the meat which could be consummated during the religious fasting. By 2012, beavers in Zasavica built 17 burrows and 6 dams, their population grew to a 100 and the chipped specimen have been caught near Šabac, Obrenovac and even Brčko, upstream, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Population found in Obedska Bara is a local one, being reintroduced in the same time and as the part of the same project as the Zasavica beavers. Initially knocking down the poplars and willows, causing damage to the surrounding arable land, after several years in which they adapted the habitat to their needs, beavers for the most part stopped being a nuisance to the local inhabitants. By 2020 they spread all over the northern and western parts of Serbia. Apart from the Sava, Drina and Jadar, they have been spotted in the Danube, Tamnava, Tisza, Bega, Timiș, Great Morava and canal systems in the Vojvodina province. To the north, they reached Petrovaradin and Novi Sad, while at the south they are spotted near Velika Plana. They also inhabited the surroundings of Belgrade, like Ritopek and Krnjača, which is part of urban Belgrade, but has much unurbanized area in the former marsh of Pančevački Rit. = Mangulica = Mangulica is the only surviving autochthonous Serbian breed of domesticated pig. Other two, Šiška and Šumadinka died out. A breed, also known as \\"woolen pig\\", due to its good qualities, is considered a \\"noble\\", but it almost died out in the 1980s. Its fat has up to 80% less cholesterol and triglycerides than a common, white pig. In 1998 Mangulica was introduced in Zasavica, but unlike Podolian cattle, they are left to roam free in the reservation, becoming feral since then. A cases of breeding with wild boar are known. By the early 2010s, their number grew to 1,000. = Podolian = In 1998 the cattle of the Podolian breed was introduced in Zasavica. First animals arrived in the spring of 1998 from Mionica, in western Serbia. Pasture \\"Valjevac\\", near the small Goransko-ribolovačko lake was chosen as their home. The pasture has an area of 3 square kilometers and numbered 80 cattle by 2011. Breeding of Podolian cattle is being part of the program for the preservation of the animal species, developed by the Serbian Ministry of agriculture. In the reserve there are several other, today rare, breeds of domesticated animals: Buša cattle, Bosnian Mountain Horse and wooly goat. = Umbra = Umbra krameri or in Serbian mrguda (\\"frown fish\\") in Serbia lives only in Zasavica. It has been classified as an endangered species in the entire of Europe and placed under the strict protection by the Bern Convention. In Serbia it has been protected in 1993. In March 2008 the fish has been discovered in the village of Bački Monoštor, near town of Sombor, almost 150 kilometers north of Zasavica.

It also refers to the projection format in which a distorted image is \\"stretched\\" by an anamorphic projection lens to recreate the original aspect ratio on the viewing screen. (It should not be confused with anamorphic widescreen, a different video encoding concept that uses similar principles but different means.) The word anamorphic and its derivatives stem from the Greek anamorphoun (\\"to transform\\"), compound of morphé (\\"form, shape\\") with the prefix aná (\\"back, against\\"). In the late 1990s and 2000s, anamorphic lost popularity in comparison to \\"flat\\" (or \\"spherical\\") formats such as Super 35 with the advent of digital intermediates; however in the years since digital cinema cameras and projectors have become commonplace, anamorphic has experienced a considerable resurgence of popularity, due in large part to the higher base ISO sensitivity of digital sensors, which facilitates shooting at smaller apertures. History The process of anamorphosing optics was developed by Henri Chrétien during World War I to provide a wide angle viewer for military tanks. The optical process was called Hypergonar by Chrétien and was capable of showing a field of view of 180 degrees. After the war, the technology was first used in a cinematic context in the short film Construire un Feu (To Build a Fire, based on the 1908 Jack London story of the same name) in 1927 by Claude Autant-Lara.Konigsberg, Ira. The Complete Film Dictionary Meridian. 1987. \\"Anamorphic lens\\" pp. 11-12 In the 1920s, phonograph and motion picture pioneer Leon F. Douglass also created special effects and anamorphic widescreen motion picture cameras. However, how this relates to the earlier French invention, and later development, is unclear.Michael Svanevik and Shirley Burgett, \\"Menlo’s Mild-Mannered Film Wizard: Motion Picture Inventor Leon Douglass Deserves Historical Niche\\", Palo Alto Daily News (July 5, 2008) pp. 6-7 Anamorphic widescreen was not used again for cinematography until 1952 when Twentieth Century-Fox bought the rights to the technique to create its CinemaScope widescreen technique. CinemaScope was one of many widescreen formats developed in the 1950s to compete with the popularity of television and bring audiences back to the cinemas. The Robe, which premiered in 1953, was the first feature film released that was filmed with an anamorphic lens. =Development= The introduction of anamorphic widescreen arose from a desire for wider aspect ratios that maximised overall image detail while retaining the use of standard (4 perf per frame) cameras and projectors. The modern anamorphic format has an aspect ratio of 2.39:1, meaning the (projected) picture's width is 2.39 times its height, (this is sometimes approximated to 2.4:1). The older Academy format 35 mm film (standard non- anamorphic full frame with sound tracks in the image area) has an aspect ratio of 1.375:1, which, when projected, is not as wide. Anamorphic widescreen was a response to a shortcoming in the non-anamorphic spherical (a.k.a. \\"flat\\") widescreen format. With a non-anamorphic lens, the picture is recorded onto the film negative such that its full width fits within the film's frame, but not its full height. A substantial part of the frame area is thereby wasted, being occupied (on the negative) by a portion of the image which is subsequently matted-out (i.e. masked, either on the print or in the projector) and so not projected, in order to create the widescreen image. To increase overall image detail, by using all the available area of the negative for only that portion of the image which will be projected, an anamorphic lens is used during photography to compress the image horizontally, thereby filling the full (4 perf) frame's area with the portion of the image that corresponds to the area projected in the non-anamorphic format. Up to the early 1960s, three major methods of anamorphosing the image were used: counter-rotated prisms (e.g. Ultra Panavision), curved mirrors in combination with the principle of Total Internal Reflection (e.g. Technirama), and cylindrical lenses (lenses curved, hence squeezing the image being photographed, in only one direction, as with a cylinder, e.g. the original CinemaScope system based on Henri Chrétien's design). Regardless of method, the anamorphic lens projects a horizontally squeezed image on the film negative. This deliberate geometric distortion is then reversed on projection, resulting in a wider aspect ratio on-screen than that of the negative's frame. Equipment An anamorphic lens consists of a regular spherical lens, plus an anamorphic attachment (or an integrated lens element) that does the anamorphosing. The anamorphic element operates at infinite focal length, so that it has little or no effect on the focus of the primary lens it's mounted on but still anamorphoses (distorts) the optical field. A cameraman using an anamorphic attachment uses a spherical lens of a different focal length than they would use for Academy format (i.e. one sufficient to produce an image the full height of the frame and twice its width), and the anamorphic attachment squeezes the image (in the horizontal plane only) to half-width. Other anamorphic attachments existed (that were relatively rarely used) which would expand the image in the vertical dimension (e.g. in the early Technirama system mentioned above), so that (in the case of the common 2-times anamorphic lens) a frame twice as high as it might have been filled the available film area. In either case, since a larger film area recorded the same picture the image quality was improved. The distortion (horizontal compression) introduced in the camera must be corrected when the film is projected, so another lens is used in the projection booth that restores the picture back to its correct proportions (or, in the case of the now obsolete Technirama system, squeezes the image vertically) to restore normal geometry. The picture is not manipulated in any way in the dimension that is perpendicular to the one anamorphosed. It may seem that it would be easier to simply use a wider film for recording movies. However, since 35 mm film was already in widespread use, it was more economically feasible for film producers and exhibitors to simply attach a special lens to the camera or projector, rather than invest in an entirely new film format, which would require new cameras, projectors, editing equipment and so forth. Naming Cinerama was an earlier attempt to solve the problem of high- quality widescreen imaging, but anamorphic widescreen eventually proved more practical. Cinerama (which had an aspect ratio of 2.59:1) consisted of three simultaneously projected images side-by-side on the same screen. However, in practice the images never blended together perfectly at the edges. The system also suffered from various technical drawbacks, in that it required three projectors, a 6-perf-high frame, four times as much film, and three cameras (eventually simplified to just one camera with three lenses and three streaming reels of film and the attendant machinery), plus a host of synchronization problems. Nonetheless, the format was popular enough with audiences to trigger off the widescreen developments of the early 1950s. A few films were distributed in Cinerama format and shown in special theaters, but anamorphic widescreen was more attractive to the Studios since it could realize a similar aspect ratio and without the disadvantages of Cinerama's complexities and costs. The anamorphic widescreen format in use today is commonly called 'Scope' (a contraction of the early term CinemaScope), or 2.35:1 (the latter being a misnomer born of old habit; see \\"Aspect ratio\\" section below). Filmed in Panavision is a phrase contractually required for films shot using Panavision's anamorphic lenses. All of these phrases mean the same thing: the final print uses a 2:1 anamorphic projector lens that expands the image by exactly twice the amount horizontally as vertically. This format is essentially the same as that of CinemaScope, except for some technical developments, such as the ability to shoot closeups without any facial distortion. (CinemaScope films seldom used full facial closeups, because of a condition known as CinemaScope mumps, which distorted faces as they got closer to the camera.) Optical characteristics Example of blue-line horizontal anamorphic flare There are artifacts that can occur when using an anamorphic camera lens that do not occur when using an ordinary spherical lens. One is a kind of lens flare that has a long horizontal line, usually with a blue tint, and is most often visible when there is a bright light in the frame, such as from car headlights, in an otherwise dark scene. This artifact is not always considered a problem., and even has become associated with a certain cinematic look, and often emulated using a special effect filter in scenes shot with a non-anamorphic lens. Another common aspect of anamorphic lenses is that light reflections within the lens are elliptical, rather than round as in ordinary cinematography. Additionally, wide angle anamorphic lenses of less than 40 mm focal length produce a cylindrical perspective, which some directors and cinematographers, particularly Wes Anderson, use as a stylistic trademark. Many wide-angle anamorphic lenses render a cylindrical perspective, as simulated by this stitched panorama of Cavendish House, Leicester. Contrast the straight vertical plane with the curved horizontal plane. Another characteristic of anamorphic lenses, because they stretch the image vertically, is that out-of-focus elements tend to blur more in the vertical direction. An out-of-focus point of light in the background (called bokehWhy is anamorphic bokeh oval?) appear as a vertical oval rather than as a circle. When the camera shifts focus, there is often a noticeable effect whereby objects appear to stretch vertically when going out of focus. However, the commonly cited claim that anamorphic lenses produce a shallower depth of field is not entirely true. Because of the cylindrical element in the lens, anamorphic lenses take in a horizontal angle of view twice as wide as a spherical lens of the same focal length. Because of this, cinematographers often use a 50 mm anamorphic lens when they would otherwise use a 25 mm spherical lens, or a 70 mm rather than a 35 mm, and so on. A third characteristic, particularly of simple anamorphic add-on attachments, is \\"anamorphic mumps\\". For reasons of practical optics, the anamorphic squeeze is not uniform across the image field in any anamorphic system (whether cylindrical, prismatic or mirror-based). This variation results in some areas of the film image appearing more stretched than others. In the case of an actor's face, when positioned in the center of the screen faces look somewhat like they have the mumps, hence the name for the phenomenon. Conversely, at the edges of the screen actors in full-length view can become skinny-looking. In medium shots, if the actor walks across the screen from one side to the other, he will increase in apparent girth. Early CinemaScope presentations in particular (using Chrétien's off-the-shelf lenses) suffered from this. Panavision was the first company to produce an anti-mumps system in the late 1950s. Panavision used a second lens (i.e. an add-on adapter) which was mechanically linked to the focus position of the primary lens. This changed the anamorphic ratio as the focus changed, resulting in the area of interest on-screen having a normal-looking geometry. Later cylindrical lens systems used, instead, two sets of anamorphic optics: one was a more robust \\"squeeze\\" system, which was coupled with a slight expansion sub-system. The expansion sub-system was counter-rotated in relation to the main squeeze system, all in mechanical interlinkage with the focus mechanism of the primary lens: this combination changed the anamorphic ratio and minimized the effect of anamorphic mumps in the area of interest in the frame. Although these techniques were regarded as a fix for anamorphic mumps, they were actually only a compromise. Cinematographers still had to frame scenes carefully to avoid the recognizable side-effects of the change in aspect ratio. =Recent use= Although the anamorphic widescreen format is still in use as a camera format, it has been losing popularity in favour of flat formats, mainly Super 35. (In Super 35, the film is shot flat, then matted, and optically printed as an anamorphic release print.) The decline in popularity can be attributed to the artifacts, distortions, speed, and expenses (in comparison to its spherical counterpart). An anamorphic lens is often slower (has a smaller effective aperture) than a similar spherical lens, and thus requires more light and makes shooting low-light scenes more difficult. The anamorphic-scope camera format does not preserve any of the image above or below the frame, so it may not transfer as well to narrower aspect ratios, such as 4:3 or 16:9 for full screen television, and would have to be pan and scanned as a result. Film grain has become less of a concern because of the availability of higher- quality film stocks and digital intermediates, although anamorphic format - due to its use of the full negative frame to record a smaller image – always yields higher definition than non-anamorphic format (provided the anamorphic projection lens, which is technically more demanding, is adequate). The aperture of the lens (the entrance pupil), as seen from the front, appears as an oval. Anamorphic scope as a printed film format, however, is well established as a standard for widescreen projection. Regardless of the camera formats used in filming, distributed prints of a film with a 2.39:1 (1024:429) theatrical aspect ratio is always in anamorphic widescreen format. Due to many movie theaters around the world not needing to invest in special equipment to project this format, it has become standard equipment in many cinemas.  Aspect ratio  One common misconception about the anamorphic format concerns the actual width number of the aspect ratio, as 2.35, 2.39 or 2.4. Since the anamorphic lenses in virtually all 35 mm anamorphic systems provide a 2:1 squeeze, one would logically conclude that a full academy gate would lead to a aspect ratio when used with anamorphic lenses. Due to differences in the camera gate aperture and projection aperture mask sizes for anamorphic films, however, the image dimensions used for anamorphic film vary from flat (spherical) counterparts. To complicate matters, the SMPTE standards for the format have varied over time; to further complicate things, pre-1957 prints took up the optical soundtrack space of the print (instead having magnetic sound on the sides), which made for a ratio (ANSI PH22.104-1957). Anamorphic 4-perf camera aperture is slightly larger than projection aperture The initial SMPTE definition for anamorphic projection with an optical sound track down the side ANSI PH22.106-1957' was issued in December 1957. It standardized the projector aperture at , which gives an aspect ratio of c. . The aspect ratio for this aperture, after a 2× unsqueeze, is , which rounded to the commonly used value '. A new definition issued in October 1971 as ANSI PH22.106-1971. It specified a slightly smaller vertical dimension of for the projector aperture, to help make splices less noticeable to film viewers. After unsqueezing, this would yield an aspect ratio of c. . Four-perf anamorphic prints use more of the negative's available frame area than any other modern format, which leaves little room for splices. As a consequence, a bright line flashed onscreen when a splice was projected, and theater projectionists had been narrowing the vertical aperture to hide these flashes even before 1971. This new projector aperture size, , aspect ratio , made for an un-squeezed ratio of '. This is commonly referred to by the rounded value or . The most recent revision, SMPTE 195-1993, was released in August 1993. It slightly altered the dimensions so as to standardize a common projection aperture width () for all formats, anamorphic () and flat (). The projection aperture height was also reduced by in this modern specification to , aspect ratio , which is commonly rounded to , to retain the un-squeezed ratio of .Hart, Martin.(2000). Widescreen museum \\"Of Apertures and Aspect Ratios\\" Retrieved July 8, 2006. The camera's aperture remained the same ( or if before 1958), only the height of the \\"negative assembly\\" splices changed and, consequently, the height of the frame changed. Anamorphic prints are still often called 'Scope' or 2.35 by projectionists, cinematographers, and others working in the field, if only by force of habit. 2.39 is in fact what they generally are referring to (unless discussing films using the process between 1958 and 1970), which is itself usually rounded up to 2.40 (implying a false precision as compared to 2.4). With the exception of certain specialist and archivist areas, generally 2.35, 2.39 and 2.40 mean the same to professionals, whether they themselves are even aware of the changes or not.  Lens makers and corporate trademarks  There are numerous companies that are known for manufacturing anamorphic lenses. The following are the most well known in the film industry: = Origination = * Panavision is the most common source of anamorphic lenses, with lens series ranging from 20 mm to a 2,000 mm anamorphic telescope. The C-Series, which is the oldest lens series, are small and lightweight, which makes them very popular for steadicams. Some cinematographers prefer them to newer lenses because they are lower in contrast. The E-Series, of Nikon glass, are sharper than the C-Series and are better color-matched. They are also faster, but the minimum focus-distance of the shorter focal lengths is not as close. The E135mm, and especially the E180mm, are great close-up lenses with the closest minimum focus of any long Panavision anamorphic lenses. The Super (High) Speed lenses (1976), also by Nikon, are the fastest anamorphic lenses available, with T-stops between 1.4 and 1.8; there is even one T1.1 50mm, but, like all anamorphic lenses, they must be stopped-down for good performance because they are quite softly focused when wide open. The Primo and Close-Focus Primo Series (1989) are based on the spherical Primos and are the sharpest Panavision anamorphic lenses available. They are completely color-matched, but also very heavy: about . The G-Series (2007) performance and size comparable with E-Series, in lightweight and compact similar to C-Series. The T-Series (2016), Panavision's latest anamorphic lens series, is designed for digital cameras initially, but also film camera compatible through specific re- engineering at Panavision. * Vantage Film, designers and manufacturers of Hawk lenses. The entire Hawk lens system consists of 50 different prime lenses and 5 zoom lenses, all of them specifically developed and optically computed by Vantage Film. Hawk lenses have their anamorphic element in the middle of the lens (not up front like Panavision), which makes them more flare-resistant. This design choice also means that if they do flare, one does not get the typical horizontal flares. The C-Series, which were developed in the mid-1990s, are relatively small and lightweight. The V-Series (2001) and V-Plus Series (2006) are an improvement over the C-Series as far as sharpness, contrast, barrel-distortion and close-focus are concerned. This increased optical performance means a higher weight, however (each lens is around ). There are 14 lenses in this series—from 25 mm to 250 mm. The V-Series also have the closest minimum focus of any anamorphic lens series available and as such can rival spherical lenses. Vantage also offers a series of lightweight lenses called V-Lite. They are 8 very small anamorphic lenses (about the size of a Cooke S4 spherical lens), which are ideal for handheld and Steadicam while also giving an optical performance comparable to the V-Series and V-Plus lenses. In 2008 Vantage introduced the Hawk V-Lite 16, a set of new lenses for 16 mm anamorphic production, as well as the Hawk V-Lite 1.3× lenses, which make it possible to use nearly the entire image area of 3-perf 35 mm film or the sensor area of a 16:9 digital camera and at the same time provide the popular 2.39:1 release format. * Carl Zeiss AG and ARRI developed their Master Anamorphic lens line, debuted on September 2012, to provide minimum distortion and faster aperture at T1.9. It's a totally new lens design which different from third-party modified Zeiss-based anamorphics such as JDC and Technovision. * Cooke Optics also developed their Anamorphic/i lens line, providing T2.3 aperture and color-matched with other Cooke lens line, which marketed as their \\"Cooke Look\\" feature. Same as Zeiss, it's a totally new lens design which different from third-party modified Cooke-based anamorphics such as JDC and Technovision. Besides, Cooke also developed its Anamorphic/i Full Frame Plus in 1.8× squeeze ratio for full frame cameras. * Angenieux: Angenieux first zoom for 35 mm film camera, the 35-140 mm, was equipped with a front anamorphic attachment built by Franscope. The 40-140 anamorphic was used on several Nouvelle Vague movies such Lola (1961) or Jules and Jim (1962). Panavision adapted the Angenieux 10× zoom for anamorphic productions. The 50-500 APZA was part of the standard anamorphic production package supported by Panavision from mid 1960s to the end of the 1970s. It has been used in numerous movies including The Graduate (1967), MASH (1970), McCabe and Mrs Miller (1971), Death in Venice (1971) and Jaws (1975). In 2013 and 2014 Angenieux released a new series of high end anamorphic zooms. These lenses, the 30-72 and 56-152 Optimo A2S are compact and weighs less than 2.5 kg. * Joe Dunton Camera (JDC): Manufacturer and rental house based in Britain and North Carolina, which adapts spherical lenses to anamorphic by adding a cylindrical element. Its most popular lenses are the Xtal Xpres series (pronounced \\"Crystal Express\\"), which were built by Shiga Optics in Japan from old Cooke S2/S3 and Panchro lenses. They have also adapted Zeiss Super Speeds and Standards (the Speedstar series), as well as Canon lenses. JDC was purchased by Panavision in 2007.\\"Panavision to Acquire Camera Assets of Joe Dunton & Company\\". PR Newswire. August 15, 2007. Retrieved February 1, 2013. * Elite Optics, manufactured by JSC Optica-Elite Company in Russia and sold in the United States by Slow Motion Inc. * Technovision, a French manufacturer that, like JDC, has adapted spherical Cooke and Zeiss lenses to anamorphic. Technovision was purchased by Panavision in 2004. * Isco Optics, a German company that developed the Arriscope line for Arri in 1989. = Projection = * ISCO Precision Optics is a manufacturer of theatrical cinema projection lenses. * Panamorph is a manufacturer of hybrid cylindrical / prism based projection lenses specialized for the consumer home theater industry. * Schneider Kreuznach, (also called Century Optics) makers of anamorphic projection lenses. The company also manufactures add-on anamorphic adaptor lenses that can be mounted on digital video cameras.  Super 35 and Techniscope  Although many films projected anamorphically have been shot using anamorphic lenses, there are often aesthetic and technical reasons that make shooting with spherical lenses preferable. If the director and cinematographer still wish to retain the 2.40:1 aspect ratio, anamorphic prints can be made from spherical negatives. Because the 2.40:1 image cropped from an Academy ratio 4-perf negative causes considerable waste of frame space, and since the cropping and anamorphosing of a spherical print requires an intermediate lab step, it is often attractive for these films to use a different negative pulldown method (most commonly 3-perf, but occasionally Techniscope 2-perf) usually in conjunction with the added negative space Super 35 affords. However, with advancements in digital intermediate technology, the anamorphosing process can now be completed as a digital step with no degradation of image quality. Also, 3-perf and 2-perf pose minor problems for visual effects work. The area of the film in 4-perf work that is cropped out in the anamorphosing process nonetheless contains picture information that is useful for such visual effects tasks as 2D and 3D tracking. This mildly complicates certain visual effects efforts for productions using 3-perf and 2-perf, making anamorphic prints struck digitally from center cropped 4-perf Super 35 the popular choice in large budget visual effects driven productions.

Dunn was widely considered one of the most dynamic speakers among the general authorities in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1991, Dunn stated that he had \\"not always been accurate\\" in his speeches and writingsPaul H. Dunn, \\"An open letter to members of the Church\\", Church News, October 26, 1991. after it was reported that he \\"made up many of the stories about baseball and battle he told as personal experiences\\".Associated Press, \\"Arizona Paper Alleges Many Stories Were Exaggerated\\", Deseret News, February 16, 1991. Biography Born in Provo, Utah, to Joshua Harold Dunn and Geneve Roberts, Dunn was baptized a member of the LDS Church at the age of eight. Dunn earned a bachelor's degree from Chapman College in 1953 and master's and doctorate degrees in educational administration from the University of Southern California. In 1952, Dunn began his professional career as a seminary teacher for the Church Educational System in Los Angeles. On April 6, 1964, LDS Church president David O. McKay called Dunn as a general authority and member of the First Council of the Seventy. While in this position, Dunn was the president of the church's New England Mission from 1968 to 1971. In 1976, Dunn became a member of the newly constituted First Quorum of the Seventy. Dunn was a member of this quorum until he was designated an emeritus general authority on October 1, 1989. Additionally, Dunn served as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy from 1976 to 1980. Dunn wrote over 50 books during his time as a general authority. Dunn married Jeanne Alice Cheverton on February 27, 1946, and they were the parents of three daughters. Dunn was named Utah's Father of the Year in 1972. He died of cardiac arrest in Salt Lake City while recovering from back surgery in 1998. Scandals =AFCO Enterprises, Inc fraud involvement= Dunn was a director of AFCO Enterprises, Inc., a property development company in the 1970s and early 1980s.Shupe, A. D. (1991). The darker side of virtue: Corruption, scandal, and the Mormon empire. Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books. page 55-57 In 1982 the company went bankrupt and in September 1983 the principal owner, Grant C. Affleck, was arrested for defrauding investors out of between $20–$50 million.\\"Authorities Arrest Suspect in Fraud\\" Salt Lake Tribune, September 4, 1983 Dunn's image was a prominent part of the promotional material provided to potential investors. Dunn said that he resigned from the company in 1978 because AFCO was exploiting his connection to the LDS Church. However, AFCO continued to provide Dunn with a new car every year until 1982, and Dunn continued to regularly attend AFCO board meetings until the company went bankrupt.Victor F. Zanana, \\"Leaders of Mormonism Double as Overseers of a Financial Empire,\\" Wall Street Journal, November 9, 1983 In a sworn deposition Dunn stated his only role had been to deliver prayers and inspirational messages; however, evidence at Affleck's trial showed that Dunn had backdated his resignation from the company, and had continued to seek new investors and called creditors on the companies behalf into the 1980s.United States of America vs. Grant C. Affleck, United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, Salt Lake City, September 26, 1983, Reporter's Transcript, vol. 17, p. 3180 and final volume pp. 16, 18 =Falsified experiences= During his time as a general authority, Dunn often included in his speeches and books extraordinary \\"real life\\" experiences that he claimed were from his past. In the late 1980s, a number of investigators, including Arizona Republic reporter Lynn Packer and church critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner, accused Dunn of fabricating or embellishing many of these events. Among Dunn's claims that came to be questioned were: *that Dunn had played major league baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals;Paul H. Dunn, You and Your World, 128; Paul H. Dunn (1973), Discovering the Quality of Success, Deseret Book: Salt Lake City, 38. *that Dunn was one of only six in his 1,000-man combat group who survived World War II, and was the only one of the six survivors who wasn't wounded;Paul H. Dunn, \\"The Message: 'If Thou Art Willing'\\", New Era, August 1975, pp. 4–5. *that Dunn was the sole survivor among 11 infantrymen in a 100-yard race against death, during which one burst of machine-gun fire ripped his right boot off, another tore off his ammunition and canteen belt and yet another split his helmet in half—all without wounding him. *that Dunn's best friend died in his arms from serious injuries sustained in a battle on Okinawa.Jerald & Sandra Tanner, \\"Dunn in the Name of God!: Confessions by Emeritus General Authority of the Mormon Church Raises New Questions about the Origins of Mormonism\\", Salt Lake City Messenger, no. 78, June 1991. When confronted with evidence that several of his stories were either completely falsified or substantially embellished, Dunn admitted that the stories were not completely true, yet continued to defend his use of the stories: \\"I haven't purposely tried to embellish or rewrite history. I've tried to illustrate points that would create interest. [I was] simply putting history in little finer packages.\\"Salt Lake Tribune, February 16, 1991, p. 2B. Dunn compared his stories to the parables of Jesus—although they were not true stories, they were nevertheless valuable means of teaching gospel principles. In 1991, Dunn asked the church's First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for permission to issue an open letter to all Latter-day Saints. The church agreed, and on October 26 the following letter was published in the Church News, a supplement section of the Deseret News, a newspaper owned by the LDS Church: > \\"October 23, 1991 > \\"I have been accused of various activities unbecoming a member of The > Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. > \\"I confess that I have not always been accurate in my public talks and > writings. Furthermore, I have indulged in other activities inconsistent with > the high and sacred office which I have held. > \\"For all of these I feel a deep sense of remorse, and ask forgiveness of > any whom I may have offended. > \\"My brethren of the General Authorities, over a long period of time, have > conducted in-depth investigations of the charges made against me. They have > weighed the evidence. They have censured me and placed a heavy penalty upon > me. > \\"I accept their censure and the imposed penalty, and pledge to conduct my > life in such a way as to merit their confidence and full fellowship. > \\"In making these acknowledgements, I plead for the understanding of my > brethren and sisters throughout the Church and give assurance of my > determination so to live as to bring added respect to the cause I deeply > love, and honor to the Lord who is my Redeemer. > \\"Sincerely, Paul H. Dunn\\" The exact nature of this \\"heavy penalty\\" imposed upon Dunn is unclear. It is clear that Dunn was not excommunicated from the church, though it is not known whether or not he was placed under some other form of church discipline, such as disfellowshipment or probation.

Darcy became one of the most trusted advisors to Edward III of England and was appointed High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests in 1319, High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1323 and High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1327. He served as Member of Parliament for Nottinghamshire in 1320. He was summoned to Parliament in 1331, 1333 and 1341 as \\"Johanni Darcy le Cosin\\". In 1323 (until 1326), 1332 (until 1333) and again in 1340 (until 1344) he was Lord Justice of Ireland. In 1324, he presided at the trial of Alice Kyteler, the celebrated Witch of Kilkenny and her associates, and condemned several of them to death by burning (Alice herself, helped by influential friends, escaped from prison and fled the country). Darcy was named a Knights Bachelor in 1336. He was steward to the king (1337–1340) and then chamberlain (1342–1346). An ambitious programme to reform the Irish administration produced little result, possibly because it was delegated to his Deputy, John Morice, a long serving and conscientious but not very competent civil servant.Frame, Robin Ireland and Britain 1170-1450 Hambledon Press London 1998 p.118 In 1342, he joined the Earl of Northampton on an expedition to Flanders and on his return was made Constable of Nottingham Castle (1343–1344) and of the Tower of London (1345–1346). He took part in a number of wars against the Scots and French and fought at the Battle of Crecy in 1346, being sent home by the king to announce the victory in Parliament. He was created the first Lord Darcy of Knayth. Marriage and issue Darcy married twice. He had one son with his first wife, Emmeline. She was the daughter of Sir Walter Heron of Silkston and Alice de Hastings. Darcy's second wife was Joan, widow of Thomas FitzJohn, 2nd Earl of Kildare.

He was ranked 83rd by the public in Skai TV's Great Greeks in 2009. In 2010, Forbes ranked Lazopoulos as the most powerful and influential celebrity in Greece. Lazopoulos was born in Larissa, Greece, where he received his primary and secondary school education. He then entered the School of Law at the University of Thrace and in 1984 received his Master’s degree from the University of Thessaloniki. However, he decided not to practise law but to pursue other vocations. In 1979, he wrote his first script for the revue Something's cooking in Gipsyland. SAY GOODBYE, IT’S ALL OVER NOW soon followed with great success. Lazopoulos joined the Free Theatre of Athens, where he performed WHY PEOPLE ARE HAPPY, followed by yet another successful revue, CHANGE AND CRAZE. The political situation at the time triggered the production of four revues of a more politico-satirical nature, written between the years 1982-86 by Lakis Lazopoulos and Giannis Xanthoulis: Haido’s Pasok’’ (1982), Pasok keeps harping on (1983), Blowing hot and cold on kastri (the PM’s residence), and Andrea’s taxing tolls (1985). In 1986 he starred in Lysistrata. The play toured Greece and was performed in all major open theatres, including the Theatre of Herod Atticus in Athens, to highly acclaimed success. That same year, he began writing on his own and staged I was Pasok and I grew old. In 1987, he wrote What the Japanese saw. For this latter he was sued by then-President of Greece, Christos Sartzetakis. After standing trial he is finally acquitted of all charges; while issue draws strong press coverage in Greece and overseas, including an article in TIME Magazine. In 1988 he stages and performs in Nicholai Gogol’s “Diary of a madman” without great commercial success. Nonetheless, he considers this performance a significant personal milestone in his career. In 1989 he stages “Greece after heart surgery” which breaks all records, while his following play “THERE WAS A SMALL SHIP” runs for two successive years and is a box office hit. 1n 1991 Lakis Lazopoulos stages “I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU” which, like all his plays thus far, he writes and performs in himself. In the summer of the same year he tours Greece with the performance “ALONE AT LAST”. This comprises a series of his most popular acts, and proves to be his most successful commercially since 1981. In fact its success was such, that another tour followed two years later, debuting in New York City. In 1992 he turns his attention to television, writing and interpreting fifteen character roles (both male and female), in the most successful TV series on Greek television to date, entitled Deka mikroi Mitsoi. The roles, portraying everyday characters satirizing contemporary social and political situations, draw great affinity with the public. Spurred by the series' success, the educational department of the University of Athens conducts a survey looking into reasons why Greeks everywhere, not only avidly watched the series, but also adopted expressions used by its characters. With its creator, Lakis Lazopoulos present, the findings were officially announced to academics, students and the press. Deka mikroi Mitsoi also takes part in the festival of Forte dei Marmi in Italy, receiving an Honorable Distinction. In 1993 he presents Prokofiev’s well-known tale of Peter and the Wolf at the Athens Opera House. He also plays the role of McKeith in Brecht’s “THREE PENNY OPERA” under the direction of Jules Dassin. In 1994 he played the male lead in a television film titled Girl with Suitcases directed by Nikos Nikolaidis. He follows this with a guest star appearance in the film “KAVAFIS”, directed by Giannis Smaragdis. In the summer of 1996 he writes the play “THE SUNDAY OF SHOES”, which goes on to be staged in Thessaloniki in the spring of 1997 and then Athens at the beginning of 1998. During that year, Walt Disney Productions assigns him the supervisory role of the animation film Hercules, for which he provides his own adaptation from English to Greek. He overseas the casting of actors and uses his own voice in dubbing the roles of Philoctetes/Phil and Panic in the film. In the summer of 1999 he plays the lead role in the film Beware of Greeks Bearing Guns directed by Australian director John Tatoulis. The film is a box office hit when released in Greece in January 2000. In 2001 he works on a film entitled My best friend, the script of which he writes, directs and stars as the lead. At the same time he also writes the theatrical play “TA LEME”, which maintains its position at the top of the box office well into 2002. In September 2002 he presents 12 theatrical monologues from the most important writers of 1700. That same summer he presents a theatrical monologue as part of the framework of the Cultural Olympiad entitled “AGES OF RIDICULE”. Between 2003/2004 he stars in the revue “WIND IN OUR SAILS”, a production he writes and directs, which is presented at the theatre Britannia in Athens to huge commercial success. At the same time, he becomes Artistic Director for two prominent Athens theatres, the Britannia and Athinon. In February 2004 the film R20, for which he has written the script and co-directed with P. Karazas, opens at the box office. During the summer of 2004 he holds the leading role of Hremilos in Aristophanes' ancient comedy Ploutos. The play tours Greece, culminating in a special performance at the ancient theatre of Epidaurus, as part of the Athens Olympics that August. The winter of 2004/2005 finds Lakis Lazopoulos writing, directing and starring as the lead in yet another successful and original production at Athens' Britannia theatre, entitled “WHERE IS THIS BUS GOING?” The show is a huge sell out, gaining exceptional reviews from the press. The premiere of Al Tsantiri News (“Live from the Shack”) in November 2004 makes Lakis Lazopoulos the first actor in Greek television history to host his own weekly show. To the present day, this satirical news bulletin continues to draw exceptionally high ratings. Since 2004 he has held the position of Programming Director for the entertainment sector of the privately owned television channel, Alpha TV. The television program “504KM NORTH OF ATHENS”, inspired by student life in Greece, was a project through which he was able to introduce a group of young actors and a very talented new director to Greek audiences. The film “DON’T GO”, released in April 2005 was an adaptation of this story. In the summer of 2005 Lakis Lazopoulos will once again bring his own style and interpretation to another Aristophanes play, The Acharnians this time for The National Theatre of Greece. In November 2005, he directed and had the lead in Vretania Theater, entitled “Hysteria” written by Tery Johnson. In 2006 he played in the film El Greco by Iannis Smaragdis, having the part of Nicolo, Greco’s best friend. The movie was released on October 2007 and was a record ticket-selling success. In November 2008 and after 3 years of absence from the theater he writes, directs and stars as the lead in the play “Toiler on the roof”. The play was a great success.

In Egypt, she met the musician Hani Mihanna who produced two of her albums. Wehyati Andak in 1995 was successful in the Arab world: until then she was known in the West side of the Arab world, but after that album she became widely known all over the Arab world. Mihnna also produced her second album, As'har Ma'ah Sertak, in 1997. A few months later in 1997 she released Al Asami with a different producer and in 2000 Yana. Her last album in Egypt was Youm Aleek, released in 2003, only three days before her murder. Her most successful singles performed in Egyptian Arabic were: * \\"Wehyati Andak\\" (Arabic script: و حياتي عندك). * \\"Mish Kol Hob\\" (Arabic script: مش كل حب). * \\"Youm Aleek\\" (Arabic script: يوم عليك). * \\"Bahlam Beloa'ak\\" (Arabic script: بحلم بلقاك). * \\"Al Asami\\" (Arabic script: الاسامي). * \\"Yana\\" (Arabic script: يانا). * \\"Ya Azeez Aini\\" (Arabic script: يا عزيز عيني). * \\"Law Ya Habeebi\\" (Arabic script: لو يا حبيبي). * \\"Ya Khofi\\" (Arabic script: يا خوفي). * \\"Kul Elli Lamouni\\" (Arabic script: كل اللي لاموني). =GCC and Persian Gulf region = Thekra performed many songs and album in different Arab dialects including Gulf Arabic, also known as \\"Khaleeji\\".

Death  A day before her death, she was in Libya where she performed a concert and she met al-Gaddafi. The same night, she sang a song based a poem written by Ali Al Keilani, and at a time where there were large tensions between Saudi and Libya. The poem had words where it criticised the corruption of the Saudi government and how they shouldn’t be in charge of Hajj in Mecca which was a large attack on the Al Saud family. On November 28, 2003, the same 4 people with her in Libya were found dead. She was murdered by an unknown despite many people believing it was her husband. A team of doctors, who examined the body of Tunisian singer Thikra, released a medical report after an autopsy was complete stating that she was shot with 26 bullets all over her body and had remained alive for only 15 minutes afterward. The other three victims of the crime, Thikra's secretary was shot 22 times and her business manager received 18 bullets before passing away alongside her husband receiving 3 bullets in the mouth. Despite the medical examiner ruling the incident to be suicide, one bullet to the mouth would do the job where as it is questionable why there were three. When her death was reported, her body was transformed by Al-Walid Bin Talal's (Saudi prince) private plane to avoid suspicion and show “solidarity”. After her death, many celebrities from the Arab world flew to Tunisia and Egypt to attend her funeral.

There are originally 111 COLAs, including Dax Jones. The birth of each COLA was heralded by bizarre weather phenomena, ranging anywhere from heatwaves to localized blizzards in summer. For reasons outlined below, none of the COLAs' mothers survived beyond the child's fourth birthday. Origins In Stirring the Storm, Dax uses an alien artifact to travel to another planet, where he learns from his aunt, Hessa, that each COLA child is the result of crossbreeding between aliens and humans: For thousands of years, an alliance has existed between 11 alien planets collectively referred to as \\"The Quorat\\". The inhabitants of each planet possess various supernatural abilities. About fifteen years prior to the events of Stirring the Storm, the Quorat felt it was time to integrate a twelfth planet into their alliance, and after surveying many potential worlds, they eventually chose Earth. However, they realized that the human race was still to closed-minded to communicate with them on a proper level, and that if they were to simply arrive on Earth and introduce themselves, they would be greeted with fear and distrust. Therefore, they decided to send ambassadors to Earth, in order to gradually introduce humanity to some of the powers that they possessed, and broaden the minds of their soon-to-be-allies. To this end, several female inhabitants of each Quorat planet were sent to Earth and settled in Britain (chosen for its isolation as an island and because its people were viewed as being among the most tolerant the world had to offer). These women were referred to as \\"Seeders\\", and were sent to Earth via an interplanetary 'corridor', activated by a key called a 'cleftonique'. Their arrival resulted in what was referred to as a 'cleftonique aftershock', which disrupted the atmospheric patterns in the vicinity, causing strange weather phenomena. The goal of each Seeder was to find an intelligent human male to marry and mate with, the result of each such union being a COLA child. The birth of these children caused another cleftonique aftershock. However, living on another planet puts one into contact with all sorts of unfamiliar viruses, and prolonged exposure ultimately proves fatal. Females had been chosen because they would be more resistant to such problems, but the physical changes brought about by pregnancy weakened their immune systems. Therefore, all of the Seeder women fell ill and died from various natural illnesses within four years of giving birth. The human father's immunity would be passed on to the child. Dax's Aunt Hessa states that humanity has always possessed certain minor psychic, dowsing, glamour and healing abilities, but that the powers the COLAs inherited from their mothers are expected to grow far beyond anything the Earth has ever seen before. She also claims that the ultimate purpose of the COLAs is to spread across the world and sire or bear gifted children of their own. Powers (several of the below list are only speculations by Gideon Reader who is speculating on Dax's ability, several others were included like slide projector and fax machine, these may be cola powers but cannot be verified as they were most likely a result of Gideon Reader messing around, as it was said he was trailing off ) Several examples of Cola powers include: *Dowsing *Clairvoyance *Clairaudience *Mediumship *Glamour (manifesting as either the ability to vanish from sight or the ability to create illusions) *Snake charming (mentioned only) *Levitation *Alchemy (mentioned only) *Telepathy *Empathy *Telekinesis *Teleportation (Olu only) *Pyrokinesis (Mia only) *Rune-reading (mentioned only) *Palm-reading (mentioned only) *Soothsaying (mentioned only) *Astral projection *Mimicry *Healing *Shapeshifting (in the case of Dax Jones and wolf only) *The ability to temporarily steal the powers of other Colas or leeching (in the case of Catherine Reader only) Category:Characters in children's literature ","title":"COLAs (The Shapeshifter)"},{"id":"10515878","text":"Moorswater industry seen from Moorswater railway viaduct Class 37 locomotive at Moorwater cement works in August 2000 Moorswater viaduct carrying the Cornish Main Line railway Moorswater is an industrial suburb of Liskeard in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

Gregorian Code) is the title of a collection of constitutions (legal pronouncements) of Roman emperors over a century and a half from the 130s to 290s AD. It is believed to have been produced around 291-4 but the exact date is unknown.\\"Codex Gregorianus\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 474. History Modern bust of Diocletian in his palace at Split, Croatia. The Codex takes its name from its author, a certain Gregorius (or Gregorianus), about whom nothing is known for certain, though it has been suggested that he acted as the magister libellorum (drafter of responses to petitions) to the emperors Carinus and Diocletian in the 280s and early 290s.Honoré (1994), pp. 148–55, 191 – anonymous secretaries Nos 17 and 18. The work does not survive intact and much about its original form remains obscure, though from the surviving references and excerpts it is clear that it was a multi-book work, subdivided into thematic headings (tituli) that contained a mixture of rescripts to private petitioners, letters to officials, and public edicts, organised chronologically. Scholars' estimates as to the number of books vary from 14 to 16,14 books: Haenel (1837); 14 or 15 books: Rotondi (1922), pp. 154–58; 16 books: Scherillo (1934). with the majority favouring 15.Krueger (1890), pp. 236–45; Rotondi (1922), pp. 154–58; Sperandio (2005), pp. 389–95; Corcoran (2006), p. 39; Karampoula (2008), pp. 189–317. Where evidence of the mode of original publication is preserved, it is overwhelmingly to posting up, suggesting that Gregorius was working with material in the public domain.Corcoran (2000), p.28. Reception In the fourth and fifth centuries, for those wishing to cite imperial constitutions, the Codex Gregorianus became a standard work of reference, often cited alongside the Codex Hermogenianus. The earliest explicit quotations are by the anonymous author of the Mosaicarum et Romanarum Legum Collatio, or Lex Dei as it is sometimes known, probably in the 390s.Collatio I.8–10, III.4, VI.4, X.8, XV.3. In the early fifth century Augustine of Hippo cites the Gregorian Code in discussion of adulterous marriages.Augustin. De coniugiis adulterinis 2.7, dated to AD 419 by , pp. 282–83. Most famously, the Gregorian and Hermogenian Codes are cited as a model for the organisation of imperial constitutions since Constantine I in the directive ordering their collection in what was to become the Codex Theodosianus, addressed to the senate of Constantinople on 26 March 429, and drafted by Theodosius II's quaestor Antiochus Chuzon.Codex Theodosianus I.1.5. pr.: Ad similitudinem Gregoriani atque Hermogeniani codicis cunctas colligi constitutiones decernimus, quas Constantinus inclitus et post eum divi principes nosque tulimus edictorum viribus aut sacra generalitate subnixas; on which see , pp. 112–118 (quaestor E23). In the post- Theodosian era both Codes are quoted as sources of imperial constitutions by the mid-fifth-century anonymous author of the Consultatio veteris cuiusdam iurisconsulti (probably based in Gaul);Codex Gregorianus quoted at Consultatio I.6–10, II.6–7, IX.8–11, 14–19. are cited in marginal cross-references by a user of the Fragmenta Vaticana;Codex Gregorianus cited at Fragmenta Vaticana 266a, 272, 285, 286, and 288. and in notes from an eastern law school lecture course on Ulpian's Ad Sabinum.Codex Gregorianus cited by Scholia Sinaitica I.3 and V.9, 10. In the Justinianic era, the antecessor (law professor) Thalelaeus cited the Gregorian Code in his commentary on Codex Justinianeus.Codex Gregorianus cited by Thalelaeus in scholia on Codex Justinianeus 2.4.18 and 2.4.43 (Basilica ed. Heimbach, vol. I pp. 704, 726). In the west, some time before 506, both codices were supplemented by a set of clarificatory notes (interpretationes), which accompany their abridged versions in the Breviary of Alaric,. and were cited as sources in the Lex Romana Burgundionum attributed to Gundobad, king of the Burgundians (473–516).Codex Gregorianus cited by Lex Romana Burgund. III.2, XIV.7, XXIII.2, XXXVIII.2, 3, XLIV.4. Eclipse Texts drawn from the Codex Gregorianus achieved status as authoritative sources of law simultaneously with the original work's deliberate eclipse by two codification initiatives of the sixth century. First, the abridged version incorporated in the Breviary of Alaric, promulgated in 506, explicitly superseded the original full text throughout Visigothic Gaul and Spain. Then, as part of the emperor Justinian's grand codificatory programme, it formed a major component of the Codex Justinianeus, which came into force in its first edition across the Roman Balkans and eastern provinces in AD 529.C. Haec (AD 528), pr.: Haec, quae necessario corrigenda esse multis retro principibus visa sunt, interea tamen nullus eorum hoc ad effectum ducere ausus est, in praesenti rebus donare communibus auxilio dei omnipotentis censuimus et prolixitatem litium amputare, multitudine quidem constitutionum, quae tribus codicibus Gregoriano et Hermogeniano atque Theodosiano continebantur, illarum etiam, quae post eosdem codices a Theodosio divinae recordationis aliisque post eum retro principibus, a nostra etiam clementia positae sunt, resecanda, uno autem codice sub felici nostri nominis vocabulo componendo, in quem colligi tam memoratorum trium codicum quam novellas post eos positas constitutiones oportet; C.

This was subsequently rolled out to Latin north Africa, following its reconquest from the Vandals in 530, and then Italy in 554. So, by the mid sixth century the original text of the Gregorian Code had been consigned to the dustbin of history over most of the Mediterranean world. Only in Merovingian and Frankish Gaul were copies of the full version still exploited between the sixth and ninth centuries, as attested by the appendices to manuscripts of the Breviary.CG quoted in Lex Romana Visigothorum, App. I.1–6, II.6–7. Legacy Alphabetical index on the Corpus Juris, printed in Lyon, 1571 It is because of its exploitation for the Codex Justinianeus that the influence of Gregorius' work is still felt today. As such, it formed part of the Corpus Juris Civilis of the revived medieval and early modern Roman law tradition. This in turn was the model and inspiration for the civil law codes that have dominated European systems since the Code Napoleon of 1804. Editions There has been no attempt at a full reconstruction of the all the surviving texts that probably derive from the CG, partly because of the difficulty of distinguishing with absolute certainty constitutions of Gregorius from those of Hermogenian in the Codex Justinianeus in the years of the mid 290s, where they appear to overlap.Corcoran (2000), pp. 32–35. Tony Honoré (1994) provides the full text of all the private rescripts of the relevant period but in a single chronological sequence, not according to their possible location in the CG. The fullest edition of CG remains that of Haenel (1837: 1–56), though he included only texts explicitly attributed to CG by ancient authorities and so did not cite the CJ material, on the grounds that it was only implicitly attributed. Krueger (1890) edited the Visigothic abridgement of CG, with its accompanying interpretationes (pp. 224–33), and provided a reconstruction of the structure of the CG, again excluding CJ material (pp. 236–42), inserting the full text only where it did not otherwise appear in the Collectio iuris Romani Anteiustiniani. Rotondi (1922: 154–58), Scherillo (1934), and Sperandio (2005: 389–95) provide only an outline list of the titles, though the latter offers a useful concordance with Lenel's edition of the Edictum Perpetuum.. Karampoula (2008) conflates the reconstructions of Krueger (1890) and Rotondi (1922) but provides text (including Visigothic interpretationes) in a modern Greek version.

Hermogenian Code) is the title of a collection of constitutions (legal pronouncements) of the Roman emperors of the first tetrarchy (Diocletian, Maximian Augusti, and Constantius and Galerius Caesars), mostly from the years 293–94. Most of the work is now lost. The work became a standard reference in late antiquity, until it was superseded by the Breviary of Alaric and the Codex Justinianeus. History Head from a statue of Diocletian, Istanbul Archaeological Museum It takes its name from its author, Aurelius Hermogenianus, a prominent jurist of the age who acted as the magister libellorum (drafter of responses to petitions) to Diocletian in this period.Honoré (1994), pp. 163–81, 191 – secretary No 20.

Nevertheless, from the surviving references and excerpts it is clear that it was a single book work, subdivided into thematic headings (tituli) containing largely rescripts to private petitioners,. organised chronologically. Of the texts explicitly attributed to the Codex Hermogenianus, the vast majority date from the years 293–294, though some texts may have been added to this core by Hermogenian in subsequent editions of his work. For the fifth-century author Coelius Sedulius claims that Hermogenian, like Origen, produced three editions of his work in total (though this may relate to his Iuris epitomae).Sedulius, Opus Paschale: Epistula ad Macedonium altera (), p. 172, lines 10–11: Cognoscant Hermogenianum, doctissimum iurislatorem, tres editiones sui operis confecisse. Still, the seven Valentinianic constitutions attributed to the CH by the author of the Consultatio veteris cuiusdam iurisconsulti must reflect on-going insertions by subsequent users rather than authorial appendices.Consultatio IX.1–7. Consensus opinion has it that the first edition collected the rescripts of 293 and 294, which Hermogenian had himself authored as magister libellorum. It has been proposed that Hermogenianus produced the second edition after 298, while praetorian prefect, its inclusion of western rescripts reflecting service as magister libellorum at the court of Maximian (c. AD 295–298), and that the final edition, incorporating extra eastern texts, was achieved c. 320 at the court of Licinius or possibly the Law School of Berytus.Corcoran (2000), pp. 32–40, 85–90; cf. 299–300. If Hermogenian applied the same organisational principle to the Codex as he did in his Iuris epitomae, then the order of titles is likely to have followed that of the Praetor's Edict.Digest. I.5.2 (Hermogenianus, lib. I iuris epit.); . Scholars' estimates as to the number of titles vary from a minimum of 18 to one of 147,18 titles: Haenel (1837); 147 titles: Cenderelli (1965), 143–81; Karampoula (2008), pp. 189–317. though a majority favour 69.69 titles: Krueger (1890), pp. 236–45; Rotondi (1922), pp. 154–58; Sperandio (2005), pp. 389–95; Corcoran (2006), p. 39. Where evidence as to the circumstances of original publication is preserved, it is overwhelmingly to the giving or subscribing of the constitution, suggesting that Hermogenian's collection was made at source in the imperial archives.Corcoran (2000), p. 28. Reception In the fourth and fifth centuries, for those wishing to cite imperial constitutions, the Codex Hermogenianus became a standard work of reference, often cited alongside the Codex Gregorianus, to which it seems to have functioned almost as a supplementary volume.

Editions There has been no attempt at a full reconstruction of all the surviving texts that probably derive from the CH, partly because of the difficulty of distinguishing with absolute certainty constitutions of Hermogenian from those of Gregorian in the Codex Justinianeus in the years of the mid 290s, where they appear to overlap.Corcoran (2000), pp. 32–35. Honoré (1994) provides the full text of all the private rescripts of the relevant period but in a single chronological sequence, not according to their possible location in the CH. The fullest edition of CH is that by Cenderelli (1965: 143–81), who lists references only where the source is CJ but otherwise gives the full text, as did Haenel (1837: 57–80), though he included only texts explicitly attributed to CH by ancient authorities and so did not cite the CJ material, on the grounds that it was only implicitly attributed. Krueger (1890) edited the Visigothic abridgement of CH, with its accompanying interpretationes (pp. 234–35), and provided a reconstruction of the structure of the CH, again excluding CJ material (pp. 242–45), inserting the full text only where it did not otherwise appear in the Collectio iuris Romani Anteiustiniani. Rotondi (1922: 154–58) and Sperandio (2005: 389–95) provide only an outline list of the titles, though the latter offers a useful concordance with Lenel's edition of the Edictum Perpetuum.. Karampoula (2008) reconstructs on the same principles as Cenderelli (1965) but provides text (including Visigothic interpretationes) in a modern Greek version.

The film made heavy use of visual special effects that were cutting-edge at the time of its release. It follows the adventures of a half- man, half-animal individual named Harry Haller, who in the Germany of the 1920s, is depressed, resentful of his middle class station, and wants to die not knowing the world around him. He then meets two strange people who introduce him to life and a bizarre world called the \\"Magic Theater\\".

Hesse's daughter-in-lawe, Ida, worked as a still photographer on the set. Production The film took seven years of complicated pre-production because its producers, Melvin Abner Fishman and Richard Herland. Fishman - a student of Jung and alchemy - wanted the film to be \\"the first Jungian film\\". and built up relationships with the Hesse family that allowed the film rights of the book to be released. Herland raised the finances. Directors Michelangelo Antonioni and John Frankenheimer, as well as the actor James Coburn were all touted to direct the film. In the end, the film was directed by its screenwriter, Fred Haines. Although Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Timothy Leary were all proposed as playing the main role of Harry Haller, the role eventually went to Max von Sydow. Although the film was made in English, none of the principal actors were native English speakers. Steppenwolf was filmed on location in Basel, Switzerland, Wiesbaden, Germany, and at Studio Hamburg in Germany. Finally, the rights to the finished film were entirely given over to Peter Sprague, its financier. A \\"marketing disaster\\" followed, which included the colour of the prints coming out incorrectly. For decades the film remained little seen except for brief runs in art film houses.

Its centre is about northeast of the centre of Damascus. Being the centre of Rif Dimashq governorate (which completely surrounds the Damascus Governorate), the town is also the administrative centre of Douma District. Douma is a major city of the region known as Ghouta, for the peri-urban settlements to the east and south of Damascus. History =21st century= During the Syrian Civil War, Douma has been a major flashpoint and witnessed numerous demonstrations against the Syrian government and armed clashes against the Syrian Army and Security forces during the early stages of the conflict. On 30 January 2012, the Syrian Army gained control of the city after the Battle of Douma, a major operation against the opposition armed groups in Rif Dimashq Governorate. On 29 June 2012, the Syrian Army was accused of committing a massacre in Douma, where more than 50 people were killed. As of 18 October 2012, the Free Syrian Army was in control of most of the suburb. Fighting and bombardments continued in the town. Douma is the main city of the Siege of Eastern Ghouta, begun in April 2013, isolating 400,000 people in a 100 square kilometre area. UN and Red Cross aid convoys were able to reach Douma with food and supplies once in 2018. In the 2015 Douma market massacre, the city was attacked by Syrian Army ground-to-ground missiles, leaving at least 50 dead and several more missing.

The Turks estimated that the convoy was attacked by a group of 6 soldiers and not the Eagles of the Whirlwind however the group declared those 6 persons were soldiers and members, the attack happened in As-Safira when the convoy taking around 3 Turks and 53 Syrians was attacked, this was the only attack the Eagles of the Whirlwind ever claimed and presumably ever committed this was also the only time Erdoğan ever mentioned the Eagles of the Whirlwind and by extension the Syrian Social Nationalist Party being the second Turkish president to do so and the third time it was ever mentioned by a Turkish president ever held in historical records. On 22 December 2017, Tahrir al-Sham accused the group of using tear gas and Grenades to kill however both Turkey and the Eagles of the Whirlwind confirmed that only Ak-47's were used, both Tahrir al-Sham and Turkey claimed the group was going to Idlib for economic reasons not military or political this however was rejected by Rojava, the PKK and Syria plus Iraq, Iran and Hezbollah and even Iraqi Kurdistan as well as Lebanon with Bashar al-Assad claiming the group was screaming Allahu Akbar & raising ISIS flags as well as that of Tahrir al-Sham on 22 December 2017, this was rejected by Turkey until a video circulated on 23 December 2017 showing exactly that and so on 24 December 2017 Erdoğan declared that it was not a civilian convoy and stated the group was justified to attack it with since it was filled with Jihadists. Only Tahrir al-Sham condemning it as a civilian targeted attack since 24 December 2017. On 1 January 2018 Ali Haidar praised the attack stating that \\"Thousands fought, hundreds died but 6 killed.\\" and he stated that this was the only real attack instead of fight or battle that occurred comparing it to the Houla massacre, his statement received condemnation by the United Nations on 2 January 2018 and he was fired from leading the Eagles of the Whirlwind on 3 January 2018 by general secretary or president of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party Hanna El Nashif for his repulsiveness and she took control of the militia from then on, on 6 December 2018 a party of around 65 people in Damascus celebrated the anniversary and around 800 in Beirut, the party in Beirut was so large the government dispersed and banned them which killed 2 people and injured around 120 people, on 6 December 2019 a party of 1,200 Syrians in Damascus celebrated the 2nd anniversary of the incident. On 6 December 2019, Syria officially made 6 December a holiday to celebrate the attack. To this day there is no evidence that the Eagles of the Whirlwind or Syrian Social Nationalist Party perpetrated the attack and it was probably committed by the Syrian Armed Forces. There is no evidence those six soldiers knew of or sympathized with the SSNP let alone joined. The six soldiers who perpetrated the attack remained missing since, leading some to believe that they were killed by the rest of the caravan or by an ambush, the Syrian government offered to pay them $30k each equal to $90k, the typical amount of a general not a soldier. All six men are Sunnis from Idlib. On 14 March 2020 all six bodies were discovered in the city confirming the presumed report that they died from a gun fight and on 14 March 2020 Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and Iran's Ali Khamenei declared them martyr's. On 1 June 2020 Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi claimed that Saudi Arabia learned of the gun fight and that they bombed the six men involved after seeing them fire upon the convoy, he also claimed that Israel helped Saudi Arabia locate the six men through satellite imagery that Saudi Arabia lacks, he claimed that Turkey and the West had no knowledge of the attack. As of 1 October 2020 the attack is internationally recognized by everyone as a Syrian offensive against Tahrir al-Sham, except by Tahrir al- Sham who claims they were Alawites who killed a convoy of Turkish and Syrian Sunni civilians and regards it as the As-Safira Massacre while it is internationally recognized as the As-Safira Incident. Climate As-Safira has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSk).

It is a part of the Martinez Unified School District. During the 2006-2007 academic year, the school had enrollment of approximately 1400 students. Alhambra plays an active role in the community, with students participating in extracurricular sports, theatre, music, mentoring, and outreach programs as well as numerous community events. The school's mascot is \\"Spike\\" the bulldog, who can often be seen in appearances with \\"Spikette\\" at football games and rallies. History The public school district added a high school department, which was accredited by the state university. Then a private school took over, and from 1895 to 1899 the Martinez Academy provided high school classes. The discontinuance of the academy - apparently the private school business was financially precarious - left Martinez without a high school. (Contra Costa Gazette January 20, 1956) In July, 1901, the Alhambra Union High School District was organized. It was the second of the present day high schools to be instituted and one of four organized in the same year. Alhambra Union High School was established in 1901 according to the minutes of the school board meeting on July 31, 1901. The school mascot was the Panther from 1927 until 1947 when they worked with the Antioch High School to keep the colors (blue and gold) and change their mascot to the Bulldogs. (see Contra Costa Gazette January 15, 1947) These items of history are available on the website AlhambraAlumni.org , created and maintained by David Rich (class of 1973) and his wife Karen. Diversity According to the SARC report for the 2014-2015 school year, the student population is 55% White, 25.4% Latino, 2% African American, 3.8% Asian, 3.4% Filipino, 0.2% Native American, 0.5% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 9.7% of two or more races.http://ahs-martinez- ca.schoolloop.com/file/1327739696363/1381823027387/4071386127395595873.pdf Campus Alhambra's campus was built into one of the Bay Area's characteristic rolling hills. The campus was renovated in 1994, and is now set in a Spanish style reminiscent of the old campus. In 2003, the Center for the Arts (Performing Arts Building or PAB) was completed, which seats 350 and plays host to theatrical and musical performances. This is a marked improvement for the school's drama department, which previously performed in the school's \\"multi-use room\\", a combination cafeteria and stage space. During the reconstruction, it staged its performances inside the school's cramped library. Most recently, the drama department received a new Black Box theater. Performances can be conducted there, or alternatively in the PAB building. The Center for the Arts also features rooms outside that are used to exhibit art. The Center for the Arts also has a large projector screen that can either hang down or retract into the ceiling above. This screen is often used for awareness programs for the students. The school's synthetic field for football, baseball, soccer, and lacrosse borders the main avenue through town, and an all weather track, tennis courts and basketball are set on the top of a hill. The renovation also produced a large gym facility and a student commons. All throughout the campus are student-made paintings on doors, walls, and seating areas. Often, the paintings are remakes of other famous paintings, but there are original works as well. For example, in between the F and H Buildings are low concrete walls with numerous flags from different countries painted on top. Some wall paintings depict famous people or musical instruments.

The school frequently fields excellent teams in most of these sports, especially football, baseball, cross-country and track & field. The Bulldogs baseball team has had two notables players drafted in the MLB since 2010. Robert Stephenson in 2011 was drafted in the first round, as number 27 overall selection out of Alhambra by the Cincinnati Reds. He is currently playing in minor league baseball. Elliott Waterman, who was also drafted in 2011, attended the University of San Francisco before being selected by the Washington Nationals in the 13th round, as overall selection number 414. Waterman is currently playing in the Gulf Coast League for the Nationals' rookie league team. The Bulldogs gridiron teams are always competitive, in large part due to the extraordinary leadership by 20+ year head coach Dave Silvera. Alhambra's most successful and memorable football teams included back-to-back 13-0 seasons leading to North Coast Section (NCS) championships in 1990 (led by quarterback Mark Rueb, running back Jeff Waters and offensive lineman/defensive lineman Joe Dunn) and 1991 (led by quarterback Ronny Odell and running back David Pruett). In the 1994-95 school year the Bulldogs and the furious foursome of Jon Lee, Corey Green, Michael Thompson and Stanley Joyner helped them finish second in the championship, winning the NCS title in the 1996-1997 school year (led by quarterback Kenny Kerns, running back Anthony Aires, and running back Anthony Lastrico). During the 1997-1998 school year, the Bulldogs won their division and lost in the conference championship game to Granada. The Granada football team was a team Alhambra had easily handled earlier in the season. Memorable players from the 1997-1998 school year football season were Bino Jackson, Ryan Lee #19 running back/scat back and defensive back/cornerback, Teddy Ballen, Tyler Fowler, Mike Ryken and Kevin Berry as quarterbacks. The football program had an off year for rebuilding in the 1998-1999 season, but surprisingly bounced back in 1999-2000. Key team players for 1999-2000 were Michael Cunningham (#5 fullback/linebacker), Justin Sharman (#82 wide receiver/cornerback/defensive back; all county both ways), Chris Bryan (#12 at quarterback; Honorable Mention for all county), Jacob \\"Jake\\" Lee (#19 cornerback/defensive back; received Honorable Mention for all county), Sam Nichols, Tyson McGuire, Doug Durban, Travis Minetti, and Matt Souza. Since the 2000 football team won their division, they went on to the state conference championship game against the high school football team Foothill. They barely lost to Foothill in 1999-2000 and 1997-1998. Unfortunately, Alhambra had a couple of off years in the early 2000s but has now returned to what's expected of an Alhambra football team in 2006 to present (excluding the 2008-2009 year with a record of 2-9). In the 2009-2010 season, Alhambra went to the championship game, losing to Marin Catholic high school, but still finishing with a record of 11-2. Track & field and cross country were under the direction of Coach Tim Bruder for 33 years (who recently died in his sleep). Coach Bruder's contributions are numerous to Alhambra Athletics; he is irreplaceable and will be extremely missed. These Alhambra sport teams have sent athletes to numerous state championships, such as the 1994-95 team with Jon lee, Corey Green, Michael Thompson and Stanley Joyner, who had a chance at winning the 4x100 relay when a bad hand-off suppressed their chances. Several Alhambra cross-country alumni have gone on to becoming collegiate All-Americans. The track team hosts the annual \\"Martinez Relays\\", the oldest high school relays in Northern California. In 2000, after the transfer of James McCauley, a stand-out volleyball player from De La Salle High School, the school added JV and varsity volleyball to their spring sports line-up. The varsity team was coached by former Alhambra alum Samantha Kirkhouse and was co-captained by James McCauley, #4, and Tom Hall, #13. The team, also including Eddie Glaeser, #6, Chris Uyeda, #26, and Nick Roth, #7, was involved in many disciplinary disputes with the North Coast Section CIF due to the diversity of personalities on the team. The team was still able to enjoy marginal success for their first season, and the program remained intact through the 2010 school year. Scott Osterholt, wrestling coach, was a finalist in USA Olympic Trials-Greco Roman wrestling. He was a three-time national place winner, and a national team member. Performing arts Alhambra has a drama and performing arts center which was constructed in 2002. AHS has a marching band, flag team/colorguard, drumline, concert band, jazz band, and orchestra. The drama department puts on one non-musical play in the fall, and one musical in the spring. The marching band plays at all home football games, competes in WBA, and participates in parades. Julianne George was the conductor of all bands and orchestras when they were first formed, but it is now being conducted by Sara Stafford. Gerard Wiener is the drama teacher and director. The Drama Department has put on shows including Cabaret, The Pirates of Penzance, The Diary of Anne Frank, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hello Dolly!, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Guys and Dolls, Grease, Once Upon a Mattress,, 12 Angry Jurors, Xanadu, All in the Timing, Much Ado About Nothing, To Kill A Mockingbird, and Almost, Maine. The musicals feature a live student band/orchestra previously conducted by Ms. George, several students, and now conducted by the Jazz Band director, Ms. Brown. Alhambra also produces an annual \\"Talent Show of Fine Arts\\" called the Backroads Coffeehouse, which features paintings, music, dance, poetry, and more.

This movie is the polyptych of interconnected stories in different time-zones, shifting between a Yunnan village, a campus, and the Gobi Desert. This movie was screened in competition at the Venice International Film Festival and nominated for Golden Lion but lost to Ang Lee's historical thriller Lust, Caution. This film also premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, and was nominated for Achievement in Cinematography at the 2007 Asia Pacific Screen Awards. Plot The movie details four interconnected stories. In the first story, madness and mischief as a single mother (Zhou Yun) drives her devoted son (Jaycee Chan) to distraction with her daredevil antics in pursuit of tranquility. The agile mom climbs tall trees and stands perilously astride a small earthen raft on the river. She treasures a beautiful pair of slippers that she is forever losing, and the son fears that, one day, the footwear will remain while his mother disappears. In the second story, on a college campus, two old friends find their friendship tested by rivalry over a woman. Doctor Lin (Joan Chen) is the mistress of Old Tang (Jiang Wen), but she finds herself drawn to a teacher named Liang (Anthony Wong). When Liang is accused of groping women at a campus gathering, Lin offers her rear end behind a curtain to determine whose was the guilty hand. Old Tang, who is a hunter, has a young wife (Kong Wei) who begins a relationship with the madwoman's son. One day, Tang overhears their noises of passion and his wife whispering that her husband says her belly is like velvet. He determines to shoot the young man but is given pause when the boy asks him, \\"What is velvet?\\" The final episode involves all the characters in a dreamlike sequence that brings their lives full circle. Cast *Jiang Wen as ... Old Tang *Joan Chen as ... Doctor Lin *Zhou Yun as ... Mad Mother *Jaycee Chan as ... The Son *Anthony Wong as ... Teacher Liang *Kong Wei as ... Tang's Wife Reviews The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, despite its lukewarm commercial reception. Writers at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival mentioned \\"a new aesthetic of magical realism, Jiang deftly defies the gravity of linear storytelling to produce sheer visual poetry. This gallery of lavishly composed frames may seem to follow an irrational logic but, in the end, the imagery is as rare and precious as velvet was scarce in the isolated China the film so vividly depicts.\\" Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \\"Fluid motion and glorious colors provide a visual treat in Jiang Wen's sumptuous romantic fantasy... besides being wonderful to look at, The Sun Also Rises is great fun, with sure-handed performances.\\" Moreover, the film was rumored to be China's official entries to the 2008 Oscars bidding with Lust, Caution and The Warlords. Critic and filmmaker Bilge Ebiri, however, described it as perhaps \\"one of the strangest pictures I've ever seen\\" and found it increasingly \\"more frenetic and absurd\\", despite acknowledging a \\"stylish delirium\\" near the end. Writing in Muse Magazine, Perry Lam also gave a negative review, criticizing \\"Jiang's timidity and the small-mindedness of his new movie.\\" References External links  Toronto International Film Festival official site - The Sun Also Rises Entry Category:2007 films Category:Chinese films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Films based on Chinese novels Category:2000s fantasy drama films Category:Films scored by Joe Hisaishi Category:Films directed by Jiang Wen Category:Magic realism films Category:Chinese fantasy drama films Category:2007 drama films ","title":"The Sun Also Rises (2007 film)"},{"id":"10516182","text":"right Victor Technology LLC (also known as Victor Calculator) is a supplier of printing calculators, scientific calculators, financial calculators, basic calculators, and desktop accessories with headquarters in Bolingbrook, Illinois. Victor products are sold primarily throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico through independent office supply dealers.  Company history  Victor adding machine Victor Adding Machine Co. was a fledgling company in 1918 when the operator of a successful chain of meat markets gave a Victor salesman $100 for what he thought would buy an adding machine. Instead, he got 10 shares of the company's stock. In an effort to protect his investment, that man – Carl Buehler – became a director of Victor in September 1918 and was elected president of the company three months later. The first Victor adding machine, Model 110, was introduced in 1919. In 1921, Carl selected his 24-year-old son, A. C., as Vice President of Operations and advised him to operate the company by \\"working like the devil, but treat the employees right and allow them to make some money\\". Carl also believed in reinvesting most of the profits so the company could grow. A.C. assumed control of the company on the death of Carl Buehler in 1932. During World War II, Victor manufactured an aircraft compass, a B-24 bomber turret gunsight, and the Norden bombsight.https://www.victortech.com/about , History and see especially 1939, retrieved December 25, 2019. After the war, Victor had all the necessary elements for success in the adding machine industry – quality products, a good research department, an efficient factory, an effective sales organization, and a dedicated service department. Therefore, it was no surprise that by 1947 Victor had become the world's largest exclusive manufacturer of adding machines, and five years later topped the million mark in units sold. In 1953, Victor went into the cash register business, acquiring its long-time customer, the McCaskey Register Company. This purchase immediately contributed to sales and marked the beginning of a major expansion phase. A. C. began to evaluate the computer market during the 1950s. He decided that the market had potential, but that he would stay out of it until he could find or develop a product suitable for both large and small businesses. The solution came in 1961 when Victor merged with the Comptometer Corporation, which produced calculating machines and a telecommunication device called the Electrowriter. In 1965 Victor Comptometer Corporation produced the Victor 3900, a fully electronic calculator with multiple functions, three storage registers, and a small CRT display. The unit incorporated an early MOS integrated circuit for processing and storage. The unit was designed for desktop use, but was extremely large and heavy. Due to manufacturing difficulties, manufacturing was discontinued in 1967.Victor 3900 in oldcalculatormuseum.com, updated September 30, 2017, retrieved December 25, 2019. The newly formed Victor Comptometer maintained an aggressive stance towards product line expansion. In 1966, the cash register line, which had begun with a calculator on top of a cash drawer, was expanded to include the Hugin cash register. This Swedish-made product was distributed by Victor in the U.S. and Canada. By 1967, there were 75 basic models in the Victor line. After 1967, Victor began designing electronics into Victor products. In 1971, the 1800 series was introduced as the first full line of electronic calculators. In 1973, a revolutionary electronic dot-matrix printer was introduced and sold as an OEM product. In 1974, a series of programmable calculators were introduced and quickly captured a large segment of the banking and small-business market. In 1975, Victor began producing a series of electronic cash registers. Kidde, Inc. of Saddle Brook, New Jersey, acquired the company and renamed it Victor Business Machines in 1977. Under new ownership, Victor began to search for products for the office of the future. At the top of the list was to find a superior microcomputer product. Toward the end, Kidde made a deal with Chuck Peddle's Sirius Systems Technology, Inc. – a company recognized for manufacturing a technologically advanced, affordable desktop computer designed for the needs of small businesses, Sirius 1. It was an Intel 8088 based machine running MS-DOS and CP/M, but more powerful than IBM PC, released at the same time, regarding RAM, display, floppy disk, etc. They realized that the computer would fit perfectly into Victor's well-established network of 50 branches and 680 dealers. An arrangement was made for Victor to have exclusive domestic distribution rights for a three-year period. The computer was sold as the Victor 9000. Because of its advanced features and excellent marketing, the Sirius machine quickly became the number one selling microcomputer in Europe, when IBM waited with the promotion of the PC on that market. Realizing the value of Victor's distribution channels, Sirius set out to acquire the Victor Business Products division from Kidde, Inc. The acquisition was completed in November 1982 and the new company was called Victor Technologies, Inc. Four months later, Victor became a publicly owned company. The combination of rapid expansion of personnel, a large increase in the number of branch sales offices and sales that did not meet anticipated levels, caused the company to experience financial difficulties in 1983. In order to protect Victor Technologies, Inc. and at the same time find a way to meet its obligations to its creditors, Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings began in February 1984. As Victor sought to restructure and streamline its operations in the next year, the company continued to fill orders for both office and computer products. In August 1984, an agreement was made with Datatronic AB of Sweden to purchase 90% of Victor Technologies, Inc. Datatronic was a diversified corporation with interests that included business microcomputers, software development, finance and consumer products and publications. The purchase was finalized on February 5, 1985. Victor Technologies, Inc. had begun its resurgence as a strong contender in the office products and business computer fields. Victor redirected its marketing plan to place major emphasis on the calculator business in the United States and the computer business in Europe. During the next few years, both of these divisions grew and became quite successful. During this time period, Victor's parent company, Datatronic AB was sold to Proventus AB, a large Swedish investment company. They, in turn, sold the Victor Computer Division to Tandy Corporation in 1989. This sale left the successful Victor calculator business intact in the United States. The then current management team of Victor U.S.A. consisting of Dick Battalini, Marty Lent, and Joe Federman formed DMJCO, Inc., which then purchased the assets of Victor Technologies, Inc. in May 1991. Both Battalini and Lent had at that time over 25 years of experience with Victor in Sales and Marketing, and Federman, the then-President of Victor Technologies, Inc., had many years of experience in both public and corporate finance and corporate management. In 2006 the assets of DMJCO, Inc. were acquired by the existing management team of Jordan Feiger and John Ringlein and the company's name became Victor Technology LLC. In 2007 Victor Technology released the V12 financial calculator which competed with the long-established Hewlett Packard HP-12C financial calculator. The V12 operated on exactly the same keystrokes as the HP-12C, so it could be used interchangeably with no confusion. This was of great benefit as it allowed students a lower cost alternative to the HP-12C unit while still being able to follow along with group lessons in class. In 2008 Victor launched the PL8000 printing calculator. The PL8000 contained many industry firsts including an alphanumeric display, alphanumeric printer, Prompt Logic guides for the user, Loan Wizard, personalized text messages, reprint key, and HELP key. The PL8000 was also the fastest and quietest printing calculator available at that time. Also launched in 2008 were several models with anti-microbial protection and recycled plastic. In 2012 Victor launched the Midnight Black Collection of high-end desk accessories.https://www.victortech.com/about , see especially 2012, retrieved December 25, 2019. The collection has since expanded to include Pure White, Classic Silver, Mocha Brown, and Heritage Wood color variations. In 2014 Victor launched the High Rise Collection of standing desk converters.

Founded by Montreal writer Linda Leith, it is the world's first multilingual literary festival. In early 2011, Leith departed, and a new president and a new director of programming were hired. The festival is put on by Blue Metropolis Foundation, a not-for-profit organization established in 1997 to bring together people from different cultures, to share the pleasures of reading and writing, and to encourage creativity and intercultural understanding. The foundation also offers a wide range of educational and social programs year-round, both in classrooms and online. The purpose of these programs is to use reading and writing as therapeutic tools, to encourage academic perseverance, and to fight against poverty and social isolation. History Blue Metropolis was inspired by an earlier event. In 1996, three Montreal writers who were members of the Writer's Union of Canada (Linda Leith, Ann Charney, and Mary Soderstrom) organized a new literary event in partnership with the Union des écrivaines et des écrivains québécois (UNEQ). Called 'Write pour écrire', it brought writers and readers together from across the French-English language divide. In 1997, Leith went on to establish Blue Metropolis Foundation as uniquely 'created by writers and readers for writers and readers'. The first Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival took place April 19 to 23, 1999. Its programming, which took place in French or English or both, included the first Blue Metropolis Translation Slam and literacy/community writing activities, as well as readings, on-stage interviews, and panel discussions. With the support of writers, readers, and volunteers, the foundation was able to expand its scope beyond the festival and organize a wide range of educational programmes for young people, from the primary school to cégep levels. The name 'Blue Metropolis' was partially inspired by the philosophical essay 'On Being Blue', in which the American writer William H. Gass investigates the many different and contradictory connotations of the word 'blue'. In 2017, the festival added an LGBTQ-themed stream called Violet Metropolis, in conjunction with the city's existing Violet Hour reading series.Peter Knegt, \\"Canadian LGBTQ literature is having a moment, and this Montreal festival is showcasing that\\". CBC Arts, April 18, 2018. In 2018, the festival created the Blue Metropolis Violet Prize to honour Canadian LGBTQ writers.\\"Metropolis Violet : Écrivain(e)s LGBTQ à Metropolis bleu\\".

McLean County, Kentucky, is named in his honor. Early life Alney McLean was born to Ephraim and Elizabeth \\"Betsey\\" (Davidson) McLean in Burke County, North Carolina, on June 10, 1779.Kleber, p. 599 Alney McLean's father, Ephraim, a descendant of Clan Maclean of Isle of Mull, served as a captain at the Battle of Kings Mountain, and received a 600-acre land grant in what is now East Nashville, Nashville Tennessee in payment for his service. Along with Colonel Elijah Robertson, brother of James Robertson (explorer), Ephraim McLean represented what was then Nashville, North Carolina, to the North Carolina General Assembly in 1784,Connor, p. 586. making him one of the earliest officials in what would soon become the state of Tennessee. Alney McLean's mother, Elizabeth Davidson, was the first cousin of Brigadier General William Lee Davidson, who died fighting Cornwallis at the Battle of Cowan's Ford.Ewing, p. 88. McLean pursued preparatory studies,Congressional Biography likely at Davidson Academy (later Peabody College) where Ephraim was a trustee.Board of Trustees, p. 3 At age twenty McLean relocated to KentuckyRothert, p. 72 where he was appointed surveyor of Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. In this capacity, he laid out Greenville, Kentucky, the county seat, and was elected a trustee of that city when it was formed in 1799. On November 16, 1805, McLean married Tabitha Russell Campbell, daughter of Revolutionary War general William Campbell; the couple had ten children.Biographical Encyclopedia of Kentucky One of McLean's grandsons, William C. McLean, became an Associate Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court. McLean's nephews included John McLean (Illinois politician) and \\"Kentucky Longrifleman\\" Ephraim McLean Brank, who served with him under Lieutenant Colonel William Mitchusson at the Battle of New Orleans. Alney McLean's brother in law, Brigadier General Robert Ewing, was elected Justice of the Davidson County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions during the period of Andrew Jackson's service as an attorney in Nashville,Ely, p. 369. served as a delegate to the North Carolina Convention to ratify the U.S. Constitution and became Speaker of the Kentucky State Senate. Surviving correspondence appears to indicate the two had a close relationship. Other close relatives were Linn Boyd, 24th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; Rev. Finis Ewing, one of the founders of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church; and Illinois' fifth Governor William Lee D. Ewing. Political and military career Sign in front of the McCracken, Kentucky Courthouse (in Paducah, Kentucky) commemorating early members of the U.S. House of Representatives representing Jackson Purchase (U.S. historical region). The \\"First District\\" in the title actually changed over time. It refers to the Jackson Purchase, which was in the from 1819 to 1823, the until 1833, and then the until the end of the sign's lineage in 1855. McLean studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1805 and commenced practice in Greenville. He showed little interest in politics until at least 1808.Rothert, p. 71 He was first elected to office in 1812, representing Muhlenberg County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1812 to 1813. At the outset of the War of 1812, McLean organized a company of volunteers.Rothert, p. 70 Records show that the company was enlisted September 18, 1812. In 1813, he organized a company ultimately commanded by Lewis Kincheloe, then raised another company that he commanded personally under General Samuel Hopkins in his campaigns against the IndiansBiographical sketch of the Hon. Lazarus W. Powell and again under Lieutenant Colonel William Mitchusson at the Battle of New Orleans.Smith, p. 179. McLean, along with Kentucky Senator John Adair and others, later took offense to General Andrew Jackson's charge that Kentuckians \\"ingloriously fled\\" from fighting at New Orleans; he remained a political opponent of Jackson's for the remainder of his career. McLean was elected as a Republican to the Fourteenth Congress, serving from March 4, 1815, to March 3, 1817. He returned to Congress in 1819, serving in the Sixteenth Congress. After leaving Congress, he was appointed a circuit judge of the fourteenth district of Kentucky, a position he held until his death. As a presidential elector in 1824 and 1832, McLean twice cast his vote for Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. Some credit McLean with helping Clay, with whom he served in two separate Kentucky Congressional delegations, form the Whig Party (United States) in opposition to Jackson. Later life Around 1820, McLean and his son William discovered coal on the family farm near the now-defunct town of Paradise. However, at the time, wood was more plentiful and convenient, and the discovery was largely overlooked. In 1830, the McLeans mined some of the coal and sent it to Russellville, Kentucky, on ox wagons and via barges down the Green River to Owensboro, Kentucky, and Evansville, Indiana. The McLean mine was one of the first commercial mines in Muhlenberg County and was later valued above other mines in the county because of its transportation facilities.Rothert, pp. 389-390 McLean died of pneumonia near Greenville, Kentucky, in 1841 and was buried in Old Caney Station Cemetery, near Greenville, Kentucky. McLean County, Kentucky, was formed from Muhlenberg and other counties in 1854 and named in honor of Alney McLean.

The locomotive had two MAN diesel engines, giving a combined power output of and allowing the vehicle to reach a maximum speed of . It had a 1'BB'1 wheel arrangement and a driver's cab at only one end. Two units were ordered in 1937, but only one locomotive was delivered, in 1942. Numbered 601, it was the first diesel locomotive used by NSB. As first serving on the Bergen Line, although the locomotive was plagued with technical faults causing it to be out of service for shorter and longer periods. The locomotive was moved to the Dovre Line from 1952 and finally to the Gjøvik Line and Kongsvinger Line from 1957. The locomotive was retired and scrapped in 1959. History The Di 1 was the first class of diesel locomotives ordered by the Norwegian State Railways. Krupp had developed the diesel- hydraulic transmission system during the early 1930s, which at the time proved superior to the diesel-electric transmission system. NSB ordered two locomotives in 1937 to test out the new technology. However, the deliveries were delayed and in the end only one locomotive was delivered, in 1942. The locomotive was designed to be operated in pairs, and thus only received a cab at one end. As only one unit was delivered, the locomotive was in need of turntables to operate. The locomotive was numbered 601, allowing for ample additional steam locomotives to be delivered in the remaining, lower-numbered slots.Aspenberg (1999): 203 Di 1 at Finse Station in 1942 The locomotive was initially used on the Bergen Line. The advanced designed, combined with lack of suitable competence among NSB's staff and lack of spare parts, resulted in the locomotive seeing little revenue use. After a few years it was taken out of service and did not re-enter use until 1947, when the diesel shortage had diminished. A contributing factor was also the poor workmanship caused by the wartime industry. The locomotive was transferred from Oslo to Bergen District on 20 December 1945 and was used on the Bergen Line. During 1952 the locomotive started being used on the Dovre Line, and it was official transferred to Trondheim District on 20 October. The class was important for NSB to gain insights into operations and technical aspects of diesel operations.Aspenberg (1999): 205 This resulted in NSB taking delivery of the Di 2 class from 1954.Aspenberg (1999): 204 The units remained the most powerful diesel locomotives used by NSB until the delivery of the Di 4 in the 1980s. On 4 October 1957 the engine returned to Oslo District, this time to be used on the Gjøvik Line, and to a less extent the Kongsvinger Line. The locomotive was retired on 24 July 1959, and sold to Brødrene London as scrap, and has thus not been preserved.

Arvanid (), Arnavud (), plural: Arnavudlar (): modern Turkish: Arnavut, plural: Arnavutlar; are ethnoyms used mainly by Ottoman and contemporary Turks for Albanians with Arnavutça being called the Albanian language.\\"Arnavudca\\". Osmanlıcayazılışı. Retrieved 16 January 2016.. Etymology The original Greek ethnonym Άλβανίτης (approx. \\"Álbanítis\\"), derived from Άλβάνος (\\"Álbános\\"), became Άρβανίτης \\"Árvanítis\\" in Modern Greek. The pronounciation of \\"β\\" changed from /b/ in ancient Greek to /v/ in Byzantine Greek. This is reflected in the Turkish term, Arnavut or Arnaut, by ways of metathesis (-van- to -nav-).Malcolm, Noel. \\"Kosovo, a short history\\". London: Macmillan, 1998, p.29 \\"The name used in all these references is, allowing for linguistic variations, the same: 'Albanenses' or 'Arbanenses' in Latin, 'Albanoi' or 'Arbanitai' in Byzantine Greek. (The last of these, with an internal switching of consonants, gave rise to the Turkish form 'Arnavud', from which 'Arnaut' was later derived.)\\"Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia; Jeffrey E. Cole - 2011, Page 15, \\"Arbëreshë was the term self-designiation of Albanians before the Ottoman invasion of the 15 century; similar terms are used for Albanian origins populations living in Greece (\\"Arvanitika,\\" the Greek rendering of Arbëreshë) and Turkey (\\"Arnaut,\\" Turkish for the Greek term Arvanitika). A related Greek term is Arvanites. The Ottoman Turks borrowed their name for Albanians after hearing it from the Byzantine Greeks.Liakos, Antonis. (2012) Hellenisms: culture, identity, and ethnicity from antiquity to modernity. p. 230. \\"The term \\"Arvanite\\" is the medieval equivalent of \\"Albanian.\\" it is retained today for the descendants of the Albanian tribes that migrated to the Greek lands during a period covering two centuries, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth.\\" Usage =Ethnic marker= During the Ottoman era, the name was used for ethnic Albanians regardless of their religious affiliations, just like it is today. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, due to socio-political disturbances by some Albanians in the Balkans, the term was used as an ethnic marker for Albanians in addition to the usual millet religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records. While the term used in Ottoman sources for the country was Arnavudluk (آرناوودلق) for areas such as Albania, Western Macedonia, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, parts of northern Greece and southern Montenegro.. \\"This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (Arnavud) was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records. These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s.\\"; p.107. \\"In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article: that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman \\"Albania\\" or Arnavudluk (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical \\"justification\\" for the creation of a \\"Greater Albania\\" today.\\". \\"In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. In comparison with 'Serbs', who were not a meaningful category to the Ottoman state, its records refer to 'Albanians' more frequently than to many other cultural or linguistic groups. The term 'Arnavud' was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as 'Arnavudluk', and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters — a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits.\\". \\"Anscombe (ibid., 107 n. 3) notes that Ottoman \\"Albania\\" or Arnavudluk... included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia\\"; see also El2. s.v. \\"Arnawutluk. 6. History\\" (H. İnalcık) and Arsh, He Alvania. 31.33, 39-40. For the Byzantine period. see Psimouli, Souli. 28.\\" In modern Turkish Arnavutluk refers only to the Republic of Albania.. =Transfer to other languages= The term Arnā'ūṭ (الأرناؤوط) also entered the Arabic language as an exonym for Albanian communities that settled in the Levant during the Ottoman era onward, especially for those residing in Syria. The term Arnaut (Арнаут), plural: Arnauti (Арнаути) has also been borrowed into Balkan South Slavic languages like Bulgarian and within Serbian the term has also acquired pejorative connotations regarding Albanians.Murati 1991, p. 71. \\"emri etnik a nacional e shqiptarëve, përkundër trajtës së drejtë sllave Albanci, tash del të shqiptohet si Šiptari e Šipci me një konotacion përbuzës negativ, ashtu siç është përdorur në krye të herës te serbët edhe në kohën e Jugosllavisë së Vjetër bashkë dhe me formën Šiftari e Arnauti me po të njëtat konotacione pejorative. [ethnic name or the national one of Albanians, despite the right Slavic term Albanci, now appears to be pronounced as Šiptari of Šipci with a connotation that is contemptuously negative, as it is used in the very beginning of the Serbs era at the time of the old Yugoslavia together and the form Šiftari and Arnauti which have the same pejorative connotations.]\\". \\"Der ursprüngliche Name Άλβανίτης (abgeleitet von Άλβάνος) wurde im Neugriechischen zu Άρβανίτης… In türkischer Vermittlung erfuhr die Silbe -van- eine Metathese zu -nav-, so dass die türkische Form des Namens für die Albaner arnavut bzw. arnaut Lautet. In dieser Form gelangte das Wort ins Bulgarische (BER I/1971: 15). [The original name Άλβανίτης (derived from Άλβάνος) was established in Modern Greek to Άρβανίτης .... In Turkish the syllable was experienced and mediated as -van- and by metathesis to -nav- so that the Turkish form of the name for the Albanians became respectively Arnavut or Arnaut. In this form, the word came into Bulgarian (BER I / 1971: 15).]\\". \\"зову Арнаут, Арнаутка, па од тог назива доцније им потомци прозову се Арнаутовићи. [...] Арнаучићи зли, пакосни и убојити.\\" In Ukraine, Albanians who lived in Budzhak and who later also settled in the Azov Littoral of Zaporizhia Oblast are also known as Arnaut. The city of Odessa has two streets: Great Arnaut Street and Little Arnaut Street.Seven ethnographical miracles of Ukraine. Ukrayinska Pravda. May 13, 2014 =Albanian Ottoman soldiers= Historically used as an exonym, the Turkish term Arnaut has also been used for instance by some Western Europeans as a synonym for Albanians that were employed as soldiers in the Ottoman army.. \\"And a further complication is introduced by the term \\"Arnaut\\", which could he used as a synonym for \\"Albanian\\", hut tended to suggest those Albanians (in the ethnic- linguistic sense) who acted as soldiers for the Ottomans — though these included Catholic Albanians as well as Muslim ones. (When early reports refer to the local Ottoman forces, such as the force led by Mahmut Begolli [Mehmet Beyoğlu], pasha of Peja, they usually state that they consisted largely of Arnauts. Those Serb historians who claim that the terms Arnaut and Albanian did not mean ethnic Albanians, when applied to the supporters of Piccolomini, seem to have no difficulty in accepting that they did have that meaning, when applied to those fighting against him.)\\" In Romanian arnăut was used in a similar way, since at least the 18th century, for Albanian mercenaries dressed in traditional garb and hired either by the rulers of the Romanian principalities for their court guards, or by the boyars as bodyguards.

He was a billionaire whose fortune collapsed after he and his brothers William Herbert and Lamar Hunt tried to corner the world market in silver but were prevented by government intervention. He was also a thoroughbred horse breeder. Personal Hunt was born in El Dorado, Arkansas, but lived most of his life in Dallas, Texas. He was the son of Lyda Bunker and oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, who set up Placid Oil, once one of the biggest independent oil companies,\\"Oil Baron Nelson Bunker Hunt Dies\\" The Guardian October 22, 2014 He had six siblings: Margaret Hunt Hill (1915–2007), H. L. Hunt III (1917–2005), Caroline Rose Hunt (1923–2018), Lyda Bunker Hunt (born and died in 1925), William Herbert Hunt (born 1929), and Lamar Hunt (1932–2006). He was married to Caroline Lewis Hunt of Ruston, Louisiana for 63 years until his death, and they had four children together. In October 2014, Hunt died at the age of 88. He had cancer and dementia. Business career Hunt played a significant role in the discovery and development of the oil fields in Libya, the more established oil enterprises' stake of which were nationalized by Muammar Gaddafi in 1973. This nationalization later resulted in the House of Lords decision in BP Exploration Co (Libya) v Hunt (No 2) [1983] 2 AC 352. Hunt owned the Dallas-based Titan Resources Corporation, which is still involved in the exploration of oil in North Africa. He was chairman of Hunt Exploration and Mining Company (HEMCO). Silver manipulation Beginning in the early 1970s, Hunt and his brothers William Herbert and Lamar began accumulating large amounts of silver. By 1979, they had nearly cornered the global market. In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers profited by an estimated US$2-4 billion in silver speculation, with estimated silver holdings of . Primarily because of the Hunt brothers' accumulation of the precious metal, prices of silver futures contracts and silver bullion rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to $50 an ounce in January 1980. Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later. The largest single-day drop in the price of silver occurred on \\"Silver Thursday\\". In February 1985 the Hunt brothers were charged \\"with manipulating and attempting to manipulate the prices of silver futures contracts and silver bullion during 1979 and 1980\\" by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In September 1988 the Hunt brothers filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code largely due to lawsuits incurred as a result of their silver speculation. In 1989, in a settlement with the CFTC, Nelson Bunker Hunt was fined $10 million and banned from trading in the commodity markets as a result of civil charges of conspiring to manipulate the silver market. This fine was in addition to a multimillion-dollar settlement to pay back taxes, fines and interest to the Internal Revenue Service for the same period. His brother William Herbert Hunt made a similar settlement. Politics Nelson Bunker Hunt was active in conservative political causes and was a member of the Council of the John Birch Society. Hunt mentored Zahid Bashir, former spokesman and press secretary to the Pakistani Prime Minister, in oil trading. He was one of the main sponsors of the conservative organization Western Goals Foundation, founded in 1979 by General John K. Singlaub, journalist John Rees, and Democratic Congressman from Georgia Larry McDonald. During the mid-1980s, he contributed almost half a million U.S. dollars to The National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty (NEPL), a conservative fundraising organization later heavily implicated in the Iran–Contra affair. Hunt was past Chairman of the Board of the Bible Society of Texas and the past Chairman of, and significant contributor to Campus Crusade for Christ International's \\"Here's Life\\" Campaign (1976–1980), as well as providing a $3.5 million loan guarantee for the 1979 Campus Crusade film Jesus. Thoroughbred horse racing In 1955, Hunt bought his first thoroughbreds and by the 1970s his breeding program had become one of the world's largest and most productive. Winner of the U.S. Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in 1976, 1985, and 1987, he owned the Bluegrass Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and raced thoroughbreds in Europe and North America. Among his horses, Hunt bred or raced Vaguely Noble, Dahlia, Empery, Youth, Exceller, Trillion, Glorious Song, Dahar and Estrapade. In 1973 and 1974, Hunt was the British flat racing Champion Owner and in 1976 won The Derby with Empery. The United States National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) awarded Hunt the title of \\"legendary owner-breeder\\". Overall, Hunt bred 158 stakes winners and either bred or owned 25 champions. Hunt's bankruptcy forced him to liquidate his thoroughbred operations. A 1988 dispersal sale of 580 horses at Keeneland Sales brought in $46,911,800, at that time the highest amount in the history of thoroughbred auctions. In 1999, he returned to thoroughbred ownership, spending a total of $2,075,000 on 51 juveniles and yearlings.

The WPS standard defines how a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clients’ discovery of and binding to those processes. The data required by the WPS can be delivered across a network or they can be available at the server. WPS can describe any calculation (i.e. process) including all of its inputs and outputs, and trigger its execution as a web service. WPS supports simultaneous exposure of processes via HTTP GET, HTTP POST, and SOAP, thus allowing the client to choose the most appropriate interface mechanism. The specific processes served up by a WPS implementation are defined by the owner of that implementation. Although WPS was designed to work with spatially referenced data, it can be used with any kind of data. WPS makes it possible to publish, find, and bind to processes in a standardized and thus interoperable fashion. Theoretically, it is transport/platform neutral (like SOAP), but in practice it has only been specified for HTTP. Operations WPS defines three operations: # GetCapabilities returns service-level metadata # DescribeProcess returns a description of a process including its inputs and outputs # Execute returns the output(s) of a process WPS operations are invoked by submitting XML or URL-encoded requests to an Online Resource URL. When requesting an Execute operation the HTTP request identifies the inputs, the name of process to be executed, and the form of output to be provided. Properties WPS has the following properties: # Inputs can be web-accessible URLs or embedded in the request. # Outputs can be stored as web-accessible URLs or embedded in the response. # For a single output such as a GIF image, WPS can return the output directly, without any XML wrapper. # It supports multiple input and output formats. # It supports long-running processes. # It supports SOAP and WSDL. A WPS is usually not invoked directly. More often, it is invoked by a client application that provides the user with interactive controls. This client application may or may not be web-based.

This was the first Tintin story to be adapted into a movie and follows the story of the comic almost exactly. There were only two theatrical screenings of the film; the first at the ABC Cinema on 11 January 1947 for a group of special invited guests, while the other one was shown in public on December 21 of that year, before Bouchery declared bankruptcy and fled to Argentina. All of the equipment was seized and a copy of the film is currently stored at Belgium's Cinémathèque Royale. The copy is available to watch for paying members of the Tintin club.  Plot  Tintin finds himself involved in a mystery of a drowned man, a regular tin of crab meat, and the name of a ship called the Karaboudjan scribbled on a piece of paper inside of the man's pockets. Upon investigating the ship, Tintin discovers that the shipment of tin cans contains not crab meat, but drugs. After learning about the ship's shady business, Tintin ends up becoming prisoner on the ship which already cast off from the port. The only way for Tintin to escape is by heading for dry land by lifeboat, and the only person to aid him is the ship's whisky guzzling Captain named Haddock who is the only one on board not aware that his crew is trafficking drugs right under his nose.

It is useful for analysing time series that appear to be long-memory processes (diverging correlation time, e.g. power-law decaying autocorrelation function) or 1/f noise. The obtained exponent is similar to the Hurst exponent, except that DFA may also be applied to signals whose underlying statistics (such as mean and variance) or dynamics are non- stationary (changing with time). It is related to measures based upon spectral techniques such as autocorrelation and Fourier transform. Peng et al. introduced DFA in 1994 in a paper that has been cited over 3,000 times as of 2020 and represents an extension of the (ordinary) fluctuation analysis (FA), which is affected by non-stationarities. Calculation Given a bounded time series x_t of length N, where t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, integration or summation first converts this into an unbounded process X_t: :X_t=\\\\sum_{i=1}^t (x_i-\\\\langle x\\\\rangle) where \\\\langle x\\\\rangle denotes the mean value of the time series. X_t is called cumulative sum or profile. This process converts, for example, an i.i.d. white noise process into a random walk. Next, X_t is divided into time windows of length n samples each, and a local least squares straight-line fit (the local trend) is calculated by minimising the squared errors within each time window. Let Y_t indicate the resulting piecewise sequence of straight-line fits. Then, the root-mean-square deviation from the trend, the fluctuation, is calculated: :F( n ) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t = 1}^N \\\\left( X_t - Y_t \\\\right)^2}. Finally, this process of detrending followed by fluctuation measurement is repeated over a range of different window sizes n, and a log-log graph of F(n) against n is constructed. A straight line on this log-log graph indicates statistical self-affinity expressed as F(n) \\\\propto n^{\\\\alpha}. The scaling exponent \\\\alpha is calculated as the slope of a straight line fit to the log-log graph of n against F(n) using least-squares. This exponent is a generalization of the Hurst exponent. Because the expected displacement in an uncorrelated random walk of length N grows like \\\\sqrt{N}, an exponent of \\\\tfrac{1}{2} would correspond to uncorrelated white noise. When the exponent is between 0 and 1, the result is fractional Gaussian noise, with the precise value giving information about the series self-correlations: * \\\\alpha<1/2: anti-correlated * \\\\alpha \\\\simeq 1/2: uncorrelated, white noise * \\\\alpha>1/2: correlated * \\\\alpha\\\\simeq 1: 1/f-noise, pink noise * \\\\alpha>1: non-stationary, unbounded * \\\\alpha\\\\simeq 3/2: Brownian noise Trends of higher order can be removed by higher order DFA, where a linear fit is replaced by a polynomial fit. In the described case, linear fits (i=1) are applied to the profile, thus it is called DFA1. To remove trends of higher order, DFAi, uses polynomial fits of order i. Due to the summation (integration) from x_i to X_t, linear trends in the mean of the profile represent constant trends in the initial sequence, and DFA1 only removes such constant trends (steps) in the x_i. In general DFA of order i removes (polynomial) trends of order i-1. For linear trends in the mean of x_i at least DFA2 is needed. The Hurst R/S analysis removes constant trends in the original sequence and thus, in its detrending it is equivalent to DFA1. The DFA method was applied to many systems; e.g., DNA sequences, neuronal oscillations, speech pathology detection, and heartbeat fluctuation in different sleep stages. Effect of trends on DFA were studied in and relation to the power spectrum method is presented in. Since in the fluctuation function F(n) the square (root) is used, DFA measures the scaling-behavior of the second moment-fluctuations, this means \\\\alpha=\\\\alpha(2). The multifractal generalization (MF-DFA) uses a variable moment q and provides \\\\alpha(q). Kantelhardt et al. intended this scaling exponent as a generalization of the classical Hurst exponent. The classical Hurst exponent corresponds to the second moment for stationary cases H=\\\\alpha(2) and to the second moment minus 1 for nonstationary cases H=\\\\alpha(2)-1. Relations to other methods In the case of power-law decaying auto-correlations, the correlation function decays with an exponent \\\\gamma: C(L)\\\\sim L^{-\\\\gamma}\\\\\\\\!\\\\ . In addition the power spectrum decays as P(f)\\\\sim f^{-\\\\beta}\\\\\\\\!\\\\ . The three exponent are related by: * \\\\gamma=2-2\\\\alpha * \\\\beta=2\\\\alpha-1 and * \\\\gamma=1-\\\\beta. The relations can be derived using the Wiener–Khinchin theorem. Thus, \\\\alpha is tied to the slope of the power spectrum \\\\beta and is used to describe the color of noise by this relationship: \\\\alpha = (\\\\beta+1)/2. For fractional Gaussian noise (FGN), we have \\\\beta \\\\in [-1,1] , and thus \\\\alpha = [0,1], and \\\\beta = 2H-1, where H is the Hurst exponent. \\\\alpha for FGN is equal to H. For fractional Brownian motion (FBM), we have \\\\beta \\\\in [1,3] , and thus \\\\alpha = [1,2], and \\\\beta = 2H+1, where H is the Hurst exponent. \\\\alpha for FBM is equal to H+1. In this context, FBM is the cumulative sum or the integral of FGN, thus, the exponents of their power spectra differ by 2. Pitfalls in interpretation As with most methods that depend upon line fitting, it is always possible to find a number \\\\alpha by the DFA method, but this does not necessarily imply that the time series is self-similar. Self-similarity requires that the points on the log-log graph are sufficiently collinear across a very wide range of window sizes L. Furthermore, a combination of techniques including MLE, rather than least-squares has been shown to better approximate the scaling, or power-law, exponent. Also, there are many scaling exponent-like quantities that can be measured for a self-similar time series, including the divider dimension and Hurst exponent. Therefore, the DFA scaling exponent \\\\alpha is not a fractal dimension sharing all the desirable properties of the Hausdorff dimension, for example, although in certain special cases it can be shown to be related to the box-counting dimension for the graph of a time series. Multifractality and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis It isn't always the case that the scaling exponents are independent of the scale of the system. In the case \\\\alpha depends on the power q extracted from :F_q( n ) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t = 1}^N \\\\left( X_t - Y_t \\\\right)^q\\\\right)^{1/q}, where the previous DFA is q=2. Multifractal systems scale as a function F_q(n) \\\\propto n^{\\\\alpha(q)}. To uncover multifractality, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis is one possible method .

Early life  Watson attended Marist Brothers Parramatta in Sydney's western suburbs, representing the school in cricket, rugby league, athletics and swimming. (See Parramatta Marist High School) Between 1986 and 1992, Watson was employed by Coca-Cola, moving through the ranks of marketing and sales. From 1992 to 1998 Watson was with Pepsi Cola, working with athletes, creating sports sponsorship and he was also responsible for sports and event marketing. He joined Kellogg's in 1998 after working for 12 years within the 'Cola Wars'. He was responsible for re- engineering sports properties and helping Kellogg's deliver their business plan for the first time in 19 years.  New Zealand Warriors  In November 2000, Watson was appointed chief executive officer of the New Zealand Warriors, shortly after chairman Eric Watson purchased the New Zealand licence to compete in the National Rugby League. Watson was involved with the club when they made the finals series of the NRL for 3 consecutive years (2001, 2002 and 2003). Under his leadership the club secured its first title, winning the J.J. Giltinan Shield for the minor premiership in 2002. The same year the Warriors made its NRL Grand Final for the first time. Watson resigned from the Warriors at the end of the 2005 season. Warriors' majority shareholder Eric Watson said Watson had played a huge role in rebuilding the club. \\"When we had problems in 2004, Mick had to remove himself from Cullen Sports projects and come back into the rugby league business,\\" he said. During Watson's time at the Warriors, the club reached the NRL finals for the first time in their history (2001), repeated the feat the next two seasons and, in 2002, also won the minor premiership and made the grand final for the first time but in the past two years he has fallen out with leading media outlets for periods.  Boxing  Watson created the Cullen Sports boxing division which includes New Zealand Heavyweight Shane Cameron (former IBF Australasian, IBF Pan Pacific). In 2007 Watson and former Rugby League star Monty Betham formed WAAAM Boxing and created Dodge Fight Night. A professional Boxing event that was broadcast live on TVNZ in New Zealand and delayed to Australia and Samoa. WAAAM Boxing promoted Anthony Mundine, Steven Heremia, Tyrone Brunson, Peter Kariuki and Mohammed Azzaiouii. =Other work= During his tenure as CEO Cullen Sports, Watson wrote and created Prime's first NZ produced product – The Tem Show, starring Temuera Morrison. He also conceptualised and produced 'Controversy Corner', a weekly panel style radio program that aired weekly on Radio Sport. Watson was appointed ambassador for Auckland Cancer Society in 2001 and 2002. In his role he helped launch the inaugural Relay for Life fundraising event. It has been stated that The Tem Show could be renewed for a second season nearly a decade on, however Temuera Morrison has dismissed this speculation to date. Views on Immigration In an interview with the New Zealand Listener, Watson railed against Asian immigration into Australia. He said \\"as an Australian living here [New Zealand] and with the full intention of staying here, [I say] beware immigration. Just look towards Australia [and what has happened there since] opening the floodgates to South-east Asia. Look at the growing population … of crime, cultures that refuse to accept your culture.\\" Watson, according to the Listener, felt that Asian immigrants had 'ruined' Sydney, and would hate the same to happen to Auckland.

Six units were built by Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK) of Kiel, Germany, and the remaining by Thune in Oslo. The locomotives were used for shunting and for local and light freight trains throughout NSBs network. Based on MaK's 575C design, the locomotives were long and had a C wheel arrangement. The first six units were built by MaK and were delivered between 1954 and 1957. Thune delivered its first two units in 1958, with a MaK prime mover. These eight had a power output of . All later production was carried out by Thune using prime movers from Bergen Mekaniske Verksted, with a power output of . Further series consisted of fifteen units in 1962, sixteen in 1963–64, nine in 1970 and six in 1973. One unit was upgraded with a Caterpillar prime mover and a new cab in 1997, and designated Skd 225. It remained in use until 2012, while the last of the other units were retired in the 2000s. Four locomotives have been preserved at heritage railways. History NSB's first diesel locomotive was the Krupp-built Di 1, delivered in 1942. It had a poor operational record, being plagued with technical faults.Aspenberg (1999): 203 Based on the experiences with the locomotives, NSB started in the 1950s to look into additional diesel-hydraulic locomotives for its un-electrified lines.Aspenberg (1999): 205 NSB chose to test out the MaK 800D with a power output of and a D wheel arrangement. Although satisfied with the performance, NSB felt the locomotive was too powerful and instead opted for the smaller 575C.Aspenberg (1999): 204 The 575C design had been delivered with two units to the Nynäs Line in Sweden in 1951. NSB's class was designated Di 2 and the three first locomotives, numbered 801 through 803, were delivered in 1954. Thune-built 2.833 in the original green color scheme at the Norwegian Railway Museum The second batch of locomotives consisted of three more units built by MaK, numbered 806 through 808, and delivered in 1957. The following year NSB took delivery of two units from Thune, numbered 804 and 805. All following production would be made by Thune, with prime movers from Bergen Mekaniske Verksted. The first fifteen of these were no. 808–823, delivered in 1962, followed by sixteen units, no. 824–839, in 1963 and 1964. Another series, the nine units numbered 840–848 was delivered in 1970 and the final series, the six units numbered 849–854, was delivered in 1973. The main task of the Di 2 was heavy shunting and short-haul freight trains. From 1960 some units were stationed in Bergen and used for shunting at Voss Station and Ål Station. Three locomotives, no. 805, 808 and 817, have been prominently featured in Olsenbanden films. Two locomotives, 827 and 829, were repainted and used for the Semsame Train in the children television series Sesam stasjon. Retirement started during the 1990s. As of 1999 there were fifteen remaining units in use, including all of the 1973 batch, and the oldest from the 1963–64 batch. Di 2 854 was in 1997 rebuilt in the Netherlands with a new Caterpillar engine and driver's cab, receiving the new designation Skd 225. Four locomotives have been preserved by Bergen Technical Museum (817), the Norwegian Railway Club (827), the Norwegian Railway Museum (833) and the Setesdal Line (843). Specifications Di 2 hauling a train over Skansen Bridge just south of Trondheim Central Station in 2000 Common for all series is an overall length of and a C wheel arrangement. The class was wide and tall. The locos had a maximum permitted speed of on main line service and during shunting. The MaK six-cylinder prime movers gave a power output of , the first three being of the MS 30 A model and the second five of the MS 301 A model. This gave 740 and 750 revolutions per minute, respectively. The Bergen prime movers were slightly more powerful, giving a power output of . The MaK units weighed , while the Thune units weighed . Gradual changes to the design were made as production advanced. The 1962 series saw the introduction of the heavier Bergen engines and new cabs, increasing the axle load from 15 to 16.5 tonnes. The 1963–64 series saw improvements to the dead man's switch and the cooling system. The 1970 series introduced a sideways flexible mid-axle. At first the Di 2 engines were painted green, but later when NSB chose to paint its entire fleet red, the Di 2 engines were also converted to red. In the 1980s the Di 2 units were painted the distinct red and yellow shunter colors of NSB.

Other cross streets include Martin Place, Bridge Street, and Bent Street. It is the hotspot of Sydney's legal elite. History Phillip Street initially ran from Hyde Park in the south and original Government House at Bent Street in the north. After the governor's residence moved to the present Government House and the old residence was demolished in 1846, the street was extended north to Circular Quay. Presumably, it was named after Captain Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales. In the 1860s the section of Phillip Street between Bent and Hunter Streets was realigned, to connect the northern section of Phillip Street with Elizabeth Street, rather than the southern section of Phillip Street.Visit Sydney Australia - Phillip Street Heritage Walk This junction is now Chifley Square. Phillip Street was the residence of Henry Lawson when he first moved to Sydney in 1883. He joined his mother and sister at number 138, and was still living here when his first poem, A Song of the Republic, was published by The Bulletin on 1 October 1887.

Character history Emma arrived in Hollyoaks as a replacement to Dale Jackson and to help Will Davies with the serial killings in Hollyoaks. On her first appearance in the show, Emma was seduced by fireman Ben Davies (Will's son) as the pair met at The Loft. Her one-night stand with Ben was to prove costly as she discovered that she became pregnant and eventually confronted Ben with the truth. However, Ben was engaged with Izzy Cornwell and refused to stand by Emma’s unborn child. Emma managed to keep the identity of her child's father a secret until a blast from Emma’s past returned. Will’s ex-wife and Ben’s mother Alison Davies turned up in Hollyoaks and revealed the truth between Emma and the Davies clan. A long time ago, Emma had an affair with Will, which was the reason Will’s marriage to Alison broke down. Soon, Ben discovered the truth about Emma’s past and the link with his father. Ben’s fiancée Izzy also discovered on her wedding day that Ben was the father of Emma’s unborn child. Despite Emma wanting to have a future with Ben, Ben went ahead and married Izzy. Shortly after, Emma gave birth to a son and named him Arthur Stanley Davies. Ben then had a change of mind and decided that he did want to be part of Arthur’s life. However, this change of heart did not last long. At Arthur's christening, Alison tried to obliterate Emma from Arthur's baptism pictures by requesting Emma to all of the take pictures so that Emma herself would not be featured in any of them; each time Emma took a picture, Alison taunted her by continually proclaiming \\"let's have another picture of baby and father\\". When Will asked Alison if Emma would be featured in any of the pictures, Alison arrogantly replied: \\"as long as I have any say in the matter, no!\\". Alison continued with this, ignoring Will's warning that her behaviour made her no better than Emma and that she risked Arthur coming to resent her for her actions in later life. Unbeknown to Alison, however, Emma was moving the camera towards the floor each time she took the pictures, so that none of the Davies family or Arthur himself were featured either; this incident brought Emma's feud with Alison to a head, as at the party after the baptism service when Emma admitted to Alison that she had sabotaged the photographs, the two got into a vicious brawl, and had to be separated by Johnno Dean and Les Hunter. Eventually, Ben’s marriage with Izzy broke down after Izzy couldn’t cope with Ben having so much to do with Arthur, and this subsequently resulted in Ben wanting nothing to do with Arthur, as he blamed Arthur for causing his marriage with Izzy to collapse. Emma then decided it was best to move away and start over. In October 2004, Emma left Ben and Hollyoaks behind her, taking Arthur with her. They briefly returned six months later in the late night special Hollyoaks: Let Loose when Ben decided to file for full custody of Arthur after a chance meeting led to Ben spending time with Arthur, and he decided the time had come to heal the rift with his son, but then Ben's then- girlfriend Lisa Hunter decided she did not want to be a mother figure to Arthur and pressurised Ben into sending Emma and Arthur away again; Ben decided that after losing Izzy he could not risk losing Lisa as well because of Arthur, and he asked Emma and Arthur to leave, although he agreed to stay in touch with Arthur this time. Neither Emma nor Arthur have been heard from since.

She is published by Headline Review and by Salt. The Hours of the Night was the controversial winner of the Romantic Novel of the Year award in 1997. The Mysteries of Glass was long listed for the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2005.  Biography  =Personal life= Sue Gee's parents met and married in India in 1946 and returned to Britain in 1947, with the coming of independence to India. She and her brother David grew up on a Devon farm and in a Leicestershire village, before the family moved to Surrey in 1957. She lived for 27 years with the environmental journalist Marek Mayer: they married in 2003, two years before his death. Their son is Jamie Mayer. Sue Gee lives in London and Herefordshire. =Background and career= She was educated at the University of London, Goldsmiths College and at Middlesex University, where between 2000 and 2008 she was programme leader on the MA Creative Writing course and established The North London Literary Festival. She currently teaches at the Faber Academy, and is a mentor on the Write to Life programme at Freedom from Torture. Her first novel, Spring Will Be Ours, was inspired by Marek Mayer's Polish background. It delineates the period 1939-1981 - from the Invasion of Poland (1939) at the start of World War II to the period of Solidarity and martial law (1981-1983). Its title comes from graffiti scrawled on the walls of Warsaw in 1981: Winter is yours, but spring will be ours. Later novels are both historical and contemporary. The success of her novel The Hours of the Night in 1995 attracted criticism from Barbara Cartland and others because it included a love affair between a gay couple. She is also the author of many short stories, and of a Radio 4 drama, Ancient & Modern, broadcast in 2004 with Juliet Stevenson in the lead role.

The club won two Libyan Premier League titles in a successful period in the late 1990s. The club finished 2nd in 1997, and followed this with two back-to-back titles, in seasons 1997–98 and 1998–99. The club's home strip is orange, and the away strip is black. Glory Years: Late 1990s During the late 1990s, Almahalla started to build a strong team. They got considerably stronger as the decade, and obtained a mid-table finish in the 1996–97 season. Just one season later, the club, barely 20 years old, and recently promoted, won the title, giving them a place in the 1999 CAF Champions League. They defeated the Chadian champions AS Coton Chad 3–2 in the preliminary round, losing the first leg away in N'Djamena 2–0 on January 31, 1999. However, two weeks later, they won 3–0 in the second leg in Tripoli to set up a First Round tie with eventual finalists ES Tunis. The first leg at the 11 June Stadium was a tense affair, with the Tunisian side winning 2–1. Two weeks later they lost 2–0 at Stade El Menzah, as they bowed out of the competition 4–1 on aggregate. However, the 1998–99 season proved to be just as fruitful domestically. Al Mahallah won the league title again, and thus secured qualification to the 2000 CAF Cup, where they met the Egyptian club and eventual runners-up Ismaily. Ismaily ran out 5–1 victors at the Ismailia Stadium, but Al Mahallah salvaged pride in the second leg, as they won 3–2. This was Ismaily's only defeat in the competition. Almahalla participated in the CAF Cup again in the 2001 edition of the competition, where they met the Senegalese outfit ASEC Ndiambour. Mahallah won the first leg 2–1, but later lost 2–0 in Louga, going out 3–2 on aggregate. Relegation and Stagnation The club was relegated from the Libyan Premier League in the 2001–02 season, and has failed to come anywhere near that level since. The club was even relegated to the Libyan Third Division, and has only recently returned to the second tier. In the 2006–07 season, their first back in the Second Division, the club finished 9th in Group A, avoiding relegation by 6 points; last season, they made a great improvement, and finished 5th in Group B. They have made a great start to this season's competition, winning five of their first 6 matches. As of the end of Round 7, they sit top of Group A, with 19 points from 7 games.

Career Born in Boston, Lincolnshire, he first played for his local side Boston Excelsior, then Boston Town. He impressed in a home match for Boston Town against Royal Arsenal on Good Friday in 1889, and Arsenal then arranged a job for him at the Royal Arsenal factory so that he could play for their team. He played in Arsenal's very first FA Cup tie, against Lyndhurst on 5 October 1889, and soon earned a reputation as a determined and tough-tackling wing-half. He became club captain in 1890, and was still captain when Arsenal turned professional in 1891. However, he was replaced as Arsenal captain in October 1891 by new arrival Sandy Robertson (who had previously played for Preston North End's 1888–89 Double-winning side), and although assured of a place in the first team, he decided to step down to the reserves. In the summer of 1892, he moved to Luton Town, to become the club's captain and coach. He played 4 FA Cup ties and 71 other senior matches for Woolwich Arsenal. After two years at Luton, he joined Tottenham Hotspur (thus making him the first person to play for both Spurs and Arsenal, albeit long before the latter moved to north London in 1913), and played in Spurs' very first FA Cup tie, a first qualifying match against West Hertfordshire, on 13 October 1894; Spurs won 3–2. He left Tottenham in 1895, and finished his career at Dartford. He later opened a sports shop in Plumstead and became the first British ladies team coach in 1895. Julian remained loyal to Woolwich Arsenal, going back to work for the club during the Boer War. Julian retained his footballing ties after retiring from playing, and in 1909 he moved to the Netherlands to coach there, later followed by his sons Bill jr. and Harry, who both coached a number of teams in the Netherlands. Julian acted as head coach of HFC from 1909 until the 31st of December 1912. He stayed with HFC but from then on he was assistant-coach / groundsman / caretaker before he returned to England in 1915 to live in Enfield, London. He was one of the longest-surviving members of Arsenal's first professional side, along with Gavin Crawford and Jack McBean. The three were reunited at an Arsenal game against Chelsea on 20 March 1948 (by which time Arsenal were one of the leading sides in English football), an event recorded in The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal. He lived until the age of 89, dying in Enfield in 1957, outliving both Crawford and McBean to make him the last surviving member of Arsenal's first professional team. Personal life Julian married Edith Emerson in July 1888. They had three sons and a daughter. He died in Enfield in 1957.

Nesbit. First published in 1899, it tells the story of Dora, Oswald, Dicky, Alice, Noel, and Horace Octavius (H. O.) Bastable, and their attempts to assist their widowed father and recover the fortunes of their family; its sequels are The Wouldbegoods (1901) and The New Treasure Seekers (1904). The novel's complete name is The Story of the Treasure Seekers: Being the Adventures of the Bastable Children in Search of a Fortune. The original edition included illustrations by H. R. Millar. The Puffin edition (1958) was illustrated by Cecil Leslie. The story is told from a child's point of view. The narrator is Oswald, but on the first page he announces: \\"It is one of us that tells this story – but I shall not tell you which: only at the very end perhaps I will. While the story is going on you may be trying to guess, only I bet you don't.\\" However, his occasional lapse into first person, and the undue praise he likes to heap on himself, makes his identity obvious to the attentive reader long before he reveals it himself.  Publication  The Bastables stories from The Story of the Treasure Seekers were first published between 1894 and October 1899 in an assortment of periodicals: Nister's Holiday Annual, the Illustrated London News and its supplement Father Christmas, The Pall Mall Magazine, and the Windsor Magazine.Nelson, Claudia. \\"Note on the Texts.\\" Introduction to The Story of the Treasure Seekers and The Wouldbegoods. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013. The order in which the chapters appeared was changed for the one-volume publication in 1899. Some of them also underwent extensive rewriting. Influence on other literature The Story of the Treasure Seekers was the first novel for children by Nesbit; it and her later novels exerted considerable influence on subsequent English children's literature, most notably Arthur Ransome's books and C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis notes in the first chapter of The Magician's Nephew that the portion of the action of that book that takes place in this world happens at the same time as that of the Treasure Seekers. The American writer Edward Eager was also influenced by this and other Nesbit books, most notably in his Half Magic series, where he mentions the Bastable children and other Nesbit characters as heroes of his characters. Nesbit's influence on other British and American children's literature rests largely on the following motifs: her protagonists are a set or sets of siblings from a separated or incomplete family who must (or prefer to) amuse themselves alone while on holiday. Through magic or complex imaginative play, the children face perils that they overcome through pluck.Graham, Eleanor. \\"E. Nesbit and the Bastables.\\" Introduction to The Story of the Treasure Seekers. Penguin Books: Harmondsworth, 1971. Another notable feature is the depiction of the realistic quarrels and faults of the children. J. K. Rowling, writer of the Harry Potter series, ranked Nesbit as one of her favourite authors, and The Story of the Treasure Seekers as her favourite of Nesbit's books. British writer Michael Moorcock later used the character, or at least the name, of Oswald Bastable for the hero and first- person narrator of his trilogy A Nomad of the Time Streams, published from 1971 until 1981, an influence on the nascent genre of steampunk.  TV adaptations  The book has been made into TV series three times, in 1953, 1961, and 1982. It was made into a television movie as The Treasure Seekers in 1996.

Its main goal is to simplify the collaboration between programmers and designers. This is achieved by embedding TAL statements inside valid HTML (or XML) tags which can then be worked on using common design tools. TAL was created for Zope but is used in other Python-based projects as well.  Attributes  The following attributes are used, normally prefixed by \\"\`tal:\`\\": ; define : creates local variables, valid in the element bearing the attribute (including contained elements) ; condition : decides whether or not to render the tag (and all contained text) ; repeat : creates a loop variable and repeats the tag iterating a sequence, e.g. for creating a selection list or a table ; content : replaces the content of the tag ; replace : replaces the tag (and therefore is not usable together with content or attributes) ; attributes : replaces the given attributes (e. g. by using \`tal:attributes=\\"name name; id name\\"\` the name and id attributes of an input field could be set to the value of the variable \\"\`name\`\\") ; omit- tag : allows to omit the start and end tag and only render the content if the given expression is true. ; on-error : if an error occurs, this attribute works like the content tag. If a tag has more than one TAL attributes, they are evaluated in the above (fairly logical) order. In cases when no tag is present which lends itself to take the attributes, special TAL tags can be used, making the \\"\`tal:\`\\" prefix optional. e.g.: ... would cause the code inside the \`tal:if\` tags to be used whenever the context (whatever the application server defines the context to be, e.g. an object) contains variable \\"\`itemlist\`\\" with a true value, e.g. a list containing at least one element. The identifier following the colon is arbitrary; it simply needs to be there, and to be the same for the opening and closing tag.  METAL  The Macro Expansion Template Attribute Language (METAL) complements TAL, providing macros which allow the reuse of code across template files. Both were created for Zope but are used in other Python projects as well. METAL complements TAL with the ability to reuse code. It allows the developer to define and use macros, which in turn may have slots; when using a macro, variational content can be specified for a slot. When generating XML documents, the XML namespace must be specified (\`xmlns:metal=\\"http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/metal\\"\`). = METAL Attributes = The following attributes are recognised, normally requiring a „\`metal:\`“ prefix: ; define-macro : creates a macro ; define-slot : creates a slot inside a macro ; use-macro : uses a macro (normally given via a TALES path expression) ; fill-slot : when using a macro, replaces the default content of the given slot ; extend-macro : since Zope v3: extends a macro, comparable to subclassing, by redefining of slots Normally, just one of those is used at a time. In cases when no tag is present which lends itself to take the attributes, and in special cases when more than one METAL attribute is needed, special METAL tags can be used, making the „metal:“ prefix optional. E. g. (sketched with Roundup in mind): ... ... ...

Career The band was formed after Spendlove and Brown met at music college in 1999. After college they continued to play together and drafted in school friends Smith and Townsend. In 2003 considerable interest in the band resulted in an influx of A&R; men to Gawthorpe and a signing to Domino Records. Three singles, an EP and an album followed, and the band embarked on a tour of Europe and the United States, recording in Mississippi with record producer, Dennis Herring. In 2005 a change of direction saw Smith and Townsend leave the band and, later that year, the remaining two founder members brought in the Russian former tennis professional Andrei Nosov on guitar and Welsh student Tom Bailey on five- string bass guitar to replace them. The new members brought with them a range of new influences including native Siberian music and dance-inspired indie. The band spent much of 2006 writing new material and showcasing it to fans across the country. In the summer their 2003 single \\"Change My Mind\\" was featured on a television advertisement for Lynx shower gel. It generated considerable interest in the single, leading it to be re-released. Despite the interest from fans, the band's record label did not push the single and it received limited airplay. Finding themselves unable to market the band, and choosing to concentrate on their more commercial signings, Domino Records parted company with The Blueskins, leaving them on the lookout for a new label. The band spent the latter months of 2006 touring their new songs and writing new material. At the end of the year they played a small gig in their local pub in Gawthorpe, inviting friends to take to the stage and perform with them. After writing new tunes and touring the UK for two years with the new line-up, they decided to disband in April 2008. Following the split, Ryan Spendlove, The singer and frontman of The Blueskins decided to go solo and formed his own style of acoustic Blues/Folk.

The ship had a particularly active operational role during World War II, being awarded 11 battle honours, and was known as \\"The hardest worked destroyer in the Fleet\\". She was the first ship to sink a German U-boat, took part in the Norwegian Campaign, served with Force H in the Mediterranean on the Malta Convoys, escorted convoys to Russia and across the Atlantic, and saw action during the invasions of Sicily, Italy and Normandy, and was at the liberation of the Channel Islands. She was then decommissioned and sold for scrap in late 1945. Design and description As the flotilla leader for the F-class destroyers, Faulknor was built to the same design as , flotilla leader for the preceding s, which marked a return to building flotilla leaders to an enlarged design, the most obvious difference being the additional 4.7-inch (120 mm) gun between the funnels.

For anti-aircraft defence, Faulknor had two quadruple Mark I mounts on the bridge wings for the 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes.Whitley, p. 105 One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.English, p. 141 =Wartime modifications= While under repair in May–June 1940, her aft bank of torpedo tubes were replaced by a QF 20 cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.

The ship was modified to prepare her for Arctic weather and her depth-charge stowage was increased to 38 during her late-1941 refit. In mid-1942, 'X' gun was removed, the three-inch gun repositioned there and the aft torpedo tubes were reinstalled. The quadruple Vickers machine gun mounts were replaced by shielded single mounts for Oerlikon AA guns; another pair of Oerlikon mounts were installed on the aft superstructure. Her original low-angle rangefinder above the bridge was replaced by a new high-angle gunnery director fitted with an analog Fuze Keeping Clock (mechanical computer) and a Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted on its roof. A Type 286PQ surface-search radar was installed on the foremast; it was replaced by a Type 291 radar in March–April 1943. The three-inch gun was replaced by a quadruple mount for 2-pounder () Mk II AA guns and the single mounts on the bridge wings were replaced by twin mounts for a total of six Oerlikons.Smith, pp. 57, 114, 280 Construction and career The ship was ordered on 17 March 1933 from Yarrow Shipbuilders under the 1932 Programme, although her hull was sub- contracted to Vickers Armstrongs. She was laid down at their Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 31 July, and launched on 12 June 1934English, pp. 75–76 by the wife of Rear-Admiral Reginald Henderson, Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy,Smith, p. 9 as the third ship of her name.Colledge, p. 123 Faulknor was completed on 24 May 1935 at a cost of £271,886, excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns, ammunition and communications equipment. Captain Marshall Clarke was her first captain, and also commander of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet.Smith, pp. 11, 13 After working up in May–July, the ship to put into Portsmouth to remedy the defects revealed from 29 July to 21 September, before she could assume her proper place with her flotilla.English, p. 76 Faulknor, together with most of the ships of her flotilla, was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War; during this time, Captain Victor Hilary Danckwerts relieved Clarke in March 1936.Smith, p. 282 The ship remained there until 20 July when she began a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until 3 October. She was detached to the Mediterranean to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides in the Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee during January–March 1937 and then deployed off the Spanish ports on the Bay of Biscay for another three months before returning home. Faulknor collided with the freighter off Ushant on 4 August and was under repairs at Portsmouth until 28 December. She was assigned to work with the French Navy in the Mediterranean for the first three months of 1938 before returning home. Danckwerts was relieved in his turn by Captain C. S. Daniel in April. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. =World War II= In September 1939, Faulknor and her 8th DF was assigned to the Home Fleet and based at Scapa Flow. In the first month of hostilities she was part of an anti-submarine hunting group centred on the aircraft carrier . On 14 September, the carrier was unsuccessfully attacked by the . Faulknor, in company with her sister ships and , counter-attacked and sank U-39 north-west of Ireland, rescuing most of her crew. After a pair of fishing trawlers were sunk by a submarine off the Hebrides, the 6th and 8th DFs were ordered to sweep the area on 19 September. The following day, Faulknor rescued 20 crewmen from after several of her sisters sank the submarine and then resumed their normal escort duties. A month later, the ship was damaged during heavy seas while escorting the capital ships of the Home Fleet and was repaired at Scotstoun from 15 to 28 October. Two months later, she was escorting the battleship when the latter struck a magnetic mine as they were entering Loch Ewe on 4 December. Faulknor remained there for a time in case any further mining attempts were made. In February 1940, she was one of the escorts for Convoy TC 3 carrying troops from Canada to the UK. Later that month the ship rescued 10 survivors of the torpedoed freighter on 11 February. Captain Antony de Salis assumed command of the ship and the flotilla on the 19th.Smith, pp. 24–26, 30–31, 33, 35–36 Map of the Ofotfjord Faulknor participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April–June, screening the ships of the Home Fleet early in the campaign. After the Second Battle of Narvik on 12 April, Captain Antony De Salis, Captain (D) of the 8th DF and commander of Faulknor, was appointed the Senior Destroyer Officer for the Narvik area with authority over all the destroyers in the area. He tasked them to patrol the Ofotfjord and evaluate the German defences while preventing any submarines from entering. A landing party from Faulknor went ashore on 16 April to inspect the wreck of the beached and search for any useful documents and assess her condition. They found nothing and one man was killed by a sniper. The following day, Faulknor and the destroyer bombarded the German ship and set her afire. During this time, the ship was attacked by German aircraft on multiple occasions to little effect. On 25 April, she helped to land part of the 2nd Battalion, the South Wales Borderers to Bogen and Lenvik. Later she bombarded German positions in support of the Allied advance on Narvik. On 4 May, Faulknor rescued 52 survivors from the Polish destroyer , which had been sunk by German bombers, and recovered the bodies of 60 more crewmen. The next day, the ship ran aground while bombarding German defences in the Rombaksfjord, but was only lightly damaged. On the voyage home for repairs, she escorted a convoy of empty troopships. Faulknor arrived at Scapa Flow on 9 May and sailed for Grimsby for repairs.Smith, pp. 42–56 Force H The repairs were completed on 12 JuneSmith, p. 56 and, a week later, she escorted the battlecruiser and the aircraft carrier , together with her sisters and and the destroyer , from Scapa Flow to Gibraltar where they would form Force H.Rohwer, p. 29 In early July, Faulknor screened the larger British ships during the attack on the Vichy French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir, French Algeria. During Operation MA 5, a planned carrier attack on Italian airfields in Sardinia, the destroyer was torpedoed by the on 11 July after the attack had been cancelled due to lack of surprise.Rohwer, pp. 31–32 The torpedo blew a large hole in the ship, but the British tried to salvage her. Despite their efforts, she foundered later that morning after the destroyer and Faulknor took off the survivors.Smith, p. 61 A month later the ship was one of the escorts for Force H during Operation Hurry, a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August. On 13 September, Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French. Ten days later, they attacked Dakar, but were driven off by the Vichy French defences. In early October, Faulknor escorted a troop convoy from Freetown, Sierra Leone, to French Cameroon. She then returned to Gibraltar and escorted the aircraft carriers and Ark Royal during Operations Coat and White in November.Rohwer, pp. 34, 38, 42–43, 47, 49 On 21 November, Faulknor, together with the light cruiser and Forester, intercepted the Vichy French blockade runner and escorted her to Gibraltar. The ship escorted Force F to Malta during Operation Collar later in the month and participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November. The following month Faulknor covered another convoy to Malta and went to the assistance of Convoy WS 5A after it had attacked by the German heavy cruiser .Smith, pp. 69, 77–78 In early January, she screened Force H during Operation Excess.Rohwer, pp. Later that month, Faulknor and Forester temporarily relieved some of the escorts for Convoy WS 5B bound for Egypt via the Cape of Good Hope and stayed with the convoy to Freetown. Before arriving there on 26 January, they were detached from Force H to reinforce the Freetown Escort Force. Faulknor rescued four survivors from the oil tanker on 3 February after they had been at sea for 41 days. Their stay in Freetown did not last long as they were ordered to escort Convoy SL 67 and the battleship en route back to Gibraltar in late February. The slow convoy was attacked by two U-boats that sank five ships from the convoy on 8 March, with the destroyers rescuing some of the survivors. Later that day, the German battleships and spotted the convoy, but Admiral Günther Lütjens declined to attack when Malaya was spotted. Force H rendezvoused with the convoy three days later and Faulknor and Forester arrived back in Gibraltar on 16 March. Faulknor spent most of the rest of the month refitting.Rohwer, pp. 49–50, 54, 62; Smith, p. 79–85 On 2–4 April, the ship led the escorts for Ark Royal as she flew off more fighters bound for Malta and repeated the mission three weeks later.Smith, pp. 86, 90 In early May she was part of the destroyer screen with five other destroyers for the battleship , and the light cruisers , and which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet. This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to the Middle East and the transfer of warships. Faulknor and the other F-class destroyers had their Two- Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear rigged to allow them to serve as a fast minesweepers en route to Malta. Despite this, one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged.Rohwer, p. 72 Later that month, she participated in Operation Splice, another mission in which the carriers Ark Royal and flew off fighters for Malta.Smith, p. 96 Force H was ordered to join the escort of Convoy WS 8B in the North Atlantic on 24 May, after the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 23 May, but they were directed to search for the and the heavy cruiser on 25 May. Heavy seas increased fuel consumption for all of the escorts and Faulknor was forced to return to Gibraltar to refuel later that day before rejoining the capital ships of Force H on 29 May, after Bismarck had been tracked down and sunk. In early June the destroyer participated in two more aircraft delivery missions to Malta (Operations Rocket and Tracer). On the 16th, after German blockade runners reached France, Force H sortied into the Atlantic on a unsuccessful search for more blockade runners. Together with Fearless, , Forester and , Faulknor helped to sink on 18 June. Four days later, the 8th DF was tasked to intercept a German supply ship heading towards the French coast. The next day they spotted which was scuttled by her crew upon the approach of the British ships. They rescued 78 British POWs taken from ships sunk by German raiders as well as the crew. In late June, Faulknor screened Ark Royal and Furious as they flew off more fighters for Malta in Operation Railway.English, p. 79; Rohwer, p. 74, 77–78; Smith, pp. 96–108 During a Malta supply convoy (Operation Substance), the ship went to the assistance of Fearless on 23 July, after she had been crippled and set afire by Italian torpedo-bombers, but she could not be safely towed back to Gibraltar and had to be sunk by Foresters torpedoes. A week later Faulknor screened the capital ships of Force H as they covered another Malta convoy (Operation Style). On the return voyage, her turbines broke down, but she was able to limp to Gibraltar after the port turbine was repaired. An inspection revealed that some of the blades in the starboard turbine had fractured. As the dockyard lacked the spare parts and the heavy lifting gear necessary, Faulknor was ordered home for a complete refit. She was assigned as the senior ship of Convoy HG 70 despite being limited to a speed of and her convoy reached Londonderry on 16 August without having lost a ship. Two days later the ship began a major refit in Southampton that was not completed until 9 November.Smith, pp. 108–115 Arctic and Atlantic convoys Faulknor was assigned to the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow after the completion of her refit, and led the escort for the battleship as she ferried Prime Minister Winston Churchill to meet with U.S President Roosevelt in the Atlantic Conference in mid-December. Both Faulknor and Foresight suffered weather damage en route, and were forced to break off and seek refuge in the Azores, Portugal, before returning to Scapa Flow on 23 December.Smith, pp. 115–118 A Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber from the aircraft carrier overflies Faulknor in May 1942 On 27 January 1942, Captain Alan Scott-Moncrieff relieved de Salis.Smith, p. 118 she was deployed with units of the Home Fleet escorting convoys to Russia. Scott- Moncrieff commanded the close escort for Convoy PQ 9/10 and the returning Convoy QP 7 in February, and, while escorting the covering force for Convoy PQ 12 at the beginning of March, was ordered to assist the damaged light cruiser after she had encountered a drifting mine. After escorting her to Seidisfjord, Iceland, Faulknor rejoined the covering force on the 9th, shortly before it turned back for Scapa Flow. Several days later, the ship led a destroyer sweep off the Norwegian coast on an unsuccessful search for the , arriving back at Scapa on the 14th. After some repairs for some weather damage, Scott-Moncrieff again commanded the escorts for the covering force for Convoys PQ 13 and the returning QP 9 at the end of the month.Smith, pp. 118–128 On 1 April Faulknor led a force of five other destroyers that were to escort ten Norwegian merchant ships attempting to reach Britain from Sweden via the Skagerrak. The Germans were expecting the breakout and damaged or sank six of them while causing two others to return to Sweden. Faulknor sank the burning after her crew had been taken off by another destroyer, despite heavy attacks by the Luftwaffe. As usual, she led the escorts of the distant covering force for Convoys PQ 14 on 11–18 April, PQ 15 on 22 April–5 May and PQ 16 on 23–30 May, and then PQ 17 on 29 June–8 July with little incident other than the usual heavy weather. Five days later Faulknor began a refit at a shipyard at Hull that lasted until 27 August.Smith, pp. 128–134 Type 285 fire control radar and Type 286PQ warning radar was fitted, a HA gun replaced the 4.7-inch mounting in the X position, and the after torpedo tube mounting was also replaced. She then returned to convoy escort duty, screening Convoy PQ 18 in September, and sinking the south of Spitsbergen. In October she escorted returning Convoy QP 15, and Convoy JW 51A in December. Further escort duty followed in 1943, escorting Convoy JW 52 in January, Convoy JW 53 in February, and Convoy RA 53 in March. In April she was detached for convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic with the Flotilla as the 4th Escort Group, escorting convoys HX 234, SC 127, ONS 6, ONS 182, and HX 239. Mediterranean and Aegean In June 1943 Faulknor rejoined the 8th Destroyer Flotilla for Fleet duties in the Mediterranean, arriving at Alexandria on 5 July to support the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). She served as part of the screen for the covering force in the Ionian Sea (two aircraft carriers, three battleships, and four cruisers with 17 other Allied destroyers). After screening and patrol duties in August, she supported Allied landings on the Italian mainland (Operation Baytown) and at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) with destroyers of 4th, 8th and 24th Flotillas. She was then detached with other destroyers to screen ships escorting the Italian Fleet to Alexandria via Malta, and then was transferred to the Eastern Mediterranean to support Allied operations in defence of Aegean Islands against German invasion. She transported troops to Leros, carried out patrols, sank several cargo ships and landing craft, and carried out bombardments of shore positions before the operation was abandoned in November. In December Faulknor supported military operations on the west coast of Italy, escorting the landing ships and with No. 9 Commando for a landing north of the Garigliano (Operation Partridge), then carrying out diversionary bombardments. In January 1944 she took part in the landings at Anzio (Operation Shingle), providing naval gunfire support and anti-aircraft defence during the initial landings, then as a patrol and escort ship into March. Normandy and the Channel In April 1944, Faulknor returned to Scapa Flow to support the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune) joining ten other destroyers in Force J of the Eastern Task Force, and assigned to attack the beach defences west of La Riviere. On 27 April she sailed to the Solent for exercises. She sailed for Normandy on 4 June, but was recalled when the operation was postponed for 24 hours. On the 5th she sailed with Convoy J1, made up of the 9th Minesweeping Flotilla, four Danlayers, a Harbour Defence Motor Launch and the 1st Division of 159 BYMS Flotilla. On the morning on 6 June she provided naval gunfire support off Juno Beach, returning to Portsmouth to re-ammunition later in the day. On the 7th she returned to Normandy with General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, the Allied Land Forces Commander for the initial phase of the invasion, on board for transport to the beachhead to set up his Tactical HQ. She was then deployed on patrols, anti- aircraft defence, and ferrying duties. On the 24th she embarked the First Sea Lord Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Cunningham, the Second Sea Lord Admiral Algernon Willis, the Naval Secretary Admiral Cecil Harcourt, and the Lord Privy Seal Lord Beaverbrook at Portsmouth to visit the Assault Area. After arrival the flag of Admiral Bertram Ramsay, the Allied naval commander was worn during a visit by Admiral Alan G. Kirk, the U.S. naval commander. She returned to Portsmouth with her passengers same day. Faulknor was released from duty in July and sailed to Grimsby for repairs. In September she was deployed for support and convoy defence duty in the Channel, and in October joined the 14th Escort Group based at Milford Haven, employed in the Irish Sea, English Channel and the South-West Approaches. In December she rejoined the reformed 8th Destroyer Flotilla at Plymouth, and was deployed for the defence of Channel convoys. On 8 May 1945 she accepted the surrender of the German garrison at Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, and on the 17th escorted six German minesweepers and two patrol boats to the UK. On 6 June she escorted the cruiser taking King George VI to visit the Channel Islands. =Decommissioning and disposal= In July Faulknor was reduced to the Reserve and de-stored at Plymouth, then sailed to Dartmouth to decommission on the 25th. She was put on the Disposal List in December 1945, and was sold on 21 January 1946 to BISCO for breaking-up by Thos W Ward at Milford Haven. After being stripped of equipment at Plymouth in March she was towed to the breaker's yard, arriving on 4 April 1946.

His principal contribution was in making available facsimiles of ancient documents and some of the earliest explorers' reports on pre- Columbian ruins and Maya civilisation. He was the eldest son of George King, 3rd Earl of Kingston, Lord Kingsborough, the latter a Tory, of Mitchelstown Castle, County Cork. He represented Cork County in parliament between 1818 and 1826 as a Whig. In 1831, Lord Kingsborough published the first volume of Antiquities of Mexico, a collection of copies of various Mesoamerican codices, including the first complete publication of the Dresden Codex. The exorbitant cost of the reproductions, which were often hand-painted, landed him in debtors' prison. These lavish publications represented some of the earliest published documentation of the ancient cultures of Mesoamerica, inspiring further exploration and research by John Lloyd Stephens and Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg in the early 19th century. They were the product of early theories about non-indigenous origins for Native American civilisations that are also represented in the Book of Mormon (1830) and myths about mound builders of Old World ancestry in North America. In 1837, Lord Kingsborough was imprisoned at the Sheriff's Prison in Dublin because he was unable to pay a small debt owed to a printer. He contracted typhus while in prison following which he was released and died three weeks later on 27 February 1837, aged 41, less than two years before he would have succeeded to his title and estates, his father having been declared insane in 1830. The last two volumes of Antiquities of Mexico were published posthumously. The Codex Kingsborough is named after him.

He worked for 45 years for the State and Globe Banks and was often referred to as the \\"Banker Poet of Boston\\". His odes and prologues won several competitive prizes and were collected and published in 1841 as The Writings of Charles Sprague. Personal life He was born in Boston on October 26, 1791. He was a descendant of some of America's founding fathers, including his father, Samuel Sprague (participant in the Boston Tea Party and Revolutionary War), Richard Warren (Mayflower passenger) and the Reverend Peter Hobart and William Sprague of Hingham. He received a common-school education, beginning at age 10 at the Franklin School in Boston. He was taught by Dr. Asa Bullard and Mr. Lemuel Shaw who later became Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. He lost the use of his left eye by an accident at age 10. His formal education ended at thirteen when he was apprenticed to a dry goods merchant, Messrs Thayer and Hunt. Here he gained his first practical knowledge of business. Later he formed a co-partnership with William B. Collander in the grocery business. He married Elizabeth Rand in 1814 and had four children, two dying in childhood. In 1819 be began working for the State Bank as a teller and when the Globe Bank was established in 1824 was employed there as a cashier. He remained there, becoming an officer in the institution, until 1865 and was often referred to as the \\"Banker Poet\\" of Boston. He resigned his bank position, when at 73 years and growing infirm with age, he didn't want to undertake the labors of a new regime of banking under national laws. He enjoyed the comforts of home life, surrounded by his books, until January 22, 1875, when after a short illness he died at 84. Poet His first recognition for poetry came when he won a prize for the best prologue at the opening of the Park Theater in New York City. His first printed efforts were published in the Centennial, Boston Gazette, and The Evening Gazette as early as 1811. Upon the occasion of the triumphal entry of Lafayette into Boston, in 1824, he wrote the inscription for an arch that hung over the streets of Boston. Many of Charles Sprague's poems were delivered at public festivities — major, historical Boston events — including Curiosity, delivered at the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard University in 1829. This is his longest and most elaborate work. In the Salem Observer, August 29, 1829, it is noted that at the commencement at Harvard an honorary degree of Master of Arts was given to Mr. Charles Sprague, the poet. It goes on to state, \\"We are glad that the distributors of the literary honors of old Harvard are so discriminating in the selection of the candidates for their favors\\". This was quite an accomplishment as his formal education ended at thirteen and he was the epitome of a 'self-made man. \\"Shakespeare Ode\\" was delivered at a Boston theatre in a pageant in honor of Shakespeare, in 1823; \\"Ode\\" was pronounced at the Centennial Celebration of the Settlement of Boston of 1830; \\"Triennial Ode\\" at the Massachusetts Charitable Assoc. 1818; \\"Fifty Years Ago\\" at the Fourth of July Celebration, and \\"Song\\" at a festival in Faneuil Hall. Legacy His children, Charles James Sprague (who became Curator of botany at the Boston Society of Natural History) and Mary Anna Sprague both married and had children. The families creative and productive talents continued on through his grandsons. His namesake, Charles Sprague Pearce, was a noted expatriate artist who resided in Paris. He is best known or a series of lunettes, paintings that he was commissioned to do for the Library of Congress in 1896. Another grandson, William Houghton Sprague Pearce (W.H.S. Pearce) worked for the New England Mutual Life Insurance company for over fifty years and painted local landscapes. He lived in Newton and often provided the artwork for the New England Mutual yearly calendar.

The band formed in 1982,RFI Music Website (2001) and in 1986 were signed to Barclay records, France, who released their first album, 'Chic planète'.Sleeve Notes, L'Affaire Louis Trio, Master Serie Universal Music (2000) The members were: singer / bassist Cleet Boris (aka Hubert Mounier, who died in May 2016), guitarist Karl Niagara (aka Vincent Mounier, Hubert's younger brother) and keyboardist / drummer Bronco Junior (aka François Lebleu, who died in December 2008). In 1987, L'Affaire Louis' Trio were awarded the prize for best newcomers at France's prestigious 'Victoires de la Musique' ceremony. The trio stayed together until 1997, when Vincent Mounier left during the recording of their 1997 release, 'Europium'.L'Affaire Louis Trio & Hubert Mounier http://lalt.free.fr (2002) Since then, the band was dissolved, but Hubert Mounier recorded with drummer Lebleu on his first two solo releases, 'Le Grand Huit' (2001) and 'Voyager léger' (2005). He had also worked extensively as a comic book artist under his Cleet Boris pseudonym. He died of an aortic dissection on May 2, 2016 at the age of 53. Style The band's sound was defined by large scale, jazz-influenced arrangements from the likes of big band veteran Christian Fradin, the angular pop of English band XTC, and the pop-funk exotica of New York City-based Kid Creole and The Coconuts. Their initial recordings relied heavily on contributions from some of France's top jazz musicians, however, the band's sound was continually refined over the years, with Europium (1997), their last album, offering their most stripped down, guitar-centric arrangements. Lyrics Hubert Mounier's lyrics are often witty, containing a large amount of wordplay and puns. His most lyrically ambitious project was L'Affaire Louis' Trio's fourth album, Mobilis in mobile (1993) a concept album based on the character of Captain Nemo, from Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea.

It was the group's first release with drummer Barry Jenkins, who replaced founding member John Steel as he had left the band in February of that year. History \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" was one of a series of Animals renditions of Brill Building material, following the 1965 hits \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\" and \\"It's My Life\\". According to one account, all three came out of one call in 1965 that the Animals' then- producer Mickie Most made for songs. The Animals had always had a somewhat contentious relationship with such songs, knowing they gave them hits but preferring the more straightforward R&B; numbers they used for album tracks. Moreover, now they were performing a Goffin and King selection; although the couple was already legendary for their pop songwriting prowess, Animals lead singer Eric Burdon had previously seemingly mocked Goffin-King's \\"Take Good Care of My Baby\\" in the Animals' 1964 stream-of-consciousness rock history \\"Story of Bo Diddley\\". Furthermore, they were now using Tom Wilson as a producer, who promised them more artistic freedom than they had had under Mickie Most. The Animals' arrangement is led by a pulsating organ riff from Dave Rowberry, which is then set against a prominent bass guitar line from Chas Chandler. Hilton Valentine decorates the song with fuzz guitar chords. Eric Burdon sings the verses in a quiet manner: :When you complain and criticize :I feel I'm nothing in your eyes :It makes me feel like giving up :Because my best just ain't good enough :Girl, I want to provide for you :And do all the things that you want me to before sliding into a loud, pleading voice on the chorus: :Oh oh no! :Don't bring me down ::No no no no :Oh babe oh no :Don't bring me down \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" was a solid hit, reaching the Top 10 (#6) in the UK pop singles chart, and falling just short of that on the U.S. pop singles chart, reaching number 12 during June and July 1966. It was also popular in Canada, reaching number 3 on the CHUM Chart. It was also one of their most popular singles in Germany, reaching number 17. Rolling Stone would later write that \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" represented one side of the Goffin-King \\"boy-girl, loneliness-togetherness\\" duality. Allmusic considers \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" an exemplar of the Animals' \\"brutally soulful inspiration.\\" Later versions New York Dolls singer David Johansen's Animals medley from his 1982 live album Live It Up gained considerable MTV exposure; \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" was in the middle, following \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\" and before \\"It's My Life\\". The Guess Who? did this song on the bootleg live album \\"Live in Winnipeg\\" in 1967. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers had \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" in their concert repertoire from 1977–1986, and a 1978 performance of it was captured on their 1985 live album Pack up the Plantation: Live!. The song has also been recorded by Riki Maiocchi, Paul Shaffer, and Southside Johnny. Eric Burdon has performed it with Shaffer, Robby Krieger and Brian Auger, as well as in his own bands of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Similarly titled songs Some websites erroneously claim the song has earlier been recorded by Pretty Things in 1964; in fact, that \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" was a different song, written by Johnnie Dee, that was a Top 10 hit in the UK. There also are two subsequent songs by the same title: the pop hit \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" by Electric Light Orchestra in 1979, and an R&B;/dance hit \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" by Spirits in 1995.

Painting by Viktor Vasnetsov. A volkhv or volhv (Cyrillic: Волхвы; Polish: Wołchw, translatable as wiseman, wizard, magus, i.e. shaman, gothi or mage) is a priest in ancient Slavic religions and contemporary Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery). The term volkhv is a cognate of Old Norse völva. In modern Slavic priesthood Russian Rodnover volkhv In contemporary Slavic Native Faith, the volkhvs are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, the lesser order being that of the zhrets. The latter are not necessarily shamans, and their function is merely to hold sacrifices (the word zhrets literally means \\"sacrificer\\", from Proto-Slavic *žьrti, and is cognate of Slavic words for \\"offering\\"). p. 210; p. 316. Though the majority of priests are males, most groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of zhritsa and vedunya (\\"seeresses\\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, Halyna Lozko from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the religious movement. In 2012, three Russian Rodnover organisations, the Union of Slavic Rodnover Communities, the Circle of the Pagan Tradition and the Circle of Veles, signed an \\"Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests\\", instituting a common priesthood and the criteria for the ordination of those wishing to become Slavic priests. Among the olden Rus' Volkhvs are attested among the early Rus' people. Volkhvs were believed to possess mystical powers, particularly the ability to predict the future. The first literary reference to a volkhv occurs in the Primary Chronicle under the year 912; there, the priest-soothsayer predicts Prince Oleg's death. With the adoption of Christianity, the pagan priests came under persecution and sometimes tried to channel social discontent against the Christian church.

Negative assurance tells the data user that nothing has come to the CPA's attention of an adverse nature or character regarding the financial data reviewed. This type of assurance is normally given to investment bankers and the SEC when the financial data are being used for stock and bond issuance. In addition, this assurance is given whenever a CPA is asked to comment on financial statements upon which a previous Audit Opinion has been rendered. (This type of assurance is unacceptable for the basic financial statements on which a certifying audit has been performed.) Negative assurance is also issued for in review engagements, which are a similar but lower level of service when compared to an audit. Negative assurance comments are made on unaudited financial statements and subsequent changes, indicating that nothing came to the auditor's attention that suggests the statements do not comply with applicable accounting requirements; are not fairly presented in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis; or do not fairly present information shown therein. Negative assurance is given because the auditor has not made an examination in conformity with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). Negative assurance is not appropriate unless the CPA has made an examination in accordance with GAAS for the accounting period before the current one. This is because the auditor needs evidence that can be related to comfort letter procedures. For negative assurance to be permissible, the evidence must have been gathered directly by the CPA giving the assurance, and not by another CPA. Negative assurance is also used in modern day law practice, as the assurance can be used when a defense of \\"due diligence\\" needs to be established. Negative assurance is provided in letter format, and is used explicitly in conjunction with another document. The letter is usually used by the counsel to establish two standard facts about the document in question. Specifically, that the counsel has read the document in question, and that the counsel is not answerable for the document's accuracy, completeness, or fairness. While negative assurance is not considered a legal opinion, third parties and underwriters often use Negative assurance to circumvent accountability charges.\\"Negative Assurance in Securities Offerings (2008 Revision).\\" Business Lawyer, vol. 64, no. 2, Feb. 2009, pp. 395-406.

Edward was born in Launceston, Tasmania, brought up in New Zealand, and educated in France and at King's College London. He married Agnes Mildred Hall on 15 July 1874 at Christchurch. She was the daughter of George Williamson Hall, and John Hall was thus her uncle. Edward and Agnes had four children: Edward Howard St George Wakefield (1875); Gerald Seymour Wakefield (1877); Grace Josephine Wakefield (1879); and Mildred Wakefield (1881). Wakefield was a journalist and then a colourful, volatile and ambitious politician in New Zealand, who showed considerable promise, though this was not quite fulfilled; \\"He was among the best parliamentary debaters of the time; admired for his wit and power of argument.\\" He was the Member of Parliament for Geraldine 1875–1881, then for Selwyn 1884–1887, when he resigned. He won an by-election against John McLachlan, and was then elected unopposed in 1884 general election some five months later. He served as Colonial Secretary in the short 1884 ministry of Harry Atkinson; from 28 August to 3 September 1884. Wakefield subsequently concentrated on writing, producing New Zealand after Fifty Years (1889). Later he moved to America, then London. Having become blind in old age, he was made a brother of the Charterhouse in recognition of his service, and resided there at the almshouse; he died there in 1924.

Life Dormer was the third son (but first surviving) of Sir William Dormer and his second wife, Dorothy (née Catesby). He studied at Gray's Inn in 1567 and obtained a B.A. from Oxford in 1569. In 1575 Dormer succeeded to the considerable lands and estate of his father in Buckinghamshire and elsewhere, together with a fortune estimated by the Spanish ambassador to amount to 100,000 ducats. Dormer became a Justice of the Peace in 1577. He served as High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1584 and was knighted in 1591. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Tregony in 1571 and for Buckinghamshire in 1593. In June 1615 he was created a baronet, of Wing (or Wyng or Wemme). Only a few weeks later he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dormer, of Wenge in the County of Buckingham. Family Dormer married Elizabeth Browne, daughter of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, by whom he had six sons and three daughters. Dormer was a brother-in-law of Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, who was married to Elizabeth's sister, Mary.Virgoe, Roger. \\"Dormer, Robert (1551-1616) of Wings, Bucks.\\", The History of Parliament His half-sister, Jane married the Spanish Ambassador, Gómez Suárez de Figueroa y Córdoba, 1st Duke of Feria. His paternal grandmother, Jane Newdigate was the sister of the Carthusian martyr, Sebastian Newdigate, but both Dormer and his father appear to have conformed to the established church. Nonetheless, Dormer held strong Catholic sympathies as so many of his relatives remained Catholic. Sir William Dormer was a friend of the influential Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, whose patronage seems to have extended to William's son, Robert, and shielded the family somewhat from close scrutiny under the Penal laws despite the fact that Robert had married into the Catholic Montague family. His daughter, Dorothy, married Sir Henry Huddleston, of Sawston Hall, noted for a number of priest holes. Lord Dormer died in November 1616, aged 65, and was interred at All Saints' Church, Wing, where there is an impressive monument to his memory. He was succeeded in his titles by his grandson Robert, who was created Earl of Carnarvon in 1628. References Sources * Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

It is located on School Road and Washington Avenue. The name South Shore was suggested in 1942 by Alice Okkonen, an elementary school teacher from Herbster, Wisconsin.South Shore Schools, \\"The Torch, \\" 1942 History South Shore School District was originally one of the many “township schools” in Bayfield County, Wisconsin, when Port Wing Township was still part of Bayfield Township. Over the years five schools have been built - in 1893, 1894, 1898, 1903, 1978 and 1990. The first “schoolhouse” was built in 1893 by Irving Herrick as a small log structure near Larson Creek and Twin Falls. There were about seven students. The second school was built in 1894 by the Town of Bayfield and was a one-room school with a belfry. Because of growing enrollment in the town of Port Wing, the Town of Bayfield constructed a second schoolhouse in 1898, along with a woodshed. It was later made into the Port Wing Creamery and then enlarged to make a co-op. When there were more students than the schools could handle, the Presbyterian Church was used. These two schools served as the main sites for education in Port Wing until 1903, when they were replaced by the “Big White School”. On March 8, 1901, Port Wing became a town, putting it in charge of schools. Because of the growing enrollment, the Town of Port Wing built a larger three-story white school in 1903 costing $25,000. The building was divided into the Port Wing Graded School on the first floor, and the Union Free High School on the second floor. The school board of 1903 was also \\"high- tech”, operating the first school busses (wagons called kid hacks) in Wisconsin. This was the Port Wing school until 1978, when a new school was constructed. In 1979, everything from the \\"Big White School\\" was destroyed except the belfry, which stands today as a reminder of the school. In 1990 the elementary addition was added on the south side. Extra-curricular activities South Shore has a monthly newspaper, the Pocoho. It was named after the towns in the district. =Athletics= There are fewer sports than at most schools, but they include baseball, cross country, volleyball and basketball. The school's basketball program has teams for 3-4 and 5-6 grades, middle school, and high school. The boys' team went 20-0 in conference play in the 2007-08 school year. The Cardinals had the best defense that year with an opponent average of 38.2 points a game, along with the 2nd best offense averaging 62.7 points per game. South Shore has two gymnasiums and a track and field area on campus, along with two smaller outdoor courts and a playground. References 1.Rockenbach, Sondra.

It has about 1,200 inhabitants. Administrative parts Village of Bezděkov u Úsova is an administrative part of Úsov. History The first written mention of Úsov is from 1260. The castle was built around 1250. In 1487 the lords of House of Vlašim modified the castle, which was later given into the possession of the lords of Boskovice. In 1622 Emperor Ferdinand II presented the town to Prince Karl I of Liechtenstein, on condition that none but Catholics should be permitted to reside there. As late as 1834, out of a population of 4,534, only 24 were Protestants. In 1860 there were 245 houses in Aussee with 2,662 inhabitants, of whom 950 were Jewish.Carl Koristka: Die Markgrafschaft Mähren und das Herzogthum Schlesien. Olmütz 1860 From the 17th century until 1945, the castle was in the possession of the princes of Liechtenstein. Today the castle is used as a museum, with the main pieces of the museum mainly being the trophies of the hunting expeditions of the princes of Liechtenstein. In 1852 the Mährisch-schlesische Forstlehranstalt (Moravian-Silesian Silviculture School) was founded in Úsov, but in 1867 transferred to Eulenberg. =Jewish Asyva (Aussee)= Aussee was the home to a Jewish community beginning in the 17th century. In 1688 the dean of Mohelnice gave orders for the erection of a synagogue at Aussee. This building was destroyed in 1722. During the services on the eve of Yom Kippur a Catholic priest entered the synagogue and began to preach a missionary sermon to the people assembled for worship. The officers of the congregation asked him to withdraw; but he persistently refused to do so, and they were compelled to eject him. When the Jews brought charges against the priest for disturbance of the peace, he claimed that they had assaulted him. After a protracted lawsuit a decision was rendered to the effect that the synagogue be destroyed and that no other be built. Of those charged by the priest with assault 3 men were branded with a hot iron and exiled; while the fourth, a man 74 years old, was sentenced to work upon a Catholic church then in construction. 32 years elapsed before permission was granted to establish another House of Worship, though it was to be a lesser establishment than a synagogue. (Abraham Ha-levi, \\"M'gilath S'darim\\") It was not until 1783 that permission was given to build a regular synagogue; and when this was dedicated Abraham Prostiz was chosen rabbi. Other rabbis were: Israel Fuchs (brother of R. Manli Fuchs of Moravský Krumlov), Loeb Pollak, M. Duschak and David ben Jacob Szczebrszyn (author of notes on the Targumim, is said to have occupied the rabbinate in the 17th century). Under the law of March 21, 1890, relating to the legal conditions of the Jewish congregations in Austria, the community of Aussee was amalgamated with the neighboring communities; and, through personal and local considerations, Mährisch-Schönberg became the seat of the Jewish communal district.

Background Barrett Brown of The Huffington Post has described the blog as catering to \\"one of the most collectively cerebral audiences one may find within the right side of the blogosphere\\". Goldstein's respect for the legacy of Hunter S. Thompson is an enduring theme, as is his sardonic allusions to such popular cult figures as Martha Stewart and the fictional Billy Jack. The blog is known for its bawdy overtones, surrealistic sense of humor, and biting wit. Controversies Goldstein vocally opposed the abrupt change of financial arrangements by Pajamas Media in 2009, which deprived him — and other bloggers such as The Anchoress and Ace of Spades HQ — of income from PJM-mediated advertising. He also publicly chastised those he refers to as GOP pragmatists or realists for their criticism of Rush Limbaugh's answer to a question about the coming Obama presidency, once again relying on linguistics and hermeneutics to make the point that \\"losing more slowly\\" is still losing, and that there is nothing more pragmatic, as a political strategy, than standing on principle In 2016, he was a vocal critic of the Trump nomination and of the idea of \\"White Nationalism,\\" likening it to an \\"identity politics of the right.\\" Recently, however, he has praised the effectiveness of many Trump Administration policies and expressed a willingness to support his re-election campaign under the right circumstances. Deborah Frisch incident On July 4, 2006, University of Arizona adjunct professor Deborah Frisch started writing comments at Protein Wisdom. Two days later, she wrote \\"You live in Colorado, I see. Hope no one JonBenets your baby.\\" She then added: \\"I reiterate: If some nutcase kidnapped your child tomorrow and did to him what was done to your fellow Coloradan, JonBenet Ramsey, I wouldn't give a damn.\\" She later resigned and apologized, saying \\"I don’t think professors should do that. I crossed the line.\\" Her behavior gained nationwide news coverage. Following further incidents, Goldstein obtained a restraining order and preliminary injunction against her. Goldstein has said he took temporary breaks from blogging to deal with continued harassment from Frisch, who has faced continued legal problems since her relocation to the Pacific Northwest. Conservative bloggers have alleged cyberstalking and other strange behavior by Frisch since then. In 2015, Frisch was arrested four times on charges including stalking, menacing, criminal trespass, and initiating a false police report.

It is the first of the original 12 chapters in the series The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. The story takes place from 1877 to 1880 when Scrooge is a child in Glasgow, Scotland. He comes in conflict with The Whiskervilles, earns his Number One Dime and heads for the United States on a cattle boat. It is the first appearance of Scrooge's mother Downy O'Drake. Scrooge's Uncle Jake McDuck appears for the first time in this story even though he was mentioned in A Christmas for Shacktown. The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1992-33; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge #285, in April 1994. Plot As a child, Scrooge grows up in a poor family that has a rivalry with the Whiskervilles clan. When he gets his first job as a shoe shiner, his first customer presents him with extremely filthy work boots, but pays him with an American coin (a dime). Furious at being cheated, Scrooge makes a vow to always be \\"fair and square\\" in business and becomes much more cunning and gets more business. He later earns more money first by selling firewood and then by selling peat moss. Family legend, meanwhile, states that the McDuck family was heir to a castle and large fortune. One of their ancestors, determined to hide the treasure from thieves, sealed it away inside the castle (accidentally sealing himself away at the same time). The family was frightened away from the land by a \\"phantom hound\\" and, as a result, the treasure was lost while the castle fell to ruin. While exploring the castle, Scrooge discovers that the hound only was a trick by the Whiskervilles, who wanted the McDuck family out of the way so that they could steal the hidden treasure. Encouraged by a strange keeper in the castle, Scrooge gets revenge for his family by filling a suit of armor with peat and setting it on fire, scaring the Whiskervilles into thinking it was a ghost. Inspired by the keeper, Scrooge decides to go to America to earn his fortune. After Scrooge leaves the castle, the keeper reveals himself as the ghost of the ancestor who was sealed away in the wall. When asked by the ghosts of the other ancestors why he didn't simply just show Scrooge the location of the treasure, he explains that the boy must earn his fortune himself.

He threw and batted right-handed; Del Greco stood tall and weighed , during his playing days. Del Greco grew up in Pittsburgh's Hill District and was signed by the hometown Pirates. They traded him to the Cardinals on May 17, 1956, in a deal that brought center fielder Bill Virdon to Pittsburgh. After spending most of 1957 with the seventh-place Cubs and in Triple-A, Del Greco was acquired by the pennant-winning Yankees, on September 10. He was a light-hitting, speedy, and defensively-sound player. The Yankees used him to fill in for Mickey Mantle in the late innings, but Del Greco did not appear in the 1957 World Series, won by the Milwaukee Braves in seven games. He was the regular center fielder for the A's from July 1961 through 1963, hitting a composite .233 in 327 games played. After a minor-league stint in 1964, Del Greco played his last MLB game for the Phillies, in May 1965 and retired from baseball after the 1966 campaign.

Most of its members had previously been active in the Revolutionary Brigades (Brigadas Revolucionárias), an armed group with links to the Revolutionary Party of the Proletariat (Partido Revolucionário do Proletariado). A total of 18 people were killed by the FP-25 as a result of armed attacks, bombings and confrontations with the police during bank robberies and escape attempts. Notable attacks included the 1984 firing of four mortar rounds at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon and the 1985 bombing of six NATO ships, including the , also in Lisbon. The most well-known figure connected with the FP-25 was Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho. Ideology FP-25 Flag The FP-25 brought together the most radical sectors of the Portuguese radical left, who were growing discontent with the development of parliamentary democracy and capitalism in post-Carnation Revolution Portugal. In the organization's \\"Manifesto ao Povo Trabalhador\\" or \\"Manifesto to the Workers\\" released in April 1980, the organization outlined its opposition to amendments to the Portuguese Constitution of 1976, specifically the abandonment of socialism, the abandonment of agrarian land reforms or the perceived lack of expression of the will of the people. Opposing the political realities of the time, the FP-25 proposed a model of popular democracy, based on popular assemblies - the so-called basismo (\\"basism\\") ou conselhismo (\\"councelism\\"), similar to the Libyan or Cuban revolutions. It also defended the non-alignment with either side of the Cold War as a necessary condition to the implementation of socialism in Portugal. The nature of the armed actions and terrorist attacks showed a preoccupation with different causes: political, economic, environmental, solidarity with other terrorist groups and support of FP-25 militants that had been arrested. The group unsuccessfully tried to intimidate the population, provoke a general revolt and raise a popular army. Their constant operations of \\"recovery of funds\\" (i.e. bank robberies, the main source of funding) and their political and media isolation led the FP-25 to be seen by most Portuguese as no-more than a criminal gang.  Foreign links and funding  Although the FP-25 tried to obtain the support of foreign governments for funding and logistical support, it seems that the majority if the group's financing came from the above-mentioned \\"recovery of funds\\". Still, some governments (especially Mozambique) did grant some support, for instance giving sanctuary to militants escaping the Portuguese authorities. The FP-25 also tried to collaborate with other terrorist groups, namely the IRA and the ETA, the latter being confirmed that there were exchange of weapons and technical know-how.

The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime. The technology life-cycle (TLC) describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase, and the financial return during its \\"vital life\\". Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) while in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short. The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle (PLC) dealt with in product life-cycle management. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction, marketing measures, and business costs. The technology underlying the product (for example, that of a uniquely flavoured tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different. The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost, and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with patents and trademarks seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it. The product of the technology may be a commodity such as polyethylene plastic or a sophisticated product like the integrated circuits used in a smartphone. The development of a competitive product or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the management of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development. Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the technological maturity of a product. This is not similar to a product life cycle, but applies to an entire technology, or a generation of a technology. Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle. After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes, producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult, as the technology matures. The four phases of the technology life-cycle The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases: #The research and development (R&D;) phase (sometimes called the \\"bleeding edge\\") when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high #The ascent phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the \\"leading edge\\") #The maturity phase when gain is high and stable, the region, going into saturation, marked by M, and #The decline (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology. =S-curve= The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve. Technology perception dynamics There is usually technology hype at the introduction of any new technology, but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim. Because of the logistic curve nature of technology adoption, it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive. The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are: * fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming eternal exponential growth * fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing 300px Similarly, in the later stages, the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of technology maturity and market saturation. The technology adoption life cycle typically occurs in an S curve, as modelled in diffusion of innovations theory. This is because customers respond to new products in different ways. Diffusion of innovations theory, pioneered by Everett Rogers, posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new innovations and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption. Rogers classified individuals into five groups: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. In terms of the S curve, innovators occupy 2.5%, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, late majority 34%, and laggards 16%. The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows:Technology Management - Growth & Lifecycle, Shahid kv, Sep 28, 2009, Attribution Non-commercial *Innovation stage: This stage represents the birth of a new product, material of process resulting from R&D; activities. In R&D; laboratories, new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors. Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element, the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely. *Syndication stage: This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology, such as, product, material or process with potential for immediate utilisation. Many innovations are put on hold in R&D; laboratories. Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised. Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non- technical, mostly economic factors. *Diffusion stage: This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation, by potential users of the technology. But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion. *Substitution stage: This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology, due to replacement by another technology. Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution. The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics. Licensing options Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later.Bayus, B. (1998). An Analysis of Product Lifetimes in a Technologically Dynamic Industry. Management Science, 44(6), pp.763-775. =Licensing in the R&D; phase= There are always smaller firms (SMEs) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&D; in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions, substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats. Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in areas of significant and high risk (e.g. aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained. In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as venture capitalists or business angels, can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&D;, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital. Larger firms may opt for Joint R&D; or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called strategic alliances – strategic partnerships. With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change. In the case of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through initial public offering (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre- allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed. Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development. =Licensing in the ascent phase = The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it commences when the R&D; portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be as successful in that period. Strongly patented technology extends the duration period. The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare. Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring not to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party. =Licensing in the maturity phase= The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity. The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in joint venture, typically in regions where the technology would be in the ascent phase,as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced in such strategy. =Licensing in the decline phase= After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life). Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply, say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology. The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as knowhow which could have a longer life if properly protected. It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations. The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, may imply a declining technology. In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work to reduce such risk and can be negotiated. There are instances when, even though the technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This is often the form that technical service and technical assistance contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for Prahova County for three consecutive terms, between 1992 and 2000. Biography Opriş was born in Ploieşti, graduating from the I. L. Caragiale High School in 1977, and from the Bucharest Carol Davila General Medicine and Pharmacy Faculty in 1983. Profile at the Chamber of Deputies site He was a general practitioner until 1990, when he began his specialization in Psychiatry (completed in 1992). In 1999, he completed a post-graduate course at the National College of Defense. Career Joining the PNŢCD after the 1989 Revolution, Opriş became leader of its youth organization on 1991 (serving until 1993), a junior member of its Leadership Bureau (1991–1995, during the time when the party was headed by Corneliu Coposu) and its Vice President in 1996. As a member of the Chamber, he sat on its Committee for Health and Family throughout his mandates, and advanced legislation on medical practice, the creation of a College of Romanian Doctors, health insurance, and forensic science. Upon the CDR's creation, before the elections of 1996, he became the new body's campaign organizer. In December 1996, after the election victory, Opriş was appointed to ministerial office, as Minister-Delegate for Coordinating the General Secretariat of the Government and of the Department for Local Public Administration. He proposed several new laws, including those on ministerial responsibility, the status of civil servants, on property rights, and on local budgets, as well as issuing a 1997 ordinance to amend the Law on Public Administration. During the new Radu Vasile government, Remus Opriş was also noted for his criticism of Democratic Party (PD), the CDR's coalition partner, and condemned the decision taken by Radu Berceanu, the PD's Minister of Industry and Commerce, to replace PNŢCD-appointed members of the administrative boards for state-owned enterprises such as RENEL and ROMGAZ.\\"Remus Opriş Criticises Industry and Trade Minister's Decision\\", RADOR, May 27, 1998 At the time, he stated: \\"If the PD believes Mr. Berceanu's decision was fair, that means the PD is trying to gain electoral capital by further harassing its coalition partners\\". He soon became noted for his opposition to the Premier, and called on him to resign Sorin Roşca-Stănescu \\"Capul lui Vasile\\" (\\"Vasile's Head\\"), fragment of Marea Provocare, published by Ziua — according to the journalist Sorin Roşca-Stănescu, Opriş was the leader of a PNŢCD faction who came into conflict with Vasile's. After the Vasile cabinet was replaced with that of Mugur Isărescu, the PNŢCD went on to face a parliamentary crisis due to a standoff with the PD, when the PD's Minister of Defense, Victor Babiuc, decided to leave his party — the PD refused to pass legislation until Babiuc was to be replaced with Sorin Frunzăverde. \\"Asediat şi fără gloanţe, PD... trage de timp\\" (\\"Under Siege and with No Bullets Left, the PD... Shoots Time\\"), in Ziarul Financiar, March 10, 2000 In response, Opriş called on all other coalition partners (the National Liberals, the Social Democrats, the Democratic Union of Hungarians and various minor groups) to express support for the proposed legislation, and argued that new laws could conceivably be passed with support from opposition parties. (The crisis was ultimately overcome when Frunzăverde took over as minister.) No longer elected to office in the elections of 2000 (when the PNŢCD as a whole failed to pass the election threshold in either chamber of Parliament), Remus Opriş resumed his activity as Vice President of the PNŢCD (briefly renamed Christian-Democratic People's Party, PPCD). \\"«Nu vom accepta să fim absorbiţi de alte partide»\\" (\\"«We Will Not Accept Absorption into Other Parties»\\") (interview with Remus Opriş), in Evenimentul, March 1, 2006 In March 2006, he rejected the offer of fusion proposed by the PD, aimed at creating a \\"center-right pole\\" in Romanian politics, and indicated that the National Peasants' Party would carry on as an independent force. In July 2006, Opriş was presented by the National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives with the file kept on him by the Securitate, attesting that Communist Romanian authorities had him under constant surveillance between 1976 and 1978, and again in 1981. \\"Remus Opriş a fost urmărit de 38 de securişti\\" (\\"Remus Opriş Was Kept under Surveillance by 38 Securitate Men\\"), in Ziua, July 21, 2006 At the time, he specified, 16 Securitate officers had overseen his case, and he had been reported on by 22 informants.

The clause took its name from a declaration read by Friedrich Martens, the delegate of Russia at the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899. It reads as follows: The Clause appears in a slightly modified form in the 1907 Hague conventions: The Clause was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.Rupert Ticehurst (references) in hist footnote 1 cites The life and works of Martens are detailed by V. Pustogarov, \\"Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909) — A Humanist of Modern Times\\", International Review of the Red Cross (IRRC), No. 312, May-June 1996, pp. 300-314.Rupert Ticehurst (references) in hist footnote 2 cites F. Kalshoven, Constraints on the Waging of War, Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1987, p. 14. The clause did not appear in the Geneva Conventions of 1949,ICRC Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions p. 38 ¶ 53 but was it included in the additional protocols of 1977.ICRC Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions p. 38 ¶ 53; p. 1341 ¶ 4433 It is in article 1 paragraph 2 of Protocol I (which covers international conflicts), and the fourth paragraph of the preamble to Protocol II (which covers non-international conflicts). The wording in both is identical but slightly modified from the version used in the Hague Convention of 1907:ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, p. 38 ¶ 56 In its commentary (Geneva 1987), the ICRC states that although the Martens Clause is considered to be part of customary international law,ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, p. 39 ¶ 56; p 436, footnote 29 the plenipotentiaries considered its inclusion appropriate because: Rupert Ticehurst, a Lecturer in Law, at King's College School of Law in London, writes that: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in their advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons issued on 8 July 1996, had to consider the general laws of armed conflict before they could consider the specific laws relating to nuclear weapons. Several different interpretations of this clause were presented in oral and written submissions to the ICJ. Although the ICJ advisory opinion did not provide a clear understanding of the Clause, several of submissions to the court provided an insight into its meaning. The evidence that Ticehurst presents is that just as in 1899 there was a disagreement between the great powers and the minor powers that lead to the formulation of the Clause, so in 1996 a similar divergence of views exists between the declared nuclear powers and the non nuclear powers with the nuclear powers taking a narrow view of the Clause and the non nuclear powers taking a more expansive view. Ticehurst concludes that: Judicial review Several national and international courts have considered the Martens Clause when making their judgements. In none of these cases however have the laws of humanity or the dictates of the public conscience been recognised as new and independent right. The clause served rather as general statement for humanitarian principles as well as guideline to the understanding and interpretation of existing rules of international law. The Martens Clause was quoted in the following judicial rulings: * Decision of the Supreme Court of Norway on 27 February 1946 in appeal proceedings against Karl-Hans Hermann Klinge, Kriminalassistent of the Gestapo (confirmation of the death sentence imposed by the first instance)Trial of Kriminalassistent Karl-Hans Hermann Klinge * Decision of the US military tribunal III in Nuremberg on 10 February 1948 in the case United States v.

He held the Chair for the shortest period of any holder to date, resigning from his position immediately after giving his opening address. Early life Lee was born at Melrose, Roxburghshire in 1793, the second son of John Lee, an agriculturist. He was educated at Galashiels, chiefly by the Reverend Robert Balmer, until in 1806, at age thirteen, he went to the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated MD in 1814. After his graduation he was appointed Physician's Clerk to James Hamilton, Professor of Midwifery at the University of Edinburgh, a position he relinquished in 1817. Career In 1824 Lee accepted an appointment as personal physician to Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, Governor-General of the Crimea. Through this office he met Alexander I of Russia in 1825. He described his experiences in Russia in the book The Last Days of Alexander and the First Days of Nicholas, published in 1854. Returning to London in 1827, Lee was appointed in 1830 a Fellow of the Royal Society, an institution with which he maintained a long and acrimonious relationship, particularly over the disputed award of a Royal Medal to Thomas Snow Beck. Through the offices of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, Lee was appointed Regius Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow in 1834. However, he resigned after his opening speech and returned immediately to London. Between 1835 and 1866 he was lecturer at St George's Hospital, London, on midwifery and the diseases of women. In 1841 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.

The team implementing DI consisted of Siegfried Engelmann, Carl Bereiter, and Jean Osborn. The program incorporated short instructional periods, usually 20 to 30 minutes a day. The instructional periods focused on language, reading, and math. The children showed vast improvement which led to further development of the approach used. When further developing DI, they applied the same principles to create a formal instructional program that included language, reading, and math. The formal program was termed DISTAR, for Direct Instruction System for Teaching Arithmetic and Reading. In the late 1960s, Project Follow Through included DI as one of the programs to compare the outcomes of over 20 different educational interventions in high-poverty communities. The study was a large government-funded study that was implemented over a multiyear period. DI was implemented in 19 different sites which ranged in demographic and geographic characteristics. The results indicated that DI was the only intervention that had significantly positive impacts on all outcomes that were measured.Stockard, J., Wood, T., Coughlin, C., & Rasplica Khoury, C. (2018). The Effectiveness of Direct Instruction Curricula: A Meta-Analysis of a Half Century of Research. Review of Educational Research, 88(4), 479-507 Direct Instruction has been effectively delivered through peers to students with learning disabilities.Marchand-Martella, & Martella (2002) An Overview and Research Summary of Peer-Delivered Corrective Reading. The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (2), 214 -235 Peer delivery offers teachers new ways to use the curriculum. The approach has also been examined as a model to assist students in a resource room with homework completion, bolster executive functioning skills and improve teacher efficiency. Success for All Another popular direct instruction approach is the Success for All program, which uses scripted teaching to instruct elementary children in phonics intensive reading instruction program. What the teacher says is carefully scripted in the program. The program was designed by Johns Hopkins University professor Robert Slavin in the mid-1980s for failing schools in Baltimore. The program requires a dedicated 90 minutes of reading instruction each day in which the teacher must follow a pre-ordained lesson plan that has every minute filled with scripted instruction and specific activities designed to teach reading. Jonathan Kozol criticized the program in his book, The Shame of the Nation, for being excessively dogmatic, utilitarian, and authoritarian. English language learners (ELL) students could also benefit from Direct Instruction. The program for teaching English to Spanish speaking students begins with teachers giving instruction in Spanish and then gradually incorporating more and more English in the directions. As with all Direct Instruction programs, the Direct Instruction groups are also kept small and with others of similar skill levels. Effectiveness Features that make Direct Instruction effective: : *Only 10% of material is new while the remaining 90% of material is a review of previously taught content. *Students are grouped based on their skill levels that is determined by assessments administered before commencing the Direct Instruction program. *Emphasis on student's pace by either slowing down, reteaching or accelerating through easily understood material. *External validity of Direct Instruction has been tested and the program is research- based. Debates about the efficacy of DI have raged since before the final results of Project Follow Through were published; however, there is substantial empirical research supporting its effectiveness. A meta-analysis published by Adams & Engelmann (1996), a chief architect of the DI program, finds a \\"mean effect size average per study...(as) more than .75, which confirms that the overall effect is substantial.\\" In some special education programs, it is used in a resource room with small groups of students. Some research has shown benefit with this model.Resource Room Teachers' use of Strategies that Promote the Success of Handicapped Students in Regular Classrooms Nancy K. Glomb and Daniel P. Morgan Journal of Special Education, Jan 1991; vol. 25: pp. 221 - 235 Direct Instruction is used with students from every population segment (with regard to poverty, culture, and race). In Project Follow Through, the DI model was ranked first in achievement for poor students, students who were not poor, urban students, rural students, African American students, Hispanic students, and Native American students. Today, many of the Bureau of Indian Affair's highest-performing schools use Direct Instruction materials. The Baltimore Curriculum Project has many schools with Free and Reduced Lunch Rates above 75% serving student populations that are more than 90% African American. These schools have shown strong achievement gains using Direct Instruction.Rebar, M. (2007). Academic acceleration in first grade using the Direct Instruction model. (Report No. 2007-1). Cheney, WA: Eastern Washington University. Meta-analysis of 85 single-subject design studies comparing direct instruction to other teaching strategies found the effects to be substantial for students with learning disabilities;Swanson, H.L. & Sachse-Lee, C. (2000). A Meta-Analysis of Single-Subject-Design Intervention Research for Students with LD. Journal of Learning Disabilities, Vol. 33, No. 2, 114-136 however, when qualified by IQ and reading levels strategy instruction (SI) had better effects for the high IQ group. For the low-IQ discrepancy groups, higher effect sizes were yielded for a Combined DI and SI Model when compared to all competing models. With the exception of handwriting, DI's effects were all above 0.8 (i.e., reading and mathematics). John Hattie's Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement (2009) summarizes the results of four meta-analyses that examined Direct Instruction. These analyses incorporated 304 studies of over 42,000 students. Across all of these students, the average effect size was 0.59 and was significantly larger than those of any other curriculum Hattie studied. Direct Instruction is recognized as one of two effective models of comprehensive school reform and, in many cases, can be integrated into a tiered model system to address students with developing problems.Stewart, R.M., Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. & Benner, G.J. (2005). Three- Tier Models of Reading and Behavior. JEIBI 2 (3), 115-123 The findings from Project Follow Through, conducted in a variety of selected communities throughout the United States, suggested that Direct Instruction is the most effective model for teaching academic skills and for affective outcomes (e.g., self-esteem) of children. Recent large-scale studies (1997–2003), such as the Baltimore Curriculum Project, show that it is possible to help schools that are in the lowest twenty percent with respect to academic achievement steadily improve until they are performing well above average. In some cases, school achievement improved from the 16th percentile to above the 90th percentile. Criticism Common criticisms: Teachers often express animosity towards the methods of Direct Instruction claiming that it limits both student creativity and teacher creativity in the classroom due to its strict, scripted procedures. Another common concern of those who disagree with Direct Instruction programs is their expense. Many argue that the current expense of implementing Direct Instruction programs is too high and unreasonable for low SES schools or school districts. Some prices of student workbooks are about $20 each while teacher workbook pricing can range from $180-$232 as seen on the McGraw Hill website, who is the main distributor of Direct Instruction materials (NIFDI, 2005). Other criticisms: One three-year study of methods of teaching reading showed that highly scripted, teacher-directed methods of teaching reading were not as effective as traditional methods that allowed a more flexible approach.Ryder RJ, Burton JL, Silberg A. 2006. Longitudinal study of direct instruction effects from first through third grade. Journal of Educational Research, 99, 3, 179-191 Urban teachers in particular expressed great concern over the DI's lack of sensitivity to issues of poverty, culture, and race. The former president of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), Anne Tweed, questioned whether direct instruction was the most effective science teaching strategy. In the December 15, 2004 NSTA Reports she concluded that \\"direct instruction alone cannot replace the in-depth experience with science concepts that inquiry-based strategies provide.\\"Tweed, a. (2004). Direct Instruction: Is It the Most Effective Science Teaching Strategy? NSTA Reports, 15 December 2004. Retrieved 5 August 2013 Some critics also see DI as a betrayal of the humanistic, egalitarian foundations of adult public education, or as a \\"canned\\" or \\"teacher proof\\" curriculum deliverable via unskilled teachers.From behaviorism to humanism: Incorporating self- direction in learning concepts into the instructional design process.

Norman, OK: Oklahoma Research Center for Continuing Professional and Higher Education, University of Oklahoma, 1994 (Roger Hiemstra & Ralph Brockett) In Australia, where DI has been used in schools among several remote Indigenous Australians communities in Queensland, DI has been criticised for its high cost in return for at best modest improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, as well as its US-centric theme which is alien to indigenous Australian cultures.Misty Adoniou.

It is often abbreviated as SSC or CSC. A Species of Special Concern is a species, subspecies, or distinct population of an animal native to California that currently satisfies one or more of the following (not necessarily mutually exclusive) criteria:CDFW webpage: Species of Special Concern * it is extirpated from the State or, in the case of birds, in its primary seasonal or breeding role; * it is listed as threatened or endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) but not under the State ESA; * it meets the State ESA definition of threatened or endangered but has not formally been listed under the State ESA; * it is experiencing, or formerly experienced, serious (noncyclical) population declines or range retractions (that have not been reversed) that, if continued or resumed, could qualify it for threatened or endangered status under the State ESA; * it has naturally small populations exhibiting high susceptibility to risk from any factor(s), that if realized, could lead to declines that would qualify it for threatened or endangered status under the State ESA. Definitions from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife \\"Species of Special Concern\\" status applies to animals not listed under the federal Endangered Species Act or the California Endangered Species Act, but which nonetheless (1) are declining at a rate that could result in listing, or (2) historically occurred in low numbers and known threats to their persistence currently exist. SSC share one or more of the following criteria: These are species that are not endangered or threatened, but their population number is in special concern of wildlife foundations. # Occur in small, isolated populations or in fragmented habitat, and are threatened by further isolation and population reduction; # Show marked population declines. Population estimates are unavailable for the vast majority of taxa. Species that show a marked population decline, yet are still abundant, do not meet the Special Concern definition, whereas marked population decline in uncommon or rare species is an inclusion criterion; # Depend on a habitat that has shown substantial historical or recent declines in size. This criterion infers the population viability of a species based on trends in the habitats upon which it specializes. Coastal wetlands, particularly in the urbanized San Francisco Bay and south-coastal areas, alluvial fan sage scrub and coastal sage scrub in the southern coastal basins, and arid scrub in the San Joaquin Valley, are examples of California habitats that have seen dramatic reductions in size in recent history. Species that specialize in these habitats generally meet the criteria for Threatened or Endangered status or Special Concern status; # Occur only in or adjacent to an area where habitat is being converted to land uses incompatible with the animal's survival; # Have few California records, or which historically occurred here but for which there are no recent records; and # Occur largely on public lands, but where current management practices are inconsistent with the animal's persistence. This designation is intended to result in special consideration for these animals by the Department, land managers, consulting biologists, and others, and is intended to focus attention on the species to help avert the need for costly listing under federal and State endangered species laws and cumbersome recovery efforts that might ultimately be required. This designation also is intended to stimulate collection of additional information on the biology, distribution, and status of poorly known at-risk species, and focus research and management attention on them. Department staff should consider SSCs during (1) the environmental review process, (2) conservation planning process, (3) the preparation of management plans for Department lands, and (4) inventories, surveys, and monitoring (conducted either by the Department or others with whom we are cooperating). The Habitat Conservation Planning Branch (HCPB) is responsible for producing and periodically updating SSC publications that provide the following information: description of the animal, taxonomic remarks, distribution (text description), life history, habitat, status, management recommendations, and a range and/or distribution map. Publications currently exist based on the following taxonomic groups: mammals (1986, new version due 2001), birds (1978, new version due 2001), amphibians and reptiles (1994), and fishes (1995). These publications are updated periodically as staff and funding allow. Publications are typically produced by a contractor knowledgeable about the species groups. The contractor's draft publication is reviewed by Department regional and headquarters staff, as well as by the contractor's peers, other agencies, and other biologists, as appropriate. Final publication of an SSC document requires approval of the Director. The HCPB staff is available to assist with questions, provide expertise and/or names of species experts, coordinate funding requests, and answer policy questions related to SSCs.

Early life Julian Mond was the younger son of Henry Mond, 2nd Baron Melchett and Gwen Wilson. He was educated at Eton and rather than going to university joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1942. Here he served in the Atlantic and on the Russian convoys.Greenaway, Frank, (2004) 'Mond family ( 1867-1973)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press Retrieved on 9 March 2007. His elder brother, Lieutenant The Honourable Derek John Henry Mond, was serving on HMS Philante when he was killed in a flying accident near Lochalsh on 30 April 1945. Thus on their father's death in 1949, Julian succeeded as 3rd Baron Melchett of Landford in the County of Southampton and 3rd Baronet of Hartford Hill in Great Budworth in the County of Chester. Business career After leaving the armed forces, Melchett joined Air Contractors Ltd, a subsidiary of the merchant bank M. Samuel & Co. A year later in 1948, supported by the bank, he founded a farming company based in Norfolk, British Field Products Limited, which specialised in grass-drying and animal feedstuffs. Melchett soon afterwards joined the merchant bankers M. Samuel & Co. This company merged with Philip Hill, Higginson and Erlanger Ltd to form Hill Samuel & Co. Limited and Melchett became director in charge of the banking and overseas departments. He was also a director of the Guardian Assurance Company and of the Anglo-American Shipping Co Ltd. He was an adviser to the British Transport Docks Board, a member of the council of administration of the Malta Dockyard and on the councils of the Confederation of British Industry and the National Economic Development Council. In 1966, Harold Wilson asked him to be chairman of a committee to plan the nationalization of the British steel industry, and from that time until his death he was effectively the chairman of what became the British Steel Corporation. This was formed from fourteen major iron and steel companies and other smaller ones who together employed more than a quarter of a million workers. Personal and family The Mond mausoleum Melchett married Sonia Elizabeth Graham in 1947. They had one son, Peter Robert Henry Mond, and two daughters, Kerena Ann Mond and Pandora Shelley Mond. For most of their married life they lived on Tite Street in Chelsea, and on a farm, Courtyard, at Ringstead in Norfolk. They built a villa, Casa Melchett, near Formentor in Majorca and used to go for family holidays there. Lord Melchett died while on holiday there in June 1973 and was buried in the family mausoleum in St Pancras cemetery, Finchley. A memorial service was held for him in Westminster Abbey. His estate was valued at slightly over £310,000.

It is called a 'king pair' if the batsman gets out for a golden duck [getting out on the first ball he faced] in both innings.

Most pairs in a Test career New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin has been dismissed without scoring in both innings during seven Test matches, three more than any other player. Five players have been dismissed for four pairs of ducks in Tests.

Mick Norman of Northamptonshire bagged a king pair in a single day against Glamorgan at St. Helen's in Swansea in June 1964. When Glamorgan followed on against the Indians at Cardiff Arms Park in June 1946, last man Peter Judge was bowled for a duck by Chandra Sarwate to end the county's first innings. Invited to follow-on, Glamorgan's captain Johnny Clay, who was the non-striker, decided to waive the 10-minute interval between innings, remained in the middle with Judge, and reversed the entire batting order. Sarwate then bowled Judge again, second ball, incidentally with the same ball, and Judge thus achieved the fastest pair in the history of first-class cricket.The coach who caught Sachin, and a much-travelled man, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 20 February 2009John Arlott: Basingstoke Boy 1992 Fontana Zimbabwe opening bat Hamilton Masakadza completed an unusual pair when he was dismissed for a Test duck twice on the same day, 28 January 2012, when his team's two innings were completed within a day.

They were monarchs of Naples, as well as various other territories. History The house began in the 1350s, when King John II of France, of the House of Valois line of Capetians, came to power. His paternal grandmother, Margaret, Countess of Anjou and Maine, had been a princess of the Capetian House of Anjou or Elder Angevin Dynasty. She was the eldest daughter of king Charles II of Naples and gave the county, and then duchy of Anjou to the second son of king John II of France, Louis. Within a couple of decades, Queen Joan I of Naples, also of the senior Angevin line, realized that she would remain childless. Although there were extant heirs of the senior branch, for example, the Anjou-Durazzo cadet line, she decided to adopt Louis as her final heir. Thus, in addition to the struggle of the Angevins with the Aragonese in Southern Italy, the two Angevin lines, senior and junior, now began to contest with each other for the possession of the Kingdom of Naples. The Anjou-Durazzo line was initially successful in securing control of Naples, but the Valois House of Anjou managed to secure Provence and continued to contest the throne, with Louis II actually in control of the city of Naples from 1389 to 1399. The extinction of the line of the House of Anjou-Durazzo in 1435 temporarily secured Naples for the Valois House of Anjou, but they were driven from Naples by Alfonso V of Aragon in 1442. René, the last duke of this, third, Angevin line, died in 1480, and Anjou reverted to the French crown. With the death of his nephew the Duke of Maine in 1481 all Angevin possessions, including Provence, reverted to the crown. The Angevin pretensions to Naples were continued intermittently by the House of Lorraine, which descended from René's eldest daughter Yolande, particularly during the Valois-Habsburg War of 1551 to 1559, when Francis, Duke of Guise, a member of a cadet branch of the family, led an unsuccessful French expedition against Naples.

Construction and early years Empire State VI was originally built for States Steamship Company in Newport News, Virginia at Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company as a MARAD Type C4-S-1u break bulk cargo freighter. She was delivered to the States Lines on 19 April 1962 as the SS Oregon, a name she kept until the vessel was purchased February 15, 1977 by Moore McCormack Lines who renamed the vessel Mormactide. She went to United States Lines in 1983 when USL purchased MML. Although not the last private owner of the vessel, Moore McCormack Lines was the last company to operate Empire State before being entered into government service, as USL only operated container ships. Government service In 1986 the last private owner of the vessel, United States Lines, went bankrupt and turned over Mormactide to the Federal Government's Maritime Administration (MARAD). She was originally designated to be converted to an ammunition ship, USNS Cape Junction (T-AK-507?). Meanwhile, the vessel was laid up in the James River, National Defense Reserve Fleet, Fort Eustis, Virginia. In 1988 Mormactide was taken to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, and underwent a conversion to a Training Ship at Bay Shipbuilding Corporation. After the conversion Mormactide was renamed Empire State VI. She was delivered to the State University of New York Maritime College at Fort Schuyler on New Year's Eve in 1989 to replace the slightly older Empire State V. In 1994 Empire State VI was activated by MARAD to support the withdrawal of American troops from Mogadishu, Somalia. In the 2005 aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita which devastated the Gulf Coast, MARAD again activated Empire State VI. The vessel provided housing and support for port workers and petroleum industry workers as they began repairs on strategic infrastructure and facilities in Louisiana. In the fall of 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck the New York/New Jersey area, the college offered the vessel to billet AmeriCorps - Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Corps and FEMA workers, from outside the region. and TS Kennedy were also used to house FEMA workers, and between them the three ships housed 1,200 workers. In September 2017, following the impact of Hurricane Harvey on the Gulf Coast of the United States, MARAD again activated the ship in order to provide support for FEMA's operations in Texas. However, after subsequent hurricanes made landfall in Florida and Puerto Rico the vessel was diverted to provide relief in the ports of Key West and San Juan, while in San Juan, the ship provided housing and meals to FEMA workers. Training voyage Empire State VI underway on its 2015 training voyage on May 11, 2015. Each summer Empire State VI is activated for a 100-day training voyage. Students in the Regiment of Cadets operate the vessel for a summer sea term as part of their training requirements. The vessel began its 2020 voyage on May 4. In March 2019 the college announced the appointment of Captain Morgan McManus, SUNY Maritime College 1992 graduate, as the vessel's new master. The ship holds the record as the longest serving power-driven vessel ever used by the school. While in very good condition given her age, she still has a steam power plant, despite diesel power having been the industry standard for decades. Her emissions also exceed international standards and this has affected her training itineraries. In 2015 a Congressional committee examined the cost of replacing the vessels of the six maritime academies where the average vessel age was 35 years, and Empire State was the oldest at 53 years. In March 2018 the US federal budget included funding to replace the aging training vessels with a National Security Multi-Mission Vessel design. The first vessel built was expected to replace Empire State in 2022 but the start of construction is now reported to be delayed to 2023.

The ship was named after the Prussian Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. She was the fourth member of the class, which included five other vessels. The Bismarck-class corvettes were ordered as part of a major naval construction program in the early 1870s, and she was designed to serve as a fleet scout and on extended tours in Germany's colonial empire. Moltke was laid down in July 1875, launched in October 1877, and was commissioned into the fleet in April 1878. She was armed with a battery of ten guns and had a full ship rig to supplement her steam engine on long cruises abroad. Moltke went on one major overseas deployment in the 1880s to South America. There, she visited ports in several South American countries in the aftermath of the War of the Pacific and carried the German expedition for the International Polar Year to South Georgia Island. After returning to Germany in 1885, she became a training ship for naval cadets and later apprentice seamen. The ship served in this capacity from 1885 to 1908, during which time her activity consisted primarily of fleet training exercises and overseas training cruises. These cruises frequently went to the West Indies and Mediterranean Sea. She was stricken from the naval register in October 1910, converted into a barracks ship, and assigned to the U-boat school in Kiel. In October 1911, Moltke was renamed Acheron and she served in this capacity until 1920, when she was sold to ship breakers in July and subsequently dismantled for scrap. Design left The six ships of the Bismarck class were ordered in the early 1870s to supplement Germany's fleet of cruising warships, which at that time relied on several ships that were twenty years old. Moltke and her sister ships were intended to patrol Germany's colonial empire and safeguard German economic interests around the world. Moltke was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 18 officers and 386 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove one 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, Moltke was equipped with a full ship rig, but this was later reduced. Moltke was armed with a battery of ten 22-caliber (cal.) quick-firing guns and two 30-cal. guns. She also carried six Hotchkiss revolver cannon. Service history Moltke was the first member of the to be laid down; construction began in July 1875 under the contract name Ersatz at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. Work proceeded more slowly on Moltke than her sister , since the government shipyards were not as experienced as the private builders like Norddeutsche Schiffbau AG that built Bismarck; Moltke proved to be the fourth member of the class to be launched and the class bore Bismarcks name rather than Moltkes as a result. At the launching ceremony for Moltke on 18 October 1877, Admiral Albrecht von Stosch christened the ship with the ship's namesake, Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Helmuth von Moltke, in attendance. Fitting-out work was completed by April 1878, and on the 16th she was commissioned for initial service. She was transferred to Kiel on 28–29 April, where her armament and other final pieces of equipment were installed. She began sea trials on 18 November, which were completed on 21 December. =Deployment to South America= Map of Royal Bay (in red), where Moltke brought the International Polar Year expedition Moltke was formally activated on 1 April 1881 for an overseas deployment to South America, which she began on 17 April. After arriving in Valparaiso, Chile on 14 July, she replaced the corvette and proceeded to Coquimbo, Chile, where riots due to the Peruvian victory in the War of the Pacific threatened Germans in the city. She arrived there on 19 July and remained there until mid-September, when she toured several port cities in Peru over the following two months. Moltke thereafter went further north and visited cities in Central America, including San José, Costa Rica. On 16 February 1882, Moltke returned to Valparaiso and on 14 March sailed north to Coquimbo. She remained there until 17 May, when she departed for Montevideo, Uruguay, but due to severe storms in the Strait of Magellan forced her to wait, and she was able to reach Montevideo only in late June. In Montevideo, Moltke embarked the scientific expedition Germany contributed to the first International Polar Year, which was to spend a year on South Georgia Island making scientific observations on a range of phenomena, including disturbances in the geomagnetic field. Moltke left Montevideo with the expedition aboard on 23 July, with their equipment carried aboard the HSDG steamship ; the two ships arrived at the island on 12 August after navigating heavy seas and icebergs. It took more than a week to find a suitable landing site, and on 21 August, the scientists went ashore at what is now known as Moltke Harbor on the north side of Royal Bay, which was named for the ship. They finished unloading their equipment and setting up their housing on 24 August with the help of the crew, and on 3 September, Moltke departed for other tasks. The corvette arrived the following year to retrieve the expedition. After leaving South George Island, Moltke sailed to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands, and from there she returned to the west coast of South America. Beginning on 20 October, she visited several Chilean ports and the Juan Fernández Islands. She returned to Valparaiso in late January 1883, where she met the corvette . Leipzig went to visit Hawaii while Moltke remained off South America, though she sailed north to tour Peru and Ecuador, beginning on 28 February. After returning to Valparaiso, Moltke received the order to return to Germany on 8 July. While passing through the Strait of Magellan, she conducted a survey of coastal waters. On 4 August, she met her replacement, Marie, before continuing north into the Atlantic. Moltke stopped in Porto Grande in the Cape Verde Islands while en route, and she reached Kiel on 2 October; she was decommissioned there on 23 October. =Training ship= 1885–1889 Illustration of Moltke in heavy seas Moltke returned to service on 15 April 1885 for use as a training ship for naval cadets. Shortly thereafter, she went on a training cruise in the Baltic Sea, and on 20 May, began a tour of Norwegian ports. She then crossed the northern Atlantic to Iceland, stopping in the Berufjörður and visiting Reykjavik. She left Iceland and on 2 July stopped in Lough Swilly, Ireland, where she stayed for a month. She then sailed to Portsmouth, Britain where on 15 August she received the order to return to Germany immediately to join the Training Squadron, which was to participate in the annual fleet exercises from 30 August to 23 September. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, she went to the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel on 25 September for maintenance in preparation for the next training cruise. Moltke rejoined the Training Squadron on 1 October, and the ships embarked on the next training cruise on 11 October, sailing to the West Indies. While on the way, the squadron stopped in São Vicente, Cape Verde from 13 to 30 November, during a period of tension between Germany and Spain over competing claims to the Caroline Islands in the central Pacific. After the conflict was resolved, the ships were ordered to continue their voyage. While in the West Indies, Moltke visited Port of Spain. The ships arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 27 March 1886, where the squadron was dissolved. Moltke went into the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel for an overhaul in April, after which the squadron was reformed for the 1886 training year. During the fleet maneuvers in August and September, the ships served as the II Division. On 14 October, the squadron began the winter training cruise, which again went to the West Indies and concluded in Wilhelmshaven on 30 March 1887. Moltke went to Kiel on 3 June to take part in a celebration marking the beginning of construction on the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, after which she took part in the annual fleet maneuvers. On 1 October, the Training Squadron began the winter cruise to the Mediterranean, and in December, while in Sanremo they took part in a naval review for then-Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who succeeded his father, Kaiser Wilhelm I after the latter's death on 9 March 1888. The ships arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 10 April , after which Moltke went to Kiel eight days later for another overhaul. The training year for 1888 was interrupted by the death of Friedrich Wilhelm after just three months on the throne, and Moltkes next activity was a trip to Russian and Scandinavian ports for the new Kaiser, Wilhelm II. The annual fleet maneuvers followed in August and September, and on 29 September, the winter training cruise to the Mediterranean began. Moltke visited numerous ports in Greece, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire before the squadron returned to Wilhelmshaven on 16 April 1889. The squadron was then disbanded and Moltke was decommissioned on 30 April. 1889–1897 Illustration of Moltke under sail, c. 1895 The ship was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel for an extensive reconstruction, which included new boilers, new quick-firing guns, and housing arrangements for up to 50 cadets and 210 Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen). Her rigging was also reduced. On 1 January 1891, she was formally assigned to the list of training ships, and she returned to service on 7 April; the ship's namesake and Wilhelm II attended this recommissioning ceremony. Moltke had to send a delegation to Berlin just three weeks later on 28 April for the funeral of Moltke, who had died four days before. Moltke began another training cruise on 15 June, visiting the West Indies, La Guaira, Venezuela, and Bahía Blanca, Argentina. While on the way back to Germany, she stopped in Norfolk, United States on 13 June 1892, and the Isle of Wight for the Cowes Regatta in early August. Here, she joined Wilhelm II aboard his yacht, Hohenzollern, before continuing on to Kiel, arriving on 9 August. She joined the fleet maneuvers immediately thereafter, and was decommissioned on 30 September after their conclusion. Moltke returned to service on 5 April 1893 and she conducted training in the Baltic Sea, which lasted until 8 June. During this period, she suffered a serious accident on 24 May, when the steamship accidentally collided with one of Moltkes dinghies and capsized it, killing six Schiffsjungen. Moltke joined the fleet maneuvers as part of III Division, beginning on 20 August and continuing until 22 September. The winter cruise began on 14 October and went to the Mediterranean. Moltke visited Piraeus on 21 January 1894, where she was visited by Wilhelm II, his sister Sophia of Prussia, and her husband, Crown Prince Constantine of Greece. Wilhelm arranged the visit over the objections of Chancellor Leo von Caprivi, who opposed a friendly visit due to the Greek government's stoppage of payments toward foreign loans, many of which were held by Germany. A week later, Moltke went to Corfu, where she stayed for four weeks. While Moltke was in Corfu, she received orders to sail to Abbazia, where Kaiserin Friedrich was staying at a spa. Moltke took Kaiserin Friedrich aboard and transported her to Fiume, where she met the Austro-Hungarian Kaiser Franz Joseph I on 29 March. On 6 April, Franz Joseph I came aboard the ship as well for a trip to Pola for a naval review of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Moltke then took Kaiserin Friedrich to Venice from 16 to 18 April, where she met with the Italian King Umberto I. On 28 April, Moltke began the voyage back to Germany, arriving in Kiel on 18 June. She returned to the Training Squadron on 14 August, which during the fleet maneuvers became II Squadron. The annual winter cruise followed on 25 September, this time going to the West Indies and concluding on 22 March 1895. Moltke began individual training thereafter, though this was interrupted in June by a celebration marking the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Moltke then went on a cruise in the Baltic that lasted until 12 July, after which she visited Edinburgh, Scotland. She returned to Germany for the annual maneuvers, which lasted from 13 August to 17 September. A week later, she embarked on the winter cruise to the Mediterranean; while in Cadiz, Morocco, she received orders to proceed to Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire as quickly as possible, since unrest in the area threatened Germans in the city. She arrived there on 15 November, joining the aviso , which was the station ship in Constantinople. In January 1896, Moltke was withdrawn to continue her training duties, and she visited numerous ports in the region, including Messina, Haifa, Port Said, and Naples. She returned to Kiel on 23 March and went into the shipyard for another overhaul. The training program for 1896 began on 12 May with a cruise in the Baltic, followed by a visit to Britain and Ireland that began on 26 June. While touring the country, Moltke accidentally ran aground lightly off the Hebrides on 17 July, but she was able to free herself without incurring any damage. She arrived back in Kiel on 2 August, after which she joined III Division for the annual fleet maneuvers. On 26 September, the winter cruise to the West Indies began, but while in Madiera, Moltke was diverted to the coast of Syria in the Ottoman Empire to protect German interests in the area that were threatened by civil unrest. She was joined in this operation by her sisters , , and . Moltke was able to return to Germany, leaving Alexandria on 10 February 1897 and arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 17 March. She then moved to Kiel, and while en route, an accident with one of her anchor chains injured 13 men. She was decommissioned in Kiel on 14 April for repairs. 1898–1920 left The ship remained out of service until 5 April 1898, when she was recommissioned; training cruises in the Baltic had to be stopped on 16 June due to an outbreak of measles among the ship's crew. In July, she began a tour of Norwegian ports, including stops in Larvik, Bergen, and Odde, where on 7 July she met Hohenzollern and the aviso . Moltke and Hohenzollern then went to Drontheim, before Moltke proceeded alone to Lerwick in the Shetland Islands. She arrived back in Kiel on 30 July. In the second half of August, she served in V Division for the fleet maneuvers, though she left on 3 September for a cruise to the West Indies. While she was in the area, the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War, and Germany feared that unrest in Cuba would threaten Germans, so she was sent to Havana. Her presence proved to be unnecessary, and so on 10 January 1899, she left the city and returned to Kiel, arriving there on 23 March. Moltke embarked on another cruise in the Baltic on 24 May 1899, followed by another cruise to the West Indies on 5 July. This voyage included a tour of South American ports, including Rio de Janeiro. From 22 to 29 December, she stayed in Charlotte Amalie on the island of Saint Thomas. She visited New Orleans from 10 to 20 January 1900, the first time a German warship stopped in the city, before returning to Germany, arriving in Kiel on 25 March. Several Baltic cruises followed between 25 May and 28 July, and then again from 11 August to 12 September, the latter period including visits to Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Stavanger. She embarked on another cruise to the Mediterranean on 17 September, and while in Gibraltar from 9 to 14 October, 200 men of the crew organized a commemoration ceremony at the cemetery where crew from the corvette who had been killed at the Battle of Tres Forcas in 1856. Moltke stopped in Beirut on 7 December, where her commander participated in a ceremony at the tomb of Saladin. She visited other ports in the region, and on 24 January 1901, entered the Dardanelles after having received permission from Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire. She left the straits on 30 January, and arrived back in Kiel on 24 February. The ship was overhauled on returning to Germany before beginning a hydrographic survey of the Adlergrund on 21 May, where the battleship had run around and been badly damaged earlier that year. The survey work ended on 18 June, and on 1 August, she began the annual training cruise, which began with visits to Copenhagen and the Faroe Islands and continued on to the West Indies, where a conflict between Venezuela and Colombia threatened German economic interests. She left the area on 19 December and proceeded north to Baltimore, arriving on 24 January 1902 and then visiting Washington, D.C., where she was visited by President Theodore Roosevelt, and then stopping in Annapolis, the site of the US Naval Academy. She then returned across the Atlantic, stopping in Dartmouth to celebrate the laying of the cornerstone of the new building at the Royal Naval College. Moltke arrived in Kiel on 20 March. Moltke serving as a U-boat tender A training cruise in the Baltic followed from 17 May to 17 June, after which Moltke embarked on the next major overseas cruise, with stops in Stockholm, Drontheim, and Funchal on the way to the Mediterranean. She cruised in the western end of the Mediterranean Sea beginning on 1 January 1903, and arrived back in Kiel on 24 March. A fire broke out aboard the ship on 6 April, necessitating repairs at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel that lasted approximately five weeks. She then went on a cruise in the Baltic, before departing for another Mediterranean cruise on 7 August. Stops during this voyage included Fiume, Corfu, and Constantinople; heavy storms forced her to stop in Santander, Spain. The ship returned to Kiel on 21 March 1904. As was typical, a cruise in the Baltic followed on 16 May, after which she went on another cruise to the West Indies and the United States that ended on 17 March 1905. She was decommissioned in Kiel on 31 March for an overhaul. Moltke remained out of service until 4 April 1907 when she was recommissioned for the last time. She made a cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to South American waters, which included a visit to Rio de Janeiro and a tour of the West Indies. This proved to be the last time Moltke went to sea; she arrived back in Kiel on 23 March 1908, where she was decommissioned on 7 April, her place in the Training Squadron having been taken by the protected cruiser . Moltke was stricken from the naval register on 24 October 1910, having been allocated to the U-boat school in Kiel. She was then converted into a barracks ship and renamed Acheron on 28 October 1911 so her name could be used for the battlecruiser that had just entered service. Acheron served in this capacity until 7 July 1920, when she was sold and thereafter broken up.

Early life Ed Turney was born in Brooklyn, New York. His early years were spent in Ridgewood and later in Huntington, Long Island. At the age of 18, he enlisted in the US Navy where he received his first training in electronics. Turney graduated 3rd in his class from the U.S. Naval School, Electronics Technicians at the U.S. Naval Training Center in Great Lakes, Illinois. Career After leaving the Navy, Turney worked for a brief time back on his native Long Island for the Long Island Lighting Company. His next stop was at Philco as a TechRep Field Engineer. Turney's career took off when, in 1969, he joined Fairchild Semiconductor as Sales Engineer. Within two years, he was promoted to Director of Sales and Marketing, Computer Market based in corporate headquarters, Silicon Valley, California. In 1969 Fairchild Semiconductor was taken over by Motorola management. This was the impetus for the founding of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). AMD was founded by Jerry Sanders, John Carey, Sven Simonsen, Ed Turney, Jack Gifford and three members of Gifford's team, Frank Botte, Jim Giles and Larry Stenger. As Vice President, Sales and Administration, Turney was responsible for worldwide sales, purchasing, material, customer service, plus numerous diversified administrative and contractual functions. Under Turney's reign, sales grew incrementally at 20% per quarter to approximately $65,000,000 from first production in April 1970 through December 1974. Ed Turney's next position was as Vice President, Worldwide Marketing and Sales at Electronic Arrays. In Turney's two-year stint from 1974 to 1976 he increased sales from $6M to $22M propelling the company into becoming the world's largest Read-Only Memory manufacturer at the time. The company was subsequently acquired by NEC of Japan. In December, 1976, Ed joined Intersil as Vice President, Worldwide Marketing and Sales. He had been solicited by the Board Chairmen of both companies at the time of acquisition of Intersil by Advanced Memory Systems to integrate sales and marketing for the combined companies and to formulate and execute consolidated business plans. Turney developed and implemented a multi-year, award-winning advertising campaign to create a new image for the company. He received the EFFIE Award, given for the most effective advertising commercials. At that time, Intersil was the only semiconductor company in the nation to have received the award. Death Turney died on October 15, 2008, of brain cancer at age 79. He was buried on October 18 at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery, 22555 Cristo Rey Drive, Los Altos. He is buried in St. Theresa’s Court next to his mother, Rose. References Further reading *The Spirit of AMD by Jeffrey L.

Biography Maria Anna as a child, by Louis de Silvestre. C. 1735. Maria Anna's parents had sixteen children; her most notable siblings were Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony, Queen Maria Amalia of Spain and Maria Josepha, Dauphine of France, the mother of Kings Louis XVI, Louis XVIII of France, and Charles X of France. Maria Anna was married to her first cousin, the Bavarian Elector Maximilian III Joseph in 1747. Having no children of her own, Maria Anna negotiated with King Frederick II of Prussia after her husband's death in 1777 to secure Bavaria's independence against Austria and to support the succession rights of the Wittelsbach branch Palatinate Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld in Bavaria, when the new Elector of Bavaria Charles Theodore attempted to cede Lower Bavaria to Austria. A secret treaty with Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II had been concluded in the end. In exchange for Lower Bavaria, Charles Theodore was to receive the Austrian Netherlands (close to his ancestral domains), the Palatinate (already his patrimony), Jülich and Berg. However, these plans failed with the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778, in which King Frederick II stifled the Austrian attempts to exchange the Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria. When Emperor Joseph II tried the scheme again in 1784, Frederick II created the Fürstenbund. After her husband Maximilian III Joseph died, Maria Anna Sophia spent the rest of her life at Fürstenried Palace and enjoyed the gratitude of the Bavarian people and the heirs of the Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld branch: Charles II, Duke of Zweibrücken, and his brother Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, who finally succeeded Charles Theodore in 1799 as first King of Bavaria.

It is Haneke's debut feature film. The film chronicles the last years of an Austrian family, which consists of Georg, an engineer; his wife Anna, an optician; and their young daughter, Eva. They lead routine urban middle-class lives, with hopes of escaping to Australia to start a new life, but suddenly decide to destroy themselves without any apparent reason. The film was selected as the Austrian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot The film is divided into three parts. The first two, 1987 and 1988, each depict a day in the family's life, showing their daily activities in detail. It conveys their discomfort with the sterile routines of modern society. Toward the beginning of each part, there is a voice over of the wife reading a letter to the husband's parents informing them of his success at work. Many of the same activities are shown in both parts. The third part, 1989, begins with the family departing from the grandparents' home after a visit. The husband then narrates a letter, written the next day, informing them he and his wife have quit their jobs and decided \\"to leave\\". It plays over clips of them quitting, closing their bank account, telling the clerk they are emigrating to Australia, selling their car, and buying a large variety of cutting tools. He then says it was a very hard decision whether or not to take Eva with them, but they decided to do so after she said she was not afraid of death. The family then eats a luxurious meal, and goes about systematically destroying every possession in the house, but in an automatic and lifeless manner, with barely any speaking (as are almost all of their actions in the movie). They rip up all of their money and flush it down the toilet. The only emotion shown is when Georg shatters their large fish tank, and his daughter screams and cries hysterically. Finally, they commit suicide by overdosing on pills dissolved in water, first Eva, then Anna, and finally Georg, who vomits up the liquid and must resort to injecting himself using a syringe. Just before he dies, Georg is shown methodically writing the names, date, and time of death of all three family members on the wall, providing a question mark for his own time of death. There is an envelope addressed to Georg's parents taped to the door. At the end of the film, there is text saying that, despite the suicide note, Georg's parents thought it may have been a homicide and a police investigation was conducted. No evidence of murder was found. Title The film's title is a reference to Australia, the continent mentioned in the film as the family's destination. Its image is visualized as an isolated beach and desert, with a mountain range on the left border and pool of water with mysterious waves (which are clearly physically impossible) in between, accompanied by discreet sounds of waves in an ominous tone. Australia is symbolised as the ideal place to escape to for the doomed Austrian family. It appears in the first two parts and as the last image in a series of flashbacks shown before the death of Georg. Background Michael Haneke said that the film is based on a news article he read about a family who committed suicide in this manner; police discovered that their money was flushed because bits of currency were found in the plumbing. Haneke claims to have correctly predicted to the producer that audiences would be upset with that scene, and remarked that in today's society the idea of destroying money is more taboo than parents killing their child and themselves. Reception The film was awarded Bronze Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival and the prize for Best Application of Music and Sound in Film at the Ghent International Film Festival. It has a weighted average of 89/100 on Metacritic, and a 67% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The Cusacks of Killeen, Co. Meath. O.Cist. A charter of 1439, a few years before his father's death, refers to the younger Sir Christopher as lord of the manor of Dunsany. (Dns. de Dunsany). He is referred to by William Camden, in the next century, as being the first Baron of Dunsany, that is: an hereditary member of the Irish House of Lords. What year he became a peer is uncertain. The first reference to the Dunsanys as peers is in the roll of the two Irish earls and eleven Irish barons who met with Henry VII of England and Ireland at Greenwich in 1489; the third Lord Dunsany, Sir Christopher's grandson, is listed last of the eleven, after Lord Trimleston; other Irish parliaments use almost the same order of precedence. It so happens that we know the date of the patent of the Barony of Trimleston to be 4 March 1462; it is one of two baronial patents that survive. Cokayne concludes, in the Complete Peerage, that, if this precedence represents the date of creation, then, since Sir Christopher's will is dated 1 August 1462, probably shortly before his death, the Barony of Dunsany was created in that year. The Complete Peerage also notes, however, that the order of precedence was likely to reflect the relative importance of the lords, rather than the age of their titles. Debrett's single sourceless sentence on the subject describes the charter of 1439 as a writ, although Cokayne denies that Ireland recognised the creation of peerages by writ; some websites have copied Debrett. Christopher Plunkett was succeeded by his son Richard Plunkett, 2nd Baron of Dunsany. References *G. E.

It consists of a 16th-century tower house, extended by the addition of a range of cottages. The castle is set in of planted grounds, including a 18th-century walled garden. Lodge House History The lands of Kames were granted to the Bannatyne family by Robert the Bruce in the 14th century. Although of 14th-century appearance, the present tower house is thought to date from the 16th century. The last Bannatyne owner was Sir William Macleod Bannatyne (1743–1833), a distinguished lawyer and judge in Edinburgh, who took the title Lord Bannatyne on promotion to the College of Justice in 1799. In the later 18th and early 19th century he laid out the walled garden and constructed a mansion adjoining the tower house. Kames was the birthplace and early home of the critic and essayist John Sterling (1806–1844). Thomas Carlyle in his biography of Sterling refers to the castle as \\"a kind of dilapidated baronial residence to which a small farm was then attached\\". Lord Bannatyne sold the estate around 1810, to James Hamilton WS, preferring his social life in Edinburgh. Kames Castle became part of the Marquess of Bute's estate in 1863. Some alterations to the tower house were undertaken in the later 19th century. Around 1900 the mansion was demolished and replaced with a series of cottages around a courtyard, with the intention of creating a hunting lodge. In the mid to late 20th century, Kames was used as a children's holiday home, run by the Scottish Council for Spastics. It is now privately owned, with a number of cottages available as holiday lets.

It is small, hardy, and has a docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and possibly brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock may have become feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands by one of the exploratory expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville. Populations are found on Ocracoke Island, Shackleford Banks, Currituck Banks, Cedar Island,Mark Price (24 september 2019): 28 wild horses drowned... The Charlotte Observer and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary. Bankers are allowed to remain on the islands due to their historical significance even though they can trample plants and ground-nesting animals and are not considered to be indigenous. They survive by grazing on marsh grasses, which supply them with water as well as food, supplemented by temporary freshwater pools. To prevent overpopulation and inbreeding, and to protect their habitat from being overgrazed, the horses are managed by the National Park Service, the state of North Carolina, and several private organizations. The horses are monitored for diseases, such as equine infectious anemia, an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996. They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained have been used for trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.  Characteristics  A map showing herd locations The typical Banker is relatively small, standing between high at the withers and weighing . The forehead is broad and the facial profile tends to be straight or slightly convex. The chest is deep and narrow and the back is short with a sloped croup and low-set tail. Legs have an oval-shaped cannon bone, a trait considered indicative of \\"strong bone\\" or soundness. Callouses known as chestnuts are small, on some so tiny that they are barely detectable. Most Bankers have no chestnuts on the hind legs. The coat can be any color but is most often brown, bay, dun, or chestnut. Bankers have long-strided gaits and many are able to pace and amble. They are easy keepers and are hardy, friendly, and docile. Several of the Bankers' characteristics indicate that they share ancestry with other Colonial Spanish horse breeds. The presence of the genetic marker \\"Q-ac\\" suggests that the horses share common ancestry with two other breeds of Spanish descent, the Pryor Mountain Mustang and Paso Fino. These breeds diverged from one another 400 years ago. The breed shares skeletal traits of other Colonial Spanish horses: the wings of the atlas are lobed, rather than semicircular; and they are short-backed, with some individuals possessing five instead of six lumbar vertebrae. No changes in function result from these spinal differences. The convex facial profile common to the breed also indicates Spanish ancestry.  Breed history  Since they are free-roaming, Bankers are often referred to as \\"wild\\" horses; however, because they descend from domesticated ancestors, they are feral horses. It is thought that the Bankers arrived on the barrier islands during the 16th century. Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the horses' origins, but none have yet been fully verified. Aerial view of a barrier island in the North Carolina Outer Banks One theory is that ancestors of the Banker swam ashore from wrecked Spanish galleons. Ships returning to Spain from the Americas often took advantage of both the Gulf Stream and continental trade winds, on a route that brought them within of the Outer Banks. Hidden shoals claimed many victims, and earned this region the name of \\"Graveyard of the Atlantic\\". At least eight shipwrecks discovered in the area are of Spanish origin, dating between 1528 and 1564. These ships sank close enough to land for the horses to have made the shores. Alternatively, during hazardous weather, ships may have taken refuge close to shore, where the horses may have been turned loose. However, the presence of horses on Spanish treasure ships has not been confirmed—cargo space was primarily intended for transporting riches such as gold and silver. Another conjecture is that the breed is descended from the 89 horses brought to the islands in 1526 by Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. His attempted colonization of San Miguel de Gualdape (near the Santee River in South Carolina) failed, forcing the colonists to move, possibly to North Carolina. Vázquez de Ayllón and about 450 of the original 600 colonists subsequently died as a result of desertion, disease, and an early frost. Lacking effective leadership, the new settlement lasted for only two months; the survivors abandoned the colony and fled to Hispaniola, leaving their horses behind. A similar theory is that Sir Richard Grenville brought horses to the islands in 1585 during an attempt to establish an English naval base. All five of the expedition's vessels ran aground at Wococon (present-day Ocracoke). Documents indicate that the ships carried various types of livestock obtained through trade in Hispaniola, including \\"mares, kyne [cattle], buls, goates, swine [and] sheep.\\" While the smaller vessels were easily refloated, one of Grenville's larger ships, the Tiger, was nearly destroyed. Scholars believe that as the crew attempted to lighten the ship, they either unloaded the horses or forced them overboard, letting them swim to shore. In a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham that same year, Grenville suggested that livestock survived on the island after the grounding of his ships.  Life on the barrier islands  Drinking from a horse-dug water hole on Shackleford Banks About 400 Bankers inhabit the long, narrow barrier islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks. These islands are offshore sediment deposits separated from the mainland by a body of water such as an estuary or sound. The islands can be up to from the shore; most are less than one mile (1.6 km) wide. Vegetation is sparse and consists mainly of coarse grasses and a few stunted trees. Each island in the chain is separated from the next by a tidal inlet. The Bankers' small stature can be attributed, in part, to limited nutrients in their diet. They graze mostly on Spartina grasses but will feed on other plants such as bulrush (Typha latifolia), sea oats, and even poison ivy. Horses living closer to human habitation, such as those on Currituck Banks, have sometimes grazed on residential lawns and landscaping. Domesticated Bankers raised on manufactured horse feed from an early age tend to exhibit slightly larger frames. Fresh water is a limiting resource for Bankers, as the islands are surrounded by salt water and have no freshwater springs or permanent ponds. The horses are dependent on ephemeral pools of rainwater and moisture in the vegetation they consume. Bankers will dig shallow holes, ranging from in depth, to reach fresh groundwater. Occasionally, they may resort to drinking seawater. This gives them a bloated appearance, a consequence of water retention caused by the body's effort to maintain osmotic balance.  Land use controversies  The National Park Service (NPS) is concerned about the impact of Bankers on the environmental health of North Carolina's barrier islands. Initially, the NPS believed that the non-native Bankers would completely consume the Spartina alterniflora grasses and the maritime forests, as both were thought to be essential to their survival. Research in 1987 provided information on the horses' diet that suggested otherwise. Half of their diet consisted of Spartina, while only 4% of their nutrients came from the maritime forest. The study concluded that sufficient nutrients were replenished with each ocean tide to prevent a decline in vegetative growth from overgrazing. A 2004 study declared that the greatest impact on plant life was not from grazing but from the damage plants sustained when trampled by the horses' hooves. Bankers pose a threat to ground-nesting animals such as sea turtles and shorebirds. Feral horses interrupt nesting activities and can crush the young.  Management and adoption  As the Bankers are seen as a part of North Carolina's coastal heritage, they have been allowed to remain on the barrier islands. To cope with the expanding population, prevent inbreeding and attempt to minimize environmental damage, several organizations partner in managing the herds. = Ocracoke = A Banker horse on Ocracoke Island Since 1959, Bankers on Ocracoke Island have been confined to fenced areas of approximately . The areas protect the horses from the traffic of North Carolina Highway 12, as well as safeguarding the island from overgrazing. The NPS, the authority managing the Ocracoke herd, supplements the horses' diet with additional hay and grain. In 2006, as a precaution against inbreeding, two fillies from the Shackleford herd were transported to Ocracoke. = Shackleford = Public Law 105-229, commonly referred to as the Shackleford Banks Wild Horses Protection Act, states that the Bankers on Shackleford Island are to be jointly managed by the National Park Service and another qualified nonprofit entity (currently the Foundation for Shackleford Horses). The herd is limited to 120–130 horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the contraceptive vaccine Porcine zona pellucida (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island's horse population is monitored by freeze branding numbers onto each animal's left hindquarter. The identification of individuals allows the National Park Service to ensure correct gender ratios and to select which mares to inject with PZP. Since 2000, adoptions of Bankers from Shackleford have been managed by the Foundation for Shackleford Horses. As of 2007, 56 horses had found new homes, 10 resided with another herd on Cedar Island, and two had been moved to the Ocracoke herd. A freeze branded mare on Shackleford On November 12, 1996, the Shackleford horses were rounded up by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Division and tested for equine infectious anemia (EIA). EIA is a potentially lethal disease, a lentivirus transmitted by bodily fluids and insects. Seventy-six of the 184 captured horses tested positive. Those that tested negative were allowed to remain on the island and those with the disease were transported to a temporary quarantine facility. Finding a permanent, isolated area for such a large number of Bankers was a challenging task for the Foundation; eight days later the state declared all proposed locations for the herd unsuitable. It ordered the euthanization of the 76 infected horses. Two more horses died in the process—one that was fatally injured during the roundup, and an uninfected foal that slipped into the quarantined herd to be with its mother. = Currituck Banks = As a consequence of development in Corolla and Sandbridge during the 1980s, horses on Currituck Banks came into contact with humans more frequently. This proved to be dangerous and sometimes fatal for the horses. By 1989, eleven Bankers had been killed by cars on the newly constructed Highway 12, and several others in Sandbridge. That same year, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, a nonprofit organization, was created to protect the horses from human interference. As a result of its efforts, the remainder of the herd was moved to a more remote part of Currituck Banks, where they were fenced into of combined federal and privately donated land between Corolla and the Virginia/North Carolina line. Corolla commissioners declared the site a horse sanctuary. The population is now managed by adopting out yearlings, both fillies and gelded colts. Conflicts over the preservation of the horses continued into 2012. In 2013, legislation was introduced to help preserve the herd on Currituck. = Rachel Carson Site, North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve = A herd lives on the Rachel Carson component of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who had used the islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed by the state of North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource. No management action was taken until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when after years of flourishing population, the island's carrying capacity was exceeded. Malnourishment caused by overcrowding resulted in the deaths of several horses; the reserve's staff instituted a birth control program to restrict the herd to about 40 animals.  Uses  Adopted Bankers are often used for pleasure riding and driving. As they have a calm disposition, they are used as children's mounts. The breed has also been used in several mounted patrols. Before 1915, the United States Lifesaving Service used horses for beach watches and rescues. In addition to carrying park rangers on patrols, the horses hauled equipment to and from shipwreck sites. During World War II, the Coast Guard used them for patrols. In the 1980s Bankers were used for beach duty at Cape Hatteras National Seashore. In 1955, ten horses were taken from the Ocracoke herd as a project for Mounted Boy Scout Troop 290. After taming and branding the horses, the scouts trained them for public service activities. The Bankers were ridden in parades and used as mounts during programs to spray mosquito-ridden salt marshes.

It is formed near the Subantarctic Front on the northern flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The surface density of Subantarctic Mode Water ranges between about 1026.0 and 1027.0 kg/m3 and the core of this water mass is often identified as a region of particularly low stratification. Another important facet of SAMW is that silicate (an important nutrient for diatoms) is depleted relative to nitrate. This depletion can be tracked over much of the globe, suggesting that SAMW helps set the blend of nutrients delivered to low-latitude ocean ecosystems, and thus determines the balance of species within these ecosystems. SAMW is a very homogenous layer that forms north of the Subantarctic Front and is also referred to as a pycnostad. Its uniformity can be attributed to convective overturning that also serves to ventilate it resulting in the high dissolved oxygen value of >6ml/l. It has slightly less dissolved oxygen than the surface water layer above it, but greater dissolved oxygen than the water masses below it. It has some variability in temperature, salinity and density in the Pacific Ocean. From west to east, the density increases from 1026.9 kg/m³ to 1027.1 kg/m³, the temperature decreases from 8.5 °C to 5.5 °C, and the salinity decreases from 34.62 ppt to 34.25 ppt (psu) Glasby, G.P. , ed. 1990. Antarctic sector of the Pacific. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. , New York, New York, USA. In the region where the Peru-Chile Undercurrent flows above the SAMW, the SAMW can be distinguished as having locally-characteristic low phosphorus, silicate and other nutrient concentrations in comparison. It moves by the transference of heat energy via the Subtropical anticyclonic gyre and retains its individuality as differentiated with the less-salty Antarctic Intermediate Water below it and the more highly oxygenated surface water above it. The oxygen maximum portion of SAMW sinks at 28˚S to 700m and lifts back to 500m around 15˚S after oxygen levels decreased.Glasby, G.P. , ed. 1990. Antarctic sector of the Pacific. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. , New York, New York, USA. SAMW acts as an oxygenator for mid oceanic depths in the Southern oceans. Near the surface it picks up atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide and then sinks, or subducts near the Indian Ocean, contributing to the Indian subtropical gyre and cooling and contributing to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).Downes, S.M, N.L.

The population is 79,257 (2019) \\\\- 65% of them Pashai, 20% Pashtun and 15% Tajik. The district center is the village of Alishing (Alishang), located on at 862 m altitude. There are 12 zones, each with around 12 to 14 villages located in the valleys and mountains. The Alishing river crosses the district and is the main source of irrigation. The economy of the district is poor but some villages such as Qal'a-i-Najil have vibrant Bazaars. Most people in the district work in the agricultural based jobs. Some men work as migrant workers in country's like Iran or Pakistan as manual labourers during their 20s so to save enough to provide for the family's plot of land. Security in the district has been contested in recent year due to geographical location of the district to key terrain in the ongoing insurgencies across the eastern part of the country. The district has good agricultural lands helped by annual flooding and organized irrigation. Most of the plots of land grow wheat, corn and alfalfa. Most family's keep a small garden to grow fruits and vegetables. The area is a mountainous district but has a paved road following the river valley from Mihtarlam to Dawlat Shah District. There are frequently floods, earthquakes and mudslides which annually cause heavy damage to key infrastructure such as check dams and bridges. There are three schools in the district Andara, Qal'a-i-Najil and Kanday which serve ages 6 to 15. Though most people work in an agricultural based economy many read and write. Children seeking further educations go to urban centers like Mihtarlam, or Kabul. The majority of the population enjoys music and dance which was banned during the Taliban Government years. The majority of the population is at least trilingual speaking Dari, Pashto and Pashai. Though Pashai is spoken during every day conversation Dari and Pashto are spoken during formal affairs. Many people from outside this districts have difficulty in understanding the local accent and the Pashai language is not conmanly spoken outside region. The best comparison is that of wales and the Welsh language . People enjoy Mehndi or henna a paste that is bought in a cone-shaped tube and is made into designs for men and women. Mehndi is a ceremonial art form which originated in ancient Subcontinent of India. Mehndi can be applied to both men and women.[5]. It is typically applied during weddings - most often for brides but sometimes for grooms. In Rajasthan, the grooms are given designs that are often as elaborate as those for brides. In Assam, apart from marriage, it is broadly used by unmarried women during Rongali bihu. Muslims in Pakistan also started to use it as an indication of coming of age. In the Middle East and Africa, it is common for women to apply henna to their fingernails and toenails and to their hands.

The population is 36,950 (2019) \\\\- 50% Tajik, 40% Pashai and 10% Pashtun. It has 60 villages. The district center is the village of Dawlat Shah, located on at 1583 m altitude in the Hindukush mountains in the valley of the Alishing river. The main source of potable and irrigation water in the district is a river which runs through the district from the Farashghan mountains. Communications are poor, and there is just one main road which runs to the district center. Good quality potable water is available only from springs. However, not all inhabitants of the district have access to these, and many use river water, which is not hygienic and causes water-borne diseases. For example, it was reported that in late 2001 / early 2002 cholera killed 13 inhabitants of Atto and Chekla villages. Water is carried long distances by women and girls. Spring water is also not a reliable source as the springs are affected by drought. As this is a mountainous area, there is little arable land. Due to the altitude of the land in many places it is not possible to irrigate it from the river. In the past spring water was used for irrigation but this is seasonal. A key source of income is forestry; however, much of the forest was cut down to provide wood for shelter re-construction. Some dry fruit trees were also burnt down during the war in 1980s. The community has nevertheless themselves started to construct a road to Farashghan village, and has already completed 20 km. They have now sought assistance from WFP for a food for work programme to help them to complete the project. In general, however, there has been little activity by humanitarian agencies in this district. The majority of the population suffer from poverty. It was reported that due to lack of work most young men are without occupations and many are armed and become involved in criminal activities. Nevertheless, it was reported that Dawlat Shah has good natural resources, such as forests, fruit and water. Around half of the returnee families are currently rebuilding their homes. The houses are built in the traditional mountain style - with stones and wood. Some villages were burnt during the war in 1980s and the rest were destroyed during bombardment.

It was said to be an Italian style water garden fed by the waters of the nearby Folly Burn. Inspired by the descriptions of his well-travelled friends Sibbald and Balfour he began a grand tour on 2 September 1668. He visited many gardens, waterways and canals including The King's Garden in Paris which he described as \\"the most complete that is in the world\\". Sadly he never returned to put his new ideas to the test. En route to Italy he died in Avignon, France in early September 1671. Balfour and Sibbald on hearing of his death travelled to Livingston Peel and organised transportation of the huge plant collection to Edinburgh, to a site now occupied by Waverley Station and shortly, in 1763, to a new site on Leith Walk.

Mexican narco-cinema  The Mexican narco-cine (Spanish for narco-cinema) or narco-películas (Spanish for narco-films/narco-movies), are a subgenre of the Mexploitation style films, \\\\- focused solely on the violence and luxurious lives of drug lords and cartels. The title and the storyline of these films are usually inspired by popular narco corridos (drug ballads, drug songs), - - and are marketed as low budget tie-in merchandising to the narcocorrido songs. - Sometimes these films feature famous narco-corrido singers on them, and are rumored to be financed by drug lords themselves. However, only a few such cases have been proven. \\\\-  Common qualities  The typical Mexploitation film takes place in major cities and drugs, sex, and crime are nearly always involved. These movies are usually low-budget and are filmed in a couple of weeks. They typically feature one or two B-movie actors in major roles with the rest of the cast being played by unknown actors. Mexploitation movies made in the 1960s and 1970s in Mexico were closer to their American exploitation film counterparts, with low- budget science-fiction films that often starred Mexican luchadores such as El Santo and Huracan Ramirez. However, in the early 1980s and 1990s there was a notable change with films increasingly dealing with real-life issues such as drug cartels and the murders of their rivals. Notable actors in these films include Mario Almada, Hugo Stiglitz, Sergio Goyri, Valentin Trujillo, Jorge Reynoso, Rodolfo de Anda, Fernando Almada, Rosa Gloria Chagoyán and David Reynoso. The director Robert Rodriguez has been considered a pioneer of Mexploitation in the United States. His first film, El Mariachi, contains many Mexploitation elements and his 2007 film, Planet Terror, contained a fake trailer which developed into a feature film called Machete (2010), which contains many familiar elements of the genre.  K. Gordon Murray  An exploitation film producer and distributor named K. Gordon Murray created a unique collection of horror films in Mexico which began to appear on American late-night television and drive-in screens in the 1960s. Ranging from monster movies clearly owing to the heyday of Universal Studios, to the lucha libre horror films featuring El Santo and the \\"Wrestling Women\\" alongside the 1959 Christmas classic \\"Santa Claus\\", these low-budget films are still notably campy and inspired a small cult following.

It is named after its first owner and occupant Stephen Decatur. The house (built, 1818) is located at the northwest corner of Lafayette Square, at the southwest corner of Jackson Place and H Street, near the White House. A museum, it now serves as the National Center for White House History, managed by the White House Historical Association. History Decatur House is one of the oldest surviving homes in Washington, D.C., and one of only three remaining houses in the country designed by neoclassical architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Completed in 1818 for naval hero Stephen Decatur and his wife, Susan, the Federal Style house is prominently located across Lafayette Square from the White House. It was successively home to Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren and Edward Livingston, who collectively made Decatur House the unofficial residence of the Secretary of State from 1827 to 1833, each renting the house while they served in that post. In 1836 John Gadsby and his wife Providence moved into the house and brought their house slaves. They built a two-story structure at the back which became the slave quarters for those workers, who previously lived in the main house. This structure remains as one of the few examples of slave quarters in urban areas. It is physical evidence of African Americans having been held \\"in bondage in sight of the White House.\\"\\"The Slave Quarters\\" , Decatur House, accessed 21 Apr 2009 Following John Gadsby's death, the home was again rented to a series of prominent tenants. In order, these tenants were Vice President George M. Dallas, publisher and former Mayor of Washington Joseph Gales, Congressmen and brothers John A. King and James G. King, Rep. William Appleton, Speaker of the House James Lawrence Orr and Sen. Judah Benjamin. During the Civil War it was used as Army offices and then it sat empty for six years. Decatur House was purchased in 1872 by Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a frontiersman and explorer who later became a rancher and diplomat.Gerald Thompson, Edward F. Beale and the American West, University of New Mexico Press, 1983. Beale's daughter-in-law, Marie, bequeathed Decatur House to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1956. The house was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Decatur House, now a museum, is located at 748 Jackson Place, N.W., on President's Park (Lafayette Park). The lower floor is kept in the style of the early 19th century while the upper floor shows more modern renovations of the early 20th century. Because of the centrality of its location, the status of its residents, and the fact that urban slaves worked there across from the White House, the house now contains more material interpreting African American history. Among the compelling stories is that of Charlotte Dupuy, who in 1829 sued her master Henry Clay, then Secretary of State, for her freedom and that of her two children. While she lost her court case, Clay finally freed Dupuy and her daughter in 1840, and her son in 1844. A special exhibit on African American history through 1965 has recently been added to the museum and its website.

Between 1902 and 1930, over 400 homes were built to provide housing for the influx of workers coming to work at the cotton mill. A variety of floor plans were built over the time of construction. The earliest homes, shown on the 1902 and 1908 Sanborn maps of Mooresville, were mainly 3-room, T-shaped houses with front and back porches. In 1916–17, the mill added 4- and 5-room houses.

As of 2016, it was one of the largest regional producers of aluminium with sales of 106,500 tons of aluminium, and third-largest exporter of Bosnia with 171 million euros worth of exports (as of 2017). History The history of Aluminij began in the first years of the 20th century, with the discovery of bauxite ore deposits in Herzegovina and the subsequent exploitation of the resource. After the end of World War II in 1945, a new company was created, Bauxite Mines Mostar, with the goal of exploring, exploiting and transporting bauxite commercially. It was this first company that carried out the initial construction studies for aluminium smelters were conducted, the birth of the aluminium industry that was to come. In 1969, the bauxite Mines Mostar Company merged with Energoinvest Sarajevo to form a new organisation focused on aluminium production. The Government of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina tasked the group with maximizing the potential of the resources in the region and develops a new facility that could turn Mostar into a global aluminium producer. This was achieved by 1975, as regular aluminium production began in the new Alumina Factory. This successful development was based on cooperation between Energoinvest and the French company Pechiney. Aluminij was established in 1975 in Mostar. It soon emerged as one of the largest aluminium manufacturing companies in former Yugoslavia. Company's facilities were largely destroyed during the 1992–1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and were later rebuilt.VAW-technologie puts Aluminij Mostar on top: state-of-the-art reduction plant will result from modernisation project.

Despite possessing a distinctive, wide ranging singing voice, Nugent recorded and toured with other singers during much of his early solo career, including Derek St. Holmes, Brian Howe, and Meat Loaf. In the late 1980s and early 1990s he was part of the supergroup Damn Yankees. In later years, Nugent drew attention for his outspoken conservative political views, as well as his strident advocacy of hunting and gun ownership rights.

As a teenager, Nugent attended St. Viator High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois, and for a short time, William Fremd High School in Palatine, Illinois. His maternal grandparents were Swedish. =Draft status= Nugent grew up in a military family; his father was a career army sergeant. Nugent himself never served in the military, even though he came of age during the height of the Vietnam War. In 1977 and 1990 interviews with High Times magazine and the Detroit Free Press, Nugent claimed he deliberately failed his draft physical by taking drugs, eating nothing but junk food for days beforehand, and defecating and urinating in his pants. Nugent denied his defecation story in a 2018 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience; he asserted that he invented the story for his and his band's amusement, as he claimed news sources at the time often published inaccurate information on his band. He also stated he was eligible for military service and passed a draft physical in 1969 and received a student designation rather than a student deferment several months later while he was attending Oakland Community College, but was not called to service. Nugent further stated that his 4-F rating on wikipedia was \\"made up\\", despite it being sourced to Snopes. Nugent's Selective Service classification record shows he initially qualified for student deferments. When he was no longer enrolled in school, he received a draft rating of I-A, until he failed a draft physical on August 28, 1969. After that physical, he was rated 1-Y (\\"registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency\\") until that classification was abolished in 1971. He was subsequently reclassified 4-F, indicating ineligibility for military service under established physical, mental, or moral standards. Musical career Nugent in concert with his signature Gibson Byrdland guitar =The Amboy Dukes= The first lineup of the Amboy Dukes played at The Cellar, a teen dance club outside of Chicago in Arlington Heights, Illinois, starting in late 1965, while Nugent was a student at St. Viator High School. The Cellar's \\"house band\\" at the time had been the Shadows of Knight, although the Amboy Dukes eventually became a staple until the club's closing. The Amboy Dukes' second single was \\"Journey to the Center of the Mind\\", which featured lyrics written by the Dukes' second guitarist Steve Farmer from the album of the same title whose cover features a diverse array of drug paraphernalia. Nugent, an ardent anti-drug campaigner, has always claimed that he had no idea that this song was about drug use. The Amboy Dukes (1967), Journey to the Center of the Mind (1968), Migration and Rusty Day (1969)—all recorded on the Mainstream label—sold moderately well. On April 5, 1968, the day after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Nugent joined other musicians in a tribute to King by having a folk, rock and blues jam session. Joni Mitchell played first, followed by Buddy Guy, Cactus, and Jimi Hendrix. Other musicians who participated were BB King and Al Kooper. After settling down on a ranch in Michigan in 1973, Nugent signed a record deal with Frank Zappa's DiscReet Records label and recorded Call of the Wild. The following year, Tooth Fang & Claw (which contained the song \\"Great White Buffalo\\", arranged with Rob Grange) established a fan base for Nugent and the other Amboy Dukes. Personnel changes nearly wrecked the band, which became known as Ted Nugent & the Amboy Dukes. Nugent reunited with the other members of the Amboy Dukes at the 2009 Detroit Music Awards, which took place April 17, 2009. The psychedelic band received a distinguished achievement honor at the event. The Dukes also played together at the ceremony, marking their first public performance in more than 30 years. =Solo career= Nugent dropped the Amboy Dukes band name for good in 1975, and signed to Epic Records. Derek St. Holmes (guitar, vocals), Rob Grange (bass) and Clifford Davies (drums) were the primary additional band members for his 1970s multi-platinum albums: Ted Nugent (1975), Free-for-All (1976) and Cat Scratch Fever (1977). These albums produced the popular radio anthems \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Stranglehold\\", \\"Dog Eat Dog\\", and \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\". Despite most of the songwriting credits being listed as solely Nugent, St. Holmes claims they were co-written by the whole band, and that Nugent took sole credit as a way to not pay them royalties. It was during these three years that Nugent emerged as a guitar hero to hard rock fans, many of whom were unaware of his lengthy apprenticeship with the Amboy Dukes.Charlesworth, Chris. A-Z of Rock Guitarists, pg. 65 This band lineup toured extensively, also releasing the multi-platinum live album Double Live Gonzo! (1978), until its breakup in 1978 when St. Holmes and Grange departed. St. Holmes was replaced by Charlie Huhn and Grange by Dave Kiswiney. Davies left around 1982 after staying on to record Weekend Warriors (1978), State of Shock (1979), Scream Dream (1980) and Intensities in 10 Cities (1981). The \\"Intensities in 10 Cities\\" album includes the controversial song \\"Jailbait.\\" On July 8, 1979, Ted was on the rock radio program King Biscuit Flower Hour. This was the original broadcast of Ted's performance of Live at Hammersmith '79 which had been recorded during the second set of a night at London's Hammersmith Odeon in 1979. An album of this program was released in 1997. =1980s solo career and Damn Yankees= During the period of 19821989, Nugent released a series of solo albums (to declining critical favor and commercial performance) and also began assuming a more prominent role as lead vocalist. In 1989, he joined the supergroup Damn Yankees, with Jack Blades (bass/vocals, of Night Ranger), Tommy Shaw (guitar/vocals, of Styx) and Michael Cartellone (drums). Damn Yankees (1990) was a hit, going double platinum in the U.S., thanks to the hit power ballad \\"High Enough\\". =Return to solo career= Nugent performing in 2005 Returning to a solo career, Nugent released Spirit of the Wild in 1995, his best-reviewed album in quite some time. The album also marked the return of Derek St. Holmes to Nugent's studio band. A series of archival releases also came out in the 1990s, keeping Nugent's name in the national consciousness. He also began hosting a radio show in Detroit on WWBR-FM (\\"102.7 The Bear, Detroit's Rock Animal\\") and took ownership in several hunting-related businesses. He created TV shows for several networks; Wanted: Ted or Alive on Versus, Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild on PBS and The Outdoor Channel, as well as Surviving Nugent and Supergroup-Damnocracy on VH1. In 2006, Ted Nugent was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. Ted Nugent appears on David Crowder Band's 2007 release, Remedy, playing guitar on the song \\"We Won't Be Quiet\\". He announced his \\"Trample the Weak, Hurdle the Dead\\" tour on April 21, 2010. Nugent toured with local Detroit musician Alex Winston during the summers of 2007 and 2008. On July 4, 2008, at the DTE Energy Music Theater in Clarkston, Michigan, Ted Nugent played his 6,000th concert. Derek St. Holmes (original singer for the Ted Nugent band), Johnny Bee Badanjek (drummer for Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels), and Nugent's guitar teacher from 1958, Joe Podorsek, all jammed on stage with Nugent for various songs. On March 14, 2011, Nugent released a new song, \\"I Still Believe\\", as a free download via his website to subscribers to his newsletter. Nugent says of the song: \\"America is a target-rich environment for an independent man addicted to logic, truth and The American Way. 'I Still Believe' throttles the animal spirit of rugged individualism in pure MotorCity ultra high-energy rhythm and blues and rock and roll.\\" In April 2011 Nugent announced that former frontman Derek St. Holmes would be joining his band for Nugent's I Still Believe Tour. Media appearances =Reality programming= Nugent has starred in his own outdoors television show on the Outdoor Channel, named after his popular song \\"Spirit of the Wild\\", since 2001. The song was the theme music to the TV series, in which Nugent took viewers on a variety of wild game hunts using his bow. In the series, he taught and advised hunters and \\"hands-on\\" conservationists around the world on the different aspects of hunting and politics.Spirit of the Wild. Outdoor Channel. In one episode of Spirit of the Wild, Nugent hits a young deer with a bow. Two game wardens saw the episode, later charging Nugent with 11 misdemeanor violations of California hunting law. Nugent plead guilty to two violations. In 2003, he was host of the VH1 reality television program Surviving Nugent, in which city dwellers such as model Tila Tequila moved to Nugent's Michigan ranch in order to survive such \\"backwoods\\" activities as building an outhouse and skinning a boar. The success of the two-hour show spawned a four-part miniseries in 2004, titled Surviving Nugent: The Ted Commandments. This time it was filmed on Nugent's ranch in China Spring, Texas. During filming, Nugent injured himself with a chainsaw, requiring 44 stitches and a leg brace. In 2003, Nugent also guested on the VH1 program Forever Wild, hosted by Sebastian Bach, former lead vocalist for the band Skid Row. They shot some firearms and walked around Nugent's cabin in the woods. Two years later, in 2005, Nugent hosted a reality-type show, Wanted: Ted or Alive, on what was then called the OLN, or Outdoor Life Network, before it became the NBC Sports Network of the present day. In Wanted: Ted or Alive, contestants competed for money as well as for opportunities to go hunting with \\"Uncle Ted.\\" The contestants had to kill and clean their own food to survive. In 2006, he appeared on VH1's reality show SuperGroup, with Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian, Biohazard bassist Evan Seinfeld, ex-Skid Row lead singer Sebastian Bach, and John Bonham's son Jason Bonham, who had been the drummer for Bonham, UFO, and Foreigner. The name of the supergroup was originally FIST but later was changed to Damnocracy. Bach had lobbied for the name Savage Animal.

Also in 2009, Nugent played guitar at The Alamo for a Tax Day Tea Party hosted by Glenn Beck and Fox News. Most notable in his set was a version of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" in which he used alternate picking and whammy bar effects. The clip and sound bite of this came to be played extensively on Fox News as well as on The Glenn Beck Program. =Acting= In 1976, Nugent was in the documentary Demon Lover Diary, about the making of the John Dods' horror/comedy movie The Demon Lover. He is shown supplying real guns for the making of The Demon Lover, as the crew films at Nugent's house. In 1986, he guest starred in an episode of the hit television show Miami Vice entitled \\"Definitely Miami\\". Nugent played a villain. His song \\"Angry Young Man\\" was featured in the episode. His song \\"Little Miss Dangerous\\" was also featured on a Miami Vice episode of the same name, although he did not appear in the episode. In 2001, Nugent appeared as himself in a third-season episode of That '70s Show entitled \\"Backstage Pass\\". Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon), who works for radio station WFPP, obtains tickets to the upcoming Ted Nugent concert for the entire gang. Following the concert, her boss Max (Howard Hesseman) gives Donna a backstage pass to meet Nugent, where he volunteers to sit for an interview. Meanwhile, Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson) and Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) try to sell unauthorized concert t-shirts accidentally spelled Tad Nugent.

In the episode \\"Full Bluntal Nugety\\", Nugent is a guest at the university, there to speak on his favorite topics, mainly hunting and gun control. This is where new student Steven Karp (Jay Baruchel) takes his love interest Lizzie (Carla Gallo) on their first date. Karp tries to heckle Nugent during his speech in an attempt to impress Lizzie, with disastrous results. FOX didn't like the idea of Nugent and his political views appearing on this show, so the episode was re-shot and re-edited as \\"Oh, So You Have a Boyfriend?\\" which aired without any Ted Nugent content whatsoever. The complete \\"Full Bluntal Nugety (Director's Cut)\\" episode is available in its entirety, in the Undeclared DVD box set, including some extra Ted Nugent scenes that had been deleted. He made a guest appearance on the cult television series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, in the episode \\"Gee Whiz\\", on Adult Swim.

In 2007, Nugent debated The Simpsons producer Sam Simon on The Howard Stern Show about the ethics of hunting animals. Coincidentally, Nugent would later lend his voice to an over-the-phone appearance in the season 19 episode of The Simpsons, \\"I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\", where, in a humorous jab at his political stance, inmate Dwight picks up his call for voting no to the fictional Proposition 87, which bans crossbows in public schools. As part of his pre-recorded message, Nugent asks \\"If we outlaw crossbows in our public schools, who's going to protect our children from charging elk?\\".

Attracting attention for his outspoken statements on issues ranging from guns to biodiversity, Nugent has been a regular guest on such programs as Larry King Live, The Howard Stern Show, and Politically Incorrect. In 1978 Nugent appeared on The Midnight Special as host and a performer. In 1978 Nugent's song \\"Queen of the Forest\\" was featured on the pilot episode of WKRP in Cincinnati as the first record the fictional radio station played upon switching formats.

On March 13, 2007, Nugent was interviewed on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! and performed the songs \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\" and \\"Rawdogs and Warhogs\\". On April 15, 2009, Nugent appeared onstage with his guitar in San Antonio as part of Glenn Beck's coverage of the Tax Day Tea Party protests on the Fox News Channel.

July 30, 2008 On July 9, 2010, Nugent was again interviewed by Jones and criticized the latest policies issued by the Obama administration and the U.S. Supreme Court concerning gun policy. He claimed that rejecting the idea of the right to self-defense being expressed in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which Nugent called \\"gun control\\" policies, is most likely to destroy American society. Nugent also claimed similar policies were the cause of the downfall of every society in human history., July 9, 2010 Nugent also appeared in the season 2 Penn & Teller: Bullshit! episode on P.E.T.A. in 2004. He was a weekly contributor to the newspaper, the Waco Tribune-Herald until 2009.

Nugent also wore a Bad Boys era Detroit Pistons shirt in the Damn Yankees music video for \\"Come Again\\". Nugent suffers from hearing loss. He said in a 2007 interview: \\"The ear's not too good, especially with background noise, but that's a small price to pay. Believe me the journey was worth it.\\"Tanner, Adam. \\"Ted Nugent might run for Governor of Michigan.\\" Article at MaconDaily.com, via Reuters, on August 19, 2007. =Allegations of relationships with underage girls= Two women have accused Nugent of having sexual relationships with them when they were under 18 years old. In 1978, Nugent began a relationship with 17-year-old Hawaii native Pele Massa. The age of sexual consent in Hawaii at the time was 16, however, they could not marry due to the age difference. To get around this, Nugent joined Massa's parents in signing documents to make himself her legal guardian. Courtney Love also claims that she performed fellatio on Nugent when she was 12. On The Joe Rogan Experience, Nugent denied that he had ever been in romantic relationships with underage girls, other than when he was underage himself. This goes against what Nugent previously said in a Behind the Music episode, where he admitted to several affairs with underage girls. Additionally, his song \\"Jailbait\\" is about being attracted to and wanting to have sex with a 13-year-old girl. =Family= Nugent has been married twice and has six children with four women. In the late 1960s, prior to his first marriage, Nugent fathered a boy (Ted Mann) and a girl, both of whom he gave up for adoption in infancy. This did not become public knowledge until 2010. The siblings were adopted separately and had no contact with one another. The son learned the identity of his birth father in 2010, through the daughter's quest to make contact with him and their birth parents. According to a news report, over the years Nugent had discussed the existence of these children with his other children. He was married to his first wife, Sandra Jezowski, from 1970 to 1979. They had two children, son Theodore Tobias \\"Toby\\" Nugent and daughter Sasha Nugent. Sandra died in a car crash in 1982. His second marriage is to Shemane Deziel, whom he met while a guest on Detroit's WLLZ-FM, where she was a member of the news staff. They married on January 21, 1989. Together they have one child, son Rocco Winchester Nugent. In 2005, Nugent agreed to pay $3,500 monthly in child support for a son fathered with Karen Gutowski while he was married to Deziel. =Drug and alcohol stances= Since the 1970s Nugent has promoted anti-drug and anti-alcohol stances. He has been cited as a key influence in the straight edge movement, a punk rock-associated lifestyle that developed in the early 1980s and discourages drug and alcohol use. Henry Rollins, vocalist for Black Flag, reports that he and friend Ian MacKaye (vocalist for Minor Threat and writer of the song \\"Straight Edge\\" that gave the movement its name) were inspired by Nugent during their high school years in the 1970s when he was the only major rock star to publicly eschew drug use: \\"[We] would read about the Nuge and the thing that really rubbed off on us was the fact that he didn't drink or smoke or do drugs ... [Nugent's performance] was the craziest thing we'd ever seen onstage and here's this guy saying, 'I don't get high.' We thought that was so impressive.\\"As quoted by Michael Azerrad (2001) Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991. New York: Little, Brown and Company. , p. 121 Nugent is a national spokesman for the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program,Tim Mak (2010) 10 little- known facts about Nugent, Politico.com, accessed June 16, 2017 In 2015, however, Nugent declared his support for the legalization of marijuana for medical use. In 2018 he admitted that he drinks \\"a little wine\\". Politics Nugent is a vocal supporter of the U.S. Republican Party and various associated conservative causes, particularly gun rights and hunter's rights. He is a supporter of President Donald Trump, and has made a number of statements critical of President Barack Obama, one of which was perceived as potentially threatening and lead to Nugent being investigated by the Secret Service. His views are considered racist by some.BJ Colangelo, October 23, 2018, Detroit Metro Times, Ted Nugent totally triggered by not being inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Retrieved November 30, 2018, \\"Everyone's favorite racist uncle, Ted Nugent, ...\\"Frank Smyth, February 10, 2016, Progressive Times, Cat Scratch Fever—Is Ted Nugent's Racism Too Much for Republicans?, Retrieved November 30, 2018, \\"....Yesterday longtime NRA board member Ted Nugent went further into racist territory ...

As a reward for entertaining U.S. troops in Iraq in 2004, Nugent visited Saddam Hussein's war room. He commented on Iraq, \\"Our failure has been not to Nagasaki them.\\" On July 17, 2008, during the presidential election season and shortly before the Republican presidential nominating convention, Nugent expressed his skepticism about presumptive GOP Presidential nominee John McCain, stating that McCain was \\"catering to a growing segment of soulless Americans who care less what they can do for their country, but whine louder and louder about what their country must do for them. That is both un- American and pathetic.\\" At a 2009 West Virginia rally sponsored in part by Massey Energy, Nugent \\"defended mountaintop removal mining,\\" according to reporters on the scene. \\"On behalf of the Nugent family, I say, start up the bulldozers and get me some more coal, Massey,\\" Nugent was recorded as saying.\\"Friends of America crowd smaller than anticipated\\" by Jessica Lilly and Scott Finn. West Virginia Public Broadcasting Nugent is an outspoken critic of Islam, which he describes as a \\"voodoo religion\\" which \\"believes in world domination\\". During an interview with Piers Morgan, Nugent denied that he considered himself homophobic, saying \\"I'm repulsed at the concept of man- on-man sex, I think it's against nature. I think it's strange as hell, but if that's what you are, I love you. I'm not going to judge another's morals. I say live and let live. I have friends that are gay.\\" Nugent clashed in 2014 with Jay Dean, then the mayor of Longview, Texas, and an incoming Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives after Dean moved to cancel Nugent's scheduled appearance at the Longview Independence Day concert. Dean said that he finds Nugent's music unsuitable for family-oriented audiences on July 4. Longview hence paid Nugent $16,000, half of the amount he had been promised, to drop him from the concert. Nugent in turn called Dean \\"racist\\" and \\"clueless, dishonest, and one of the bad guys.\\" In 2014, Nugent worked as the treasurer and co-chairman for Sid Miller's campaign for Texas Agriculture Commissioner. Nugent speaking at a campaign event for Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Scottsdale, Arizona. Nugent's conservative views have prompted criticism from fellow musicians such as Paul McCartney, David Crosby, and the band Goldfinger, who have a song titled \\"Fuck Ted Nugent\\" on their album Open Your Eyes. =Gun rights= Nugent is an advocate of the right to bear arms, but while performing he instructs venues to not allow firearms. When interviewed by Texas Monthly editor Evan Smith in season 5 of TexasMonthlyTalks he said, \\"I would rather that [a victim of violent crime] in Massachusetts last month who was taking her daughter to soccer when they were carjacked by a recidivist maggot, who had been in the prison system all his life but was let out again because we feel sorry for him, maybe he had a bad childhood – instead of her being hijacked and murdered, I'd rather she just shot the bastard dead... But in Massachusetts, somebody decided she can't do that. So she's dead. I would rather she was alive and the carjacker was dead.\\" Nugent currently serves on the Board of Directors of the National Rifle Association (NRA). In 2016, Nugent posted an image on his Facebook page implying that Jews are behind the push for gun control. Nugent's rant sparked outrage and some called for his NRA resignation. In March 2018, Nugent criticized the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting who became gun control activists, calling them \\"mushy brained children\\" and stating that \\"the evidence is irrefutable: They have no soul.\\" In June 2018, Nugent said that \\"evil, dishonesty and scam artists have always been around and that right now they're liberal, they're Democrat, they're RINOs, they're Hollywood, they're fake news, they're media, they're academia, and they're half of our government, at least ... There are rabid coyotes running around, you don't wait till you see one to go get your gun, keep your gun handy. And every time you see one, shoot one.\\" =Animal rights= Nugent, an opponent of animal rights, said in a long interview, \\"I'm stymied to come up with anything funnier than people who think animals have rights. Just stick an arrow through their lungs.\\" In 2000, Bhaskar Sinha was jailed briefly following an incident outside a department store in San Francisco in which he threatened and physically assaulted Nugent, who in turn took Sinha into custody until San Francisco Police arrived and arrested the protester. However, protesters claim that Nugent started the altercation by spitting in the face of one of the protester when offered an anti-fur flyer. A San Francisco police officer, who stated that he was on the scene, said that he didn't believe Nugent spat on anyone. Nugent has reportedly received death threats against him and his family from animal rights activists. On the Penn & Teller's Bullshit! episode about People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Nugent said, \\"We've got reports and files with law enforcement across America where the animal rights extremists are on record threatening to kill my children on the way to school because we eat pheasant.\\" In a 1992 radio interview, Nugent referred to Heidi Prescott of the Fund for Animals as a \\"worthless whore\\" and a \\"shallow slut\\", asking \\"who needs to club a seal, when you can club Heidi?\\" He was ordered by a court to pay Prescott $75,000. Nugent defended Kid Rock, a fellow rocker and hunter, when he killed a mountain lion in January 2015, calling the people who targeted Rock \\"braindead squawkers\\" and that Rock did good by keeping predator numbers low and helping the deer population, which is vital for hunting. In July 2015, Nugent was one of the few to defend the killing of Cecil the lion. Nugent owns a 340-acre hunting ranch near Jackson, Michigan, called Sunrize Acres. Anti-hunters claim this fenced facility offers \\"canned\\" hunts. Nugent has said, \\"I understand the criticism from those who say canned hunting violates the ethic of fair chase\\", though he still operates the facility, and refers to it as \\"high fence hunting\\". In April 2012, Nugent pled guilty to illegally killing and transporting an American black bear in Alaska. His sentence included two years of probation, a prohibition on hunting and fishing in Alaska and on any U.S. Forest Service lands for one year, and a fine of $10,000, and he was required to produce and broadcast at his own expense a 30-60 second Public Service Announcement (PSA) on the responsibilities of hunters. The judge in the case, Michael A. Thompson (Alaska), admitted in court that he himself had never heard of the law in which Nugent was charged, despite the fact that Thompson himself had been a lifelong bear hunter in Alaska. Nugent explained his side of the situation in an interview with Deer & Deer Hunting. =Obama administration= Nugent was particularly critical of President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, saying they \\"should be tried for treason & hung,\\" among other multiple derogatory comments directed towards them. On Facebook he shared a video depiction of Clinton being shot by her 2016 Democratic presidential primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, commenting \\"I got your guncontrol [sic] right here bitch.\\" At a concert on August 22, 2007, while wielding what appeared to be assault-like rifles, Nugent said in reference of Obama, \\"suck on my machine gun\\". In the same gun-wielding rant, Nugent said of Dianne Feinstein, \\"ride one of these you worthless whore\\". In January 2014, Nugent called Obama a \\"communist- educated, communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel\\". That February, Nugent endorsed Greg Abbott in the Republican primary election for Texas Governor. Abbott, however, distanced himself from Nugent due to the \\"subhuman mongrel\\" comment, saying, \\"This is not the kind of language I would use or endorse in any way.\\" After being further chastised about it by Senator Rand Paul, Nugent apologized for the comment. However, when asked in April 2017 if he regretted his comments about Obama, he replied \\"No! I will never apologize for calling out evil people.\\" On April 17, 2012, while stumping for Obama's opponent Mitt Romney at the 2012 NRA Convention, Nugent said, \\"If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, again, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year.\\" Nugent received a visit from the Secret Service for these remarks. Following these comments, commanders at Fort Knox opted not to allow him to perform at a previously scheduled event. On February 12, 2013, Nugent attended the State of the Union address given by President Obama. He was the guest of U.S. Representative Steve Stockman of Texas's 36th congressional district. =Donald Trump= In February 2016, Ted Nugent praised Trump's 2016 Republican Presidential Primary opponent Ted Cruz, stating \\"My dream would be if Ted Cruz became president tonight. I really admire Ted Cruz, on many levels.\\" However Nugent later endorsed Donald Trump, and during the last week of the U.S. presidential election campaign performed at a number of Trump rallies in Michigan, including Trump's final campaign rally in Grand Rapids. On April 19, 2017, Nugent in the company of Kid Rock and Sarah Palin, had a \\"long-planned\\" visit at the White House. According to Nugent the visit lasted four hours and was like \\"a family reunion.\\" Nugent described it as \\"a wonderful personal tour of every room\\" followed by photo sessions and dinner with Donald Trump. =Potential runs for office= Referring to Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm (in office 2003–11), during performances he would frequently interject \\"Jennifer Granholm, kiss my ass\\" into his songs, and shoot an arrow at her likeness. In a 2007 interview, in discussing running for governor of Michigan, he stated that Granholm \\"is not doing an ugly job, but as the perfect woman, she is scrotumless\\".Blabbermouth.net , January 7, 2006 Although Nugent has never run for government office, in the 2000s, he publicly speculated about doing so on several occasions. In May 2005, he announced he was \\"getting real close to deciding to run\\" for governor of Michigan in 2006, while in 2007, he talked about running for that office in 2010. During the latter period, he stated, \\"Michigan was once a great state. Michigan was a state that rewarded the entrepreneur and the most productive, work-ethic families of the state. Now the pimps and the whores and the welfare brats are basically the state's babies.\\" Earlier, Nugent had been rumoured to be under consideration by the Illinois Republican Party as its candidate in that state's 2004 Senate race, given his roots in Illinois. In July 2008, Nugent declared \\"I was serious when I threatened to run for office in the past if I cannot find a candidate who respects the U.S. Constitution and our sacred Bill of Rights.\\" When asked by Imagineer magazine in a 2010 interview about what he would do if elected to political office, he responded: \\"Slash the living hell out of the waste and corruption and the outrageous army of do-nothing bureaucrats. I would fire every government worker whose job I would deem to be redundant and wasteful. No able-bodied human being would ever get a handout again.\\" In a July 2013 interview with The Washington Post, Nugent expressed interest in possibly running for President of the United States as a Republican in the 2016 election. He never sought the office.

Early life He was born in Sedgefield, County Durham, the only son of William and Christina Farrow. He was educated at Sedgefield Junior School, and attended St Michael's School, Buckingham Palace Road, after he and his family moved to London. After working as a shop assistant from 1938 to 1942, he joined the RAF in 1942. He served as a rear-gunner on Lancaster bombers with No. 218 Squadron, operating from Suffolk on missions over northwest Europe, and was eventually promoted to Flight Sergeant. It was during his time in the RAF, in 1944, that he met and married his wife, Joan Chittenden. After his service ended, he joined the Cardiff City Police, later the South Wales Constabulary, in 1947, and it was in this role he was awarded the Albert Medal, which he exchanged in 1972 for the George Cross. He was a road safety officer with the force for several years. Albert Medal On patrol on 21 June 1948, at around seven o'clock in the evening, he was alerted by a crowd of people that a four-year-old boy had fallen into the Feeder, an aqueduct supplying water to the Cardiff Docks from the River Taff. He ran to the uncovered section where the boy had fallen in, removed his uniform and dived into the water, swimming under the covered section for around 180 yards (165 m) in search of the boy. Headroom dropped from two feet (65 centimetres) at the start of the covered point to around six inches (15 centimetres). It was impossible for Farrow to stand upright with his head above water level. In addition to the pitch black darkness under the covered section, the water was black and heavy deposits sat on the bottom of the aqueduct. Farrow searched the area for fifteen minutes, but thought it was hopeless to venture downstream, and worked his way back to the uncovered section, with the current against him. He was not an excellent swimmer, and fingerholds in the slimy roof were uncommon, located only where slabs fitted together or were damaged. He was exhausted after reaching the open air. The boy's body was later recovered from the water. He was highly praised for his determination and bravery both by witnesses and the coroner, and was awarded the Albert Medal in October 1948 by King George VI. Citation > Whitehall, 6 October 1948.

During his retirement he lived in Llandaff, and enjoyed fly fishing and gardening. He gave his Albert Medal to the National Museum of Wales.

The show has a comedic theme and uses a narrative voiceover to highlight aspects of the clips. Whacked Out Sports, created and produced by Mark OBrien, founder of Mighty Oak Entertainment. (who also co-distributes the series with Trifecta Entertainment & Media), features 170 episodes and has been in syndication since 2006. In 2014, the series was renewed for Seasons 9 and 10. Subject Matter The show consists entirely of short video clips featuring sports-related stunts and odd sporting events. The clips are accompanied by irreverent and wacky narration which is intended to present sometimes shocking images in a humorous manner. High points from the clips are generally replayed several times for maximum effect, a technique also used on the similar show MXC. The narrator, Tom Gottlieb (known for, and playing a similar role to, “Cookie Masterson” from the video game series You Don't Know Jack), uses a juvenile commentary to help create the lighthearted nature of the show; for example, stating \\"he's using his noggin to steer the toboggan\\" when referring to a luge accident. Another trademark feature of the show are the often cartoonish stock sound effects such as screams, punches, crashes, and groaning men sounds after scenes of crashes, falls, fights or other incidents are shown. The clips for Whacked Out Sports are collected from videos taken by various sources around the world. International Distribution The series began airing in the United Kingdom on the Five USA channel in February 2008. It is also broadcast in South Africa on DSTV and in Estonia on TV6 where it is shown along with Maximum Exposure and other similar themed shows under the title Meeletu Maailm.

It was opened in 1719 as the church for the newly created Parish of Sunderland, and served the local community until dwindling numbers forced its closure in 1988. It has since been in the ownership of the Churches Conservation Trust who have preserved the space and converted it into a community cultural hub. History =Origins= In 1712, with the port of Sunderland growing rapidly, the local St. Michael's church at Bishopwearmouth was rapidly becoming too small to serve the growing population. Some local merchants came together and started an appeal to build a new church in the east end of the city, and a site on the town moor was chosen. Because of the rapid growth of the population, it was also decided that a new parish should be created, and on 9 March 1719 an act of parliament was passed to create the Parish of Sunderland (thus the church is sometimes referred to as Sunderland Parish Church). The Bishop of Durham of the time, Nathaniel Crew gave his consent, as did Reverend James Bowes D.D. Design The architect of the original church is not known for certain, although there are reports of involvement from William Eddy (a well-known local architect) and Daniel Newcombe, who would be appointed the first rector of the church. The building itself has a Baroque style, brick built and with stone mouldings surrounding the doors and windows. The original building was without apse, although this would later be added (see below), and from the outside is described by Whellan as \\"plain and unprepossessing\\". Inside, the building is described by Whellan as \\"handsome\\", with the aisles of pews being separated from the central nave by seven pillars on each side, each being capped with a corinthian-style capital. His full description reads: Opening Following the start of groundwork in 1718, the church building was completed the next year, such that on 5 September 1719 the consecration of the premises took place; prior to this, however, on 2 June 1719, the first recorded marriage took place at the church, of Jonathan Chambers and Elizabeth Hutchinson. =1700s= View of apse with tower in background In 1735, Daniel Newcombe, the rector of the church who almost certainly had been involved in the original design of the building, decided to add an apse to the eastern end. This would give the building a chancel, which it had lacked until this point. The apse was large, near circular, and featuring a large venetian window; it still stands as part of the building today. Newcombe paid for the extension with his own money. =1800s= The church started the nineteenth century with a new roof in 1803, which included its raising so that a new gallery could be added. Jack Crawford Memorial Jack Crawford memorial in the graveyard Jack Crawford, the \\"Hero of Camperdown\\", was a sailor aboard HMS Venerable in 1797, during the Battle of Camperdown. Venerable took fire damaging its mast, which lowered the flag of Admiral Duncan - recognised as the sign of surrender - so Crawford scaled the remnants of the mast and nailed the Admiral's flag back to the top. Crawford was well celebrated for his act of heroism, and the people of Sunderland awarded him a silver star. In the coming years, however, he fell into poverty and was killed by a cholera outbreak in 1831. In 1888, Holy Trinity Church erected a headstone in its graveyard in his honour.This was followed two years later by a statue of commemoration in Mowbray Park. =1900s= The 1900s started with the church being re-glazed, before community life began to degrade and the number of churchgoers in the east end of Sunderland diminished. =Closure= The congregation continued to diminish throughout the 20th century, until on 26 June 1988 the church was forced to close, and transferred to the Redundant Churches Fund (now known as the Churches Conservation Trust). The building itself needed extensive and costly repairs, and indeed to this day the Trust are still undertaking repairs. Present Day Southern (side) elevation No longer in use as a place of worship, the building these days goes by the name of The Canny Space, a community venue and cultural arts centre. Restoration work is still underway, with most of the money being fundraised; as of 2015, £1,341,014 had been raised towards the project. The project's Creative Director role has been filled by noted local musician Dave Stewart, former member of Eurythmics.

He helped form the 1990s British boy band Take That. Biography =Early career= Martin-Smith entered the entertainment industry in the early 1980s working as a casting agent from offices in Manchester's Royal Exchange. From there, he challenged the \\"London-centric\\" attitude of many in the business, championing the cause of local talent and establishing many actors in film and television. His first success in the music industry was the artist Damian who had a UK top 10 hit with a cover of \\"The Time Warp\\" in 1989. He also ran the Film Artist Agency at Half Moon Chambers in Manchester. =Take That= In 1989 following the success of US boyband New Kids on the Block, Martin-Smith decided to create a British version of NKOTB with a similar \\"chosen\\" formula of singers and dancers. In 1990, he assembled Gary Barlow, a 19-year-old from Cheshire who had been singing and playing the piano on the northern club circuit for five years; Mark Owen, an 18-year-old Manchester United trialist; Howard Donald, a 21-year-old vehicle painter who also DJ'd, danced and modelled; and Jason Orange, a 19-year-old painter and decorator from Manchester who had danced on Pete Waterman's television programme The Hit Man and Her. Martin-Smith put out an advertisement for another singer, and chose 16-year-old bodypopper Robbie Williams from Stoke-on-Trent. Take That sold 19 million records (9 million albums and 10 million singles) between 1990 and 1996. Between the band's first single release in 1991 and their break-up in 1996, the BBC described Take That as \\"the most successful British band since The Beatles in the UK, beloved of young and old alike\\". Take That's dance- oriented pop tunes and ballads dominated the UK charts in the first half of the 1990s, spawning two of the best selling albums of the decade with Everything Changes in 1993 and their Greatest Hits in 1996. In 1995, Williams left the band. After his departure, the third Take That album Nobody Else was re-issued in some markets excluding some vocals by Williams, most notably a new recording of \\"Love Ain't Here Anymore\\". Williams did not perform any lead vocals on this album, and band members later blamed this on his \\"lack of interest and commitment\\" in the recording of the album. The rest of the band finally split in 1996. In 1995 Gay Times listed Martin-Smith as one of the most influential gay people in music. In 2007 Martin-Smith was parodied (along with the members of Take That) in the Channel 4 spoof documentary series Star Stories. =Robbie Williams= Robbie Williams left Take That in 1995 under a strict performance and confidentiality agreement. In 1997, Martin-Smith sued Williams for unpaid commission in relation to a Take That management contract. Williams responded by saying that Martin-Smith had been in breach of his fiduciary duties as the group's manager. The court found in Martin-Smith's favour and determined that Williams had indeed violated the terms of the contract. Williams appealed against the decision but lost again. The feud between the pair resurfaced when Williams' biography written by the journalist Chris Heath, Feel: Robbie Williams was published in 2004.Heath, Chris – Feel: Robbie Williams Ebury Press, Pub: 30 September 2004, Williams described how Martin-Smith allegedly destroyed his confidence, and did not hide his hatred for Martin-Smith whom he calls \\"the spawn of Satan\\" claiming that the manager told people he was gay. He noted that: \\"I can say something nice about every single member of Take That. But when it comes to Nigel Martin-Smith....I want to rip his uterus out.\\" In response, Martin-Smith blamed Williams' inability to deal with his sexuality as the major cause of the singer's insecurity and his drug and alcohol issues, and stated: \\"It's very sad that Robbie has turned out like he has. He doesn't seem at all happy. He has been suppressed and the ramifications of that are now beginning to show. He looks a mess, he looks like a lost unhappy individual. It's very telling that none of his relationships with women have lasted. He is now dating another actress in LA. It won't last. It's all for show. Deep down he is gay. Robbie and I were completely comfortable with each other. He was the more dominant one and knew what he wanted. That's not the behaviour of a man who is experimenting for fun. It was for real.\\" On Williams' 2006 album Rudebox, Williams originally detailed in the track \\"The 90s\\" about how he fantasised about gouging out Martin-Smith's eyes out during his time with Take That. The lyrics prompted Martin-Smith to instigate legal action against Williams and EMI prior to the album's release. EMI instructed Williams to rewrite the song and remove the offending lyrics. However, since promotional copies of the album had already been dispatched to the media and the lyrics had been made public knowledge, Martin-Smith proceeded with his lawsuit against Williams and EMI and won £300,000 in the High Court for defamation of character. Williams and EMI were also forced to issue a public apology to Martin-Smith. =After Take That= Martin-Smith entered into a consultancy deal with Virgin Records and managed the come back of Scottish singer Lulu. Around this time, Martin-Smith made a huge investment in his Manchester-based talent agencies moving into purpose- built studios and offices and employing leading agents to oversee his roster of artistes. The NMSM Talent Group now incorporates: *Urban Talent: an agency specialising professional actors with a natural talent to work in television. Two of its clients are actors Gerrard Thompson from In the Flesh and James Bryhan from The Apostate. *Lime actors – a management company for professional, trained actors. One of its clients was former Coronation Street actor Adam Rickitt, signed in 1997. Nemesis Agency (of which Martin-Smith was the sole director) was sold in a pre-pack deal after entering administration in June 2013. In 2005, Martin-Smith was contracted to work on the re-launch of Take That which saw him co-produce a TV documentary about the group, manage the release of their Ultimate Collection compilation album, and launch their sell-out UK tour. However, Martin-Smith was removed from the position once the documentary was over and just before the tour as, according to Mark Owen, he \\"wasn't needed.\\" Martin-Smith later said: “I can’t believe what a success the comeback has been. I thought they would do the tour and that would be it. But now they could tour every year and pack stadiums.” =The Mend= In 2008 Nigel Martin-Smith, formed a new vocal group after auditioning boys from the North West. The initial line up consisted of Lewis Conroy, Dean Kelly, Jayme Kontzle and Craig Worsley. The band was initially called ASBRO, a play on words related to an ASBO (Anti Social Behaviour Order), and were described by Danny McFadden in The Guardian as the new East 17. Martin-Smith stated in an interview that, in seeking members for the band, he, \\"wanted them to be ‘streetwise’ as well as having bags of personality, a good voice and looking good in front of a camera.\\" In early 2010, Martin-Smith auditioned for a fifth member, which resulted in the addition of Kris Evans to the group. At this point Lewis Conroy left the line up and the group became a four piece consisting of Evans, Kelly, Kontzle and Worsley. In 2011, due to the negative associations linked to the name ASBRO, the group became known as The Mend. Of the change, Dean Kelly stated in an interview, 'We loved the name Asbro, but we felt it was holding us back because there was negative feedback about it. We thought ‘we need to mend this’, hence how we came up with The Mend.' Jayme Kontzle added of the name change, \\"No record label has seen us as The Mend so it’s like a new start for us. It also stands for The Manchester End.\\" They stated during their first appearance on Britain's Got Talent in early 2012 that they had been together for three years. Manchester Gay village In 2000 Martin-Smith opened the first of his commercial entertainment venues in Manchester's gay village a nightclub called Essential. He then opened a second venue in 2004 called \\"Queer\\" – a cafe bar by day and a bar/club by night on Canal Street and finally \\"Boyz\\" – an underground pop bar club also on canal street all of which have since closed down.

It is a large housing estate, built between the 1960s and the 1990s. It is situated on the north-eastern edge of Nuneaton, close to the A5 (Watling Street) and approximately 1½ miles from the town centre. Administration Home nation: England Region: West Midlands Administrative county: Warwickshire Ceremonial county: Warwickshire Historic county: Warwickshire Local government district: Nuneaton & Bedworth borough District ward(s): St Nicolas, Weddington County electoral division(s): St Nicolas, Weddington Postal district(s): CV11 (sector 6) Boundaries: Watling Street (A5), The Long Shoot and Hinckley Road (A47), Glebe Lane and the grounds of North Warwickshire & Hinckley College, and Higham Lane History The estate is named after the ecclesiastical parish in which it is located, Nuneaton St Nicolas. The main thoroughfares through the estate are: *St Nicolas Park Drive (between Hinckley Road and Higham Lane), the estate's main road, *Pallett Drive (between St Nicolas Park Drive and the northern end of Milby Drive), *Milby Drive (between Higham Lane and the southern part of Pallett Drive ). Windermere Avenue is also an important thoroughfare, and in fact was originally intended to be the main road through the estate. The first part of the estate to be built was constructed in the 1960s, and is also known as the Glebe Estate, as it was built on land belonging to Glebe Farm (after which nearby Glebe Lane is named). It comprises those streets in the south of the estate, which are mainly named after lakes and places in the English Lake District (e.g. Kirkstone Walk, Ullswater Avenue, Coniston Way). Some streets also bear the name of local dignitaries (e.g. Knox Crescent, Raison Avenue). The second part of the estate was built in the 1970s, based around Pallett Drive (named after the constructor that built the first part of the estate). The streets in this area are mainly named after places on the Thames (e.g. Woodcote Avenue, Reading Avenue, Chelsea Close). One street (Callendar Close) is named after a local farm, while Milby Drive takes its name from the town and parish church of Milby in George Eliot's Scenes of Clerical Life, which was based on Nuneaton (her home town) and St Nicolas parish church. Milby Drive was originally built in two (unconnected) parts (the first leading off Higham Lane, the second leading off the southern part of Pallett Drive). The third and final part of the estate was developed in the 1990s and consisted of the central part of Milby Drive (connecting the two existing parts) and the adjoining cul-de-sacs, which, with the exception of Change Brook Close (named after a local tributary of the Anker), are named after English cathedral cities (e.g. Canterbury Way, Lichfield Close, Norwich Close). Education St Nicolas Park is served by two primary schools: St Nicolas CE Primary School (which also serves the nearby Horeston Grange estate), on Windermere Avenue, and Milby Primary School, on Milby Drive. At secondary level, St Nicolas Park is in the catchment area for nearby Higham Lane School. Post-16 education is provided by King Edward VI College, in the centre of Nuneaton, and North Warwickshire and Hinckley College, adjacent to the estate. Community and leisure facilities St Nicolas Park has a number of recreation grounds and play areas (the largest being the playing fields off Ambleside Way and off Buttermere Avenue). In addition, there are two sports clubs (Ambleside Sports Club and Nuneaton Bowling Club) located nearby. There are two public houses on the estate: The Coniston, on Pallett Drive, and The Harvester (which, since the mid-1990s, has been attached to a Travelodge hotel) on the corner of St Nicolas Park Drive and Hinckley Road. Other nearby pubs include The Chase (on Higham Lane), The Acorn (on Camborne Drive in Horeston Grange), and The Longshoot Hotel. There is one place of worship on the estate: Nuneaton Christian Fellowship on Pallett Drive. The Anglican parish church for the area is St Nicolas' church in Nuneaton town centre. Shopping facilities Local shops can be found around the junction of St Nicolas Park Drive and Coniston Way. The nearest post office is Higham Lane post office (on the corner of St Nicolas Park Drive and Higham Lane). Other shopping facilities can be found in nearby Horeston Grange and in Nuneaton town centre.

Origin The name originates from the Etruscan city of Atria or (Adria) that also gave its name at a much earlier period to the Adriatic Sea. It is believed that the name dates from 1931 or earlier. History The history of Adria and Adriatica as watch trademarks is closely associated with the Belle Époque period through the Montilier Watch Co, established in 1852 in Montilier, close to Morat/Murten, at the foot of the Watch Valley, Switzerland. The brands were dormant from the start of World War II until 1949. From 1962 two associated watch companies, established in Biel/Bienne and Basel, took over the manufacturing and marketing of Adria and Adriatica watches in partnership, designing mainly classical round pink gold- plated ladies’ and some gentlemen's models, and a special model called \\"Adriatica World Champion\\". Both brands, especially Adriatica, flourished in the Scandinavian countries, and also, especially, in Finland. Adriatica watches started being increasingly imported discreetly into Poland by seafaring people and being distributed there and in many of the non-communist countries, becoming established in the Eastern part of Europe. In 1989, foreseeing the opening of trade, a family which owned the company —took over the brands and developed them as manufacturers and distributors. Adriatica watches have always been Swiss made. Since 1998 they were manufactured by their own company, PR & A Watch Sagl, in Dongio, in the watchmaking area of Ticino, the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland.

The goal of boarding is to capture, or destroy, the enemy vessel. Larger ships carried specially trained and equipped sailors, or marines, as boarders. Boarding and hand-to-hand combat was the primary means by which to conclude a naval battle until heavy ordnance gained tactical primacy at sea. A cutting out boarding is an attack by small boats, preferably at night and against an unsuspecting, and anchored, target. It became popular in the later 18th century, and was extensively used during the Napoleonic Wars. This heralded the emphasis on stealth, and surprise, that would come to dominate future boarding tactics. An example is the successful cutting out of the Hermione which took place at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, on 25 October 1799. In modern warfare, boarding by military forces almost always involves stealth, and usually takes place at night. It may involve the use of small submarines or submersibles, or inflatable boats, or by frogmen. All involve scaling the sides of the ship. When stealth is not as important, helicopters may be used to carry troops to the deck of the ship.  In wartime  Boarding is used in wartime as a way to seize a vessel without destroying it, or to remove its cargo (people or goods) before it is destroyed. It can also be used to aid in the collection of naval intelligence, as soldiers boarding a sinking, crippled, or surrendered vessel could possibly recover enemy plans, cipher codebooks or machines. For a boarding to be successful, it must occur without the knowledge of the crew of the defending ship, or the ship's defenses must be suppressed. In modern warfare, boarding by military forces may involve the use of small submarines or submersibles, inflatable boats or helicopters to carry troops to the deck of the ship, or may simply be carried out by scuba divers scaling the sides of the ship.  In peacetime  In peacetime, boarding allows authorized inspectors of one nation or group, such as a coast guard or an international policing fleet (e.g. United Nations fleet), to examine a ship's cargo in a search for drugs, weapons, passengers which are unrecorded on the ship's manifest, or any other type of contraband that could possibly have been carried aboard. A nation's coast guard could also board any suspicious ships that have been overfishing in such a nation's territorial waters. Air ambulances often deploy paramedics to ships by using typical helicopter boarding procedures.

Boarding is the oldest method of securing an opposing ship, as the first cases were depicted when the Sea Peoples and Egyptians fought. For cultures that lack effective shipboard artillery, boarding is the main technique of ship-to-ship combat. However, in the modern era, boarding is still used, particularly when stealth is desired. In all eras, boarding requires that the ship boarded be stable enough to withstand the impact of enemy personnel leaping or climbing onto the deck and a subsequent sustained fight. The target ship must also have enough deck space for boarders to be able to stand and fight effectively. Thus, Native American war canoes or New Zealand waka were not suitable boarding targets, and wars between sides equipped with such vessels have generally not seen boarding actions, or any other decisive form of ship-to-ship combat. Instead, such vessels were often used for the rapid transportation of troops and supplies, and decisive engagements were normally fought by landing forces. = Ancient and Post- classical = Throughout the ancient and post-classical periods, all naval ship-to-ship combat focused primarily on boarding, although ramming and incendiaries were secondary tactics. Greek and Persian naval tactics emphasized ramming and boarding, notably at the Battle of Salamis. The earliest Roman naval battles against Carthage also emphasized boarding. Since the Romans were primarily a land-based army, they could not effectively combat the Carthaginian navy, and subsequently lost several sea battles. The corvus, a boarding ramp with two steel spikes, was the Roman answer to this problem. Roman sailors piloted their ship alongside a Carthaginian ship, dropped the corvus from one deck to the other, and sent their soldiers across the board, assaulting the ship. The Carthaginian navy, unprepared for this \\"land combat\\" on the oceans, lost several ships to this tactic. This invention secured Roman naval dominance in the Mediterranean Sea for several centuries. Battle of Lepanto in 1571, naval engagement between allied Christian forces and the Ottoman Turks During the medieval period, boarding continued to be the dominant form of ship-to-ship combat. The most prominent naval power of the period, the Vikings, rarely fought other seaborne peoples on the water, but they still depended on boarding on those rare occasions, often lashing their longships together to make a more stable platform for the upcoming battle. The maritime use of Greek fire made Byzantium less dependent on boarding than other medieval powers, but it was still used. To better resist boarding, medieval European ships began to be built with high wooden \\"castles\\" fore and aft, which boarders could scale only with great difficulty, while archers, crossbowmen or arquebusiers could sweep the enemy decks. Medieval China, Korea, and Japan were also dependent on boarding tactics, with the flat expanse of a ship used as a battleground for the marine contingents on the ships. The Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185 was one of the classic naval battles in medieval Asia to be decided by boarding. Boarding attacks also occurred beyond the medieval era in Asia. During the Imjin Wars in naval operations, both Korean and Japanese marines would attempt to board the other's ships for engagement in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese used boarding attacks more often because of the imbalance of firepower between the two navies; at the time, the Koreans controlled a much more powerful navy, technically and tactically, than the Japanese. Though the Japanese were armed with the latest in European small firearms, Korean cannons were advanced and among the best in Asia at the time; therefore, it was very easy for Korean ships, using cannons, to destroy Japanese ships. = Early modern period = The development in the early 16th century of shipboard gunports and gun carriages, and the consequent adoption of broadside tactics, gradually ended the primacy of boarding in naval warfare. The decline in boarding occurred faster in Northern and Western Europe than in the Mediterranean. While England and France quickly designed ships with heavy broadsides, the Mediterranean's lighter winds encouraged the Spaniards, Italians and Ottomans to retain the rowed galley, which was difficult to equip with heavy broadsides because the weight and size of the artillery interfered with the oar banks. As late as 1571, the Mediterranean Battle of Lepanto, while influenced by artillery, was still principally a battle determined by boarding. Algerine pirate ship The defeat of Spain's Great Armada in 1588 struck the death knell for major fleets geared toward boarding. The Spanish galleons were intended primarily for boarding combat, their contingents of boarding soldiers far outnumbering the English and their decks provided with high castles for suppressive fire. But the Armada proved unable to close with the English vessels, partly because the Spanish castles rendered their ships more sluggish, while Drake and Hawkins stood off and bombarded the Spanish from long range, tearing up their rigging and decimating their crews with the superior firepower of their broadsides. This enabled the outnumbered English fleet to avoid being boarded and prevent a Spanish landing. While boarding would never again be the dominant tactic in Western naval warfare, it was not abandoned. Boarding was still used as the coup de grace against a crippled ship, enabling the victimized vessel to be recovered and used by the boarders' side rather than being sunk. Important information such as enemy plans, ciphers or rutters might also be recovered. Large quantities of soldiers were consigned to transports rather than \\"pestering\\" the decks of warships, but smaller units of specialized marines were kept aboard to aid in boarding (as well as to enforce naval discipline). Sailors themselves were now expected to play the major role in boarding combat. Boarding was of particular importance in the 17th and 18th centuries' guerre de course, or commerce raiding, as well as to privateers and pirates. Because naval crews were paid prize money for bringing back enemy merchant shipping and cargoes intact, it was preferable to capture such ships rather than sink them, which ultimately required boarding, with or without a preliminary artillery duel. Privateers and pirates found boarding even more necessary, as both depended entirely on capturing merchant vessels for their livelihood, under the wageless system of \\"no purchase, no pay.\\" 's crew boarding at the action of 14 December 1798. There were two chief techniques of boarding in the Age of Sail. One was to bring the two ships close enough to actually step from or leap from one's own gunwale to the enemy's deck. Grappling hooks and lines assisted in keeping the vessels side by side. The second option was to place a boarding party onto a dory, gig, or another type of small boat, row it alongside the target, and then climb aboard by using grappling hooks or the steps built into some ship's sides. The cinematic method of throwing a grappling line into the enemy's rigging or yards and then swinging aboard does not appear to have any historical support, as this could hardly have been practical, and brought a soldier within range of a large group of hostile combatants extremely quickly. In addition, it would be hard for large numbers sufficient to overwhelm the other ship's defenses to be brought onto the deck in this fashion. Boarding in the Age of Sail was more difficult and dangerous than in previous eras of open-decked sailing vessels. Defenders could seek cover in \\"closed quarters\\" in the ship's roundhouse or foredeck, shooting through small loopholes at the exposed boarders. The defenders could also place grenades on their gunwales or dangle them from their yards, detonating them by fuses of quick match that led back through the loopholes into the closed quarters. If not in closed quarters, defenders sometimes resorted to the naval boarding pike, trying to kill or wound boarders while keeping them at a distance, and of course might use any of the weapons that the boarders themselves used. Broke leads the boarding party to USS Chesapeakealt=Sailors in combat on the deck of a ship Boarding weapons in the Age of Sail consisted of grenades, pistols, blunderbusses, muskets, bayonets, cutlasses, naval boarding axes, and naval boarding pikes, etc. Until the introduction of the percussion cap in the early 19th century, sailors preferred to use flintlocks whenever possible, as the lighted match of a matchlock was extremely dangerous to use on board a ship. Spanish and Portuguese sailors, especially officers, were known to use the rapier throughout the 17th and even into the 18th century, but the close-quarter nature of boarding combat rendered these lengthy swords very ineffective. An important multipurpose weapon was the boarding axe, useful for attacking the enemy, but also essential for chopping down doors and bulkheads to break into closed quarters where defenders of a ship could barricade themselves. The heavy blade could also cut grappling lines. The continued success throughout the 18th century of boarding tactics in a secondary role is best exemplified by John Paul Jones' assault against from the sinking in 1779, the only known case in the Age of Sail where a ship's captain captured an enemy ship while losing his own. in turn broke the United States' run of successful frigate battles during the War of 1812 by boarding and capturing in 1813. = Modern era = Anti-piracy boarding, February 2009 The adoption of ironclads and increasingly powerful naval artillery vastly increased the risk to boarding parties. Meanwhile, the suppression of piracy and the abandonment of privateering and prize money made boarding actions even against merchant vessels less rewarding. The massacre of Paraguayan canoe-borne boarding parties by Brazilian ironclads during the Paraguayan War demonstrated the futility of direct assault by boarding in the face of 19th-century technology. During World War I the Royal Navy created their own type of warship specifically designed for boarding. Several armed boarding steamers were converted from merchant ships and fought in engagements such as the Action of 16 March 1917. For the most part, boarding became a police action in which the attackers came on board only when no resistance could be expected, in order to search vessels and remove contraband. The target would be a ship that had hove to or surrendered. During wartime, the surrendering or sinking ship would be searched for any valuable information such as plans and ciphers. One prominent example would be during World War II, when British vessels crippled the in 1941, and sent a crew aboard after the U-boat commander, Kapitänleutnant Fritz-Julius Lemp, gave the order to abandon ship. The British would be rewarded with a fully operational Enigma cipher machine, left behind by the German sailors. On June 4, 1944 a United States Navy task force led by Captain Daniel V. Gallery boarded and captured . True boarding assaults in the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries became extremely rare, generally by small boats or by divers, who entered the target vessel surreptitiously and exploited total surprise to seize control before resistance could be effectively organized. Modern-day pirates in motorboats similarly depend on speed, stealth and surprise to take their targets, usually unarmed and poorly defended, without serious resistance. However, the use of boarding tactics has begun to revive in recent years, both as part of anti- piracy operations and in conflicts such as the ongoing aftermath of the Libyan Civil War, and the 2014 Crimean crisis.

In most wet scrubbing systems, droplets produced are generally larger than 50 micrometres (in the 150 to 500 micrometres range). As a point of reference, human hair ranges in diameter from 50 to 100 micrometres. The size distribution of particles to be collected is source specific. For example, particles produced by mechanical means (crushing or grinding) tend to be large (above 10 micrometres); whereas, particles produced from combustion or a chemical reaction will have a substantial portion of small (less than 5 micrometres) and submicrometre particles. The most critical sized particles are those in the 0.1 to 0.5 micrometres range because they are the most difficult for wet scrubbers to collect. Droplet production Droplets are produced by several methods: #Injecting liquid at high pressure through specially designed nozzles #Aspirating the particle-laden gas stream through a liquid pool #Submerging a whirling rotor in a liquid pool. These droplets collect particles by using one or more of several collection mechanisms such as impaction, direct interception, diffusion, electrostatic attraction, condensation, centrifugal force and gravity. However, impaction and diffusion are the main ones. =Impaction= Figure 1 - Impaction In a wet scrubbing system, dust particles will tend to follow the streamlines of the exhaust stream. However, when liquid droplets are introduced into the exhaust stream, particles cannot always follow these streamlines as they diverge around the droplet (Figure 1). The particle's mass causes it to break away from the streamlines and impact or hit the droplet. Impaction increases as the diameter of the particle increases and as the relative velocity between the particle and droplets increases. As particles get larger they are less likely to follow the gas streamlines around droplets. Also, as particles move faster relative to the liquid droplet, there is a greater chance that the particle will hit a droplet. Impaction is the predominant collection mechanism for scrubbers having gas stream velocities greater than 0.3 m/s (1 ft/s) (Perry 1973). Most scrubbers operate with gas stream velocities well above 0.3 m/s. Therefore, at these velocities, particles having diameters greater than 1.0 µm are collected by this mechanism. Impaction also increases as the size of the liquid droplet decreases because the presence of more droplets within the vessel increases the probability that particles will impact on the droplets. =Diffusion= Figure 2 - Diffusion Very small particles (less than 0.1 µm in diameter) experience random movement in an exhaust stream. These particles are so tiny that they are bumped by gas molecules as they move in the exhaust stream. This bumping, or bombardment, causes them to first move one way and then another in a random manner, or to diffuse, through the gas. This irregular motion can cause the particles to collide with a droplet and be collected (Figure 2). Because of this, diffusion is the primary collection mechanism in wet scrubbers for particles smaller than 0.1 µm. The rate of diffusion depends on the following: #The relative velocity between the particle and droplet #The particle diameter #The liquid-droplet diameter. For both impaction and diffusion, collection efficiency increases with an increase in relative velocity (liquid- or gas-pressure input) and a decrease in liquid-droplet size. Figure 3 - Hypothetical curve illustrating relationship between particle size and collection efficiency for a typical wet scrubber However, collection by diffusion increases as particle size decreases. This mechanism enables certain scrubbers to effectively remove the very tiny particles (less than 0.1 µm). In the particle size range of approximately 0.1 to 1.0 µm, neither of these two collection mechanisms (impaction or diffusion) dominates. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 3. =Other collection mechanisms= In recent years, some scrubber manufacturers have utilized other collection mechanisms such as electrostatic attraction and condensation to enhance particle collection without increasing power consumption. In electrostatic attraction, particles are captured by first inducing a charge on them. Then, the charged particles are either attracted to each other, forming larger, easier-to-collect particles, or they are collected on a surface. Condensation of water vapor on particles promotes collection by adding mass to the particles. Other mechanisms such as gravity, centrifugal force, and direct interception slightly affect particle collection.

Chileans are the second largest group of Latin American Australians residing in Australia. The biggest Chilean Australian communities are primarily found in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.  Demography  According to the 2006 Australian Census, 23,305 Australians were born in Chile while 25,439 claimed Chilean ancestry, either alone or with another ancestry. The Australian 2001 Census reports that 63% of Chilean-born respondents nominated their leading ancestry as Spaniard, while others nominated a Croatian (19%), German (8%), Italian (6%) or English (4%) ancestry. The largest Chilean Australian communities are in Sydney (10,909 residents, 2006 Census result) and Melbourne (6,530). A Chilean government study conducted by the Chilean National Institute of Statistics in 2003-04 and published in 2005 found that 33,626 first and second generation Chileans were living in Australia. This figure was gathered by combining the population reported in the 2001 Australian Census and the National Registry for Chileans living abroad. https://web.archive.org/web/20060213213457/http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/chilenos_exterior/registro_chilenos_exterior.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090416055506/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20050816/pags/20050816125322.html One estimate of Chilean-Australians (including those born in Chile and those of Chilean descent) is approximately 40,000, another 2006 estimate is as high as 45,000. History and cultural background Nick Carle Ramón Freire In 1837, two Chileans arrived in Sydney, the first on record in Australia. One was former Chilean president Ramón Freire, exiled from Chile after attempting to re-take power in a coup. He did not settle in Australia, however, and eventually returned to his homeland. Chilean migration to Australia occurred at different times from the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The first Labour Party Prime Minister of Australia, and the first leader of a social democratic party to become a national head of government, Chris Watson, was born in Valparaíso, Chile the son of a Chilean citizen of German descent. Migration studies demonstrate that late 20th century Chilean migration to Australia occurred in three distinguishable waves. In the 1960s, especially between the years 1968-70, around 1,500-2,000 Chileans arrived in Australia as a consequence of the economic recession produced during the government of Eduardo Frei Montalva, and the high level of unemployment at the termination of his administration. The majority of these people were middle class and well educated, and their migration can be seen to have an economic basis. Frank Duarte The second significant group to arrive was likely motivated by the presidential election of Salvador Allende in 1970. Allende was the world's first democratically elected Marxist President of any nation. His ascension to the presidency provoked a high level of uncertainty amongst the wealthy, given his stated platform of nationalisation of mining, industry, and services. The political and economic unrest that followed prompted many Chileans to flee the threat of political and social instability. This group was, again, overwhelmingly middle class, with sufficient resources (education and finance) to establish themselves as small business operators within Australia. By 1971, 3,760 Chilean-born people were registered in Australia. In this group arrived laser physicist and author Frank Duarte who became the first South American to graduate with a Ph.D. from an Australian university, and leader of the Macquarie science reform movement. The third distinguishable wave of immigration to Australia was the greatest in number by far, and was characterised in large part by Chileans fleeing their homeland as a consequence of political events following the 1973 military coup and subsequent military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. This wave of Chilean migrants was quite homogeneous, comprised in the majority by skilled workers, and at times, their families. In this regard the middle class was represented only in the minority. Political elitists and intellectuals from the left were also small in numbers, due to their preference for Eastern Europe and socialist nations in Latin America. Former president of Chile Michelle Bachelet briefly lived in Australia with family already present in the country after the coup of 1973 later moving to East Germany. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship over Chile lasted until 1990. During his regime more than 500,000 Chileans fled the country, 21,029 of whom sought sanctuary in Australia. However, several thousand have and are still returning to Chile from all over the world as the economic boom of the country has prospered the nation. Moreover, since the latter part of the 1980s, many Chileans who had worked for the military government have also emigrated to Australia, leading to a degree of tension with and periodic denunciations from other Chilean Australians.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-25/adriana-rivas-sydney-woman- wanted-for-extradition-chile/5342476  Notable Chilean Australians  * Chris Watson * Peggy Antonio * Frank J.

Hansa was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1896, launched in March 1898, and commissioned into the Navy in April 1899. The ship was armed with a battery of two 21 cm guns and eight 15 cm guns and had a top speed of . Hansa served abroad in the German East Asia Squadron for the first six years of her career. She contributed a landing party to the force that captured the Taku Forts during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. In August 1904, she participated in the internment of the Russian battleship Tsesarevich after the Battle of the Yellow Sea during the Russo- Japanese War. After returning to Germany in 1906, she was modernized and used as a training ship in 1909, following the completion of the refit. At the outbreak of World War I, Hansa was mobilized into V Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1920. Design Line-drawing of the Victoria Louise class In the early 1890s, elements in the German naval command structure grappled with what type of cruiser ought to be built to fulfill the various needs of the fleet. The Reichsmarineamt (RMA—Imperial Navy Office) preferred to build a combination of large cruisers of around along the lines of and significantly smaller vessels of about to support them, while the Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command) argued that a uniform force of cruisers was preferable. In the event, the RMA carried the day and three 6,000-ton cruisers were authorized in 1895. They resembled the larger s, designed at the same time, albeit at reduced scale. Hansa was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. As designed, she displaced , and at full load, her displacement rose to . Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single screw propeller, with steam provided by eighteen coal-fired Belleville boilers. Her engines were rated for , and provided a top speed of . The ship had a range of approximately at . She had a crew of 31 officers and 446 enlisted men. The ship was armed with two 21 cm SK L/40 guns in single turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns were supplied with 58 rounds of ammunition each. They had a range of . Hansa also carried eight 15 cm SK L/40 guns. Four were mounted in turrets amidships and the other four were placed in casemates. These guns had a range of . She also carried ten 8.8 cm SK L/35 naval guns. The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns. She was also equipped with three torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the broadside and the third was in the bow, all below the waterline. The ship was protected with Krupp armor; their deck was on the horizontal with sloped sides that were thick. Her main and secondary battery turrets had 10 cm thick sides and the secondary casemates had the same level of protection. The conning tower had 15 cm thick sides. Service history Hansa in drydock at AG Vulcan Hansa was ordered under the contract name \\"N\\" and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1896. She was launched on 12 March 1898, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 20 April 1899. Following her commissioning in 1899, Hansa was deployed to Germany's overseas possessions. Hansas first commander on the China station was Hugo von Pohl, who went on to command the High Seas Fleet during World War I. As part of the East Asia Squadron during the Boxer Rebellion, the ship made a noteworthy contribution in the Battle of the Taku Forts. In June 1900, Hansa, along with the cruisers , , and landed detachments of Seebataillone (marines) to seize the Taku Forts. The marines joined detachments sent from warships of several other countries. A total of around 450 German troops were contributed to the multi-national force, which totaled around 2,200 officers and men. On 11 July 1903, the ship steamed into the British naval base at Weihaiwei, along with the Chinese cruiser Hai Chi. Hansa left the port two days later. On 16 January 1904, Hansa visited Mirs Bay outside of Hong Kong and departed after two days in the harbor. In February, the Russo-Japanese War broke out; Hansa was sent from Che Foo for Port Arthur, which was under attack by Japanese forces. Hansa evacuated the German civilians in the port. In early March, she was again in Hong Kong, and was joined there by the flagship of the East Asia Squadron, on the 8th. In August, the badly damaged Russian battleship Tsesarevich and three destroyers sought refuge in the German naval base at Tsingtao following the Russian defeat in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. As Germany was neutral, the East Asia Squadron interned Tsesarevich and the destroyers. On 13 August, the Russian ships restocked their coal supplies from three British steamers, but Hansa and Fürst Bismarck cleared for action to prevent them from leaving the port. The two cruisers were joined by Hertha, , and the gunboats and . Lithograph of Hansa in 1902 Hansa returned to Germany in 1906. The following year, she went to dry dock at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig for a refit, during which she was re-boilered. Hertha originally had three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished by 1909, at which point Hansa became a cadet training ship. From 1911 to 1912, Günther Lütjens served aboard Hansa as commander of the naval cadets that trained on the ship. Lütjens went on to command the task force composed of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen in World War II. In early January, Hansa cruised into the Atlantic and visited Bermuda. Hansa had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into V Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service. She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a barracks ship for the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship-breakers in Audorf-Rendsburg. She was scrapped the following year.

Formerly referred to as the Qasr Prison ( zendān-e qasr, \\"Castle Prison\\"), it was one of the oldest political prisons in Iran, which is now a museum complex surrounded by a public park. History Qasr was originally built in 1790 as a palace with extensive gardens of which nothing but the names remain, in the reign of Fath-ali Shah of the Qajar Dynasty. In 1929 it was repurposed as a prison, the first modern detention center in the country, in which prisoners had legal rights. Nikolai Markov, a Georgian architect who settled in Iran after the Russian Revolution, did the rebuild, combining urban industrial design with traditional Iranian features such as adobe bricks, which became known as Markovian bricks. It had 192 rooms for 700 prisoners, of which about 100 cells were solitary. Here Ahmad Ahmadi, known to prisoners simply as “Dr Ahmadi” administered lethal air injections to several of Reza Shah's many opponents, such as the poet Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi. After Reza Shah was overthrown by the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941, Ahmadi himself was tried for the murders and executed in 1943. For Mohammad Reza Shah, it served as a torture and execution chamber of those who opposed his regime. In its dark, dank-smelling cells Ayatollah Khomeini, Ali Khamenei, Morteza Motahhari and Ayatollah Taleqani were held. On 11 February 1979 1,000 women were liberated from the prison. Following the 1979 Revolution, many civil and military officials of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi were detained and executed at the prison, including Nader Jahanbani and Amir Hossein Rabi'i; Major General Manuchechr Khosrodad and Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveida were imprisoned at Qasr before being executed on the roof of Refah School, where Khomeini had set up his headquarters. In subsequent decades the prison fell into disuse till in 2005 it was announced by the ICHTO that the compound would become a museum. In 2008 it was donated to the municipal government. Reopened in 2012, the former prison buildings and offices were turned into museum buildings, surrounded by a public park which carries the same name. It hosts many cultural events such as the Nowrooz festival. According to the Iranian Students News Agency Qasr was named the most creative museum in the country in 2013.

Originally designed for the Central and South Atlantic passenger routes, it was later adapted as a military transport and special raider. Design and development The design for the construction of a large four-engine, twin-float seaplane began at the end of September 1937, when the technical department of CRDA accepted the specifications of the LATI (Compagnia Ala Littoria) company, created in 1939, who required a long-range seaplane for carrying mail, cargo and passengers to Latin America. These plans were cancelled on the outbreak of World War II, but a version of the aircraft was adapted for long-range maritime patrol, armed with 10 single-mount machine guns in both side gun positions, in two upper turrets, and belly positions. Plans were made to install cannon in a front turret or in a glazed nose position, and more machine guns in a tail position. For bombing, it was adapted to carry up to of bombs in an internal bomb bay and on outer wing positions: up to four launch racks, for air-launched torpedoes for surface attack, or \\"Maiale\\" manned torpedoes or midget submarines for special operations. The original engines were relatively underpowered, so Zappata asked the authorities for permission to acquire Wright R-2600 Double Cyclones from the United States. Due to the deteriorating international situation, however, he was unable to obtain authorization. The CANT Z.511 civil aircraft could theoretically carry 16 passengers over . Later, when adapted as a military transport, four Piaggio P.XII R.C.35 were used, giving only adequate power to an aircraft weighing up to , giving it a maximum range of . Operational history rightThe Z.511 had its first test flights at Monfalcone, Venezia Giulia (north-eastern Italy) between October 1940 and March 1942. Between 28 February and 1 March 1942, test pilot Mario Stoppani succeeded in taking off and landing fully loaded in very rough seas, with waves and winds of . The Z.511 prototype was then transported to Grado, Venezia (further away from the insecure Yugoslavian border) for further evaluations; the last test and operational flight occurred on 1 September 1943, two days before the Italian Armistice was signed. After the division of the Italian forces, one aircraft was appropriated by the Fascist Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana. However, it had been damaged only three weeks before by British fighters, which had strafed it on Lake Trasimeno where it was undergoing final trials. It was transferred to the seaplane base at Vigna di Valle. There it suffered from sabotage by base personnel to prevent it falling into the hands of either the Allies or the Germans. The other aircraft, still under construction at the CRDA factory, was retained by Axis forces and scrapped for the metal, which was sent to Germany.

The term was first coined by the author Michael Moorcock in 1963 and later used by critics of 1960s urban restructuring in the United States. Ada Louise Huxtable in 1972 and Marshall Berman in 1996 have written about urban restructuring (and destruction) in areas like the Bronx, and highlight the impacts of aggressive redevelopment on the urban social experience. The term has come into being in an age of rapid globalization and urbanization. This rapid globalization trend has led to the focus of violence and destruction in the context of the city rather than its surroundings. Especially after the events at Sarajevo, recognition has begun to be given to the cases of violence specifically directed to the destruction of an urban area. The exact constraints and definition of this term continue to be debated because the limits of this emerging concept make it extremely difficult to categorize events under the heading of urbicide. The question of intent also arises when discussing the limits of urbicide. The ability of term to cross a variety of fields such as international politics, anthropology, and sociology makes it particularly difficult to set a finite definition of urbicide which satisfies all these fields.  Terminology  The term \\"urbicide\\" has its roots in the Latin word urbs, meaning \\"city\\", and occido, meaning \\"to massacre\\". In 1944, Raphael Lemkin defined genocide as \\"a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves\\". This term, however, failed to address violence not aimed at human bodies. The first recorded use of the term \\"urbicide\\" was by Michael Moorcock in the Elric novella \\"Dead God's Homecoming\\" (Science Fantasy #59, Nova Publishing, June 1963). In the wake of the destruction of Sarajevo, the term gained more common usage, examples being found in the works of Marshall Berman (1987) and Bogdan Bogdanović. In their 1992 publication \\"Mostar '92\\", a group of Bosnian architects from Mostar used the term urbicide to define the violence against the city fabric, such as the destruction of the Mostar bridge, a usage consistent with Marshall Berman's prior use of the term to describe similar acts of violence in Bosnia. Urbicide is increasingly being used by architects, urban planners, scholars and historians to help describe and understand the contemporary and historic wars where cities can no longer be considered safe havens from war, but rather are part of the battlefield. Some people argue that urbicide should be understood as a part of genocide, as to destroy people's homes is to destroy them. In his book Urbicide, Martin Coward argues along a similar line. Rather than use urbicide for all violence against the city, Coward uses the term to denote violence which seeks to annihilate difference through the destruction of the material foundation of that difference. The urban is meant to imply the material foundation of heterogeneity (being with others as being with otherness), and he interprets some instances of destruction of the city as an attempt to destroy the material foundations of that heterogeneity. Urbicide would then share the annihilatory character of genocide, but not necessarily its focus on human beings as the object of destruction. The definition of urbicide is interdependent on the definitions of city and violence. In many urbicidal incidents, one or both of these definitions has been removed from the situation's context by the perpetrator. Either the \\"city\\" receiving the violence has been demoted from its status as \\"city\\", or the violent act is not considered violent. The meaning of the words city and violence therefore become highly important when classifying an act as urbicidal. A city is an area consisting of numerous institutions, residents, industries, and businesses supported by large infrastructure and a dense and diverse population. A city can be framed in numerous ways. For example, it can be thought of as an economic system, in which all social relations stem from a market economy, and the city is produced and shaped by the market. A city can also be thought of as a state of mind, in which all people who live in the city share the same consciousness. Similarly, it can be seen as an aggregation of different social/cultural forms, making cities a center for heterogeneity. Finally, a city can be seen from an architectural perspective, as a conglomeration of masses and spaces. As Henri Lefebvre states, \\"a city is, therefore, whatever is experienced, known, represented, constructed, or destroyed as a city.\\" Violence is typically defined as, \\"a behaviour involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill\\" (Compact Oxford Dictionary). However, when defining violence sociologists, historians, philosophers and other scholars have identified other less direct forms of violence that should also be considered. Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Philippe Bourgois write in their book Violence in War and Peace that \\"Violence can never be understood solely in terms of its physicality – force, assault, or the infliction of pain – alone. Violence also includes assaults on the person hood, dignity, sense of worth or value of the victim. The social and cultural dimensions of the violence are what gives violence its power and meaning.\\" Some of the other categories are structural violence, symbolic violence, and violence enacted by the government through laws or actions. Structural violence occurs when the structure of a society causes the violence. Examples of this include laws that create unequal access to public amenities or affect different citizens based on their status in society. Symbolic violence concerns socially accepted norms that are ingrained over time such as the roles of different classes, genders and ethnic groups. Finally political violence addresses the harm the government can inflict by their actions either through neglect or action. All of these forms of violence can also be characterized in urbicide. While physical destruction of a city's buildings is the most obvious form of urbicide, it can also occur in less noticeable ways. Governments redefining areas of the city as slums or \\"illegitimate\\" can lead to an unequal treatment of citizens. For people living in these areas they have been denied their citizenship. How a government zones a city can also generate violence. While not directly causing harm, certain zoning combinations could increase violence, decrease the value of properties, and force poorer people into an undesirable neighborhood.  Cases  The hybrid nature of the term urbicide suggests that it is either a radical framework through which to view the historical destruction of cities, or something appropriate only to the \\"now\\" and has mandatory qualities in the present. Whereas in its first modern manifestations the targeting and destruction of cities was seen as something new, outside the traditional rules of European warfare, Marshall Berman, an American Marxist writer and political theorist, proposes that urbicide is the oldest story in the world. In his view, the Old Testament books of Jeremiah and Lamentations appropriately cover urbicide, or mark its beginnings. In later times the Roman Empire imposed the complete destruction of Jerusalem and a similarly devastating Carthaginian peace, though these proved less than permanent. Nonetheless, Berman's view of potential \\"urbicidal\\" events is very much within the Marxist historical telos, which suppresses the contingency of urbicide in history, or rather, its own telos. Many cities are in some sense imperial cities, having created an empire (Babylon, Rome), or been created by one (Persepolis, Cairo, Philadelphia) or greatly expanded (Byzantium, Delhi) or have become the capital of one (Peking, London) or received special privileges from an empire, for example as Free Imperial Cities. Thus there are perspectives that see urbicide as part of broader imperialist goals, for example in the elimination of cities by Communist Cambodia. Writers and geographers such as Mike Davis, Nurhan Abujidi and Stephen Graham represent some of these currents. The Nazis' deliberate destruction of Warsaw, as well as the Siege of Sarajevo, which led to the \\"coining\\" of the most current and popular definition of urbicide, stand as the most symbolic historical events representative of urbicide. Recent events in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Zimbabwe, post-Katrina New Orleans, and Iraq also stand as significant urbicidal examples, and can be taken as a broad spectrum of \\"violence against the city,\\" indicating the fluidity or multi-faceted discourse of urbicide. =Vukovar= Castle Eltz was in ruins The siege of Vukovar was an 87-day military campaign aimed against the eastern Croatian city of Vukovar led by the Yugoslav People's Army, supported by various Serbian paramilitary forces between August and November 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Indiscriminate bombardment of Vukovar, in which up to a million shells were fired on the city, led to destruction of three quarters of all neighborhoods. Among them were schools, hospitals, churches, public institutions’ facilities, factories, medieval Eltz Castle and house of the Nobel-winning author Lavoslav Ružička. Several sources, like the Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Serbia, described the systematic destruction of the city as urbicide. Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Serbia also criticized the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for not reaching a verdict for the destruction of Vukovar. Slobodan Milošević was indicted for, inter alia, \\"wanton destruction\\" of the city, but died before a verdict was reached. Goran Hadžić was also indicted in the same category and is on trial. =Sarajevo= Heavily destroyed apartment buildings in Sarajevo Violence in Sarajevo was a product of the Bosnian War, which lasted from 1992–1995 in which Serb forces of the Republika Srpska and the Yugoslav People's Army besieged Sarajevo. This region was very ethnically diverse, providing homes for both Serbs and Muslim Slavs. The violence is sometimes referred to as ethnic cleansing which ended in some of the worst violence this region has ever seen. Ultimately, urbicide resulted in the complete annihilation of Sarajevo's built environment. This broke down the city's infrastructure and denied thousands of civilians food, water, medicine, etc. In the wake of this violence, Sarajevo's Civilians also became victims of human rights offenses including rape, execution, and starvation. The Bosnian government declared the Siege over in 1996. =Warsaw= A German soldier sets fire to a building in Warsaw Warsaw Old Town marketplace, 1945 During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Nazi Germany deliberately razed most of the city of Warsaw after the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The uprising had infuriated German leaders, who decided to make an example of the city, although Nazi Germany had long selected Warsaw for major reconstruction as part of their Lebensraum policy and Generalplan Ost, the plans to Germanize Central and Eastern Europe and eliminate, ethnically cleanse, or enslave the native Polish and Slavic populations. The Nazis dedicated an unprecedented effort to destroying the city. Their decision tied up considerable resources which could have been used at the Eastern Front and at the newly-opened Western Front following the Normandy landings. The Germans destroyed 80–90% of Warsaw's buildings and deliberately demolished, burned, or stole an immense part of its cultural heritage, completely destroying Warsaw's Old Town. =Zimbabwe= While the term \\"urbicide\\" finds its genesis in the urban destruction and targeting associated with the Bosnian Wars of the early 1990s, its meaning(s) develops historically and in the present. Recent events in Zimbabwe, while falling under the definition of urbicide as selective violence and destruction against cities, also positions urbicide outside the dynamics of genocidal warfare. Operation Murambatsvina or \\"Operation Restore Order\\" was a countrywide program of targeted violence against cities, towns, peripheral urban areas, and resettled farms, resulting in the destruction of housing, trading markets, and other \\"collective\\" structures. It was a large- scale operation, strategically resulting in the displacement of over 700,000 refugees, and \\"knowingly\\" manufacturing a massive humanitarian crisis. Beyond the obvious violations of human rights, Operation Murambatsvina is striking in its abilities to literally unhinge the urban and rural poor from the collective structures integral to everyday, grounded existence in favor of dispersal, but without active state measures to reinstitute these people within governable spaces. Though Operation Murambatsvina has been seen as urbicidal, the question has been raised as to whether an urbicidal framework seeks a different subtext. =New Orleans= The destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 has been interpreted as the culmination of political and policy-driven urbicide that has been played out over many decades of corrupt politics, exemplified by leaders such as William J. Jefferson which led to waste and outright theft of civic funds by elected officials from all socioeconomic backgrounds. While natural disasters such as Katrina cannot be considered urbicidal in and of themselves, such disasters can, due to flawed governmental legislation, affect socioeconomic groups disproportionately. In the case of New Orleans, the areas of the city that were hit hardest included neighborhoods from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Areas housing members of the lowest socioeconomic classes lacked the resources to rebuild and re-establish their communities. Higher income neighborhoods were able to raise funds for additional security and civic improvements through tax levees and private fund raising efforts. Impoverished neighborhoods dependent upon city's resources were unable to successfully re- establish themselves without federal Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. According to urbicide scholar Andrew Herscher, \\"Katrina's effects…were but the last and most visible traces of a chronic disaster, an urbicide fabricated not by military action but by policy and ideology.\\" =Aleppo= Robert Templer and AlHakam Shaar proposed that the deliberate destruction of Aleppo during the Battle of Aleppo was a form of \\"urbicide\\".  Human rights  Human rights discourse provides another lens in which we can view urbicide, especially through the use of The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Universal Declaration of Human Rights Using the term urbicide, usually refers to violence and destruction of buildings and architecture, but when also using the UN's Declaration along with urbicide, the focus is instead on people. Looking at violent acts and observing how they affect people, their culture and their safety inevitably centers on human rights and may often carry more validity for these urbicidal acts to also be cases of human rights violations. The following cases are viewed here with a greater focus on the human rights aspect of them. The term urbicide can still apply, but human rights language may allow for a more familiar approach to these cases as many people are already aware of the general rights that people hold. These rights are explicitly stated here to fully demonstrate how fundamental rights are being violated as part of urbicide: =Sarajevo= Article 3 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and Article 5 states that no one shall be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. However, 20,000 Muslim women and girls were raped by Serbs, thousands were missing and/or executed. When using the term urbicide, human rights should be included because atrocities like this also affect the culture and feeling of the city. They must be taken into account when the urbicidal effects of bombings and military actions in the region are being examined because they show that the conflict was more than simply destroying the physical city buildings; there was destruction of people, their safety and of their communities. =Zimbabwe= The rights of 700,000 Zimbabweans were violated as they were forced from their urban homes and were left to create new lives for themselves during Operation Murambatsvina in May 2005 . Clearly this breaks the UN's Article 25 which says: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. The government forcibly removed these citizens from where they were living knowingly displaced them, leaving them without resources and access to food, shelter and health care.  International law  As of now there is no explicit language mentioning urbicide in international and humanitarian law. As the term has been coined and interpreted only recently, during the Yugoslav war in the 1990s, it has not reached public consciousness and public discourse to such extent as to be an instantiated into international law. If genocide and urbicide, however, are synonymous terms, as some theorists propose, it could be argued that urbicide is already prohibited by international law. It can also be argued that urbicide, as destruction of urban spaces and human habitations, is made illegal under international law and humanitarian law through the effects of other laws dealing with destruction of human-made environment and people's dependency upon it. Such laws are the rights to adequate housing, the right to life and privacy, to mental integrity, and to the freedom of movement. The most salient example of Sarajevo, where the term urbicide partly originated, clearly demonstrates the violation of these basic human rights on the civilian population of the city. Testimonies of the urbicide in Sarajevo, in the cultural production of confessional literature during the siege, clearly show the dramatic plunge in the standard of living, the overtaking and militarization of the public space, and the daily struggle of the citizens to get basic supplies such as food and water. In other cases, such as the Porta Farm evacuation and demolition of settlements by the Harare local government, there is evidence of violation of these basic human rights as specified by the International Law and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights . Despite the specified violations, however, it might be useful to apply, as with genocide, the umbrella term urbicide for these and other cases of urban destruction. The prospects for a codified prohibition of urbicide might benefit from differentiating the term's legal articulation from human rights law, just as urbicide conceptually separates itself from human rights. With the city as the site of urbicide, the traditional nation-state parties to international legislation might not suffice alone as stake-holders in any legal process, customary or otherwise. However, too much localizing of the criminalization of urbicide risks exonerating by inaction the governments often implicated as aggressors against the city and its citizens. It is often against their power interest to prosecute urbicide or to establish any form of judicial framework that deals explicitly with violations of such nature. The inclusion of governments into the process is desirable, but their willingness to submit to another kind of scrutiny: particularly under the broad definitions of structural violence that often enter discourses on urbicide. They could presumably make their way into the legal discourses, as well. The lack of explicit terminology that would address the destruction of cities in legal terms on the international level makes it unlikely that the international courts will take the issue more seriously. The problem is also with the enforcement of these laws on the international level, which have previously unenforced, even the human rights laws already in place. Decisions of the International court, such as the case of reparations to Bosnia by the Serbian government for crimes against humanity, in which the court, in February 2007, acquitted Serbia of the duty to give reparations, perhaps demonstrate the further need to distinguish between urbicide and genocide. In the case of Sarajevo, where the case of genocide, as legally understood, could not be unequivocally applied to cases such as the Siege of Sarajevo, the concept of urbicide might provide a better interpretive framework for the violence inflicted upon the Sarajevo populace and their urban environment, such as the shared public space and the architecture of the city. The goal of such violence may have not been to destroy a minority population and their cultural and symbolic space, as in cases of genocide but to fragment the heterogeneous population of the city into homogeneous enclaves based on the ethnicity of the population. Thus, the violence is not directed towards an ethnicity per se, but towards the city as a heterogeneous space where different cultural identities can live and interact without antagonism.

On 8 February 1988, Pope John Paul II proclaimed her Venerable. Early life Mary Potter and her sister-in-law Marguerite. Mary Potter's engagement photo Mary Potter was born in a rented house at 23 Old Jamaica Road in Bermondsey, South London. Mary was the fifth child and the only girl born to William and Mary Anne (Martin) Potter. One of her brothers was the chess master William Norwood Potter. Mary had a congenital heart and lung disease which left her with frail health and a permanent cough for the rest of her life. Her father left the family home in 1848, went to Australia, and never returned, leaving Mrs. Potter to raise the children by herself.\\"Mary Potter: Her Story\\", Little Sisters of the Poor When Mary was 19, she was introduced to her brother's friend, Godfrey King and became engaged. Godfrey, who had tried a vocation as a Trappist monk, would give Mary pious books. After about four months, Mary wrote to Godfrey to terminate the engagement. Bishop Grant, suggested she seek her calling as a religious sister. As she was of delicate health, her mother suggested that Brighton would be a healthy place for her to go, and so they went to seek advice about her vocation at the Sisters of Mercy Convent.\\"Venerable Mary Potter\\", Little Company of Mary Hospital and Health Care Centers Sisterhood Mary resolved to go to Brighton by train and investigate life as a religious, with her mother and her brother. They arrived on 7 December 1868 and met the sisters. After some discussion the sisters suggested to Mary that the next day, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, would be a good day to receive her as a postulant. This was a hasty decision and Mary was ill- prepared to enter into religious life so suddenly. However, she decided to stay, receiving the name Sister Mary Angela.Dom Antoine Marie osb., \\"Venerable Potter\\", Abbey of Saint-Joseph de Clairval But it became evident that life was too demanding physically for Mary and she was advised to leave the convent after eighteen months. Her spiritual director, Fr. Lambert, S.J., was convinced that she should go into a contemplative order that combined Eucharistic adoration and apostolic activity, rather than a strictly contemplative order such as the Carmelites. She left the Sisters of Mercy on 23 June 1870. As she became stronger, Mary's prayer life became more intense. After a period of prayer and reflection, she started to think of the possibility of founding a group of religious Sisters dedicated to the spiritual, and where possible, the physical assistance of those who were sick and dying. In 1872, she became more and more convinced that this was what she was called to do. Little Company of Mary Mary sought spiritual advice from a Monsignor John Virtue, newly arrived in Southsea as a Military Chaplain. Mary asked him to guide her. She wrote many letters to Virtue which are now at the Propaganda Fide Archives in Rome. Mary wrote to Monsignor Virtue, \\"I cannot but feel I have had a call from God to devote myself to help save souls in their last hour. I have been drawn so strongly to pray for the dying.\\" Mary continued to write to Monsignor Virtue although he was less than encouraging. In January 1876 Monsignor Virtue was transferred. Mary's youngest brother, George, now a teacher at Ratcliffe College, wrote to Mary suggesting that she apply to Bishop Bagshawe, (Bishop of Nottingham) for permission to work in his diocese. Bishop Bagshawe offered to pay the rent for 12 months and Mary found an old disused stocking factory for the beginnings of her “special work.” The date of the opening ceremony of her first convent was Easter Monday, 2 April 1877. She was soon joined by other young women in this poor area called Hyson Green. After a lot of discussion with Fr. Selley and others, it was decided to call the group the Little Company of Mary. Eventually they settled on a simple dress of a plain habit of black and a pale blue veil. The Little Company of Mary sisters went out and helped the sick and poor in their homes. Bishop Bagshawe did not agree with Mary Potter's vision of the Little Company of Mary and could not understand that she wanted the sisters to be both ‘active and contemplative.’ He could also not understand Mary's inspiration for the sisters to be in constant prayer for the dying. After three weeks he deposed Mary as superior and put another sister in charge. In 1878 Mary underwent two mastectomies within six months. The operation was performed on the kitchen table of the convent on 8 December. She went to Rome in 1882 to gain approval for the Constitutions of her new Congregation, and while there established Calvary Hospital on the Via S Stefano Rotondo not far from St. John Lateran.\\"Venerable Mary Potter\\", Calvary Health Care It was there in 1908 that the first Catholic Training School for nurses commenced in Italy. Through contacts of many Bishops and laity, the Little Company of Mary was becoming well known. There were invitations to go to other countries as their ministry was appreciated. In 1885 five sisters sailed to Sydney, Australia. The Little Company of Mary then spread to the Southern Hemisphere and flourished, attending the sick, the poor and the dying where they were needed.

Background and education Born one of six children in Woodlands, Falkirk, Scotland, he was the son of Anne Steuart (Forbes) and Robert Wyllie Howie, and the grandson of businessman Thomas W. Howie.http://www.thepeerage.com/p27999.htm#i279988 Considered too frail to follow his brothers to the High School of Glasgow, he was therefore cared for by a maid and educated at local schools. He then studied electrical engineering at Glasgow University, graduating in 1941. He served in the RAF for four years during the Second World War, gaining the rank of Flight Lieutenant. Career Howie was Assistant Managing Director of Thomas Laurie & Co, his uncle's motor and electrical engineering firm, from 1947 to 1957, becoming Managing Director upon his uncle's death until his own retirement in 1981. Thomas Laurie & Co was founded in 1882 and had fitted the first fully automated street lighting in Britain, in Falkirk; it was also a car dealership, most recently for Peugeot. Turnover surpassed £1 million in the early 1970s. As well as being an Associate of the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, a Member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers and an Associate Member of the Institute of the Motor Industry, Howie also served on the Engineering Advisory Committee of Falkirk College of Technology. Civil duties Howie was made responsible for the setting up of the Children's Hearing system in Falkirk, becoming the first Chairman of the local Children's Panel Advisory Committee in 1970, Chairman of the Supplementary Benefit Appeal Tribunal in 1973, and a Justice of the Peace the following year. In 1981 he was appointed Her Majesty's Deputy Lord Lieutenant for the County of Stirling, representing HM The Queen at official functions. In 1983 he was appointed General Commissioner of Income Tax, a position he held until the age of 75. Interests A keen supporter of the Scout movement, having met Robert Baden- Powell in person in his youth, he held the position of District Commissioner for Falkirk District for 18 years. He then became Chairman of the Falkirk District Scout Association, becoming Honorary President in 1978. At that time he was also appointed Chairman of the Forth Valley Scout Council, representing this body on the Scottish Committee of the Scout Association, a post he held until 1989. He received the Medal of Merit in 1956, the Silver Acorn in 1981, and the Silver Wolf, the highest Scouting award given to just one in two million members, in 1989, for 'services of the most exceptional character to the movement'. He founded the Stirling and District Amateur Football Association in 1951, as well as serving on the board of the Scottish Wildlife Trust. His interest in nature, particularly geology, led to him gaining a Bachelor of Arts in Ecology from the Open University in his retirement. He was also President of Falkirk Rotary Club and was made a Paul Harris Fellow. He was also President of Falkirk Fishing Club and the Toastmasters Club and a Director of Glenbervie Golf Club. He was also chairman of the local Age Concern.

The business was one successor to Routledge, Warne, Routledge (thus from 1858), the publishing partnership of Warne with his brother-in-law George Routledge and the eldest of Routledge's sons. The other successor was George Routledge & Sons.Imminent termination of the partnership and succession by Routledge was reported in \\"Literary Gossip\\", The London Review, 17 June 1865, p. 646\\\\. \\"On the 30th of the present month the partnership hitherto subsisting between Mr. George Routledge, Mr. F. Warne, and Mr. R. W. Routledge, will terminate. After that date, business will be carried on by the Messrs. Routledge under the style and title of George Routledge & Sons, who will receive all accounts due to, and meet all claims against, the present firm.\\" The next weekly issue of The Athenaeum, no. 1965, 24 June 1865, carried two advertisements by Frederick Warne & Co. and one by George Routledge & Sons (its \\"List of New Books\\", p. 855). Warne announced a new arrangement as the exclusive seller of books published by S. O. Beeton (p. 834) and provided a double list of books (p. 835): \\"S. O. Beeton's Publications\\" and \\"Works: Formerly published by Routledge, Warne & Routledge, now the property of Frederick Warne & Co.\\" Two weeks later Warne listed its own \\"New Publications\\", The Athenaeum, no. 1967, 8 July 1865, p. 37. During the second half of the nineteenth century, the company built a good reputation for publishing children's books, publishing illustrated books by well-known authors and artists as Edward Lear, Kate Greenaway and Walter Crane. The company also published a 'Pictorial' series of books of collections of short essays and illustrations on many non-fiction topics. The following list may not be complete. Pictorial Cabinet of Marvels Pictorial Museum of Sport and Adventure Pictorial Records of Remarkable Events Pictorial Stories of Heroism and Enterprise Pictorial Travels on Land and Sea Pictorial Treasury of Famous Men and Famous Deeds The Pictorial Tour of the World Toward the end of the century, Frederick Warne had retired and left the firm to his three sons, Harold, Fruing and Norman. Warne was among the six publishers whom Beatrix Potter submitted her first book, the story of a rabbit called Peter. Like the other five firms, Warne turned the proposal down. But the people at the firm changed their minds when they saw the privately published copy in 1901. They said they would publish the book, as long as the illustrations were drawn in colour. The next year, Warne published The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and by Christmas it had sold 20,000 copies. This began a 40-year partnership that saw the publication of 22 additional little books. Beatrix Potter was engaged to marry Norman Warne, her editor and the youngest of the three Warne brothers. However, he died tragically in 1905, only a few weeks after their engagement. Harold, the eldest brother, took over as Potter's editor. She continued to produce one or two new Little Books each year for the next eight years until her marriage in 1913 to William Heelis. During the next few years Potter turned her attention to her farm work, but when the company fell on hard times and Harold was imprisoned for embezzlement, she came to the rescue with another new title to support \\"the old firm.\\" Potter, who had no children, left the rights to her works to Warne upon her death. The company continued to publish them; it also brought out several biographical works about its most renowned author. Over the years, Warne also expanded its nonfiction publishing, issuing among others the world-famous Observer books. In 1983, Warne was bought by Penguin Books. It began developing classic book-based children's character brands. The merchandising program was expanded from a base of thirty-five licenses to more than four hundred by the late 1990s. Over the years, Warne acquired a variety of other classic books. A major motion picture about the life of Beatrix Potter Miss Potter, starring Renée Zellweger as Beatrix Potter and Ewan McGregor as Norman Warne was released in 2006. While the company no longer exists as an independent company, it continues to exist as an imprint of Penguin Group. The company collaborated with Sony Pictures Animation and Animal Logic to produce the Peter Rabbit film, which was released in 2018.  Beatrix Potter books  From 1902 to 1930 Warne published twenty-three story books written and illustrated for children by Beatrix Potter. Primarily they feature anthropomorphic animals, such as Peter Rabbit in the first of the series, The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Here they are listed by year of the first edition. *The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) *The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903) *The Tailor of Gloucester (1903) *The Tale of Benjamin Bunny (1904) *The Tale of Two Bad Mice (1904) *The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle (1905) *The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan (1905) *The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher (1906) *The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit (1906) *The Story of Miss Moppet (1906) *The Tale of Tom Kitten (1907) *The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck (1908) *The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or, The Roly-Poly Pudding (1908) *The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies (1909) *The Tale of Ginger and Pickles (1909) *The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse (1910) *The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes (1911) *The Tale of Mr. Tod (1912) *The Tale of Pigling Bland (1913) *Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes (1917) *The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) *Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes (1922) *The Tale of Little Pig Robinson (1930) Warne also published the first British edition of one longer children's book written and illustrated by Potter. *The Fairy Caravan (1952); US edition, 1929  Observer's Books  From 1937 to 2003, Warne published small, pocket-sized books, which were available on many subjects. The aim of these books were to interest the observer. They were called the Observer's books. These books were very popular amongst children. Over the past few years they have become very popular collector items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now very rare. The values of the books can vary from 50p to hundreds of pounds. They all include a variety of topics, which include hobbies, art, history, wildlife and many more. The earlier books were printed with paper dust covers up until 1969. These were good for printing but where not very practical because they were very delicate and were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. This helped the dust covers protection. These types are often referred to as Glossies. From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books, so the books were highly protected as they didn't really have any covers. The dust covers from 1937 to 1970 had designs that were colourful and attractive as each one had its own unique colouring of squiggly lines at the top. In 1971, Warne decided to refurbish its books with a more formal dust jacket. These were good but it lost the charm that the original covers had had. I have some pictures below of old and new dust jackets in Observer's books. The first Observer guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British Birds. This is now very rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second book, on British Wild Flowers, a mint copy of this book is worth around £220. By 1941, Warne had published the first six Observer's books. In 1942, a special edition book was brought out on Airplanes. This book had no number in the series, as it was bought out to help people spot enemy planes during World War 2. It was printed again in 1943 and in 1945. When Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne bought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the Observer's books and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up to date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, The dust cover was laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the penguin Observer's books, Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions). Below is a list of all the original Observer's books with the dates of their first editions, and two pictures of Observer's books.
