Different societies, cultures and eras have attached different values to the word and have different perspectives on the concept. In the 17th century, one's family would pick the person one was going to marry based on social class and economical status. In some cultures, girls are married by the age of 14 or even younger. Love as a word has many different definitions because there are different types of loves. As society advances and modernizes every year, it becomes even more difficult to define. Love has been compared to God because of the power it has over those who believe in it. Love has the ability to be the source of human's happiness, sense of worth, and a source of healing from hurt or suffering. This is a more religious and traditional definition of love. This definition hasn't disappeared, but more definitions joined it as the world began to modernize. In the 18th century, romantic love expressed sensibility and was authentic as it stood for \\"the truth of feeling\\". Even today love is very symbolic in Western culture. It is viewed by many as the reason for living. A symbolic interaction theorists believe that shared meanings, orientations, and assumptions form the basic motives behind people's actions. Love is a universally known term and depending on the culture. Of course, not all countries place an importance on love. Countries such as Africa and India believe in arranged marriages and if love comes from that partnership, it is convenient, but not necessary. Although love can be the motive for some people's actions and bring people joy, love can also bring us sadness. \\"Love does us no good if we love the wrong person.\\" When people open their hearts, show their flaws, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses to the wrong person, it can result in heartbreak in regret. So why do humans deal with such a complicated thing such as love? Humans \\"need to love and to be loved\\". In society, there are four types of love that are visible: agape, phileo, storge, eros. Agape is a type of unconditional love which is less common in society but more apparent between individuals and their god. Phileo is a love used to describe friendship between individuals. This love is commonly seen between friends in public, especially as displays of warm gestures. Storge is another type of love that is expressed through parenting. Eros is a romantic love which was a type of love forbidden in early society and is still forbidden in some societies today. These different types of love are expressed differently based on culture. Love: A cultural perspective  Over the course of history, love has been expressed and shown differently all over the world. Display of love is different based on societal norms. Love can include acts such as kissing, sex, emotional contact and companionship that contributes to happiness in relationships. Different cultures have adopted new customs. For example, in Japan, public displays of affection are discouraged, and people believe in showing their love for their partner in a different way like packing their lunch for work. In France, people show their love by holding hands, kissing and initiating sexual relationships. The United States has a different perspective on love. People believe in going on dates, having casual sex, and are open to meeting new people in social media or dating apps. The customs in the US are generally more liberal than other parts of the world. Marriage traditions are largely cultural as well. Marriage customs Marriage can happen when two people fall in love and decide to share their life together, even though that is not how it always happens. Traditionally in the 19th century the choice of marriage was made by the parents based on political or economical considerations. In India, arranged marriages are still part of their culture. Now elopement, also known as love marriage, has become dominant in some parts of India. Marriage in Japan is more liberal when it comes to picking who they are going to marry. Arranged marriage in Japan would begin with courtship that would allow love to develop and would lead into an arranged marriage. In the US, marriage customs would depend on the person's roots and values. The wedding and marriage depend on what each individual believes is right. Society influences love Society plays a big role in the way we see love based on social differences such as gender, race, economical status, religion, education and ethnicity. In today's society, there are other major factors that influence how love is perceived by individuals. The biggest influence that we see in today modern society is social media and films. Media influences the expectations we have of what love should be. Young adults are the target population that is mainly influenced by an unrealistic idea of love that they see over and over in films. For example, The Notebook projects that love can conquer all, the idealization of one's partner, soul mate/one and only and love at first sight.  Necessity of love  Love allows people to attribute a sense of purpose for living. From the moment of birth relationships are made: mother and child, father and child, grandparent and child, and the like. As people grow older and enter into schools, jobs, and get involved in their communities the number of relationships, they have grown, as does their ability to maintain these relationships. Love can have a powerful effect on the human body. Irving Singer wrote, \\"For a person in love ... life is never without meaning.\\" A person's life is built the love between two people ‚Äì their parents, the love they share for the friendships they make and eventually, the person they marry and have children of their own with. The feelings love brings: happiness, empathy, mutual respect, a sense of purpose, can lead to stronger motivation, less stress, a positive outlook on life, and hope. Love allows humans to communicate through their emotions. To love effectively, one has to love themselves first: to love another person's flaws and quirks, one has to love their own flaws and quirks. Humans are not the only species in the world that can feel love and its effects. Non-human animals can feel love as well, although it is less complex and less creative. Many animals feel emotions. When a dog wags its tail or licks its owner after being parted for a few hours, this is interpreted as happiness. When a person leaves for work in the morning and their dog cries at the window, it exhibits sadness. A growling dog who doesn't like it when someone touches its favorite toy is showing anger. Animals can feel love as well as other basic emotions humans feel. Dogs that grow up with siblings create strong bonds to their sibling. If their sibling dies, the dog can go into depression and refuse to eat.  Types of love  Humans come across different types of love as they reach different levels are maturity in their life, such as the love a mother feels for their child, the love that involves the instant attraction to person, and the love that comes from years of being together. The love humans share for their family and friends can be viewed as \\"slow love\\". This love is based on finding shared interests and lifestyles that connect people to each other in reality. It's a love that can be carried out because of the common interests that bind them together. It is more of a mental attraction than a physical attraction. Visually, we make interpretations on love based on the way a person looks. \\"Harmonism\\" and \\"echoism\\" are the ways a face is constructed that makes one physically attractive: the distance between the forehead and nose, distant between the mouth and chin, how close the eyes are together, the sweep of one's eyebrows.The biochemical level fluctuation of a person can also explain the question ‚ÄúWho We Love‚Äù. People who have expressive traits of dopamine system: curious and energetic tend to be drawn to people who have similar personalities. People have relative high level of serotonin system traits: cautious and social conforming are attracted to their same kind as well. However, people who are foremost with expressive traits of sex hormones tend to be enchanted by their opposite kinds. People with a relative high testosterone hormone are analytical and tough minded. They tend to choose people with relative high estrogen hormone who are empathetic and pro-social. Beside the biochemical level explanation, there are also a few other elements affect people‚Äôs choices of mates. Another factor influences who people choose to love is timing. Love can happen when one least expects. Furthermore, people are more easily to fall in love when they are emotionally aroused, especially in a hard and lonely time. This is because such a mental state is associated with arousal mechanism in brains and elevated level of stress hormone, both of which increase the level romantic passion hormone: dopamine. Distance is another element influences people‚Äôs love choices: people tend to choose to fall in love with those close to them. Childhood experience also influences on mate choices. By the teenage years, people gradually construct a catalog of aptitudes and mannerisms they are looking for in a mate. Subtle differences in their experiences shape romantic tastes. Physical looking matters as well. From an anthropological point of view, a male tend to choose a female with a visual sign of youth and beauty, which indicates her high estrogen level and strong reproductive ability. However, a female with a more pragmatic and realistic goal, tends to choose a male with education, ambition, wealth, respect, status, masculine appearance. Another reason why we love who we love has to do with culture and history. Take incest, for example. In some Western cultures, falling in love with one's first cousin could be seen as possibly 'taboo' and therefore morally and lawfully wrong. However, it is legal to marry one's cousin in many western countries, eg the UK. Similarly, in some Muslim tribes, it is perfectly acceptable to fall in love with one's cousin. In the past, kissing cousins in Western societies were not uncommon. In addition, in the past, mixed-race marriages were illegal the United States. This led to people only marrying people of the same race. However, now that the society of the United States has changed drastically, it is common and completely acceptable to find couples of different races. Another type of love people come across in their life is sexual love. As an individual crosses over from a child to a teen to an adult, this type of love becomes more relevant in their life. According to Milligan, \\"Sexualized intimate love is delusional and requires an overestimation of the person we love.\\" A sexual love is a misconception of the person's beauty, intelligence, or charm. This type of love can reveal a lot about the person who's feeling such strong passionate feelings. It gives more insight into the lover than it gives about the loved. Sexual love isn't love at first sight ‚Äì it is basic human instinct and hormonal responses.  Vertical and Horizontal Structure of Love   Vertical Structure  Philips Shaver and colleagues found that emotions knowledge could be represented hierarchically. By collecting data about males‚Äô and females‚Äô cognition of ‚ÄúLove‚Äù, researchers used a prototype approach to investigate the concept of love. ‚ÄúLove‚Äù is a basic level of concept includes super-ordinate categories of emotions: affection, adoration, fondness, liking, attraction, caring, tenderness, compassion, arousal, desire, passion, and longing. Love contains large sub-clusters that designate generic forms of love: friendship, sibling relationship, martial relationship etc. Such as, ‚Äúaffection‚Äù, similar to ‚Äúcompanionate love‚Äù in social psychology field, is the term most strongly co-occurs with terms in its generic sub-cluster and not with other terms in other sub-cluster groups: ‚ÄúAffection‚Äù for example contrasts significantly with ‚Äúpassionate love‚Äù, which belongs to the second large sub-cluster ‚Äì ‚ÄúLust‚Äù.  Horizontal Structure  Love can also be examined along a horizontal dimension with a prototype approach as well. Psychologists Beverley, Fehr and James Russell designed and conducted six experiments to examine the concept of love horizontally: Free Listing of Subtypes of Love; Rating the Goodness of Love Examples; Reaction Time to Verify Love Category Memberships; the Fuzzy Boarder of Love definition; the Sustainability of the Subcategory of Love; Love Subcategory Family Resemblances. For example, Beverly Fehr and James Russell examined the concept of love by carrying out the fifth experiment, the Sustainability of the Subcategory. They selected 10 sentences that defined ‚ÄúLove‚Äù written by one group of participants and 10 definitions of ‚ÄúLove‚Äù from textbooks. They asked another groups of participants to judge how weird or natural those sentences sounded when the word ‚ÄúLove‚Äù in those definitions was substituted by targeted sub-category terms. When a prototypical sub-type substituted, such as friendship, the sentence sounded subjectively natural. However, when a peripheral sub-type, such as infatuation, took the place of ‚ÄúLove‚Äù in the definitions, it yielded subjectively peculiar results. ‚ÄúIn sum, Fehr identified a set of features of love that appear to have a clear prototype structure in terms of some features being better and some being poorer exemplars of the concept of love, and this difference appears to affect other aspects of the way love-related phenomena are processed.‚Äù Later Arthur Aron and Lori Westbay expanded the underlying structure of love prototype of Fehr‚Äôs research. To understand the way people deal with love-related information, Aron and Westbay examined the latent structure and individual differences within Fehr‚Äôs subgroup structure with three validation tests. They concluded that people generally understand the concept of love centralizing around three dimensions (passion, intimacy and commitment) which correspond to Sternberg‚Äôs triangular theory of love. An individual‚Äôs prototype of love limits his or her experience of a relationship, but the degree of these three dimensions that the individual emphasizes on depends on circumstances of that relationship.  Love in the 21st century  Today, love is still highly valued in the Western society. Love is so viewed so important and special. It is put on such a pedestal that it is almost impossible to fulfill all the expectations that people have for their relationships and marriages. For example, with the rising of \\"promposals\\", which are extravagant ways of asking someone to prom, exhibit the way that the expectations of romance are increasing. Today, sex lives are commonly flaunted rather than hidden as they used to be. Compared to the past, people are more open to sexuality, promiscuity, and divorce. As the world continues to change the views on love, its significance will continue to modify as the minds of people change.

History  The Jirama was established on 17 October 1975 when the Soci√©t√© Malagasy des Eaux et Electricit√© and the Soci√©t√© des Energies de Madagascar merged. Up until 1999, it was the only state-owned electricity company of the country. After 1999, the Jirama maintained its monopoly on transportation and distribution networks. In 2007, when Antananrivo's Mayor Andry Rajoelina took office, the city's treasury had a debt of 8.2 billion Malagasy Ariary (approximately 4.6 million U.S. dollars). On 4 January 2008, because of unpaid debts to the Jirama, the city of Antananarivo was hit by a general water cutoff and brownouts of the city's street lights. After an audit, it was found that the Jirama owed about the same amount of money to the city, and the sanction on the city's population was relieved. In 2008, thanks to the launch of a new thermal power plant in Mandroseza, the Jirama was able to service 2,000 additional consumers in Antananarivo. In June 2009, D√©sir√© Rasidy was named new CEO of the Jirama. In 2012, thanks to the financing of the French Development Agency, the Jirama launched the fuel oil power plant constructed by British Broad Crown that aimed at ending power shortages for good in Mahajanga. According to an IMF report published in March 2018, the Jirama's financial difficulties are a major burden for the Malagasy economy. In June 2018, the Jirama was considering a rehabilitation of its electricity distribution network.  Activities  Headquartered in Antananarivo, the Jirama serves 340,000 clients for electricity in 114 localities and 65 water distribution centres. The Jirama is 100% owned by the government of Madagascar.

The film, which stars Michael Douglas, Diane Keaton and Sterling Jerins, was released on July 25, 2014. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, but performed well at the box office, recouping its $18 million production budget.  Plot  Oren Little (Douglas), a realtor by trade, develops self-absorption, turning his back on his neighbors and shunning the notion of kindness to others, after his wife dies; part of his self-absorption is having no patience for children, not even his own now-adult son, from whom he has been estranged. He has a next-door neighbor, Leah (Keaton), whose own husband has likewise died, never having had any children of her own, which leads her to throw her soul and her tears into reviving a singing career that had stagnated. Then, one day, Oren's estranged son suddenly leaves his father in charge of his own nine-year-old daughter Sarah (Sterling Jerins), a granddaughter whom Oren never knew existed. When Oren's estranged son drops Sarah off at his home, needing his father to take care of her, neither Oren nor Leah, each of whom are lonely souls, have any reason to suspect that Sarah's involvement with their lives would enable them to heal their emotional wounds.

Release  The first trailer for the film was released on May 9, 2014. Released on July 25, 2014, the film earned $4,642,329 in its opening weekend. Over its 10-week run, And So It Goes earned a domestic gross of $15,160,801 and foreign gross of $10,151,586, for a total box-office of $25,312,387, against a production budget of $18,000,000.  Reception  And So It Goes received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 18% based on 88 reviews with the consensus: \\"And So It Goes aims for comedy, but with two talented actors stuck in a half-hearted effort from a once-mighty filmmaker, it ends in unintentional tragedy\\". On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 38 out 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a positive review, saying the film \\"offers juicy leading roles to stars Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton.\\" Christy Lemire of Roger Ebert.com also commended the caliber of Douglas' and Keaton's performances, but gave the film 1.5 stars for its storyline, saying: \\"Nothing here is a spoiler. The outcome is evident from the poster alone\\". A Washington Post review credits \\"the film's most alive moments\\" to Keaton, who channels her Annie Hall character in both her wardrobe and her singing jazz ballads in a local pub. While The Guardian review is happy to see \\"retirement-age characters\\" being featured in a film, it criticizes the \\"banal\\" plot, saying: \\"the story structure is so fake and so plodding\\". Film critic Richard Corliss also gave the film a negative review, saying: \\"And So It Goes may touch the frayed heartstrings of some older viewers, but it's pretty bad ‚Äî the failed attempt to Heimlich a venerable movie genre.\\"  References   External links  * * * Category:2014 films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Rob Reiner Category:2014 romantic comedy-drama films Category:American romantic comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Connecticut Category:Films shot in England Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films Category:Films scored by Marc Shaiman Category:Films about old age Category:2014 comedy films Category:2014 drama films ","title":"And So It Goes (film)"},{"id":"39382787","text":"Fort Lotfi is a village and military base in the commune of Oum El Assel, in Tindouf Province, Algeria.

For his performance in this film Adriano Celentano was awarded with a David di Donatello for Best Actor. Plot In southern France during the Roaring Twenties, Philip Bang, a notorious master con man serving his time in prison, is relocated to a high security facility for hard labor after causing an uproar at supper. This, however, is actually part of a plan to spring him from prison, arranged with the aid of his former wife and partner, Belle Duke (proprietor of a casino yacht and herself a con woman), and his daughter, Charlotte. But on his way to a transit prison facility, as Bang prepares to vacate the train via a wagon restroom, he suddenly finds himself the unwilling escape aide of another con man, young Italian \\"Felix\\", who leaves Bang in the soup. But before Felix can enjoy his new-found freedom, he is picked up by Belle Duke's men, who mistake him for Bang. Once his true identity is found out, Belle Duke is less than delighted at his presence and demands of him to free Bang. When Felix manages to escape her thugs, Belle Duke uses Charlotte to set him up, leaving him no alternative than to agree to her request. Using his own experiences with the transit facility, a purloined priest's cassock and a cuckoo clock bomb, Felix breaks Bang out, but Bang proves reluctant to return to Belle Duke, since he had fleeced her of her wealth before going to prison, and for that reason Belle is likely wanting to see the return of her money and revenge exacted on him. After testing Felix's talents and attitude, they become partners, joined by Charlotte, who has fallen in love with Felix. In order to fool Belle Duke once again, Bang decides to use the money he and Felix have appropriated to buy a worthless piece of swampland, arranging a fake archeological sensation (using real museum exhibits and Bang's old gang) and an alleged black market scheme to convince Belle Duke to purchase it at an astronomical price. The plan works out splendidly, but Felix decides to raise the stakes of the game by claiming that he has kidnapped Charlotte, using Bang's sincere distress to fully convince Belle Duke of the \\"veracity\\" of their con scheme. Felix makes a run from Belle's men with the money, but supposedly dies when his escape boat crashes into a boathouse and explodes. Shortly afterwards, the police, called upon the scene by Felix as part of his plan, arrives, supposedly arresting a dismayed Bang. But once again a double bluff is played as the police squad turns out to be Bang's con gang, and an unexpected motorcycle escort to be Felix in command of a few shop-window mannequins. After convincing Bang with some effort that his kidnapping sham was actually meant to throw off their opposition, Felix, Bang and Charlotte narrowly escape Belle Duke, who has since discovered the deception, via single-engine airplane. And as a final point, Felix cannot resist one last bluff when he accidentally spills the fleeced 100 million Francs out of the plane's open door, only to reel them back in, with each bill meticulously tied to a long line ...

She is a Distinguished University Professor at The Ohio State University (OSU) and Director of the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center at OSU. She is known as a pioneer in the use of ice cores from the Polar Regions for paleoclimatic research and is an influential figure in climate science. She is an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union and an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences.  Early life and education  Mosley-Thompson was raised in West Virginia. She received a BS in Physics from Marshall University, where she was the only female student in the physics department. She went on to receive both her master's degree and her PhD in geography from The Ohio State University, where she focused on climatology and atmospheric science. For her PhD, she interpreted the physical and chemical characteristics of a 100-meter-long ice core drilled at the South Pole in 1974; she compared the results to other cores drilled across the continent, which showed patterns in atmospheric conditions and temperature across Antarctica. With this early research, she demonstrated the importance of extracting high temporally resolved records for paleoclimate studies and, along with her husband and research partner, Lonnie Thompson, she pioneered the study of dust (particulate matter) in polar ice cores as a way to examine Earth's climate history. In 1990, Mosley-Thompson joined the faculty of The Ohio State University. She became the Director of OSU's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center in 2009.  Career and impact  Mosley-Thompson is a specialist in paleoclimatology, abrupt climate changes, glacier retreat, Holocene climate variability, and contemporary climate change. Her research focuses on reconstructing climate indicators such as temperature, precipitation and atmospheric composition from the analysis of the physical and chemical properties preserved in ice cores from both Polar Regions as well as from many of Earth's highest mountain glaciers and ice caps in the lower-latitudes. The various chemical constituents are either deposited directly on the glacier surface or within the snow that falls and are eventually compacted into ice where they may be preserved over many millennia. These records provide unique information about the climate and environmental conditions prevailing when the snow was formed. Because the ice contained in some of these cores extend back hundreds of millennia, Mosley-Thompson, Thompson and their team are able to reconstruct parts of Earth's complex climate history. This research also contributes to the understanding of the impact of volcanic emissions on Earth's climate, as well as the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Mosley-Thompson's research provides evidence for past, abrupt climatic and environmental changes, and contributes to an understanding of possible climate futures and possible effects of climate change on human civilization. Mosley-Thompson has led nine expeditions to Antarctica and six to Greenland to conduct this research. Her most recent expedition was the 6-person ice core drilling project on the Antarctic Peninsula's Bruce Plateau, for which she was field leader and Principal Investigator. This project was part of the larger National Science Foundation sponsored LARsen Ice Shelf System Antarctica (LARISSA) Project, a multidisciplinary, international effort to study the collapse of the Larsen A & B ice shelves and to contextualize their collapse within the history of climate change. Mosley-Thompson has published over 137 peer-reviewed journal articles, and she has been the recipient of over 53 research grants. In 2010, The Guardian described Mosley-Thompson and her husband Lonnie Thompson two of the ‚Äúworld's most respected climatologists and glaciologists.‚Äù The Franklin Institute describes the team as being ‚Äúwidely recognized as the world's preeminent experts in ice core sampling.‚Äù In addition to her research, Mosley- Thompson has served as president of AGU‚Äôs Atmospheric Sciences and Global Environmental Change Sections; chair of the AGU‚Äôs Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology and GEC Sections‚Äô Fellows Committees; chair of the Geology and Geography section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; and as a member of the National Academy of Sciences‚Äô U.S. National Committee for Quaternary Research and the Polar Research Board. She also works to increase the public's understanding of climate change and advocates for grassroots action on climate change.  Awards and honors  Mosley-Thompson is an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Geophysical Union. She also is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. She has received a number of awards, including the Benjamin Franklin Prize (2012), the Dan David Prize (2008), the Distinguished Explorer Award of the Roy Chapman Andrews Society (2007), and the Common Wealth Award for Science and Innovation (2002). In 2003, she was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame. The Mosley-Thompson Cirques (Antarctica) located at 78¬∫01¬¥S; 161¬∫28¬¥E were named after her.

It can be used to propagate uncertainties in the situation where errors are represented by intervals. Interval propagation considers an estimation problem as a constraint satisfaction problem.  Atomic contractors  A contractor associated to an equation involving the variables x1,...,xn is an operator which contracts the intervals [x1],..., [xn] (that are supposed to enclose the xi's) without removing any value for the variables that is consistent with the equation. A contractor is said to be atomic if it is not built as a composition of other contractors. The main theory that is used to build atomic contractors are based on interval analysis. Example. Consider for instance the equation : x_1+x_2 =x_3, which involves the three variables x1,x2 and x3. The associated contractor is given by the following statements : [x_3]:=[x_3] \\\\cap ([x_1]+[x_2]) : [x_1]:=[x_1] \\\\cap ( [x_3]-[x_2]) : [x_2]:=[x_2] \\\\cap ( [x_3]-[x_1]) For instance, if : x_1 \\\\in [-\\\\infty ,5], : x_2 \\\\in [-\\\\infty ,4], : x_3 \\\\in [ 6,\\\\infty] the contractor performs the following calculus : x_3=x_1+x_2 \\\\Rightarrow x_3 \\\\in [6,\\\\infty ] \\\\cap ([-\\\\infty,5]+[-\\\\infty ,4]) =[6,\\\\infty ] \\\\cap [-\\\\infty ,9]=[6,9]. : x_1=x_3-x_2 \\\\Rightarrow x_1 \\\\in [-\\\\infty ,5]\\\\cap ([6,\\\\infty]-[-\\\\infty ,4]) =[-\\\\infty ,5] \\\\cap [2,\\\\infty ]=[2,5]. : x_2=x_3-x_1 \\\\Rightarrow x_2 \\\\in [-\\\\infty ,4]\\\\cap ([6,\\\\infty]-[-\\\\infty ,5]) = [-\\\\infty ,4] \\\\cap [1,\\\\infty ]=[1,4]. Figure 1: boxes before contraction Figure 2: boxes after contraction For other constraints, a specific algorithm for implementing the atomic contractor should be written. An illustration is the atomic contractor associated to the equation : x_2=\\\\sin(x_1), is provided by Figures 1 and 2.  Decomposition  For more complex constraints, a decomposition into atomic constraints (i.e., constraints for which an atomic contractor exists) should be performed. Consider for instance the constraint : x+\\\\sin (xy) \\\\leq 0, could be decomposed into : a=xy : b=\\\\sin (a) : c=x+b. The interval domains that should be associated to the new intermediate variables are : a \\\\in [-\\\\infty ,\\\\infty ] , : b \\\\in [-1 ,1 ] , : c \\\\in [-\\\\infty ,0].  Propagation  The principle of the interval propagation is to call all available atomic contractors until no more contraction could be observed. As a result of the Knaster-Tarski theorem, the procedure always converges to intervals which enclose all feasible values for the variables. A formalization of the interval propagation can be made thanks to the contractor algebra. Interval propagation converges quickly to the result and can deal with problems involving several hundred of variables.  Example  Consider the electronic circuit of Figure 3. Figure 3: File:Electronic circuit to illustrate the interval propagation Assume that from different measurements, we know that : E \\\\in [23V,26V] : I\\\\in [4A,8A] : U_1 \\\\in [10V,11V] : U_2 \\\\in [14V,17V] : P \\\\in [124W,130W] : R_{1} \\\\in [0 \\\\Omega,\\\\infty ] : R_{2} \\\\in [0 \\\\Omega,\\\\infty ]. From the circuit, we have the following equations : P=EI : U_{1}=R_{1}I : U_{2}=R_{2}I : E=U_{1}+U_{2}. After performing the interval propagation, we get : E \\\\in [24V,26V] : I \\\\in [4.769A,5.417A] : U_1 \\\\in [10V,11V] : U_2 \\\\in [14V,16V] : P \\\\in [124W,130W] : R_{1} \\\\in [1.846 \\\\Omega,2.307 \\\\Omega] : R_{2}\\\\in [2.584 \\\\Omega,3.355 \\\\Omega].

Toorawa (born 1963) is a Professor of Arabic Literature at Yale University. He has published extensively on classical, medieval and modern Arabic Literature, and has also published translations from Arabic. He identifies himself as a multicultural Muslim having lived in England, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mauritius and the US. He is a faculty member in the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department at Yale University.  Biography  Toorawa was born in London, England to Mauritian parents of Indian origin. Both parents were Muslim, one Shia and one Sunni, and were married in 1962. The family moved three years later, in 1965, to Paris, France where his father was transferred. He first became aware of being Muslim in 1966 through his Senegalese tutor, Abdullah Diop, who came to their apartment daily to teach him the Arabic Script and stories about the prophets. A year later, at the age of five he began attending the English School of Paris. It was here that he learnt about Moses, Jesus and Muhammad and began constructing his understanding of interfaith differences. His parents told him the ‚Äúdifferent people believed different things‚Äù and that as Muslims they ‚Äúdid not believe that Jesus had been killed or that he had died on the cross, but that Christians did, and that was OK.‚ÄùShawkat Toorawa, ‚Äò‚ÄôMeditations of a Multicultural Muslim‚Äô‚Äô He performed the Hajj with his family before they moved to Osaka, Japan and then Hong Kong in 1972. A year later the family moved to Singapore where he attended an international school. Though the population of Singapore is 15% Muslim, in the school for expatriates he was one of a small number of Muslims.CIA Factbook - Singapore He credits this system with cultivating his love of all faiths and their traditions. He read The Lord‚Äôs Prayer at assembly and still sings Christmas carols. In 1981 he left Singapore to pursue a Bachelor‚Äôs degree with honors in Oriental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated magna cum laude in 1985.VIVO Cornell He continued to pursue his education at the University of Pennsylvania for the next four years and graduated with a Master of Arts in Oriental Studies (Arabic and Islamic Studies) in 1989. He returned to the university in 1998 to pursue a Ph.D. in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (Islamic Near East) with distinction. He taught at Duke University from 1989 to 1991, and at the University of Mauritius from 1996 to 2000. He taught at Cornell University from 2000 to 2016. He has written about Classic and Medieval Arabic Literature, Modern Arabic poetry, the Quran, Islam and the Indian Ocean. His research focuses mainly on the Middle East and South Asia. He is a former Mellon Foundation New Directions Fellow. He is Co-Executive Editor of the Library of Arabic Literature, an initiative to translate classical and premodern Arabic Literature, for which he is preparing a critical edition of the Shifa' al-‚Äòalil by the eighteenth-century belletrist Azad Bilgrami. He is also a Director of the School of Abbasid Studies.  The Dr. T Project  The Dr.T Project was an idea that first occurred to Toorawa in 2010 while trying to teach students in his classes by connecting subject material to pop culture. When he found that most students didn‚Äôt understand the references he teased his class by saying he should teach a class called ‚ÄúEverything Professor Toorawa Thinks You Should Know but You Don‚Äôt.‚Äù Students began emailing him asking if such a class did exist and on August 24, 2010 Carol Grumbach, director of the Carol Tatkon Center at Cornell University offered to run such a program at the center. \\"Something like 50 or 60 people showed up,\\" Toorawa said. \\"And we thought, 'This might work.'‚Äù Since then the Dr.T Project has been in session once a week during academic semesters (tea and shortbread are served as an additional lure).The Chronicle of Higher EducationCornell Chronicle It moved to Willard Straight Hall in 2013 where with the assistance of the Browsing Library Director, Brandon Pierotti, the program garnered much continued success.

It is located off the northern coast of the Hoamoal Peninsula at the western end of Seram Island, across the Boano Strait. The inhabitants speak the Boano language, Luhu, as well as Indonesian and Ambonese Malay. Pua Island, highest point 403 m, is located close off Boano's northwestern tip.Pub164, 2004 Sailing Directions (Enroute): New Guinea Geography Boano is mostly flat in the east and north, rising to hills in the west and south. The highest point on Buano is Gunung Tahun in the west of the island, with an altitude of . In the northwest, is the long and narrow Pua Island, separated from Boano by the narrow Valentine Strait, which is interspersed with coral reefs in many places. Boano has a tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Af). The island is divided into two villages, whose border is disputed. In 2018, the population in South Buano was 1,829 while in North Buano (including Pulau Pua) was 8,302 inhabitants. The main access to the island is by sea. History Boano is mentioned by Dutch naturalist and author Fran√ßois Valentijn, in his book Beschryvinge van Amboina in 1724 as Bunoa, Boan, Boano, and Bonnoa, along with a listing of the names of various villages and their leaders. At that time, he estimated to have been inhabited by 1,200 people most of whom were subsistence farmers. Valentijn also mentioned the peace talks between Herman van Speult of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and a local ruler named Sengadji in 1619. The Hoamoal Peninsula region in western Seram was a center of the spice trade since before the 17th century's and Buano Island had the advantage of being a safe harbor during the west monsoon season. In the 17th century, Buano Island and the Hoamoal Peninsula were subject to the Sultanate of Ternate. Islam also spread in this area at that time. Today, Islam tends to dominate the northern part of Buano while Protestant Christianity is concentrated in the south. When the VOC consolidated its monopoly on the spice trade in Maluku, there were several rebellions, including the Hoamoal War which also involved Buano in 1639. The VOC succeeded in winning the war and in 1656, and subsequently carried out forced displacement of residents to various regions in western Seram in an effort to quell further rebellion. Many inhabitants of Buano were forcibly relocated to Manipa Island. In 1675, Ternate made a treaty with the VOC, withdrewing its claims against the Ambon and surrounding areas including Buano. Until 1917, Boano was listed as an area of the West Seram Onderafdeling, Afdeling Seram, Governorate of Ambon. The island did not receive significant attention in the later stage of Dutch colonization. After the capture of the Netherlands East Indies by Japan during World War II in 1942, Boano, together with the rest of the Moluccas, was assigned to the zone of occupation of the Japanese 2nd Fleet. The occupation formally ended in August 1945; however, the newly-proclaimed Republic of Indonesia was unable to establish its power in such a remote region, and in early 1946 the Netherlands regained control of Boano without resistance. A few months later, Boano, along with all the Moluccas, Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands, was included in the quasi-independent State of East Indonesia. In December 1949. The decision to incorporate East Indonesia into the Republic of Indonesia in April 1950 was opposed by many inhabitants, leading to the proclamation of the Republic of South Moluccas, which included Boano. The succession was crushed by the Indonesian military by the end of 1950 and Boano was proclaimed part of the Republic of Indonesia. In 1983, sectarian rioting broke out when several North Buano residents attacked South Buano. Several people were killed and a number of buildings in South Buano were burned. In 1999 during the Maluku sectarian conflict, further violence erupted.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 15, 2011 creek in San Jose, California, which becomes the Guadalupe River when it exits Lake Almaden and joins Guadalupe Creek. Los Alamitos Creek is located in Almaden Valley and originates from the Los Capitancillos Ridge and the Santa Cruz Mountains. This creek flows through the Valley's Guadalupe Watershed, which is owned by the Santa Clara Valley Water District. The creek flows in a generally northwesterly direction after rounding the Los Capitancillos Ridge and the town of New Almaden, in the southwest corner, before ambling along the Santa Teresa Hills on northeast side of the Almaden Valley. Its environment has some relatively undisturbed areas and considerable lengths of suburban residential character. Originally called Arroyo de los Alamitos, the creek's name is derived from \\"little poplar\\", \\"alamo\\" being the Spanish word for \\"poplar\\" or \\"cottonwood\\". History The Alamitos Creek banks were inhabited by Native American tribes thousands of years ago and up until the time of Spanish exploration. Evidence of middens and traces of that hunter-gatherer civilisation has been recorded from archeological excavations and surface finds. From the mid-19th century until the 1970s, operation of the New Almaden Quicksilver Mines discharged high levels of mercury into the creek near its headwaters and the remaining piles of exposed mine tailings still contaminate the creek beyond natural levels. Warning signs to not eat fish caught in the Alamitos Creek still run the length of its course. In the 1940s and 1950s, rapid residential development expanded into this portion of the Almaden Valley including building which encroached into the 100-year floodplain. The Santa Clara Valley Water District began studying this watershed with emphasis upon flood control functions, and made some minor streambed alterations such as energy dissipators. In 1976 the District developed a comprehensive flood control plan and retained Earth Metrics Inc. to prepare an independent Environmental Impact Report.Environmental Impact Report for the Alamitos and Calero Creek flood Control Plan, Earth Metrics Inc., California State Clearinghouse (1976) The resulting study developed the first comprehensive data base of biology, water quality, geology and cultural resources information for Alamitos Creek. In 1989 the city of San Jose undertook an analysis to create a creekside trail from Almaden Quicksilver County Park to a location along Alamitos Creek about .6 mile below the confluence with Arroyo Calero.Feasibility study for providing a trail between Almaden Quicksilver Park and the Almaden Park via the Alamitos Creek, San Jose Parks and Recreation Dept., March, 1989 Watershed Alamitos Creek drains an area of approximately , and begins at the base of Almaden Reservoir, although the reservoir is fed by Herbert Creek whose source is just south of the peak of Mount Umunhum. In addition to Herbert Creek, the reservoir has several minor tributaries including Barrett Creek, Jacques Gulch, and Larrabee Creek. Barrett Creek begins in Barrett Canyon draining the north slope of Loma Prieta, the tallest peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and joins Herbert Creek from the south just before joining Almaden Reservoir. Barrett Creek gained significant protection in 2018 when the Peninsula Open Space Trust, the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority and the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District purchased 500 acres of land to preserve as open space. ‚ÄúRainbow trout in Barrett Creek were [once] so plentiful that fishermen used to catch them by the hundreds,‚Äù said Vice President Marti Tedesco of the Peninsula Open Space Trust. The major tributary to Alamitos Creek is Arroyo Calero which is also dammed to form Calero Reservoir. Alamitos Creek feeds into Lake Almaden (not to be confused with Almaden Reservoir). Lake Almaden was formed by a private gravel quarry operation which changed a meadow once grazed by dairy cows into the lake. Mercury and Canada goose excrement pollute the lake so that it remains closed to the public. Lake Almaden is a great impediment to native steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) migration, as it is home to many non- native predatory fish, such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). It also serves as a heat sink elevating river water temperatures downstream and creating a large warm lake area difficult for trout to migrate through. Santa Clara Valley Water District is in the process of separating the creek from the lake to address these problems, expecting to be done in 2022. After it exits the lake, Alamitos Creek is joined by Guadalupe Creek. This confluence is the origin of the Guadalupe River mainstem, just west of Almaden Expressway and north of Coleman Road. Ecology Alamitos Creek once supported runs of steelhead. In July and August 1997, the Santa Clara Valley Water District electrofished sites near Alamitos Creek's confluence with Golf Creek near the McKean Road crossing. In the downstream rocky streambed reaches of the creek there are a variety of birds commonly observed including mallard, black phoebe, common merganser, red-shouldered hawk, snowy egret, belted kingfisher, great blue heron and black-crowned night-heron. There are a few mammals on the lower reaches such as raccoon. Vegetation includes upland tree species such as coast live oak and California bay laurel; understory growth such as coyote brush, toyon and poison oak; and riparian vegetation such as red willow and wild blackberry. In the extreme downstream reaches rufous-crowned sparrow, California thrasher and American kestrel can be observed on chaparral slopes. In the oak woodlands along the creek, acorn woodpecker, California quail, Anna's hummingbird, scrub jay, oak titmouse, bushtit, Bewick's wren, and spotted towhee can be found. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a \\"Do Not Eat\\" for any fish caught in Alamitos Creek due to elevated mercury. Los Alamitos Creek Trail The Los Alamitos Creek Trail or Alamitos Creek Trail is a paved, pedestrian and bicycle trail that runs along Alamitos Creek, from Harry Road (south) to Lake Almaden Park (north). As the trail crosses beneath the Coleman Road bridge, it meets the confluence of Guadalupe Creek and becomes the Guadalupe River Trail. A paved trail system which continues along the Guadalupe River extending northward to Chynoweth Avenue. As an alternative to walking under a narrow crawl corridor below the Almaden Expressway bridge, hikers can continue by using sidewalks and the signalized intersection of Coleman Road/Almaden Expressway, trail users can follow the Guadalulpe Creek Trail westward to Meridian Avenue (unpaved, interim gravel surface).

Taken from Ibn Hazm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker. Eds. Camilla Adang, Maribel Fierro and Sabine Schmidtke. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. The suppression of the revolt both practically and ideologically has been described as a sign of the Mamluk authorities' intolerance for non-conformist ideas and willingness to interfere in religious issues normally considered the domain of theologians in Muslim empires.Lutz Wiederhold, Legal-religious elite, temporal authority, and the caliphate in Mamluk society: conclusions drawn from the examination of a \\"Zahiri revolt\\" in Damascus in 1386.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. Background In December 1382, Muslim jurist Ibn Abi al-Izz of the Hanafite school came under investigation for his theological criticism of a poem which would eventually be discredited, though not before the jurist's short inquisition.Ibn Qadi Shuhbah, al-I'lam bi Tarikh al-Islam, pg. 89. On December 27 that year, an affidavit was signed by the Sultan Barquq condemning the jurist as well as calling for an investigation of rumors regarding other jurists promoting the Zahirite school of Sunni Muslim law in Damascus. The four jurists rumored to be promoting non-conformist views were simply nicknamed al-Qurashi, Ibn al- Jabi, Ibn al-Husbani and Sadr ad-Din al-Yasufi. Four years later, a Syrian Hanbalite known as Khalid of Homs, who was actually from Aleppo, moved to Damascus under the tutelage of the Sufi ascetic Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isma'il ibn Abd al-Rahim Shihab ad-Din Abu Hashim al-Zahiri, also known as al-Burhan. During this time, a number of Egyptians who had been influenced by Zahirite theology emigrated to Syria. Burhan engaged in study of Ibn Hazm's book Al- Muhalla alongside Yasufi, with Ibn al-Jabi and Ibn al-Husbani following the other two.Carl Brockelmann, Geschichte der Arabschen Litteratur. Zweite den Supplementbanden ange-passte Auflage. Vol. 1, pg. 400. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1937‚Äì1949. Qurashi, on the other hand, associated with the above four only for the purpose of studyin but disliked Burhan personally. Discovery In August 1386, Khalid of Homs visited a local bedouin chief imprisoned in the Citadel of Damascus to seek support for the overthrow of the sultan and the installation of a caliphate, Barquq himself having overthrown the caliph al-Mutawakkil Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in order to come to power. The chief suggested that Khalid speak with Ibn al-Himsi, the Citadel's top official with no relation to Khalid despite the similar-sounding name, as he would likely support the overthrow.Shuhbah, pg. 304. Khalid informed the Citadel's commanding officer of the plot, claiming not only to have the backing of local bedouin tribes and urban Damascenes but also to have located a suitable candidate for a new caliph. The officer gave the impression that he supported the plot and asked to meet this new caliph, upon which Khalid revealed him to be Burhan and even gave the officer the exact address of Burhan's house.Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, al-Durar al-Kamina, vol. 1, pg. 514. The officer sent a request for Burhan's presence; upon his arrival, both he and Khalid were immediately arrested. Aftermath In the absence of both the Citadel and Syria's governor Baydamur on leave, Ibn al-Himsi took up the acting role of governor. He wrote to Barquq in Cairo, adding in details of his own to the story.Shuhbah, pgs. 186-176. Ibn al-Himsi not only informed the sultan of the capture of two ringleaders but also accused the governor of being a co-conspirator, leading to the arrest of the governor, his son Muhammad Shah, his nephew Aladdin al-Khazindar and two deputies in Ramadan that same year, corresponding September 1386.Al-Maqrizi, Al Selouk Leme'refatt Dewall al-Melouk, vol. 3, part 2, pg. 549. In the weeks following the arrest of Burhan and Khalid, the focus shifted into a witch hunt for anyone connected to Baydamur, resulting in both political and financial sanctions.Ibn Hajr, Ibna al-Ghumr, vol. 2, pgs. 343‚Äì345.Al-Sakhawi, Al-Daw' al-lami\` li ahli al- Qarni al-Tasi, vol. 7, pg. 168. Stemming from Burhan's confession, Yasufi was arrested and Ibn al-Husbani went into hiding. A second Hanbalite jurist, Amin ad-Din Ibn al-Najib of Baalbek, was also arrested as a co-conspirator; while he was not directly involved in the conspiracy, he had openly opposed the sultan in the past. In November 1386, Burhan and Khalid were transported to Cairo in order for sultan Barquq to meet them face to face. In their absence, a number of other local officials and clerics were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the conspiracy. Eventually, the prisoners filed a petition requesting to either be released or killed; they were instead shackled and given sentences of manual labor on public construction projects. This set off a chain reaction; local Damascenes, taking pity on the fallen politicians and clerics, began demonstrating at the construction sites in opposition to both the forced manual labor and the Burji administration in general.Shuhbah, pg. 191. The military, fearing a spread of the revolt among the lower classes, immediately canceled the labor sentences and returned the prisoners to the Citadel.Wiederhold, pg. 211. Opposition to the ruling dynasty increased when a local cleric, Yusuf al-Zuayfarini, began riding around the Citadel on a horse, claiming he would free Baydamur, popular with the common people of Damascus as both a religious cleric in his own right and for refusing to collect taxes levied by the Mamluks which had no origin in Islamic law.Wiederhold, pg. 215. Zuayfarini's arrest was ordered as well, though like Ibn al-Husbani, he was able to avoid the Burji law enforcement.Shuhbah, pg. 227. On 24 December 1386, Burhan, Khalid and Ibn al-Najib arrived in Cairo. Charges were filed of a conspiracy to overthrow the Burji government and install a caliphate with a leader of Qurashi origins.Maqrizi, vol. 3, part 2, pg. 555. On 16 January 1387, they were brought before the sultan personally for both interrogation and trial. Burhan was defiant, verbally accusing Barquq of misrule by appropriating taxes which had no textual basis in Islamic law and asserting his demand for a Qurashi leader. Uninterested in a polemical debate, Barquq simply ordered the prisoners to be tortured until they revealed the names of all their co-conspirators. The fallen governor Baydamur's name was cleared, but not before he died alone in his cell at the Citadel in February 1387. In March 1389, Burhan and Khalid were released in Cairo having only served two years and seven months, due to the intercession of an influential Shafi'ite jurist; Ibn al-Najib, who had been sent back to Damascus, was released along with the other Zahirites in the Citadel a few days later.Shuhbah, pgs. 268‚Äì269. The only exception aside from Baydamur was Yasufi, who died in the Citadel in August 1387, more than a year before his comrades would be paroled.Shuhba, pgs. 228‚Äì229. Legacy While the revolt gained early momentum from Zahirite ideas, it is today viewed more in terms of the political agitation against the Mamluks and general displeasure with the marginalization of the caliphate.Wiederhold, pg. 224. Historian Al-Maqrizi, normally removed from the topics of his writings, not only reported the revolt but sought to justify it theologically, likely due to his own status as a Zahirite.Rabbat, pg. 14. Maqrizi was also a direct student of Burhan in theology.Al-Maqrizi, Tajrid al-Tawhid al-Mufid, pg. 33 of the introduction of Sabri bin Salamah Shahin. Riyadh: Dar al-Qubs, 2005.

Currently the price of fossil fuels companies' shares is calculated under the assumption that all fossil fuel reserves will be consumed. An estimate made by Kepler Chevreux puts the loss in value of the fossil fuel companies due to the impact of the growing renewables industry at US$28 trillion over the next two decades-long. A more recent analysis made by Citi puts that figure at $100 trillion. Citigroup sees $100 trillion of stranded assets if Paris succeeds, RenewEconomy, 25 August 2015 Analysts in both the petroleum and financial industries are concluding that the \\"age of oil\\" has already reached a new stage where the excess supply that appeared in late 2014 may continue to prevail in the future. A consensus appears to be emerging that an international agreement will be reached to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2 ¬∞C that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels. According to the UK's Committee on Climate Change, overvaluing companies that produce fossil fuels and greenhouse gases poses a serious threat to the economy. The committee warned the British government and Bank of England of the risks of the carbon bubble in 2014. The following year, Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in his lecture to Lloyd's of London, warned that limiting global warming to 2 ¬∞C appears to require that the \\"vast majority\\" of fossil fuel reserves be \\"stranded assets\\", or \\"literally unburnable without expensive carbon-capture technology\\", resulting in \\"potentially huge\\" exposure to investors in that sector. He concluded that \\"the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking\\" for responding to the threat that climate change poses to financial resilience and longer-term prosperity, which he called the \\"tragedy of the horizon\\". That same month, the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England issued a report discussing the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to the insurance industry. In his speech announcing his denial of the proposal to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline, United States President Barack Obama gave as one reason for the decision \\"... ultimately, if we're going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground...\\". Etymology The term \\"carbon bubble\\" arose in the early 21st century from the increasing awareness of the impact of fossil fuel combustion on global temperatures. The term was coined by the Carbon Tracker Initiative which published key reports in July 2011 and April 2013.Unburnable Carbon ‚Äì Are the world's financial markets carrying a carbon bubble? Unburnable carbon 2013: Wasted capital and stranded assets and it was further popularised in the New Scientist magazine in October 2011. A widely shared article by Bill McKibben was published in Rolling Stone magazine in July 2012, bringing the idea to the attention of a popular audience. These were followed later in 2013 by a report from the Demos think tank.  Value  Author Bill McKibben has estimated that to sustain human life in the world, up to $20 trillion worth of fossil fuel reserves will need to remain in the ground. The Stern report in 2006 stated that the benefits of strong, early action to decrease the use of oil, coal and gas considerably outweigh the costs. Fossil fuel contributors, the building industry, and land use practices ignore the responsibility of the external costs and ignore the polluter pays principle according to which climate change costs will be paid by historical climate polluters.  Prospects for orderly bubble deflation  A planned and orderly transition away from dependence on fossil fuels could prevent a disruptive \\"bursting of the carbon bubble\\". A number of developments are supporting such a transition. *Government action on climate change :A detailed academic study of the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 that a third of global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of no more than a 2 ¬∞C rise in average global temperature. Hence continued exploration or development of reserves would be extraneous to needs. To meet the 2 ¬∞C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market. The impact on producers would vary widely depending on the cost of production in their areas of operation. For example, the impact in Canada would be far larger than in the United States. Open-pit mining of bituminous sands in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production. :In mid-2015, the Centre for Science and Policy, University of Cambridge published a report assessing the risks from climate change in order to estimate the amount of resources that should be allocated to address them. The report notes that \\"standard economic estimates of the global costs of climate change are wildly sensitive both to assumptions about the science, and to judgments about the value of human life. They are also likely to be systematically biased towards underestimation of risk, as they tend to omit a wide range of impacts that are difficult to quantify\\". *Awareness in the financial industry :By 2013, there was significant awareness in the financial industry of the risks associated with exposure to companies involved in extraction of fossil fuels. In early 2014, the FTSE Group, BlackRock and the Natural Resources Defense Council collaborated in the creation of a stock market index series that excludes companies linked to exploration, ownership or extraction of carbon-based fossil fuel reserves. These indices are intended to make it easier for investors to steer their investments away from such companies. It has been proposed that companies be required by law to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and assess the risk this could pose to their future financial performance. According to Christiana Figueres, UNFCCC, companies have a duty to shareholders to move to a low-carbon economy, because of the effects of the carbon bubble.

As of 2014 new wind power is cheaper than new coal and gas power in Australia, China and the United States. Also the electricity produced from a photovoltaic roof system is cheaper than the electricity from the grid in many countries and places in the world.German PV drops to 15 cents max , Renewables International, 2 May 2013 *Real pollution control :Fossil fuels are known for their huge negative externalities or hidden costs. Tackling this market failure will make alternative energies more competitive and will reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. *Cancellation of government energy subsidies :According to the International Monetary Fund, governments around the world gave $523 billion direct subsidies for fossil fuels in 2011.EWEA Blog: Global fossil fuel subsidies amount to $1.9 trillion ‚Äì IMF, EWEA, 5 April 2013 If a carbon tax of $25 per ton of is included the subsidies total $1.9 trillion only for 2011.IMF Calls for Global Reform of Energy Subsidies: Sees Major Gains for Economic Growth and the Environment, IMF, 27 March 2013 Removing fossil fuels subsidies will further reduce their consumption and make the alternative energies even more competitive. *Renewable corporations lobbying :As the penetration of the renewable energy increases so will the wealth of the renewable energy corporations. This and the increasing number of employees in the renewable energy sector will inevitably transform into political lobbying against fossil fuels. *Urbanization and Electric transportation :Urbanization combined with increasing availability of convenient, safe and efficient public transport, green buildings and efficient energy distribution, as well as extended product life/use/re-use, increased local recycling and self-sustainability in raw materials drive down energy consumption. Perversely, ready access to travel and luxury, more batteries (energy storage and conversion losses) and proliferation of low cost LED technology, e.g. for advertising and decorative uses, may negate some of the potential energy savings. Switching to renewables sourced, electricity based transportation will reduce the demand for fossil fuels, particularly petroleum.\\"Peak Oil\\" Less A Concern As Alternatives Reduce Demand, Cleantechnica, 23 July 2013 Combining roof photovoltaics with second hand EV batteries will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as they will provide the needed grid storage for the times when the intermittent renewable energy sources are not producing electricity.GM, ABB Demonstrate Chevrolet Volt Battery Reuse Unit, General Motors, 11 November 2012 *Innovation and Efficiency :Innovations in, for example, information technology, miniaturisation, LEDs, virtual reality, 3D printing, new materials and biotechnology enable energy reduction in the areas of human sustenance and travel, as well as physical product creation and distribution. They also offer new avenues for economic growth and technological leadership, and are thus especially important for sustained wealth creation in the most developed, net- energy importing nations. Energy consumption may be expected to decrease as the service sector of the economy continues to grow whilst heavy industry, construction, manufacturing and agricultural sectors reduce. Increased investments in energy efficiency may lead to less consumed energyEnergy Intensity: The Secret Revolution, Forbes, 18 July 2014 even when the economy grows. Without growth in energy usage the prices of fossil fuels will decrease and most of the mega energy projects may be uneconomical. *Demographics and Changes in consumer behavior :A shrinking and ageing, already materially prosperous, satisfied and individualistic society may be less motivated towards additional, energy consuming material goods and new construction. On the other hand, longer life expectancy and increasing leisure and travel time will increase total energy use over an individual's lifetime. According to research by U.S. PIRG Education Fund reported in late 2014: \\"Over the last decade ‚Äì after 60-plus years of steady increases ‚Äì the number of miles driven by the average American has been falling. Young Americans have experienced the greatest changes: driving less; taking public transport, biking and walking more; and seeking out places to live in cities and walkable communities where driving is an option, not a necessity.\\"MILLENNIALS IN MOTION, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, 14 October 2014 Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that U.S. consumption of both coal and petroleum liquids peaked in 2005, and at the end of 2014 had fallen by 21% and 13% respectively. Consumption of natural gas continued to climb, resulting in the rate of total fossil fuel consumption in terms of energy units falling only 6% from its peak in 2007 to a plateau. On the other hand, global consumption of petroleum climbed steadily a total of 32% from 1995 to 2014.

During DNA repair, the enzyme hydrolyses oxidized purines and prevents their addition onto the DNA chain. As such it has important role in aging and cancer development.  Function  This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction : 2-hydroxy-dATP + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons 2-hydroxy-dAMP + diphosphate The enzyme hydrolyses oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates. The enzyme is used in DNA repair, where it hydrolysis the oxidized purines and prevents their addition onto the DNA chain. Misincorporation of oxidized nucleoside triphosphates into DNA and/or RNA during replication and transcription can cause mutations that may result in carcinogenesis or neurodegeneration. First isolated from Escherichia coli because of its ability to prevent occurrence of 8-oxoguanine in DNA, the protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-dATP, 2-oxo-dATP, 2-hydroxy-dATP, and 2-hydroxy rATP, to monophosphates, thereby preventing misincorporation.center MutT enzymes in non-human organisms often have substrate specificity for certain types of oxidized nucleotides, such as that of E. coli, which is specific to 8-oxoguanine nucleotides. Human MTH1, however, has substrate specificity for a much broader range of oxidatively damaged nucleotides. The mechanism of hMTH1's broad specificity for these oxidized nucleotides is derived from their recognition in the enzyme's substrate binding pocket due to an exchange of protonation state between two nearby aspartate residues.center The encoded protein is localized mainly in the cytoplasm, with some in the mitochondria, suggesting that it is involved in the sanitization of nucleotide pools both for nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. In plants, MTH1 has also been shown to enhance resistance to heat- and paraquat-induced oxidative stress, resulting in fewer dead cells and less accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which encode distinct isoforms, have been identified. Additional variants have been observed, but their full-length natures have not been determined. A single-nucleotide polymorphism that results in the production of an additional, longer isoform has been described.  Research   Aging  A mouse model has been studied that over-expresses hMTH1-Tg (NUDT1). The hMTH1-Tg mice express high levels of the hMTH1 hydrolase that degrades 8-oxodGTP and 8-oxoGTP and therefore excludes 8-oxoguanine from DNA and RNA. The steady state levels of 8-oxoguanine in DNA of several organs including the brain are significantly reduced in hMTH1-Tg over-expressing mice. Conversely, MTH1-null mice exhibit a significantly higher level of 8-oxo-dGTP accumulation than that of the wild type. Over-expression of hMTH1 prevents the age-dependent accumulation of DNA 8-oxoguanine that occurs in wild-type mice. The lower levels of oxidized guanines are associated with greater longevity. The hMTH1-Tg animals have a significantly longer lifespan than their wild-type littermates. These findings provide a link between ageing and oxidative DNA damage (see DNA damage theory of aging).  Cancer  Studies have suggested that this enzyme plays a role in both preventing the formation of cancer cells and the proliferation of cancer cells. This makes it a topic of interest in cancer research, both as a potential method for healthy cells to prevent cancer and a weakness to target within existing cancer cells. Eliminating the MTH1 gene in mice results in over three times more mice developing tumors compared to a control group. The enzyme's much-studied ability to sanitize a cell's nucleotide pool prevents it from developing mutations, including cancerous ones. Specifically, another study found that MTH1 inhibition in cancer cells leads to incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP and other oxidatively damaged nucleotides into the cell's DNA, damaging it and causing cell death. However, cancer cells have also been shown to benefit from use of MTH1. Cells from malignant breast tumors exhibit extreme MTH1 expression compared to other human cells. Because a cancer cell divides much more rapidly than a normal human cell, it is far more in need of an enzyme like MTH1 that prevents fatal mutations during replication. This property of cancer cells could allow for monitoring of cancer treatment efficacy by measuring MTH1 expression. Development of suitable probes for this purpose is currently underway. Disagreement exists concerning MTH1's functionality relative to prevention of DNA damage and cancer. Subsequent studies have had difficulty reproducing previously reported cytotoxic or antiproliferation effects of MTH1 inhibition on cancer cells, even calling into question whether MTH1 truly does serve to remove oxidatively damaged nucleotides from a cell's nucleotide pool. One study of newly discovered MTH1 inhibitors suggests that these anticancer properties exhibited by the older MTH1 inhibitors may be due to off-target cytotoxic effects. After revisiting the experiment, the original authors of this claim found that while the original MTH1 inhibitors in question lead to damaged nucleotides being incorporated into DNA, they demonstrate the others that do not induce toxicity fail to introduce the DNA lesion. Research into this topic is ongoing.  As a drug target  MTH1 is a potential drug target to treat cancer, however there are conflicting results regarding the cytotoxicity of MTH1 inhibitors toward cancer cells. Karonudib, an MTH1 inhibitor, is currently being evaluated a phase I clinical trial for safety and tolerability. A potent and selective MTH1 inhibitor AZ13792138 has been developed by AstraZeneca has been made available as a chemical probe to academic researchers. However AstraZeneca has found that neither AZ13792138 nor genetic knockdown of MTH1 displays any significant cytotoxicity to cancer cells.

The brigade was formed with the 1st, 3rd and 8th Battalion of East Bengal Regiment on 7 July 1971. It is the first ever complete brigade formed during the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971.  Background  Bangladeshi military officers of various cantonments revolted against the Pakistani Army and started fighting against them with limited ammunition on the night of 25 March 1971 after the crackdown by Pakistani Army. But soon the military officers of Bangladesh Forces realised that such non-planned attack or resistance will not be able to create huge casualties of the foes. So they decided to form some sectors from which they can fight properly. The guerrillas sent from the India during May‚ÄìJune to various sectors were ill-equipped and not properly trained and hence were unsuccessful in almost every operations. Most of the guerrillas were caught or shot dead by Pakistani Army. The lack of communication between the Sector Commanders and the Indian Military Officers also created major casualties to the guerrillas sent by the Indian officers to Bangladesh. Wherever the guerrillas were caught or killed, Pakistani Army in search of the other members of them used to start arson in many villages and killed numerous innocent people to take revenge. In this situation, senior military officers assumed that the war will continue for a long time and decided to form some brigades to fight with the Pakistani Army more effectively, especially in the frontiers.  Inception  After the sector commanders' meeting held at 8, Theater Road of Kolkata, the first brigade of Bangladesh Forces was formed. Major Ziaur Rahman, who was promoted to Lieutenant ColonelDocument for showing The Bangladesh Gazette announcing the promotion of Ziaur Rahman to Lieutenant General in the book Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood by Anthony Mascarenhas during the Liberation War of Bangladesh was the senior most officer amongst the officers present there and he was given the command of the force. Though the brigade was formed after the meeting, the decision to form the force was decided earlier. Chief of Bangladesh Forces MAG Osmani himself told Major Moinul Hossain about the decision on 13 June 1971. But according to the gazette of the Government of Bangladesh the force is known to be formed on 7 July 1971. The headquarters of the brigade was at Teldhala of Tura in India.  Formation and training  The 'Z Force' established their camp in the remote Tura area of Meghalaya. But with massive spirit and interest for the freedom, people of various ages and occupations gathered under the brigade. 'Z Force' had to organise themselves properly. It was formed with 1st, 3rd and 8th battalion of East Bengal Regiment. Of them the 1st Battalion of East Bengal Regiment, who revolted in Jessore Cantonment under Major Hafiz was unable to escape safely and after fighting a crucial battle only fifty of the Bengali officers and soldiers were able to reach the border. The 8th Battalion of East Bengal Regiment was a newly formed battalion with limited power. The 3rd Battalion of East Bengal Regiment also faced casualties. In this situation, the military headquarters of Bangladesh Forces ordered Major Hafizuddin Ahmed and Major Sahriful Haq Dalim to recruit 600 youths in 1st Battalion of East Bengal Regiment and another collect 500 youths and join 'Z Force' in Tura. Major Hafizuddin Ahmed recruited 600 youths from the youth camps from Khulna-Kushtia border area. The total number of the members in 1st Battalion of East Bengal Regiment was 800 while joining the 'Z Force'. Another 500 members collected by Major Shariful Haq Dalim amplified the strength of 3rd Battalion of East Bengal Regiment. Major Moinul Hossain Chowdhury, who acted as the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of East Bengal Regiment was asked to format the battalion. The command and the charge to organise the 3rd Battalion of East Bengal Regiment was given to Major Shafayet Zamil and the responsibility of 8th Battalion of East Bengal Regiment was given to AZM Aminul Haq. After a training session of six weeks, \\"Z Force\\" turned into a valiant brigade of Bangladesh Forces.

Since the Kamalpur post was close to the border, it was decided that Mukti Bahini with the support of regular Indian army troops would attempt to capture the post. The Pakistani post was first subjected to artillery bombardment. The Mukti Bahini troops under the cover of supporting fire from Indian army almost reached to the mouth of Pakistani bunkers. However, once the supporting fire was stopped by Indian army, the Mukti Bahini troops were mowed down by machine-gun fire. The attack was called off because of heavy casualties. Captain Salahuddin Momtaz of Mukti Bahini was killed in this battle. Later from 14 November to 4 December 1971, in order to capture Kamalpur, a second battle of Kamalpur took place. The Kamalpur was subsequently captured on 4 December 1971 by combined strength of Bangladesh and Indian army.  Nakshi Border Outpost Attack  Nakshi Border Outpost was situated in the Sherpur District, where the Pakistan Army formed a strong position. The border outpost became a target of \\"Z\\" Force because of its geographical importance. Soon Captain Amin Ahmed Chowdhury, the Commander of Alpha Company and Lieutenant Modasser Hossain Khan, the Commander of Charlie Company was sent to defeat the Pakistanis of that camp. The two companies with great speed ran into the area and were able to enter into the fifty yards region. With great show of courage, they attacked the position of Pakistani Army. The Pakistanis fled from the camp and took shelter in a forest which was nearby. But soon they attacked the freedom fighters with mortar shell with field mines also interrupting the operation of the 'Z Force' companies. In this battle Captain Amin Ahmed got injured from to machine gun bullets. Major Aminul Haque saved him, risking his life.  Battle at Ghashipur  On 10 September the Delta Company of 1st Battalion of East Bengal Regiment formed a strong defence at the Ghashipur. Ghashipur was a location near the Kamalpur Border Outpost. Ghashipur was considered as a lifeline of the strong position of Pakistan Army in Kamalpur. Pakistani Army was anxious about their safety in Kamalpur due to the strong position of the 'Z Force' in Ghashipur. To remain safe from the sudden attack of freedom fighters Pakistan Army launched an attack on the Ghashipur Defense of 'Z Force'. The attempt of cleansing the freedom fighters from Ghashipur went up in smoke. Pakistan Army had to flee at the end of the battle after suffering huge casualties. Lance Nayek Yousuf and Subedar Mozammel of the regiment was martyred in the battle.  Defense of liberated zone  One of the prime objectives of Z Force was to cover the liberated zones in Northern Bangladesh during the Liberation War of Bangladesh. As a part of this operations Z Force liberated many areas and set up defence to save those areas from Pakistan Army from August 1971.  Establishment of administration in Roumari  Roumari, an area from Kurigram was liberated in late August. After being acquired by the Z Force, Ziaur Rahman directed Lieutenant Lieutenant S. I. B. Nurunnabi Khan of 3rd East Bengal Regiment, to establish an administration on behalf of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. Shafaat Jamil was asked to set up formidable defence to save the area from further invasion of Pakistan Army. Lieutenant Nabi after getting the order, formed a committee of eminent citizens of that area to establish an administration and make it properly functional. He formed some offices and other establishments including a hospital in Roumari within 27 August. Ziaur Rahman inaugurated the first ever administration system in a liberated area of independent Bangladesh on 27 August 1971. NBC Network made a documentary that included the liberated zone of Roumari which was entitled as A country made for disaster.

It was originally derived by Roger James Elliott to describe linear absorption based on properties of a single electron‚Äìhole pair. Kuper, C. G.; Whitfield, G. D. (1963). Polarons and Excitons. Plenum Press. LCCN 63021217. The analysis can be extended to a many-body investigation with full predictive powers when all parameters are computed microscopically using, e.g., the semiconductor Bloch equations (abbreviated as SBEs) or the semiconductor luminescence equations (abbreviated as SLEs). Background One of the most accurate theories of semiconductor absorption and photoluminescence is provided by the SBEs and SLEs, respectively. Both of them are systematically derived starting from the many-body/quantum-optical system Hamiltonian and fully describe the resulting quantum dynamics of optical and quantum-optical observables such as optical polarization (SBEs) and photoluminescence intensity (SLEs). All relevant many-body effects can be systematically included by using various techniques such as the cluster-expansion approach. Both the SBEs and SLEs contain an identical homogeneous part driven either by a classical field (SBEs) or by a spontaneous-emission source (SLEs). This homogeneous part yields an eigenvalue problem that can be expressed through the generalized Wannier equation that can be solved analytically in special cases. In particular, the low-density Wannier equation is analogous to bound solutions of the hydrogen problem of quantum mechanics. These are often referred to as exciton solutions and they formally describe Coulombic binding by oppositely charged electrons and holes. The actual physical meaning of excitonic states is discussed further in connection with the SBEs and SLEs. The exciton eigenfunctions are denoted by \\\\phi_\\\\lambda({\\\\mathbf{k}}) where \\\\lambda labels the exciton state with eigenenergy E_\\\\lambda and \\\\hbar {\\\\mathbf{k}} is the crystal momentum of charge carriers in the solid. These exciton eigenstates provide valuable insight to SBEs and SLEs, especially, when one analyses the linear semiconductor absorption spectrum or photoluminescence at steady-state conditions. One simply uses the constructed eigenstates to diagonalize the homogeneous parts of the SBEs and SLEs. Kira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2011). Semiconductor Quantum Optics. Cambridge University Press. . Under the steady-state conditions, the resulting equations can be solved analytically when one further approximates dephasing due to higher- order many-body effects. When such effects are fully included, one must resort to a numeric approach. After the exciton states are obtained, one can eventually express the linear absorption and steady-state photoluminescence analytically. The same approach can be applied to compute absorption spectrum for fields that are in the terahertz (abbreviated as THz) range Lee, Y.-S. (2009). Principles of Terahertz Science and Technology. doi:10.1007/978-0-387-09540-0. . of electromagnetic radiation. Since the THz- photon energy lies within the meV range, it is mostly resonant with the many- body states, not the interband transitions that are typically in the eV range. Technically, the THz investigations are an extension of the ordinary SBEs and/or involve solving the dynamics of two-particle correlations explicitly. Kira, M.; Koch, S.W. (2006). \\"Many-body correlations and excitonic effects in semiconductor spectroscopy\\". Progress in Quantum Electronics 30 (5): 155‚Äì296. doi:10.1016/j.pquantelec.2006.12.002 Like for the optical absorption and emission problem, one can diagonalize the homogeneous parts that emerge analytically with the help of the exciton eigenstates. Once the diagonalization is completed, one can then compute the THz absorption analytically. All of these derivations rely on the steady-state conditions and the analytic knowledge of the exciton states. Furthermore, the effect of further many-body contributions, such as the excitation-induced dephasing, can be included microscopically Jahnke, F.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W.; Tai, K. (1996). \\"Excitonic Nonlinearities of Semiconductor Microcavities in the Nonperturbative Regime\\". Physical Review Letters 77 (26): 5257‚Äì5260. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5257 to the Wannier solver, which removes the need to introduce phenomenological dephasing constant, energy shifts, or screening of the Coulomb interaction. Linear optical absorption Characteristic linear absorption spectrum \\\\alpha(E) of bulk GaAs using two-band SBEs. The decay of polarization is approximated with a decay constant \\\\hbar \\\\gamma = 0.13\\\\,\\\\mathrm{meV} and \\\\alpha(E) is computed as function of the pump field's photon energy E. The energy is shifted with respect to the band-gap energy E_{\\\\mathrm{gap}}=1.490\\\\,\\\\mathrm{meV} and the semiconductor is initially unexcited. Due to the small dephasing constant used, several excitonic resonances appear (vertical lines) well below the bandgap energy. The magnitude of high-energy resonances are multiplied by 5 for visibility. Linear absorption of broadband weak optical probe can then be expressed as where \\\\hbar \\\\omega is the probe-photon energy, F_\\\\lambda is the oscillator strength of the exciton state \\\\lambda, and \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda is the dephasing constant associated with the exciton state \\\\lambda. For a phenomenological description, \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda can be used as a single fit parameter, i.e., \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda \\\\rightarrow \\\\gamma. However, a full microscopic computation generally produces \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda(\\\\omega) that depends on both exciton index \\\\lambda and photon frequency. As a general tendency, \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda(\\\\omega) increases for elevated E_\\\\lambda while the \\\\omega dependence is often weak. Each of the exciton resonances can produce a peak to the absorption spectrum when the photon energy matches with E_\\\\lambda. For direct-gap semiconductors, the oscillator strength is proportional to the product of dipole-matrix element squared and \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\phi_\\\\lambda({\\\\mathbf{k}})^2 that vanishes for all states except for those that are spherically symmetric. In other words, F_\\\\lambda is nonvanishing only for the s-like states, following the quantum- number convention of the hydrogen problem. Therefore, optical spectrum of direct-gap semiconductors produces an absorption resonance only for the s-like state. The width of the resonance is determined by the corresponding dephasing constant. In general, the exciton eigen energies consist of a series of bound states that emerge energetically well below the fundamental bandgap energy and a continuum of unbound states that appear for energies above the bandgap. Therefore, a typical semiconductor's low-density absorption spectrum shows a series of exciton resonances and then a continuum-absorption tail. For realistic situations, \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda increases more rapidly than the exciton- state spacing so that one typically resolves only few lowest exciton resonances in actual experiments. The concentration of charge carriers influence the shape of the absorption spectrum considerably. For high enough densities, all E_\\\\lambda energies correspond to continuum states and some of the oscillators strengths may become negative-valued due to the Pauli-blocking effect. Physically, this can be understood as the elementary property of Fermions; if a given electronic state is already excited it cannot be excited a second time due to the Pauli exclusion among Fermions. Therefore, the corresponding electronic states can produce only photon emission that is seen as negative absorption, i.e., gain that is the prerequisite to realizing semiconductor lasers. Even though one can understand the principal behavior of semiconductor absorption on the basis of the Elliott formula, detailed predictions of the exact E_\\\\lambda, F_\\\\lambda, and \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda(\\\\omega) requires a full many-body computation already for moderate carrier densities. Photoluminescence Elliott formula 500pxthumbnailrightPhotoluminescence intensity computed via the Elliott formula. The population of s-like exciton states follow a Boltzmann distribution at 35 Kelvin, where the 1s population is suppressed to four percent and the dephasing constant is \\\\hbar \\\\gamma \\\\approx 1 /, \\\\mathrm{meV}. The vertical lines indicate the position of s-like excitonic resonances, i.e., 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. The bandgap energy is denoted by E_\\\\mathrm{gap} and 'arb. u.' means arbitrary units. After the semiconductor becomes electronically excited, the carrier system relaxes into a quasiequilibrium. At the same time, vacuum-field fluctuations Walls, D. F.; Milburn, G. J. (2008). Quantum Optics (2nd ed.). . trigger spontaneous recombination of electrons and holes (electronic vacancies) via spontaneous emission of photons. At quasiequilibrium, this yields a steady-state photon flux emitted by the semiconductor. By starting from the SLEs, the steady-state photoluminescence (abbreviated as PL) can be cast into the form that is very similar to the Elliott formula for the optical absorption. As a major difference, the numerator has a new contribution ‚Äì the spontaneous-emission source S_\\\\lambda = \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\phi_\\\\lambda({\\\\mathbf{k}})^2 f_{\\\\mathbf{k}}^e f_{\\\\mathbf{k}}^h + \\\\Delta N_\\\\lambda\\\\; that contains electron and hole distributions f_{\\\\mathbf{k}}^e and f_{\\\\mathbf{k}}^h, respectively, where \\\\hbar{\\\\mathbf{k}} is the carrier momentum. Additionally, S_\\\\lambda contains also a direct contribution from exciton populations \\\\Delta N_\\\\lambda that describes truly bound electron‚Äìhole pairs. The f^e_{\\\\mathbf{k}} f^h_{\\\\mathbf{k}} term defines the probability to find an electron and a hole with same \\\\mathbf{k}. Such a form is expected for a probability of two uncorrelated events to occur simultaneously at a desired \\\\mathbf{k} value. Therefore, f^e_{\\\\mathbf{k}} f^h_{\\\\mathbf{k}} is the spontaneous-emission source originating from uncorrelated electron‚Äìhole plasma. The possibility to have truly correlated electron‚Äìhole pairs is defined by a two-particle exciton correlation \\\\Delta N_\\\\lambda; the corresponding probability is directly proportional to the correlation. Nevertheless, both the presence of electron‚Äìhole plasma and excitons can equivalently induce the spontaneous emission. A further discussion of the relative weight and nature of plasma vs. exciton sources Chatterjee, S.; Ell, C.; Mosor, S.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H.; Hoyer, W.; Kira, M.; Koch, S.; Prineas, J.; Stolz, H. (2004). \\"Excitonic Photoluminescence in Semiconductor Quantum Wells: Plasma versus Excitons\\". Physical Review Letters 92 (6). doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.067402 is presented in connection with the SLEs. Like for the absorption, a direct-gap semiconductor emits light only at the resonances corresponding to the s-like states. As a typical trend, a quasiequilibrium emission is strongly peaked around the 1s resonance because S_\\\\lambda is usually largest for the \\\\lambda=1s ground state. This emission peak often remains well below the fundamental bandgap energy even at the high excitations where all states are continuum states. This demonstrates that semiconductors are often subjects to massive Coulomb-induced renormalizations even when the system appears to have only electron‚Äìhole plasma states as emission resonances. To make an accurate prediction of the exact position and shape at elevated carrier densities, one must resort to the full SLEs. Terahertz Elliott formula Terahertz absorption spectrum in bulk GaAs computed using the THz Elliott formula. The vertical lines indicate the np-1s transition energies of which the first one (2p-1s transition) is dominant. The 1s-band-gap-transition lies slightly above 4meV, whereas the dephasing constant is chosen to be \\\\hbar\\\\gamma = 1.7\\\\,\\\\mathrm{meV}. As discussed above, it is often meaningful to tune the electromagnetic field to be resonant with the transitions between two many- body states. For example, one can follow how a bound exciton is excited from its 1s ground state to a 2p state. In several semiconductor systems, one needs THz fields to induce such transitions. By starting from a steady-state configuration of electron‚Äìhole correlations, the diagonalization of THz- induced dynamics yields a THz absorption spectrum (\\\\omega) = \\\\mathrm{Im}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{ u, \\\\lambda} S^{ u, \\\\lambda} (\\\\omega) \\\\Delta N_{ u,\\\\lambda} - \\\\left[ S^{ u, \\\\lambda}(-\\\\omega) \\\\Delta N_{ u,\\\\lambda}\\\\right]^{\\\\star} }{ \\\\omega (\\\\hbar \\\\omega + \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\gamma(\\\\omega))} \\\\right]\\\\;. cellpadding border border colour = #50C878 background colour = #ECFCF4}} In this notation, the diagonal contributions \\\\Delta N_{\\\\lambda, \\\\lambda} determine the population of \\\\lambda excitons. The off-diagonal \\\\Delta N_{ u, \\\\lambda eq u} elements formally determine transition amplitudes between two exciton states u and \\\\lambda eq u. For elevated densities, \\\\Delta N_{ u, \\\\lambda eq u} build up spontaneously and they describe correlated electron‚Äìhole plasma that is a state where electrons and holes move with respect to each other without forming bound pairs. In contrast to optical absorption and photoluminescence, THz absorption may involve all exciton states. This can be seen from the spectral response function S^{ u, \\\\lambda} (\\\\omega) = \\\\sum_\\\\beta \\\\frac{ (E_\\\\beta-E_ u) J_{ u \\\\beta} J_{\\\\beta \\\\lambda} }{E_\\\\beta - E_ u - \\\\hbar \\\\omega - \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\gamma_{\\\\lambda, u}(\\\\omega)} that contains the current-matrix elements J_{ u \\\\beta} \\\\propto \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\phi^\\\\star_ u({\\\\mathbf{k}}) {\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\cdot {\\\\mathbf{k}}_{\\\\rm THz} \\\\phi_\\\\beta({\\\\mathbf{k}}) between two exciton states. The unit vector {\\\\mathbf{k}}_{\\\\rm THz} is determined by the direction of the THz field. This leads to dipole selection rules among exciton states, in full analog to the atomic dipole selection rules. Each allowed transition produces a resonance in S^{ u, \\\\lambda} (\\\\omega) and the resonance width is determined by a dephasing constant \\\\gamma_{\\\\lambda, u}(\\\\omega) that generally depends on exciton states involved and the THz frequency \\\\omega. The THz response also contains \\\\gamma(\\\\omega) that stems from the decay constant of macroscopic THz currents. In contrast to optical and photoluminescence spectroscopy, THz absorption can directly measure the presence of exciton populations in full analogy to atomic spectroscopy.

Nature 423 (6941): 734‚Äì738. doi:10.1038/nature01676 As a major difference to atomic spectroscopy, semiconductor resonances contain a strong excitation-induced dephasing that produces much broader resonances than in atomic spectroscopy.

SMARC Computer-on- Modules are specifically designed for the development of extremely compact low-power systems. Generally, SMARC modules are based on ARM processors, they can, however, also be fitted with other low-power SoC architectures, like, for example, ones based on x86 SoCs.Initiating Coverage on SMARC Embedded COMs Typically, SMARC modules‚Äô power requirement is in the range of a few watts, which opens up avenues to markets which to date could not be addressed due to processor designs with much higher power consumption.‚Äì new Computer-on-Module standard for ARM/SoC designs Computer-on-Modules integrate the core function of a bootable computer, like SoC, as well as additional circuitry, including DRAM, boot-flash, voltage distribution, Ethernet and display transmitter. The modules are deployed together with an application-specific carrierboard, whose size and form can be defined to meet customer-specific requirements. The carrierboard executes the required interfaces and can integrate, if required, any further functionalities, such as audio codecs, touch controller, wireless communication interfaces, etc. The SMARC specification outlines both the dimensions of the module and the positioning of the anchor points as well as the connector to the carrierboard and, most importantly, the executed interfaces with the pin-out. The pin-out is optimized for ARM and low-power SoC interfaces and is distinguished from classical PC interfaces by its target-oriented focus on low-power and mobile applications. SMARC is based on the ULP-COM form factorannounces the release candidate of the ultra low-power module standard for ARM- and SoC-based COMs which was introduced by the companies Kontron and Adlink in 2011. During the specification process by the SGET the standard was renamed to SMARC.  Dimensions  SMARC defines two module sizes: * 82 mm √ó 50 mm for extremely compact low-power designs * 82 mm √ó 80 mm for SoCs with higher performance and with increased space and cooling requirement  Connector  SMARC Computer-on-Modules have 314 card edge contacts on the printed circuit board (PCB) of the module which is plugged via a low-profile connector on the carrierboard. In most cases, the connector has a construction height of 4.3 mm. It is also used for Mobile PCI Express Module 3.0 graphic cards, which naturally have completely different pin assignments.  Signal lines and pin assignments  Signal transmission is carried out via a total of 314 pins. 33 of these are reserved signal lines for power supply and grounding, so that with SMARC a total of 281 signal lines are effectively available. ARM- and SoC-typical energy-saving interfaces, like, for instance, parallel LCD for display connection, mobile industry processor interfaces for cameras, Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) for general peripheral connection, I¬≤S for audio and I2C are included. Besides these, classical computer interfaces such as USB, SATA and PCI Express are also defined. In the current version of the SMARC specification not all of the 314 signal lines are assigned to fixed I/Os. The Alternate Function Block (AFB) has free pins available for different requirements. This is to ensure that the SMARC specification can flexibly accommodate up and coming technical developments which today are not foreseeable while remaining fully compatibility to previous designs. On the one hand, extended versions of the SMARC specification can assign new standard functions to these 20 AFB signal lines.

The football team currently competes in the Ballarat Football League, having debuted there in 1978. History The club was originally founded in 1893, and completed in the Ballarat Football Association wearing the colours of red and white before changing to blue and white in 1894. The club was a founding member of the competition in 1893 finishing in fourth place, and took until 1920 to win its inaugural premiership. In 1922 the club adopted the colours of blue and gold that prevail to the present day. After winning its second premiership in 1929, Sebastopol moved to the Ballarat and District Football League and won two premierships in a row in 1936 and 1937 before joining the Ballarat Football League in 1938. The club played off in the grand final in its first season and were defeated by South Ballarat, but then in 1939 it transferred to the Clunes Football Association winning the premiership before returning to the BFL in 1940. Consequent to this World War Two affected player numbers causing Sebastopol to form a temporary merger with South Ballarat before the BFL went into recess. Sebastopol returned in its pre war form in 1946 rejoining the Clunes FA. In 1947 it moved back to the BFL in its B Grade competition, and won premierships from 1950 to 1953. In 1959 the B Grade competition separated from the BFL to form the Ballarat District Football League and Sebastopol won premierships in this competition in 1965, 1967 and 1969. The BDFL then merged in 1973 with the Bacchus Marsh Football League and Sebastopol won the premiership in this competition in 1975. This would be the club's last premiership to date. Sebastopol rejoined the BFL in 1978 and has made three grand finals, losing them to North Ballarat in 1985, Melton Football Club in 2000 and East Point Football Club in 2019.Club history on Sebastopol website Home Ground Marty Busch Reserve - Opening of redeveloped ground, 2017 Sebastopol play their home matches at Marty Busch Reserve, Sebastopol.

It was described by the French naturalist Palisot de Beauvois in 1805. Description The adult has bold disruptive coloration in cream and green, providing effective camouflage against flowers and in damp leafy places. The male reaches 25 mm long, the female 32 mm. There are spiny projections under the abdomen, 6 in the male, 5 in the female. The wings of the male are longer and wider than the abdomen, while the female's wings are narrower than the abdomen and can only briefly sustain flight. Behaviour and ecology The wings of P. ocellata, like those of Pseudocreobotra wahlbergii, are marked with a large brightly coloured eyespot which is used in deimatic display to startle predators. The adults are aggressive mimics of flowers, waiting until prey approaches to grasp it with their forelegs.

It is a collection of three multilingual short stories directed by Bront Palarae, Sheikh Munasar, and Rozi Izma. The film is produced by the directors alongside associate producer James Wong under the production company Otto Films SDN BHD. Set in Kuala Lumpur, the story weaves together the common themes of life, hopes and dreams. The cast includes Sharifah Amani, Azad Jazmin, Ruminah Sidek, Nell Ng, Mano Maniam, Soffi Jikan, Sabri Yunus, Sherry Alhadad, Along Eyzandy, Radhi Khalid and Emely Poon. Synopsis Rahul, an Indian immigrant arrives in town to discover that the company that offered him a job has gone out of business. He is helped by a local restaurant owner and begins his life in the city as an illegal immigrant worker. In Setapak, Gienna is a Chinese woman in her thirties who is constantly avoiding phone calls from her mother. She finds herself spending an afternoon helping a stranger, a senile old lady, who cannot remember where her house is. In Ampang, Hafidd, a young man, meets a pretty stranger at the KLCC LRT station after they both miss the last train. For someone who has never dated anyone in his life, this is a life-defining moment and his only chance at love. Together the three stories create a collage of the human connections that give life to the city. There are hidden messages in each of the three short stories. The first story shows the injustice in life can receive further injustice; the second portrays kindness across racial barriers, despite issues of racism in different levels of the Malaysian society; while the final installment delivers a subtle message: When one opens his mind to see the beauty in life, life can be beautiful.

In the hermetic type, it can either be a scroll or reciprocating compressor. This type of compressor uses a drive to control the compressor motor speed to modulate cooling capacity. Capacity modulation is a way to match cooling capacity to cooling demand to application requirements. Market needs for variable capacity Typical load profile in a building Many refrigeration and air conditioning systems require reliable processes which are more efficient, compact, environmental friendly, easy to install and to maintain. The cooling requirements vary over a wide range during the day and over the year due to ambient conditions, occupancy and use, lighting etc. *In comfort cooling, there may also be the need for a stable and accurate temperature and humidity control in areas such as hospitals, IT & telecoms, process cooling. In applications such as schools, restaurants and office buildings, it is important that the cooling system is able to adapt to wide daily shifts in load. *In process applications such as fermentation, growing tunnels and industrial processes, accurate temperature settings are required to secure production quality.  Different modulating technologies  There are several ways to modulate the cooling capacity in refrigeration or air conditioning and heating systems. The most common in air conditioning are: on-off cycling, hot gas bypass, use or not of liquid injection, manifold configurations of multiple compressors, mechanical modulation (also called digital) and inverter technology. Each have advantages and drawbacks. ; On-off cycling: Results in switching off the fixed-speed compressor under light load conditions and could lead to short cycling and the reduction in compressor lifetime. Efficiency of the unit is reduced by pressure cycling and transient losses. The turndown capacity is 100% or 0% ; Hot gas bypass: Involves injecting a quantity of gas from discharge to the suction side. The compressor will keep operating at the same speed but thanks to the bypass, the refrigerant mass flow circulating with the system is reduced and thus the cooling capacity. This naturally causes the compressor to run uselessly during the periods where the bypass is operating. The turndown capacity varies between 0 and 100%.http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/bypass-method-recip-compressor- capacity-control Pipeline and gas journal March 2013, Vol 240, n¬∞3 ; Manifold configurations: Several compressors can be installed in the system to provide the peak cooling capacity. Each compressor can run or not in order to stage the cooling capacity of the unit. The turndown capacity is either 0/33/66 or 100% for a trio configuration and either 0/50 or 100% for a tandem. ; Mechanically modulated compressor: This internal mechanical capacity modulation is based on periodic compression process with a control valve, the 2 scroll set move apart stopping the compression for a given time period. This method varies refrigerant flow by changing the average time of compression, but not the actual speed of the motor. Despite an excellent turndown ratio ‚Äì from 10 to 100% of the cooling capacity, mechanically modulated scrolls have high energy consumption as the motor continuously runs. ; Inverter compressor: Uses an external variable-frequency drive - to control the speed of the compressor. The refrigerant flow rate is changed by the change in the speed of compressor. The turndown ratio depends on the system configuration and manufacturer. It modulates from 15 or 25% up to 100% at full capacity with a single inverter from 12 to 100% with a hybrid tandem.  Working principle  The variable-frequency drive controls the speed of compressor motor. The compressor is specifically designed to run at different motor speeds to modulate cooling output. Variable speed operation requires an appropriate compressor for full speed operation and a special compressor lubrication system. Proper oil management is a critical requirement to ensure compressor lifetime. Proper oil management provides proper lubrication for scroll set at low speed and prevents excess oil from being injected into the circuit when operating at full speed.  Applications  Variable speed technology can be implemented in HVACR, close control and process cooling applications and as diverse as packaged or split air-conditioning units, rooftops, chillers, precision cooling, VRF and condensing units. ; Rooftop: This is a very common unit type. The rising cost of energy means that air conditioning manufacturers must develop new generation of high-efficiency, cost-effective air conditioners for commercial buildings that meet or exceed a part-load efficiency standard of typically 18 IEER. The aim is to reduce energy use by 30% over current equipment. Inverter technology helps OEMs to build units which meet this demand. ; Air handling units: These have integrated cooling are used in commercial applications for air conditioning and humidity control in diverse ranges of buildings such as small office buildings, fitness and medical centres. Inverter compressor solutions enable smooth modulation and huge energy savings. ; Modular chillers: A typical modular chiller installation uses multiple fixed-speed. These units share the same water system to supply the building with cooled or heated water. Hybrid tandem, associating one inverter and one fixed-speed compressor, can better match the capacity requirement compared to a modular chiller with fixed-speed tandem compressors and increases efficiency. ; Close control units: These are used in the cooling of IT and electronic equipment used in data centres, telecommunications and in manufacturing industries. Power management, energy consumption and heat loads are major challenges. Maintenance of a stable temperature and humidity control, compactness of the system and overall efficiency are key design challenges in these applications for ensuring data safety and availability. This is where inverter technology makes the difference. ; Process cooling: In many industries the machinery and processes generate a large amount of heat which requires cooling, to protect the equipment and / or to ensure that the product being manufactured is of the required quality. Inverter technology helps to secure the process while providing greater efficiency. ; Variable refrigerant flow (VRF): VRF units are very popular cooling or reversible systems (heating and cooling). They combine flexibility for building owners and occupants alike, with energy efficiency, high comfort, and ease of installation, without compromising on reliability. VRF systems already extensively use inverter technology.https://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/products/hvac-systems- that-support-your-design-vision  Challenges in adopting inverter scroll in HVAC systems  The compressor and drive need to be qualified to work together and for dedicated applications. The drive modulates the compressor speed and prevents it from operating out of the compressor operating limits. The inverter frequency drives need to use algorithms developed specifically for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) or for refrigeration. They ensure that the system will run within the application constraints. The drive can also manage other devices such as oil injection valves or multiple compressors. As the compressor rotational speed changes, the amount of refrigerant ‚Äî and oil ‚Äî flowing through the compressor increases or decreases. The drive ensures that the compressor and bearings are optimally lubricated at all compressor speeds.

The Fremantle Arts Centre and the Round House were included in the first set of sites. The creation of content on wikipedia and the driving force of the project has come from the work of wikipedian editors. Subsequently local groups and collaborators have supported the project, however content creation and maintenance of the project has remained with wikipedians. Installation of plaques has been carried out by Fremantle Society volunteers, the University of Notre Dame Australia, and Fremantle Port Authority. The latter produced eight of their own plaques, of blue plastic, and are () installing them around Victoria Quay and the Maritime Museum. The collaboration has been between the Fremantle Society and Wikimedia Australia, supported by the City of Fremantle, State Records Office, Fremantle Business Improvement District, Fremantle Port Authority, and other organisations in Fremantle.

Legal background of the lease Clause 12.1 of the lease provided as follows: > The lessor does not warrant or represent that the premises are fit for the > purpose of the business to be conducted in terms of this lease or any other > purpose. Clause 19 provided that Pete's Warehousing must give written notice of any defects within ten days of occupation and return the premises in good order at the expiry of the lease. Clause 25.3 provided that the Pete's Warehousing might withhold payments due if the premises were in a defective condition. Clause 25.4 provided that the Bowsink Investments was not responsible for any damage sustained on the premises by leakage or by rain, hail, wind, lightning, flood, explosion or fire. Findings of the court When Pete's Warehousing purported to cancel the lease, Bowsink Investments instituted an action for damages. Pete's Warehousing pleaded that the lease contained a residual implied term that Bowsink Investments was obliged initially to place the leased premises in a condition reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were let, which term had been breached. To this plea Bowsink Investments excepted that it disclosed no defence, inasmuch as such an implied term was inconsistent with, and excluded by, the express terms of the lease. Kroon J held that, in the absence of any contrary term therein, a lease contained an implied residual term that the lessor was obliged initially to place the leased premises in a condition reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are let. In interpreting clause 12.1, the court held that it was not permissible merely to look at its wording. The language had to be construed in the light of the nature and purpose of the contract, and also the context of the words in the contract as a whole. Moreover, a clause which sought to limit, or might be seen as limiting, residual implied or common-law obligations, had to be restrictively interpreted. Thus the clause could reasonably be interpreted as providing merely that, in the limited context of the lessee having to secure a licence for (or otherwise having to comply with the requirements of a local or other authority in respect of) the business it intended to conduct at the premises, the lessor did not warrant or represent that the premises were fit for the purpose of that business or any other business. Furthermore, clause 19.1 did no more than provide for the extent of the lessee's obligation in respect of the condition in which the premises and its appurtenances were to be returned at the end of the lease. Clause 25.3, furthermore, did not indicate that the lessee could not raise any complaint about the condition of the premises at any stage during the lease, but remained liable to pay rental whatever that condition might be. Clause 25.4 of the lease was intended to circumscribe the lessor's liability in respect of damage that might be caused to the lessee's property as a result of defects to the premises. The fact that a clause might, in very wide terms, relieve a lessor from liability for damage which the lessee suffered because of defects did not mean that the former was relieved from all obligations to the latter; the latter might still avail himself of all residual obligations to the lessor which were not excluded by the written lease. The court held, therefore, that the express terms of the lease did not exclude the implied term relied upon by the lessee, and that the exception had to be dismissed.

It is a basidiomycete in the order Boletales. It has been found on all continents except for Antarctica. Recent molecular work demonstrates that S. himantioides is a species complex including multiple cryptic lineages. Taxonomy The fungus was first described in 1818 by Elias Magnus Fries as Merulius himantioides. Petter Karsten transferred it to the genus Serpula in 1884. Host and symptoms Serpula himantioides is a fungal pathogen within the division Basidiomycota. It produces thin, resupinate (inverted), membranous fan-like basidiocarps that are brownish in color and appear as distinctive fruiting bodies on the exterior of the host. S. himantioides prefers the moist wood of coniferous hosts such as fir, larch, spruce, and pine. It is the causal agent of butt rot disease, the symptoms of which include rotting the heartwood at base of tree, as well as damage to the tap root and cores of lateral roots, but standing trees show no signs of infection. It also a common cause of timber rotting in buildings, which has made this pathogen difficult to differentiate from S. lacrymans because of their similarities. This disease often goes unnoticed initially due to a lack of any above ground symptoms of disease. Signs of the pathogen include basidiospores, and fungal masses that are generally dark brown and membranous in the center but become thin white mycelium towards edges of the mass. The brown cubical rot caused by S. himantioides resembles the rots of Phaeolus schweinitzii and S. lacrymans. Importance Serpula himantiodes is a pre- harvest pathogen that exerts economic impact on lumber supply. It is considered the wild sister species of S. lacrymans, the pathogen that causes dry rot in wooden building structures. S. himantioides is studied most frequently in the context of its relation to S. lacrymans. Disease cycle Serpula himantioides has a heterothallic tetrapolar mating system. This means it requires the growth and conjugation of two mating types, determined by the expression of one or more alleles of two unlinked mating loci, for sexual reproduction. Environment Serpula himantioides is commonly found in the wild, while S. lacrymans is rarely found in the wild and is generally found on lumber in buildings and construction.

It was directed by Kevin Macdonald and the script was written by Tony Grisoni, Jeremy Brock and Penelope Skinner. The film stars Saoirse Ronan, Tom Holland, Anna Chancellor, George MacKay and Corey Johnson. It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Daisy, a neurotic American teenager, is sent to the English countryside for the summer to stay with her Aunt Penn and her cousins, Eddie, Isaac, and Piper. She arrives at Heathrow Airport to tightened security and reports of a bombing in Paris, and Isaac drives to her cousins' farm, which she discovers to be dilapidated and very messy. Although initially abrasive, Daisy warms to them upon learning that her deceased mother used to stay there frequently. She also falls in love with Eddie, her eldest cousin, finding him to be as introverted and strong-willed as she, and noticing his unusual, almost mystical connection to animals. A few days after her arrival, her aunt flies to Geneva to attend an emergency conference because she is an expert in terrorist extremist groups, and the group takes advantage of her absence to explore their local woodlands. Their summer fun ends when a terrorist coalition detonates a nuclear bomb in London that potentially kills hundreds of thousands; the nuclear fallout reaches as far away as their home. In the aftermath, electricity goes out, and they learn from an emergency radio broadcast that martial law has been imposed. The next day, an American consular official arrives at the house and offers Daisy passage home. Unable to help her cousins, he advises them to remain indoors and wait for evacuation. After they move to a nearby barn, Daisy and Eddie make love and she decides that she would rather stay with them. The next day, however, the British Army storms the shelter and takes them to a nearby town. There, they learn boys and girls are to be evacuated to separate parts of the country. Both Eddie and Daisy resist separation, and Daisy is restrained with cable ties; Eddie calls to her to return to their home when she gets the chance. Daisy and Piper are taken to the home of a British Army major and his wife, who foster them. Determined to escape, Daisy discreetly begins hoarding supplies, but their neighbourhood is attacked by the enemy before she has time to take everything she needs. As Daisy and Piper hike through the countryside, Daisy interprets her dreams of Eddie as indications of his current situation. One night, Daisy is woken up and witnesses a gang-rape. She and Piper flee, but after Piper starts whining, Daisy threatens to abandon her. Already disturbed by the prior experience, they discover a massacre at the camp where Isaac and Eddie were taken. Daisy reluctantly checks the bodies; although Eddie is not among the dead, Isaac's body is. She mournfully takes his glasses and later buries them. As they leave, they are spotted by two armed men, who chase them through the woods. Piper and Daisy decide to hide, but the men discover Piper. Daisy threatens them with a gun and impulsively shoots them both; she kills one and wounds the other. The horror of what she has done, along with her fears, begins to take its toll on Daisy. Later, she realises that they have lost their map and compass, and the girls are on the verge of giving up when they see Eddie's pet hawk fly overhead. They realise it will lead them home and follow it. Upon arriving home, their elation turns to horror when they discover that the military garrison stationed there has been massacred; the house is ransacked and empty; only Jet, Piper's dog, remains. Eddie is not at the barn where they took shelter either, and although Piper is elated to be home, Daisy breaks down in tears outside. The next day, however, the two hear Jet barking, and Daisy runs out into the woods, where she finds Eddie lying unconscious; he has severe burns, gashes, and his eyes are swollen shut. As she nurses him, a ceasefire is announced, electricity is returned, a new government forms, and the country begins to recover. However, it becomes clear Eddie suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and is mute. After he accidentally cuts himself while gardening, Daisy tenderly sucks the blood from his cut, which mimics his actions earlier. She kisses Eddie, hoping he may soon recover.

One of them was my uncle, Antero \\"Tatay Terong\\" Junia. The two others were Valeriano Abello (Man Yayong) and Vicente Tiston. ... As told us by our elders, the three saw the need to guide the American shelling to Japanese encampments, as Filipinos were being killed from indiscriminate targets of American cannons. Tatay Terong, who organized the signal effort first looked for my father, a sea scout. Unable to find my father, Tatay Terong sought Man Yayong, who knew semaphore signaling. Theirs was a team of sender and reader and a good \\"banker.\\" ... Tiston provided support to the two, more so that they had to sail to the American warships to direct the shelling. They were spotted by the Japanese forces and were attacked with cannon fire. Midway to the warships, a Japanese shell found its mark, capsizing their banca. The three had to swim to the warships. ...in ending, let me remind our keepers of record and storytellers, accuracy should not be sacrificed for drama, or worse, for partisan politics. The monument that reminds scouts of the heroism of these three is most inaccurate if not a comedy of errors. In that monument by the beach, that Man Yayong stands alone and the two others are forgotten, is a distortion of history at best, and a deliberate dishonesty at worst. That Man Yayong is wearing a scout uniform of current vintage is a comedy of errors.Ray L.

The agreement provided that, in the event of non-payment of rent, or the breach of any condition of the lease, the lessor would be entitled to cancel the lease and retake possession of the premises. When the supermarket failed to pay the rental for the month of December 1995, Ntshiqa cancelled the lease agreement and instituted action for the eviction of Andreas Supermarket and payment of the unpaid rental. Throughout the period starting from December 1995, up to and including the date the matter was argued, the supermarket had not paid any rent, contending that it was entitled to a rental remission for two reasons: # Ntshiqa had failed to provide toilet facilities on the premises as it had undertaken to do; and # Ntshiqa had built business premises adjacent to those occupied by the supermarket and diverted electricity from the latter premises to the others, causing frequent power cuts and damage to the supermarket's perishable goods. The supermarket contended accordingly that its use and enjoyment of the business premises had been limited and that this gave rise to its claim for a reduction of the amount of rental. The issue to be decided by the court was whether or not a lessee is entitled to withhold payment of rental on the basis of the contentions set out above. It could not be gainsaid, the court held, that the lessee in this case had undertaken to pay full rental in exchange for, inter alia, being afforded full use and enjoyment of the leased property by the lessor. A tenant pays rental as a consideration for the enjoyment and use of the premises; if a tenant has not had full enjoyment and use of the premises, he was only liable for such rental as accords with such enjoyment and use. Furthermore, the court held, the tenant is not obliged to give up possession of the premises before he may claim a reduction in rental; nor has he to pay the full rental and then reclaim a pro rata portion by way of an action for damages. The court held that both the non-provision of the toilet facilities and the frequent power failures had adversely affected the use and enjoyment of the leased premises. This limited use and enjoyment was of such a nature as to entitle the supermarket to remission of rental. Ntshiqa, therefore, could not claim payment of the full rental if he had not performed his part of the bargain: giving the supermarket full and beneficial occupation of the premises. Furthermore, as the supermarket was not only entitled to remission of rental, but could in fact even raise the exceptio non adimpleti contractus, which \\"applies to all contracts where the obligations of the parties are reciprocal,\\" Ntshiqa was not entitled to cancel the contract. Such purported cancellation amounted to nothing but repudiation of the lease agreement by the applicant. The supermarket, therefore, was entitled as the aggrieved party to elect either to keep the contract in being or to cancel it. The former had been chosen, so the agreement was still of full force.

The NSW government has spent around $400 million for the park. The park is governed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and is listed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. The Parklands begin in the north in the City of Blacktown, cross the City of Fairfield, and end in the City of Liverpool. The parklands, being approximately in size and in length, are one of the largest in the world, and they would feature picnic areas, sports grounds and walking tracks. The parklands attract 430,000 to 790,000 visitors annually.WSPT Annual Visitor Monitoring 2009/2010 In addition, the parkland provided lands for the 2000 Olympic Games. History The Parkland was an area of specialty for the Darug people and it is still deemed as important by the Aboriginal Land Council.RTA (2008) The Western Sydney Regional Aboriginal Heritage Study. NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change The Parkland has been visited by some early settlers, such as Edward Abbott and George Johnson. The Park was originally used for agricultural purposes which included gardening, dairy farming and grazing. The early settlement in the Parklands took place in Prospect in the 1790s. The Parklands were planned in 1968, as Western Sydney needed open space and recreational areas. In the late 1970s, the northern parts of the regional park had areas for rural residential lots (near Horsley Park), though by 1997 they became part of Western Sydney Regional Park. In the year 2000, the parklands supplied venues for the Sydney Olympic Games. The boundaries of the park were completed in 2006. A year later, the walking and cycling track, which meander through the park, was finally finished and opened to public.HASSELL (2010b) Draft Western Sydney Parklands Plan of Management 2010‚Äì2020. Geography The Parklands are formed by a series of connected green spaces, roughly following the western section of the M7 motorway and the M7 cycleway. They form an elongated shape, narrow in the east-west direction. The Parklands are bounded by the M7 motorway in the north, and begin in the suburb of Dean Park in the north, then largely follow the eastern side of the M7 motorway south to reach the M4 Western Motorway, at which point it extends east to incorporate the Prospect Nature Reserve around Prospect Reservoir. The Parklands continue to follow the M7 motorway south, and near Cecil Hills crosses the M7 motorway to incorporate parkland on the western side of the motorway, from where it continues south, and ends in the suburb of Horningsea Park.DECCW (2009), Draft Recovery Plan for the Cumberland Plain. DECCW, Sydney. The park is around long, starting from the suburb of Quakers Hill in the north, to Leppington (Liverpool) in the south, and is located in the heart of the Greater Western Sydney area. It features a conspicuous ridge that runs through it from north to south, providing panoramic views of Greater Western Sydney. Every entrance to the parkland contains prominent planting accompanied by a large signage to indicate access. The Parklands contain the headwaters of Eastern Creek, as a tributary of the Hawkesbury-Nepean. The north-south ridgeline in the Parklands is the catchment boundary between the Hawkesbury-Nepean, Georges River and Parramatta River catchments.NSW NPWS (2001) State of the Parks 2001, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Hurstville. Ecology Flora The Sugarloaf Ridge picnic area and the Australian fauna within its prospect. The park has around 135 hectares of woodland areas, which are remnants of Cumberland Plain Woodland. Most parts of the regional park are made up of 427 hectares of planted re-vegetation and cleared grassland areas. The Parkland's environment has remained very similar to how it was prior European contact. The park consists of 135 hectares of woodland, with the majority comprising 427 hectares of planted vegetation and cleared grassland areas. Until recently, the NSW Government has re-vegetated the area through the Greening Western Sydney Program. The Parkland's revegetation has been going since the early 1990s. The parkland has three types of soil present, with the primary ones being Luddenham soil, which comes from Wianamatta Shale. Tree in the park include, Eucalyptus moluccana, Forest Red Gum, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Eucalyptus crebra, Corymbia, Corymbia maculata, Stringybark and Eucalyptus eugenioides. Shrubs include, Blackthorn, Bursaria spinosa, Themeda triandra, Themeda australis and Microlaena stipoides.DECC (2006) A Vertebrate Fauna Survey of Western Sydney Regional Park. Unpublished report. NPWS, Parramatta. Fauna The Park contains threatened and endangered species which are protected under State and Commonwealth legislation. Wildlife in the parks includes many native species of frogs, birds, lizards and bats. Foxes and rabbits are not rare and not unheard of. The parklands from Quakers Hill, Glendenning & all the way to Bungarribee are home to a large population of Eastern Grey Kangaroos. There is also a substantial Fallow Deer population also. Around eighty native vertebrate species exist within the parkland. Migratory birds are also known to visit. A search by Wildlife Atlas returned the identification of 167 vertebrate fauna species within the Park.NSW NPWS (2002) Native Vegetation of the Cumberland Plain - Final Edition. NPWS, Sydney. One group of birds that is present all year round are the parrots. Many breed in the Parklands' trees are found, such as rainbow lorikeets, rosellas, red-rumped parrots, galahs and cockatoos. Threatened species in the park include, Meridolum corneovirens, Grey-headed flying fox, little eagle, Eastern false pipistrelle, Varied sittella, East-coast free-tailed bat, Common bent-wing bat, R√ºppell's broad-nosed bat and Turquoise parrot. Recreational features The parklands have 16 precincts and 50 park areas. From north to south, the following parks, reserves, geographical features and sporting facilities are incorporated into the Western Sydney Parklands. Most of the precincts below feature picnic and BBQ areas, pathways (for cycling or walking) and children's playgrounds. The most popular picnic areas in the park are Lizard Log, The Dairy and Plough and Harrow.Ecological (2008) Biodiversity Restoration Strategy Western Sydney Parklands. NSW Department of Planning.

Born in Clara, County Kilkenny, Ryan first arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Kilkenny under-21 team, before later joining the intermediate side. He joined the senior panel for the 2011 championship. Ryan has since become a regular member of the team and has won four All-Ireland medals, four Leinster medals and four National Hurling League medals. He captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 2014. He has also captained Kilkenny to Leinster (2014 and 2016) and National Hurling League (2014) successes. At club level Ryan is a two-time championship medallist at senior level with Clara. In addition to this he has also won All- Ireland, Leinster and championship medals in the intermediate grade. Ryan's uncles, Lester and Harry Ryan, also played with Kilkenny. Playing career Club Ryan was just out of the minor grade when he enjoyed his first success with the Clara intermediate hurling team in 2007. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of St. Lachtain's in the championship decider gave him his first winners' medal in that competition. Five years later in 2012, Ryan added a second intermediate championship medal to his collection following a 1‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì4 defeat of St. Patrick's Ballyragget. Clara subsequently faced Oylegate/Glenbrien in the provincial decider. An incredible game followed, which saw Oylgate having four men dismissed for second-yellow card offences. Clara powered to a 3‚Äì20 to 0‚Äì5 victory, with Ryan collecting a Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Clare face London-based St. Gabriel's. Clara were convincing 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì11 winners, with Ryan picking up an All- Ireland Intermediate Club Hurling Championship medal. A year after making the step up to the top flight, Clara faced hot favourites Carrickshock in the senior championship decider in 2013. With four minutes of normal time left, Carrickshock looked the likely winners as they went two points ahead. Clara then won a free with just four minutes left. Ryan took the ball off regular free-taker Keith Hogan and decided to go for goal. Ryan fired to the net from 20 metres with a style similar to Anthony Nash. Two minutes later he popped over a point to extend Clara's lead. A 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì10 victory gave Ryan his first championship medal in the senior grade. Inter-county Ryan made his first impression on the inter-county scene in 2008 as a member of the Kilkenny under-21 team. He won his first Leinster medal that year as Kilkenny trounced Offaly by 2‚Äì21 to 2‚Äì9. Ryan later added an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal following a 2‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì15 defeat of Tipperary in the decider. Kilkenny retained the provincial under-21 crown in 2009 following a 2‚Äì20 to 1‚Äì19 defeat of Dublin, giving Ryan a second Leinster medal in that grade. Kilkenny subsequently had the chance to retain the All-Ireland crown, however, Ryan's side faced a narrow 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 defeat by first time champions Clare. Ryan joined the senior team after the 2011 National Hurling League and was a member of the panel for the subsequent Leinster and All- Ireland victories. The 2012 National Hurling League was Ryan's first full campaign with the Kilkenny senior team, however, a knee cartilage injury after the first two rounds resulted in him facing a month-long lay-off. He was later restored to the starting fifteen and was once again a member of the panel as Kilkenny claimed All-Ireland honours. Ryan was a regular member of the starting fifteen in 2013. He won a National Hurling League medal on the field of play that year as Kilkenny defeated Tipperary by 2‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì20. He finished off the campaign by being named GAA-GPA Hurler of the League. Ryan made his senior championship debut on 9 June 2013 in a 0‚Äì26 to 4‚Äì9 defeat of Offaly. In February 2014 Ryan was appointed captain of the Kilkenny senior hurling team. In the League Final he was introduced as a substitute during the team's 2‚Äì25 to 1‚Äì27 extra-time defeat of Tipperary in the final. It was his second National League medal while he also had the honour of lifting the cup. He made a number of appearances in the championship, including in Kilkenny's 0‚Äì24 to 1‚Äì9 trouncing of Dublin in which he claimed his first Leinster medal on the field of play. On 7 September 2014, Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All- Ireland decider. In what some consider to be the greatest game of all-time, the sides were level when Tipperary were awarded a controversial free. John O'Dwyer had the chance to win the game, however, his late free drifted wide resulting in a draw. The replay on 27 September 2014 was also a close affair. Goals from brothers Richie and John Power inspired Kilkenny to a 2‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì14 victory. It was Ryan's third All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. As the Kilkenny captain is selected by the club champions, captaining Kilkenny twice is a rare feat. Ryan had the unique honour of captaining Kilkenny again in 2016 due to an injury sustained by club mate Shane Prendergast. He lifted the Bob O Keeffe cup for the second time on the 3rd July 2016 when Kilkenny defeated Galway in the provincial decider.

He competed for the Netherlands in the tennis event at the 1908 Summer Olympics where he took part in the men's singles and men's doubles competitions (partnering with his brother Christiaan). Tennis family and career Roelof was born on 3 October 1876 to Christiaan van Lennep and his second wife Charlotta Louise K√ºpfer. Roelof had six siblings, and a half- sister, including Madzy, Christine, August Willem and Christiaan van Lennep, all of whom later got involved in tennis . In 1895 he and his family founded the Hilversumsche Lawn Tennisclub in their own house. Some years after they established three cement courts. His sister Christine was appointed the club's treasurer. His brother August Willem won the national championships in 1903 but died young, at the age of only 24, in 1908 in London. His sister Madzy won the ladies' doubles three consecutive times (1889‚Äì1901) and the mixed two consecutive time (1899‚Äì1900, partnering Karel Beukema) both streaks started from the inaugural championships. His brother Christiaan was the most successful amongst them winning the singles on six occasions, the doubles seven times (1904, 1905, 1907, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1923). His breakthrough came when in 1904 he won a triple crown at the Haarlem International Championships (partnering Emilie Dolleman and J. F. Sol). In the same month he reached the finals of the Dutch International Championships in Scheveningen with his brother Christiaan but fell to Wylie Cameron Grant and Irving Wright. On top of that he became the triple crown national champion of the Netherlands after he copied his brother, August's singles feat from last year then claimed the doubles with Christiaan and finished the day with the mixed title partnering Louise Dolleman. Next year he was able to defend his doubles titles only losing the singles to Christiaan. In 1909 he won the mixed national championships after a three-year hiatus partnering Loes Everts. In 1910 he regained his national doubles title alongside Gerard Scheurleer. In 1911 he booked his last national title in the doubles teaming up with Adolf Broese van Groenou. Personal life Roelof was a soccer supporter as well and was the founding member of the Hilversumsche Footballclub 'T Gooi in 1889, first football club in Hilversum.

An English translation, titled Soda Pop, is due for release by Gecko Press in 2017. This edition features new illustrations by Lisen Adb√•ge. Plot summary The story is about a boy, Masarin, and his dad, Loranga, who live together in a house. Out in the woodshed lives Masarin's grandfather, Dartanjang, who is hypochondriac (and suffering from slight dementia). Loranga, constantly wearing a robe and a floral tea cozy on his head, is a childish and irresponsible bohemian. Therefore, Masarin is usually the responsible one; for example, he is the one taking care of his great-grandfather who thinks he is a cuckoo and lives at the top of a pine tree in the forest. Masarin is not disturbed by this; he is delighted with the fact that his dad is playing silly games with him. For example, they often play hockey with an overripe tomato. Other characters in the book are Gustav the Thief, the Angry Old Man and the Hot Dog Vendor.

He was most notable for competing in the Shellsport International Series in 1976 and 1977, and for running the DC Cook Motorsports team in the 1990s. He also ran the DC Cook Direct dealership, prior to his death in a car crash in 2005. Racing career In 1974, Derek Cook entered four rounds of the Southern Organs British Formula Atlantic, driving a Chevron B27-Hart/Ford, and finished twentieth overall, without scoring a point. For 1975, he entered a round of the BARC F3 Championship (with a GRD 374), but did not compete, whilst he entered eight rounds of the Southern Organs British Formula Atlantic (finishing tenth, with seven points), and nine rounds of the John Player British Formula Atlantic (finishing 16th, with 25 points), using both a Chevron B27, and a March 75B-Ford during the season. He moved into the Shellsport International Series for 1976, completing three races in the Chevron, whilst he also competed in three races of the Indylantic Championship (a new series, being the result of the merger of the two British Formula Atlantic competitions) with that car, without scoring any points in either competition. For 1977, he entered a single round of the European Formula Two Championship, and six races of the Shellsport International Series, taking eighth place overall in the latter championship, with 22 points, in what proved to be his last competitive season of racing. His solitary F2 race was at the Daily Express International Trophy, held at Silverstone Circuit, where he finished 11th in the Chevron, of 12 finishers. Dealership In 1988, Cook formed his DC Cook chain of dealers. In 1996, the franchise made a turnover of ¬£180 million, with pre-tax profits of ¬£5 million ‚Äì with the capital return being 2.77%, a figure well above the industry average. Following this record profit, the company set about expanding, with the aim of increasing turnover to ¬£400 million. This, however, would prove unsuccessful; although turnover had increased to ¬£337 million by 1999, an internet venture between DC Cook and Totalise Eurekar came at a point when the main portion of the dealership were beginning to enter difficulties, and in 2000, the share price had fallen to 9p (having been as high as 54p in 1998), with shares being suspended. The company then entered receivership in 2001, with debts totaling ¬£27 million, with receivers stating \\"after rapid expansion the dealer failed to bed down its new acquisitions. The rationalisation of the past two years did not work and the company collapsed under a debt burden of ¬£27m\\". Following the collapse of DC Cook, the Cook family started DC Cook Direct, which sold discounted new cars. However, a year prior to his death, this company also encountered difficulties; following complaints by customers, South Yorkshire Trading Standards Service cancelled the company's membership of a fair business scheme. In 2008, DC Cook Direct entered liquidation, with the company being run by his daughter, Paula. In addition to the formation of DC Cook Direct, Derek Cook had also formed Motor Solutions in 2002, an online discount dealer of new and used cars, which was later sold to Virgin Group (with Virgin taking a 53% stake, and keeping Cook on as the chief executive), and renamed as Virgin Cars, before its closure in January 2006, seven months after Cook's death. Racing team In the mid 1990s, DC Cook Motorsports was the auto racing branch of the DC Cook company. They had several drivers, both family members and non-family, and were most notable for their British Touring Car Championship and International Formula 3000 entries, with Guy Smith, later to win the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving for the team in the 1997 British Formula Three season, being their most notable driver. The team were forced to cease their activities partway through the 1999 season, as the parent company had developed financial difficulties.

(Archive). Bloomberg Businessweek. Retrieved on September 22, 2013. \\"2148, oazanagakura karuizawa-machi Kitasaku, 389-0111 Japan\\" Founded in 1904 by Kuniji Hoshino as a forestry business in Karuizawa, in the Japanese Alps, it opened its first hot spring resort in 1914. Rebranded by Yoshiharu Hoshino in 1995 as Hoshino Resorts, it has expanded across Japan and Asia with an eco- friendly policy, use of organic local produce at its restaurants, self- sufficient energy usage, and a theme of traditional Japanese-style resort accommodation. Part of the company's original theme is what Japan would be like if it continued to modernize without the influence of the West. Hoshino Resorts has also developed its bridal business through Hotel Bleston Court, a real estate leasing business, and its food business. Noriyuki Hamada, Executive Chef of Bleston Court Yukawatan restaurant in Karuizawa became the first ever Japanese chef to be recognised at the Bocuse d'Or in January 2013, winning third prize, while Hoshinoya Kyoto chef Ichiro Kubota earned a Michelin Star in October 2012.The Water Garden at Hoshinoya Kyoto  History  Hoshino Resorts began life in 1904, as a forestry business in Karuizawa, which had just begun to become popular as a location for holiday villas. Founder Kuniji Hoshino then opened the first Hoshino Onsen Ryokan ten years later in 1914. As natural hot springs were uncovered in the area, Karuizawa became a center for 1920s culture, attracting some of the most notable authors, poets and feminists of the period such as T≈çson Shimazaki, Kanz≈ç Uchimura, Akiko Yosano, and Hakush≈´ Kitahara to the \\"Liberal Education of Art Workshop\\" held in the area. It began its policy towards energy self- sufficiency as early as 1929, with the opening of its first hydroelectric power plant. Hoshino Onsen Ryokan circa 1930s Yoshimasa Hoshino, the second generation heir, was influenced by Showa era poet and ornithologist Godo Nakanishi, who commented that \\"Until now it has been customary to eat wild birds, but from hereonafter, we will enter a phase in which people will find enjoyment in watching them.\\" Hoshino Onsen Ryokan then began its first guided nature tours, called \\"Tancho-kai\\", establishing Japan's first National Wild Bird Forest in 1974 in Karuizawa, and evolving its tours into the 1992 established the Picchio Wildlife Research Center, awarded the first ever \\"Eco- Tourism\\" Grand Prize in Japan by the Ministry of Environment on June 5, 2005. The second half of the 20th century, from the post-war depression through to the increase of international travel, caused a decline in interest in many traditional ryokan. Hoshino Onsen Ryokan rebranded itself as Hoshino Resorts in 1995 when current president, and fourth-generation family member, took the helm. Since 1999, the company has pursued aims to produce zero-emissions resorts, and acquired multiple properties across Japan that had struggled since the 1980s economic bubble burst. It has refurbished, rebranded and incorporated most of its properties into one of its three brands, whilst constructing new properties from scratch in Okinawa and soon in Marunouchi, Tokyo, for its premier Hoshinoya brand. Current business activities Hoshino Resorts is currently led by fourth-generation family heir Yoshiharu Hoshino. Born in Karuizawa in 1960, the Keio University graduate went on to Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, obtaining a Masters of Management in Hospitality. He was appointed president of Hoshino Onsen in 1991, but fired six months later when his initial ideas to rejuvenate the business failed. He was recalled in 1995 and has led the company since, further being selected as the first \\"Charisma of Tourism\\" by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in 2003. During the initial stages of Yoshiharu Hoshino's management, he first restructured the company, reducing family members on the company board so that more than half would be outsiders brought in on an evaluation system; \\"The staff worked in poor conditions and the Hoshino family seemed to have special rights,\\" he told the Financial Times. By employing university graduates who themselves can present ideas such as eco-tourism, the company has seen a quick reversal from a period of high staff turnover, to a highly sought after employer with a merit-based remuneration system. Yo-Ho Brewing Company Yo-Ho Brewing, one of Japan's leading producers of craft beer, was established as a subsidiary of Hoshino Resort Company in 1996. With brewing facilities based in Karuizawa, the company produces a range of traditional beer styles. In September 2014 30% of the company was sold to Kirin Beer, the two breweries agreeing to cooperate in business areas such as shipping, marketing, procurement and product development.  Brands  Hoshino Resorts has developed three separate hospitality brands over the years aimed at different demographics. Besides its flagship Hoshinoya brand, it also operates the KAI brand and Risonare.  Hoshinoya  The Hoshinoya brand (Êòü„ÅÆ„ÇÑ), Êòü„ÅÆ„ÇÑ represents Hoshino Resort's flagship properties, currently six, including: Hoshinoya Kyoto (in Arashiyama), Hoshinoya Okinawa (on Taketomi island) and the original Hoshinoya Karuizawa. All represent the company's dedication to luxurious traditional Japanese hospitality with modern elements. Hoshinoya Fuji opened in 2015. Hoshinoya Tokyo, the fifth flagship resort and first to be constructed inside a major city, is located in downtown Marunouchi. The property was announced on March 5, 2013, and opened in July 2016. Hoshinoya Bali in Ubud opened in early 2017. Hoshinoya Karuizawa and Kyoto have both been members of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World (SLH) group since December 2009.  KAI  Kai Kaga, originally built in the early 17th century The Kai brand, is a chain of authentic onsen, natural hot spring resorts with a style of traditional Japan which serve kaiseki cuisine featuring local ingredients in each property. Targeted towards couples and women, it currently operates resorts in Aso, Atami, Kaga, Hakone, It≈ç, Izumo, Matsumoto, Tsugaru, and Kai Alps near the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. The brand was launched in 2011. Kai Kaga is typical of the Hoshino Resort strategy of finding existing properties and refurbishing them in traditional style with modern design elements. Originally built in the 1630s, the ryokan faces a restored communal bathhouse known as Kosoyu, and has undergone renovation since being acquired. Its rooms have been adapted to washitsu Japanese style, with zaisu (legless) chairs, while the spa, inspired by local peasant Imohori Togoro, who first discovered gold in the area, offers gold-leaf facial treatments. Kai Hakone, built in 1987 and acquired in 2012, combines paper screens and tatami mats in its rooms with modern sofas and kakejiku by Gallery Tsuyuki. It also provides performances of Kamishibai, folk tales about yosegi-kaizu told using paper scrolls.  Risonare  Risonare, is Hoshino Resorts' modern accommodation, designed to be stylish and appealing for families, and often offering a range of sports activities. Properties include Risonare Tomamu offering skiing in central Hokkaido, Risonare Kohamajima offering golf and windsurfing in southern Okinawa, Risonare Yatsugatake located in a wine region in central Honshu, and Risonare Atami, a seaside hot-spring resort south of Tokyo.  Other  Other brands include Omo and BEB.  Notable properties   Hoshinoya Karuizawa  Hoshino Resorts' original property is located in Karuizawa, an area of Nagano Prefecture, under Mount Asama, first deemed fit as a resort and villa spot in the late 19th century by foreign missionaries like British/Canadian theologian Alexander Croft Shaw in (1886). Emperor Akihito met his wife Michiko in the area, and it is the only place in the world to have hosted both summer and winter Olympic events. Hoshinoya Karuizawa is located on the banks of the Yukawa river. First opened in 1914, it was closed in 1995 for ten years by Yoshiharu Hoshino, before being reopened as Hoshinoya Karuizawa in 2005, the first eco-resort in Japan. The resort and its 'Tombo- no-yu' hot springs are powered by geothermal heat from the volcanos in the surrounding topography. This, as well as hydroelectricity from mountain streams, provides the energy for the rest of the resort's power. The property is Hoshino's first to achieve the policy aim of zero-emissions. The property has 77 rooms, two hot-spring baths and a chaya tea room.  Hoshinoya Kyoto  The second Hoshinoya, opened in 2009, is the former home of wealthy merchant Ryoi Suminokura (1554‚Äì1614). Suminokura is remembered mostly for creating the Takase River canal that runs through Kyoto, completed in 1611 and allowing goods to be transported to the then capital. His secluded home was constructed on the banks of the ≈åi River in the forests of Arashiyama, famed for its bamboo. The \\"riverside sanctuary\\" is reached by a small private wooden boat ride of ten minutes and retains its 19th-century wood-framed buildings, with 25 tatami-mat rooms, a library, and two gardens. Temple bells ring upon the arrival of each guest, and its moss-traced stone walkways are lit by iron lanterns. The rooms have been noted for both their natural location, visited by wild monkeys, surrounded by cherry trees, and bathed in natural light, but also for their traditional style, with hinoki cypress wood bathtubs, heated chestnut-wood floors, and wallpaper made by Kyoto craftsmen from hand-printed woodblocks (karakami). The kaiseki restaurant, run by Executive Chef Ichiro Kubota and focusing on local, seasonal and sustainable ingredients, was awarded a Michelin Star in October 2012. Kubota previously held a Michelin Star as head chef of London's Umu restaurant.  Hoshinoya Taketomi Island  Traditional style villas of Hoshinoya Taketomijima on Taketomi Island Opened in 2012, Hoshinoya Taketomi Island is the only resort on the island of Taketomi Island (part of the Yaeyama Islands group), a 2.4 square mile island with 342 inhabitants, 1,200 miles southwest of Tokyo. One of the last vestiges of the former Ryukyu Kingdom to retain its long-held identity, local village chiefs approval was needed before the complex could be built. When it was, it was under strict rules to respect the architectural style of the island, with only single-tier structures eventually approved and constructed. The property consists of 48 wood-structure villas arranged as a mini-village with stone walls, prominent Shisa displayed upon rooftops, and a lobby live-house where locals perform music on traditional sanshin. It was selected for three awards in the May 2013 edition of the Conde Nast Traveler \\"Best New Hotels in the World\\"; \\"Best New Hotels to Splurge On\\", \\"World's Most Romantic New Hotels\\", and \\"Amazing Pools at the Best New Hotels\\".

Majority of the students at the university are the youth, an age at risk of contracting HIV or falling in the trap of drug abusers. Aware of this risk the university has put up an AIDS control unit (ACU) which coordinates programs and activities to fight the challenges of HIV/AIDS. The ACU is supported by a committee which addresses the challenges of alcohol and drug abuse within the University. The ACU trains Peer Educators/counselors drawn from students and distributed in the halls of residence and programs of study. They identify emerging cases and offer support before referring the cases to professional counselors. Every semester the ACU arranges for HIV/AIDS weeks to provide counseling and testing services.

Established in May 2011, the LEP covers the geographical boundaries of the local authorities of Birmingham, Bromsgrove, Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Redditch, Solihull, Tamworth and Wyre Forest. Its board is made up of representatives from the public and private sectors, in addition to skills providers. The interim chair of the GBSLEP Board is Steve Hollis, former Midlands Chairman of KPMG and Aston Villa. This followed the resignation of Andy Street, now former Managing Director of John Lewis, who stood down from the position in September 2016 after serving since 2011 in order to seek the Conservative nomination for Mayor of the West Midlands. Since January 2013, the GBSLEP has been working with Lord Heseltine on proposals to create a Single Local Growth Fund to enable LEPs to accelerate economic development. In May 2013, the GBSLEP published its growth plan for Greater Birmingham, titled The Strategy for Growth: Delivering Growth.  Geography and economic data  The LEP area covers the LEP covers the geographical boundaries of the local authorities of Birmingham, Bromsgrove, Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Redditch, Solihull, Tamworth and Wyre Forest. In total, the LEP area - consisting of the Birmingham and Solihull core, along with Southern Staffordshire and Northern Worcestershire - has as a population of nearly two million, contains 835,000 jobs and has a GVA of about ¬£34 billion. The core area of Birmingham and Solihull have a population of 1.23 million and contain many of the economic drivers of the conurbation such as Birmingham Airport, Birmingham city centre, four major universities and international meeting places such as the National Exhibition Centre. Southern Staffordshire comprises the four local authority areas to the north: Cannock Chase, Lichfield, Tamworth and East Staffordshire (based upon Burton and Uttoxeter). It has a population of 380,000 with considerable numbers commuting to and from Birmingham. Northern Worcestershire comprises three local authority areas to the south of Birmingham ‚Äì Redditch, Bromsgrove and Wyre Forest (based upon Kidderminster). It has a population of 270,000 and has a similar relationship to Birmingham and Solihull as that of Southern Staffordshire. There is considerable commuting into Birmingham and Solihull, but also commuting out from the core city.  Birmingham City Centre Enterprise Zone  The Birmingham City Centre Enterprise Zone is one of the major projects for the GBSLEP, with the potential to create 40,000 new jobs, add ¬£2 billion a year to the economy and make available 1.3 million sq metres of floorspace over the lifetime of the project. Birmingham City Centre Enterprise Zone, comprises 26 sites across the city centre covering 68 hectares in seven clusters at Westside, Snow Hill District, Eastside, Southern Gateway, Digbeth Creative Quarter, Birmingham Science Park Aston and the Jewellery Quarter. These sites are focussed on the business and financial services, Information and Communication Technology, creative industries and digital media sectors which are already clustered in the city centre and present significant growth opportunities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, formally launched the prospectus detailing the investment sites in March 2013.  The Greater Birmingham Project  In March 2012 the UK Prime Minister David Cameron asked former Deputy Prime Minister, The Rt Hon the Lord Heseltine of Thenford, to report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and the Secretary of State for Business Vince Cable as to how wealth might be more effectively created in the UK. The Chancellor announced the terms of the review on 21 March 2012 and offered the support of a cross departmental team of officials to assist in the task. The result was ‚ÄòNo Stone Unturned‚Äô ‚Äì a report with a national scope that included 89 recommendations by Lord Heseltine and focused on the way that changes in Government organisation and funding could be beneficial to driving localised growth, particularly in the cities. The report was launched at Birmingham Town Hall on October 30, 2012 with GBSLEP Chair Andy Street and Birmingham City Council Leader Sir Albert Bore joining Lord Heseltine to outline the report. The document received significant support from the business community and, in particular, Local Enterprise Partnerships, which were identified as powerful drivers of economic growth in the report. Following the launch at Birmingham's Town Hall, the GBSLEP approached Lord Heseltine and asked him if they could work together to explore the opportunities that could arise in Greater Birmingham if the economic recommendations in ‚ÄòNo Stone Unturned‚Äô were implemented. The Prime Minister gave his support to the project, saying that he was delighted that business and civic leaders wanted to come together to consider and plan the economic and commercial future of the region in light of Lord Heseltine's report. Work began immediately following a launch event for the Greater Birmingham Project on 3 January 2013, following which more than 200 economic development partners across Greater Birmingham inputted into the report. On 17 March 2013, in advance of the Chancellor's Budget, Lord Heseltine presented the results of his work with stakeholders in Greater Birmingham. This report, the Greater Birmingham Project: The Path To Local Growth outlined how the GBSLEP would take forward the proposals contained in ‚ÄòNo Stone Unturned‚Äô.

He played for Auckland, and won the Ranfurly Shield in his first ever provincial game. After gaining All Blacks selection in 1952, Davis toured with the team to Europe and North America in 1953‚Äì54. He played extensively for New Zealand MƒÅori between 1952 and his retirement in 1959; his time with the team included matches against both South Africa and the British Lions. Davis was awarded the Tom French Cup for MƒÅori player of the year in 1952, 1953 and 1954.  Early career  Keith Davis was born in Whakatane and educated at Sacred Heart College in Auckland, where he played for the first XV from 1947‚Äì49. He was half-back, and was selected for Auckland in 1952 after making a number of appearances for the Auckland B side in 1951 and early 1952. Davis' first provincial game was a Ranfurly Shield challenge against Waikato that Auckland won 9‚Äì0 to raise the Shield. The side's first defence was against Waikato two weeks later; with Waikato avenging their loss to regain the Shield following a 6‚Äì3 victory. Davis was selected for the New Zealand MƒÅori in early 1952, and played with them during their internal-tour of New Zealand. He was subsequently selected for the New Zealand national side‚Äîthe All Blacks‚Äîlater that year. He made his Test debut against Australia on 13 September 1952, a match that the All Blacks won 15‚Äì8. At the conclusion of the 1952 season he was awarded the Tom French Cup for MƒÅori player of the year.  1953‚Äì54 European tour  In 1953 Davis was selected as one of the half-backs for the All Blacks' tour of Europe and North America. He was preferred over his cousin, Vincent Bevan, as the starting half-back for the All Blacks' five Tests. Of the five Test matches‚Äîagainst England, France, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales‚Äîthe All Blacks won three; their two losses coming to France and Wales. Davis also played in the All Blacks last match of the British and Irish leg of their tour‚Äîagainst Barbarian F.C. in Cardiff. The All Blacks were behind 5‚Äì3 at the end of the first half, but after a Davis try early in the second half to give them a 6‚Äì3 lead, before a conversion by Ron Jarden. The All Blacks scored a further three tries, with the final one set up by Davis, to eventually win 19‚Äì5. He was All Black number 546.  New Zealand MƒÅori and later career  After returning from tour, Davis was selected to captain the New Zealand MƒÅori tour of Fiji in 1954. Before leaving for Fiji, the team played six matches against provincial teams in New Zealand. The eight match tour of Fiji included three matches against Fiji; the team won seven of their matches, with the one loss to Fiji in Lautoka. The following year Davis was recalled for one Test match against Australia that the All Blacks won 8‚Äì0. He did not play any of the All Blacks' matches against the 1956 Springboks, but was a reserve in two Tests of the series. The most important New Zealand MƒÅori match of the season was against the touring Springboks‚ÄîDavis was selected at half-back. The match was lost 37‚Äì0, and has been tainted by accusations that Ernest Corbett, the MƒÅori Affairs Minister at the time, had asked the New Zealanders to lose the match. However some members of the MƒÅori side have disputed that Corbett even spoke to their team. The match was described by historian Lindsay Knight as \\"one of the worst experiences in his [Davis's] career\\". Davis toured with the MƒÅori to Australia in 1958, and played all three \\"Test\\" matches against Australia. Australia won the first Test, but the second Test resulted in a 3‚Äì3 draw. However the MƒÅori recovered to win the final Test 13‚Äì6 to draw the series. On returning to New Zealand, Davis was selected for the All Blacks for the last time. He played in three Tests against the touring Australians; the series was won by the All Blacks two Tests to one. He was not selected for the All Blacks again, and finished his career with 25 games for the side, including 10 Tests. 1959 was Davis' final season of first-class rugby. He finished his career for Auckland, and played for the MƒÅori against the touring British Lions. The New Zealanders lost the game 12‚Äì6, but did prevent the Lions from scoring any tries‚Äîthe only time this was achieved on tour. After retiring from rugby Davis continued to be involved as a coach and selector with both his club side Marist, and also the MƒÅori All Blacks in the 1960s. He was eventually awarded his Test cap at a capping ceremony in 2010, 58 years after first playing for the All Blacks. Davis died on 2 March 2019.

The game is run by the Northern Territory Rugby Union, composed of representatives from clubs, regional rugby unions, referees, and affiliated bodies for schools and junior rugby. There is no professional rugby team based in NT but the annual Hottest 7s tournament held in Darwin draws teams from around Australia and overseas, and awards prize money to the winners. History of rugby union in the Northern Territory The rugby union competition in Darwin was started in the reconstruction phase following Cyclone Tracy. A New Zealander named David Cooper advertised for other interested players which led to the founding of the Northern Territory Rugby Union in 1975. The first Darwin club rugby competition match was played on 2 October 1976 at Alawa Oval between the South Darwin Rabbitohs and the RSL Dragons (now the Darwin Dragons). From 1983 onward, the Bushratz RUFC from Jabiru played in the Darwin 2nd grade competition, and also briefly in the Katherine competition in 2009. However, due to a shortage of player numbers (as of 2013), the club no longer takes part in these competitions. In 1984, the Alice Springs club competition was started by the Central Australian Rugby Union. The Katherine club competition was established by the Katherine Rugby Union in 1987. Katherine also later briefly fielded a composite team in the Darwin competition, but found the logistics associated with the travel distance difficult to sustain. In 1989, the inaugural Territory 7s tournament was held in Darwin and won by Fijian team Duavata. The annual tournament was renamed the Hottest 7s in 2005, and the organizers in 2013 claimed it was the richest rugby sevens tournament in the Southern Hemisphere with a prize pool of $65,000. The East Arnhem Rugby Union was created in Nhulunbuy in 2004, with a junior rugby competition played during the Dry Season between April and August. Teams from East Arnhem (initially under the name of Gove Rugby) have regularly entered tournaments such as the Darwin Hottest 7s and Singapore CC 7s. Club competitions Darwin The Darwin club rugby competition runs from March to September since switching from Wet Season to Dry Season in 2003, and is administered by the Northern Territory Rugby Union. There are six clubs based in the Darwin metropolitan area that have 1st and 2nd grade open teams, and juniors from under 7 to under 17. Some clubs also have a women‚Äôs team. * Casuarina Cougars * Darwin Dragons * Palmerston Crocs * South Darwin Rabbitohs * Swampdogs * University Pirates Alice Springs The Alice Springs club rugby competition runs over the summer from November to April and is administered by the Central Australian Rugby Union.

The senior men's team is known as the Mosquitoes and the senior women's team is known as the Goannas. Team colours are ochre, black and white. The Mosquitoes competed in the Australian Rugby Shield prior to the cancellation of the competition after the 2008 season.

Facts Benlou Properties (the lessor) and Vector Graphics (the lessee) entered into a lease agreement. Clause 8.5 entitled Benlou Properties to recover 74.4 per cent of any increase in its expenditure on certain items from Vector Graphics. Approximately two years after the conclusion of the agreement, Vector Graphics sought an order to declare the clause invalid, contending * that the amounts payable in terms of clause 8.5 constituted additional rent; * that such amounts were not determined in, nor determinable from, the written agreement; and * that clause 8.5, and consequently the entire agreement, was accordingly void. The court a quo held that a number of the provisions of clause 8.5, read with certain other clauses, were invalid because they conferred a discretion on Benlou Properties to determine various costs and charges, of which a substantial portion would have to be borne by Vector Graphics. Appeal On appeal, the court noted the issue to be this: May the parties to a lease validly agree that, as part of his obligation to pay rent, the tenant has to contribute to circumscribed expenditure incurred by the landlord in his discretion? The court held that Benlou Properties' discretion to determine the extent of the respondent's liability under the provisions of clause 8.5 was subject to three qualifications: # that only a defined share (74.4 per cent) of the increased expenditure could be recovered from Vector Graphics; # that such expenditure had actually to be incurred by Benlou Properties, in the sense of an increased contractual liability towards a third party; and # that Vector Graphics was only obliged to contribute to increased expenditure incurred by Benlou Properties after the date of commencement of negotiations in respect of certain specified items. The court noted that the Roman-Dutch authorities regarded a lease in terms of which the rent was to be determined by the lessor or lessee, in his unfettered discretion, as invalid. This, however, was not the situation in casu, inasmuch as Benlou Properties could not, in terms of clause 8.5, unilaterally and simply of its own volition, impose an obligation upon Vector Graphics. It had first to bind itself to a third party and so incur contractual liability. Furthermore, the rule that the determination of rent could not be left to one of the parties had to be confined to the situation where the determination depended entirely upon the unfettered will of that party. There was also no policy reason why an undertaking by one party to compensate the other for expenditure to be incurred by the latter, albeit in his discretion, should necessarily be invalid. Since it was clear that Vector Graphics's liability under clause 8.5 was not determined by increased expenditure incurred in the unfettered discretion of Benlou Properties, it was unnecessary to decide whether Vector Graphics was liable to contribute to increased expenditure which was objectively reasonable, or to such expenditure incurred arbitrio boni viri because, on either construction, the provisions of clause 8.5 were unobjectionable. The appeal was allowed, therefore, with costs.  See also  * South African law of lease  References  * Benlou Properties (Pty) Ltd v Vector Graphics (Pty) Ltd 1993 (1) SA 179 (A).

Plans The initiative was a response by the municipality of The Hague to the scrapping of the hourly Beneluxtrein service in December 2012 in favour of the ill-fated Fyra V250, which in its brief life used the new HSL-Zuid line between Schiphol and Rotterdam and bypassed Den Haag HS, Dordrecht, Roosendaal and Mechelen. The proposed service would have run 16 times a day and would have offered the new features of starting at Den Haag Centraal and also serving Delft and Zaventem airport.http://www.mobimix.be/inhoud/2013/3/19/3689 The Hague pointed out that it is the Netherlands‚Äô political centre and the home of many international organisations, and therefore needs a direct link with the EU institutions in Brussels. It contacted various railway companies, and established the company The Hague Trains Holding B.V. to start negotiations with the Dutch and Belgian infrastructure companies ProRail and Infrabel respectively. The train paths requested would eventually be transferred to the operating company that won the contract. The municipality would commission feasibility studies and facilitate the project, but explicitly said that it had no intention to subsidise, guarantee or operate the service itself. Competition rules Although public transport in the Netherlands and Belgium, in principle, should only be carried out by holders of a concession, the Dutch Passenger Transport Act 2000 makes an exception for cross-border rail services. EU directive 91/440 permits international trains to operate outside a concession, as long as they carry very few domestic passengers. The Netherlands applies this European directive very strictly. The Dutch passengers' organisation Rover objected to the European Commission about this restrictive application of the directive, and negotiations were held with Nederlandse Spoorwegen and the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment. The service would also have to obtain clearance in Belgium, where case law exists on this topic. DB Fernverkehr‚Äôs ICE Cologne‚ÄìBrussels service initially did not carry domestic passengers between Brussels and Li√®ge. Later this was allowed with a separate ticket while domestic tickets from SNCB/NMBS were not valid on the ICE. Now this is possible with a surcharge. Status The old Beneluxtrein. The temporary intercity train between The Hague and Brussels The hourly Beneluxtrein ran between Brussels and The Hague (and on to Amsterdam) until 8 December 2012. After a period of chaos during which passengers had no option but to use the expensive Thalys or the ancient and unreliable stopping train from Antwerp to Roosendaal, a temporary intercity Brussels‚ÄìThe Hague service was re-established on 16 February 2013. The Dutch Competition Authority accepted and published the plans on 27 February 2013, in order to give the existing concessionaires, concession grantors and administrator the opportunity to establish the objective of the proposal and whether it threatened the existing concessionaire's (the NS's) ‚Äòeconomic balance‚Äô.https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2013-4907.html Feasibility The launch of the service depended not only on the outcome of the feasibility studies, but also on the resolution of the following issues: * agreement with the Netherlands and Belgium (this is basically not needed because international rail travel is a free market, but there are limitations on the carrying of domestic travellers to protect the national railway concessions) * the permits required * legal and administrative procedures * planning procedures of ProRail and Infrabel * the appointment of an operator, after going to tender and resolving any appeals * the purchase or lease of adequate trains * the appointment and training of crew The outcome of this process was that the service was not launched. Eventually the hourly Brussels- Amsterdam service via the Hague HS was restarted; it connects in Rotterdam with the high-speed Intercity Direct service to Amsterdam bypassing The Hague.

She made her first screen appearance on the 1 May 2013. She was introduced as close friend to established character, Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing), who had returned after working in New York. Her storylines have focused on her relationships including her lesbian fling with Nicole Miller (Sally Martin) and the most notable being her love triangle with characters Boyd Rolleston (Sam Bunkall) and Drew McCaskill (Ben Barrington). Her most recent storylines have seen her suffer from Addison's Disease, and try to battle for Billie's custody after separating from Drew McCaskill, but was later put on hold as she was discovered to have an aggressive brain tumour that need to be removed.  Creation and casting  To mark the show's 21st anniversary, 4 new young characters were introduced in an attempt to revamp the show, with the characters of Harper, Dayna Jenkins (Lucy Elliott), Dallas Adams (Cameron Jones) being created alongside the return of Henry Lee (Peter Huang) in a more prominent role. Ria Vandervis was cast as new emergency department Doctor, Harper Whitley. Vandervis was originally hired under a 6-month recurring contract that was later extended to a regular role. Vandervis originally commuted between Dunedin and Auckland for filming. She struggled with the extension due to personal relationship issues and considered quitting the show. Like Vandervis herself, Harper is described as \\"straight talking\\", \\"ambiguous\\" and \\"mysterious\\". She was introduced as friend from medical school to existing character Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing). The character had left New Zealand to pursue her career in Australia and then ended up in New York. At first people are suspicious of why she had returned to New Zealand and is described to be \\"vague\\" on the subject. Vandervis commented in an interview with the Otago Daily Times; She's an alpha female and uber confident and used to getting what she wants, which causes conflicts, She's also hiding a secret and doesn't want that to come up. When Vandervis first joined the cast she found it demanding commenting; It was terrifying. You get chucked in the deep end. We shoot an episode a day, so you've got 20 minutes to do a scene. You just try try get your words right and hit the mark. You're a little cog in a big machine.  Storylines  Harper arrived at Shortland Street shortly after returning from a mysterious past in New York, supposedly to visit best friend Sarah (Amanda Billing). However the two were at odds when she took Sarah's job at the hospital and began to date her ex-husband TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell). It later turned out Harper had fled a high up criminal family in America that she was set to marry into. When her fianc√© arrived, she briefly considered running away with him but decided to stay in New Zealand. Harper soon discovered she was in love with TK despite his reconciliation with Sarah but shocked all when she began to date Nicole (Sally Martin). The relationship was short-lived and Harper was devastated when Sarah died leading her to seek comfort with TK again, entering into a temporary relationship. However, advances from sensitive doctor Boyd Rolleston (Sam Bunkall) lead to a new more measured romance. Strains became apparent in the steadiness of the relationship however and after investing in a motorbike, Harper met rugged new doctor Drew McCaskill (Ben Barrington) and despite being engaged to Boyd, Harper left him after Drew was shot. Taking on more responsibility at the hospital through management positions, Harper moved in with Drew. Harper continues an unsteady relationship with Drew. Ashley, her cousin arrives in Ferndale after her mother dies and Harper becomes her legal guardian. She later marries Drew, but Ashley dies after hitting the back of her head on the back of a seat whilst in an argument with a tearaway named Olive. Harper reveals to Drew that she terminated a pregnancy to him, much to Drew's dismay, he then goes and has sex with friend and colleague Kylie Warner (Kerry-Lee Dewing) after she learns that her husband is a bigamist. However, after they reconciled and Harper was pregnant again, Drew took more responsibility, offering to take a year off work to be a stay-at-home dad, however, because Harper's initial insistence on home birth, she played a prank on him within an hour before actually giving birth. On August 8, Billy was born. The baby is an intersex child. She also named Nicole Miller as the godmother, while Boyd Rolleston, who delivered the baby was named as the godfather by Drew McCaskill, who missed the delivery as he was still reeling over her faking childbirth less than an hour ago. In October, she separated from Drew after he 'selfishly' gave up a liver to save Damo Johnson's life, and suffer from Addison's Disease. On October 23‚Äì24, however, her seizures and dizzy spell become more frequent and severe, leading to a brain tumour diagnosis. Despite it being benign, and her initially opting for chemotherapy, her seizure and collapse got so bad that it needed immediate surgical removal. Harper's relationship continued to dwindle after Drew was sent to prison for tax evasion, invaded her hobby of boxing, and asserted Billy's 'real' gender. Everything came to a head when, after claiming Leanne's lost lottery ticket for $4 million, Drew admitted that he knew and didn't return the money. He had also lied about a major loan for the IV Bar that was already collapsing due to health code violations. Harper finally decided that enough was enough and broke things off with Drew, only to agree to couples counselling the next episode.  Character development   Relationships  = Boyd Rolleston = Whilst in a relationship with Boyd, she goes on a motorcycle trip and stops at a pub only to meet Drew. Her attraction towards him \\"scares\\" her and she returns to Ferndale straight away. Upon her return, she proposes to Boyd, but shortly after Drew turns up at Shortland Street only to find him as the new plastic surgeon. Boyd is initially oblivious to the connection between the pair. Vandervis commented on Harper and Boyd's relationship saying; \\"They're both great characters but at the end of the day I think Harper and Boyd are not suited to each other, she likes a little bit of adrenalin and she has a wild side. She's never going to get that from Boyd. Whether finding a guy that's similar to her in that way would ever work in a relationship sense, you never know.\\" It was reported that a 'red wedding' was set to air as the 2015 season finale cliffhanger. Hospital Stalker, Gareth Hutchins (Jarrod Martin), held people hostage in the hospital cafeteria. This interrupted the plans of her wedding to Boyd as he was caught in the crossfire of helping the injured with Harper finding about the situation occurring and also going to the hospital to assist. The wedding is left abandoned with only couple, Dayna Jenkins (Lucy Elliot) and George Kirkwood (Arlo Gibson), at the ceremony. They utilise the celebrant and singers, Sole Mio, and marry. = Drew McCaskill = After ending her engagement with Boyd, she starts a relationship with doctor, Drew McCaskill. After Drew is shot by gunman Gareth Hutchins, she admits her love for him and supports him, determined to get to the bottom of who made an attempt on his life. The pair start a relationship and decide to get married. However, Drew begins to worry when he is left waiting at the altar due to Harper questioning the marriage, but she ends up arriving on a motorbike. When commenting on whats holding her back on the characters second wedding to Drew, Vandervis commented; \\"It's not that marriage and children and those things aren't wonderful. I think she's just struggling to work out if that's what she really wants and I think lots of people can relate to that ‚Äì being unsure,\\" adding \\"She's a really modern woman and doesn't necessarily see the point in it. She doesn't see why you need to be defined by a piece of paper or by being connected to another person.\\" However, it is revealed after the pair wed that she aborted a pregnancy to Drew after Stuff.co.nz reported about the new 'controversial' set to air. It was said that this would \\"wreck the marriage\\" of the newlyweds. It was also said, that Drew would react in a way different to Harper, with Barrington commenting; \\"Drew keeps going on to Harper, 'You killed our baby'. He says to other people, 'She killed my baby'. For her it's like, 'I had the pregnancy terminated' but Drew's like, 'It was a baby. You killed it. It's like a child murdered.' \\" Vandervis describes the termination a 'tough' choice for Harper. In amongst the pregnancy, the character also was grieving after the death of her cousin, Ashley Whitley (Ruby Lyon) of whom she had become a legal guardian for. After Billie was born, Drew's selfish ways tests their relationship. Just as Harper is contemplating separation and divorce, however, she was diagnosed with Addison's Disease, which later progressed badly into an aggressive brain cancer.  Reception  After only been on the show for 18 months, the character of Harper had been proven popular in such a short amount of time. The character especially won the attention of viewers when a storyline aired that saw her fall in love with, bisexual character, Nicole, with Harper having had no previous lesbian relationships. This was followed with a 'saucy' photoshoot for a women's magazine and attracted attention with plenty of tweets from followers. One fan reportedly named her daughter 'Harper Ria' in honour of Vandervis and her character and the new-to-acting Vandervis stating she gets stopped for autographs and photos.

Ioannou), an obsessed gamer pulled into an alternate reality where video games are real life. There he meets Kera Althorn (Jennifer Polansky), a fallen space Princess trying to reclaim her throne from the General who overthrew and murdered her family. With the help of Kera's \\"MENU System\\" (Brent Black) a portable A.I. with a snarky sense of humour. Don and Kera travel to various video game worlds, First Person Shooters, Beat 'Em Ups, Space Combat Simulators, RPGs, Platformers, Racing and much more, in an attempt to bring an alliance of video game champions together to take back her throne and help Don grow from hapless boy into heroic man in order to find his way home. Plot Season 1 (2013) The first season revolves around Don being pulled into the alternate reality where video games are real life. The first world is pulled into is called \\"The Warzone\\" and is based on the First Person Shooter genre of video games. The second arc takes place in a world based on the Beat 'em up genre of video games that were popular in the 1980s. The third arc was revealed to be based on the space combat/shooter genre in a YouTube preview. Characters and cast Main cast Don DeWitt is a child of the Nintendo Generation. He was raised on a diet of video games from Mario to Call of Duty, Final Fantasy to Double Dragon and everything in between. His father got him his first ever gaming console, an original NES, when he was just a kid and after his father, died Don's prevalent memory of his departed father was playing video games with him as a kid. Since then he's grown up with his left thumb on a directional pad and his right thumb on the A button. Always so involved in gaming that he neglected the outside world, never realized the potential he had to be somebody and slowly started to feel like an outcast. Even his favorite social spot is a Gamer Bar in his home city of London. Don one day is pulled him into an alternate reality where the video games are real life. At first this could be a dream come true for Don, he's now standing in the worlds that he could only explore through a television screen before... but soon he realizes this is far from a dream-scenario, because if he is killed now, it truly is Game Over. Don is portrayed by series creator Petros L. IoannouDon DeWitt Character Description, Official Website Kera Althorn is only child of the Emperor of the Great Interstellar Althorn Empire, is a young woman who as her title would suggest had everything. She was always taken care of, never had to lift a finger to do anything . But it wasn't to last... When a military coup broke out led by the brutal General Atticus Dynas and Kera's family was overthrown and killed, Kera was thrown into a prison cell. Kera wasn't going to take this lying down though. She might not have been active in the past but she was sure as hell going to do something about it now. Kera breaks out of prison using the help of her family's personal M.E.N.U, a sentient super-computer, and steals an old ambassadorial ship called \\"The Fortress\\" and flies away. Kera remembers one thing, the story of the Grand Champion, who united all the video game heroes once to combat an impossible threat. She now travels from world to world seeking alliances with the Champions to take back her throne as she truly becomes a self-sufficient soldier. Kera is portrayed by Jennifer PolanskyKera Althorn Character Description, Official Website M.E.N.U (or simply Menu) is the Multi-Electrical Networked User System is a highly sophisticated sentient super-computer that can process at twenty-trillion petaflops and contains virtually the entire database of the Althorn Empire stored in its drives, yet still finds the time to make the occasional sarcastic remark, witty retort and highly refined dick, butt or fart joke. Loyal to Kera's family, Menu was a super computer designed to make their lives easier, and while in most science fiction that means he's going to turn evil, Menu is quite the opposite. In fact when everyone turned against the Royal Family, Menu stuck with Kera and now aids her on her quest to bring down her father's murderer. Menu often appears as a floating head and hands on a screen, be it on the ship The Fortress, or on Kera and Don's wrist mounted portable system. He acts as an interface helping the heroes to communicate and is always on hand with a wise-crack or two or six. Menu is portrayed by brentalfloss.Menu Character Description, Official Website History My Life as a Video Game was originally conceived by writer Petros L. Ioannou, as a video game review show. Each review would involve his being sucked into the game he was reviewing good or bad to point out the flaws. However slowly as it developed, Ioannou decided to make it more of a scripted comedy show with an ongoing storyline and soon reviewer element was removed entirely in favour of a more plot and character driven narrative that would seek to analyse and poke fun at gaming culture on a whole, while creating its own universe. This also would allow him to analyse gaming genres from the past, that might not be as common anymore such as the Beat 'em up and more modern ones such as the First Person Shooter. Kickstarter On October 21, 2013, Leon Films, with a video from producer Petros L. Ioannou and co-star Brent Black, launched a crowdfunding effort for My Life as a Video Game on Kickstarter with 35 days to reach a goal of $30,000. With the help of a video from Black on his channel.Check out the NEW SHOW, I'm in!, brentalfloss YouTube channele released about two weeks into the Kickstarter, the project reached is goal and raised $32,314 in total.My Life as a Video Game - A New Webseries!, kickstarter.com Format The show is based around \\"arcs\\", each corresponding to three episodes of a story roughly ten minutes in length. Together they combine one television length episode for easier viewing together. The only exception to this is the pilot episode which stands alone, though is considered to be part of the First Person Shooter arc that takes place immediately afterward.

Clause 6.4 of the lease agreement prohibited Millennium from leasing other premises in the shopping centre for the purpose of conducting a business similar to that of the lessee. When Sofokleous realised that Millennium had entered into a lease with Croatia Meat, giving the latter the right to run a butchery from the shopping centre, he sought an interdict prohibiting Millennium from permitting any person other than himself from conducting a butchery business from any premises in that centre. The two main issues in the two applications were # whether Millennium had breached its lease with Sofokleous by entering into the lease with Croatia; and, if so, # whether Sofokleous was entitled to an interdict or Croatia to an order for specific performance. The court held that Sofokleous was running a fully equipped butchery from within the supermarket, and that it could not be said that his was a supermarket that merely sold meat as a part of its usual range of food. Millennium had acted in breach of clause 6.4 of the lease agreement with Sofokleous when it entered into the lease with Croatia. The question was which of the competing and irreconcilable claims for specific performance by the innocent parties, Sofokleous and Croatia, should be enforced, and which party had to be left with a claim for damages against Millennium. The court held that, although the damages Sofokleous would suffer on a month-to-month basis appeared to be less than what Croatia was suffering, Croatia was able to limit its damages by finding alternative premises if Sofokleous's claim were upheld, resulting in a loss far less than the long- term loss that Sofokleous would suffer. There was thus no overriding equity that favoured either of the claims for specific performance. The rule qui prior est tempore potior est jure, as applied to the law of double sales, had therefore to be applied. Sofokleous's claim was upheld and that of Croatia dismissed.

Under this agreement, Sisana supplied the owner with certain labour in consideration for the right of occupation. When the land was sold, the purchaser and new landowner, De Jager, having knowledge of the agreement between Sisana and the previous owner, was willing to continue the agreement as was set before. Sisana, however, refused to work for the new owner, taking up the position that he would only render services to the former owner, although he still claimed the right to remain on the land. The court held that De Jager was entitled to an order evicting Sisana from the farm. One who purchases such land with knowledge of the agreement between its former owner and the squatter is, of course, bound by the terms of that agreement, but Sisana lost any rights he might have had against De Jager by declining to render the services to him. The contract of a squatter, then, is not that of a tenant or lessee; it is an innominate contract under which the services of the squatter are due to the owner of the farm, who made the contract, and no one else; and the right of a purchaser of the farm to eject the squatter is not affected by notice of the existence of the contract on the part of the purchaser of the farm at the date of purchase. The Appellate Division held that, to establish a contract of lease, the litigant must show that there was a particular thing let for a specified time and that, in return for the use of occupation of the thing, the lessee undertook to pay rent.

The collections are huge and include materials in three public repositories. Of the material now in public ownership or curation the largest element is The Forsythe Collection in the National Railway Museum at York's Search Engine Archive. The central theme of their collecting is the ephemera of travel and transport. A thought that is especially driven by the recognised concept of \\"grey literature\\" (printed materials with no bibliographical trace). right Origins The Forsythe Collection (in a conscious manner) may well date back to the early 20th century. James Forsythe (1916-2004) the father of Robert Forsythe (1959-) had a cousin Colin McFarlane. Colin avidly took up the Edwardian craze of collecting postcards (in his case of railways). James Forsythe as he grew up travelling the British Empire was introduced to stamp collecting. Both those historic collections remain part of the Forsythe Collection. When Robert Forsythe grew up in the Norfolk of the 1960s, his father was deeply involved in maritime heritage notably as Chairman of the Norfolk Wherry Trust caring for the Wherry Albion. James Forsythe had boated on the Norfolk Broads since his childhood. Maps and transport literature surrounded Robert. At school Robert Forsythe started to collect railway timetables in 1971 and the earliest letters establishing this collection survive at the Norfolk Record Office. In time Robert Forsythe became a museum curator, and met and married a librarian Fiona Forsythe. They built up a network of contributors and established what the railway world realised was a very special collection. Meanwhile, as house moves forced decisions other elements of the family collections found public repositories. These embrace the Papers of Major James A. Forsythe, MBE (1916-2004), in the Norfolk Record Office and the Cambridge University Centre of South Asian Studies. Transfer to National Railway Museum The transfer to the National Railway Museum at York took place in January 2009 and again in January 2012. Some 100 metres of shelved material were transferred. The essence of the transfer was the grey literature elements of the Forsythe Collection of Transport and Travel ephemera as it is described at York. This means the publicity materials: timetables, leaflets, handbills and brochures but in general not ISBN covered items nor \\"books\\" including guidebooks. Posters, tickets and postcards were also not transferred and these collections remain with the Forsythes. Nor were extensive model railway interests. Subsequently, materials were used in the first APP generated at the museum. Another selective mention is of the material used in The Track Stars Exhibition in 2012.

The particulars of claim required Transnet to enter into good-faith negotiations with Southernport regarding the terms and conditions of an agreement of lease in respect of the properties described. The basis of Southernport's claims was contained in a contract which provided for the option to lease properties on terms and conditions to be negotiated, and provided for the referral of disputes to an arbitrator. The particulars of claim further alleged that any dispute between the parties had in terms of the contract to be referred to an arbitrator. Transnet claimed that the relevant clauses were unenforceable, * because there had been no agreement regarding the essential terms of any lease; * because the terms of the agreement relating to the lease were void for vagueness; and * because the relief claimed was not certain and definite in its terms and therefore incompetent. The thrust of the exception was that the essential terms of any agreement, in order to be enforceable between the parties thereto, had to be agreed to or at least capable of ascertainment. It was alleged that this had not occurred in the present case. It was argued further that an agreement which required further negotiations, as in the present matter, could not acquire contractual force; at best for the plaintiff, it was an agreement to agree, which was unenforceable. The court held that, before an agreement of lease came into existence, there had to be an agreement between the parties upon the use and enjoyment of the property and the rental to be paid. Agreement upon the use and enjoyment of the property involved the identification of the property. Furthermore, the intended use of the property was not stipulated, so the parties had not agreed upon the use and enjoyment of the property, which was a requirement in any lease agreement. The agreement also contained no provision for the rental to be paid, another essential element of a contract of lease. The provision for the appointment of an arbitrator provided a dispute-resolution mechanism, not one for fixing the rent or any other term of the lease. The plaintiff's reliance on such contract therefore disclosed no cause of action. For a dispute to exist in the present context, there first had to be something more than a subjective intention on the part of the contracting parties which were not the same. There had to be some basis for an objective debate between them. There was no such basis in the present case; the appointment of an arbitrator could not assist the plaintiff in this regard.

The applicant's attorneys were Schwartz & Goldblatt; the respondent's were Vermaas & Kie. HJ Preiss appeared for the applicant; JJ Strydom appeared for the respondent.  Facts  A contract was entered into between Simon Drymiotis and Johannes Frederick du Toit to enable the latter, for a fixed period, to produce and deliver andalusite at the Pietersburg Railway Station in bags, from two farms, these being the property of Drymiotis. The contract provided as follows: > The andalusite produced will be priced at R20 per ton delivered in the truck > at the station in bags, being production costs. It is further agreed that > the purchasing company be approached to pay to the said producing > contractor, the respondent, R20 per ton on his share of the andalusite and > the balance to be paid to the owner of the mineral (the applicant). Provided > that the sale price is R30 or more F.O.B. per ton, minimum to be R30 per > ton.  Argument  In an application for the ejectment of the respondent from the land, Drymiotis contended that the contract was void, as it had not been notarially executed in terms of section 3(1) of the General Law Amendment Act.50 of 1956.  Judgment  The court, after reserving judgment, held that the \\"contract\\" was essentially a \\"lease of rights to minerals in land\\" in terms of the section.

The lodge was next to a national road; because of this, it attracted considerable business. Eight years after the conclusion of the contract, the lessor insisted on the diversion of a national road. This impacted negatively on the flow of business to the hotel. About three years later, it was closed down. The lessee instituted an action against respondent for the payment of damages for breach of contract. This claim was dismissed by the court a quo. On appeal, the plaintiff averred that there was an implied term in the agreement that the respondent would not take any steps which would have the effect of interfering with access to the hotel and thus prevent the flow of business. Botha, JA held that the common-law duties of the lessor had to be determined first. He concluded that commodus usus could include the idea of profit where the lessee runs a business from the leased premises. If the property has been leased for the purpose of conducting a business from it, the lessee's right to commodus usus also relates to the profit to be gained from conducting the business. The commodus usus of lessees conducting a business on the property let, including its profitability, may be infringed in both a direct and an indirect manner. Cooper has questioned the conclusion of Botha, JA in the Sishen case, arguing that the liability of the lessor is not absolute, and that therefore, for a successful claim based on reduced profitability, the lessee must prove that the parties expressly or tacitly agreed that they would refrain from such conduct. With reference to Pothier, he states that \\"the only ground on which the lessee in Sishen was entitled to recover damages from the lessor was if he could prove that the lessor was contractually bound to refrain from conduct which caused loss.\\" Cooper concludes that, on the facts, the lessee had proven that a tacit term existed and was breached; therefore the order was correct. The difference is that Botha JA saw the commodus usus as part of the common- law naturalia, whereas Cooper believes that the lessee must plead that such a term existed in the contract.

The leader of the Ta'al party, he has served as a member of the Knesset since 1999. Tibi was acknowledged as a figure in the Israeli-Palestinian arena after serving as a political advisor to the late Palestinian president Yasser Arafat (1993‚Äì1999). He describes himself as Arab- Palestinian in nationality, and Israeli in citizenship. Tibi is also a trained physician and graduate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as a gynecologist. Early life and career Tibi was born in Tayibe, Israel, a town about 16 km (10 mi) east of the Mediterranean coast north of Tel Aviv, in 1958. His father, Kamal Tibi, was born in Jaffa. Tibi studied medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, graduating with honors in 1983. He began a residency as a gynecologist at Hadassah Hospital in 1984, but in 1987, he was involved in a violent incident with a security guard that led to his dismissal. Tibi had walked past a security checkpoint when the guard, a recent American immigrant named David Rothstein who had just been hired, ordered Tibi to let him inspect his briefcase after he had walked past the guard booth, assuming the guard would recognize him. Tibi refused, which led to a physical struggle between him and Rothstein for the briefcase. Moments later, Rothstein's superior arrived and broke it up. He identified Tibi as a doctor, and ordered him released. Tibi then swung the briefcase at Rothstein's head, causing a wound that bled profusely and required four stitches to close, and walked away, leaving Rothstein bleeding on the floor. Tibi claimed that Rothstein had tried to slap him across the mouth as they disengaged, which Rothstein denied. The hospital director, Dr. Jacques Michel, subsequently questioned Tibi, Rothstein, and a few witnesses over the incident, then fired Tibi without conducting a formal inquiry. A hospital spokeswoman said that Michel felt that to strike a man and leave him injured on the floor was such a grave and violent act for a doctor to commit as to warrant dismissal. During his studies, Tibi had also become involved in politics. In the 1980s, he made connections with prominent Palestinian activists. He attended PLO meetings around the world, and in 1984, he met Yasser Arafat in Tunis, at a time when meeting PLO members was still a criminal offense in Israel. Tibi was questioned by police several times, subjected to a stay of exit order from Israel, and arrested once. Tibi served as a political advisor to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat from 1993 to 1999, representing the Palestinians at the 1998 Wye River negotiations. He resigned from this post in 1999 upon deciding to run for the Knesset. Tibi described his relationship with Arafat as \\"close\\" and \\"extremely interesting and important to [him]\\". He was first elected to the Knesset in the 1999 elections after establishing Ta'al and running jointly with Azmi Bishara's Balad party, but broke away during the same Knesset session. In 2002, MK Michael Kleiner initiated actions in the Knesset to restrict movements by Tibi inside the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Kleiner claimed that Tibi was assisting the Palestinians in their war against Israel. Tibi protested the Knesset's decision as unconstitutional and illegal under Israeli law, and appealed to the Supreme Court of Israel, which deferred a decision on the case. Ahead of Israel's 2003 elections, several politicians, including the heads of the National Union and National Religious Party, sought to have Tibi banned from standing again as candidate; the official motion to disqualify him was filed by Likud MK Michael Eitan, who argued that beside his history as adviser to Arafat, Tibi had supported Palestinian terror throughout the Intifadas and used his immunity as MK since his election to further Palestinian interests. Eitan's motion passed in the Israeli Central Elections Committee by one vote. However, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected the Committee's arguments, unanimously overturning the ban, and Tibi was elected as part of a joint list of Ta'al and Hadash. Before the 2006 elections, Tibi took his Ta'al party out of the Hadash coalition and joined the United Arab List (UAL). After retaining his seat, he became a Deputy Speaker of the Knesset. He was re-elected on the joint UAL‚ÄìTa'al list in the 2009 and 2013 elections. Inside and outside Israel, Tibi is acknowledged as an effective parliamentarian and advocate for Palestinians who live in Israel and the territories it controls. He was the first Arab member of the Knesset to succeed in passing legislation under his own name against opposition, including an August 2012 law regularizing compensation given by airlines to their customers for delayed or cancelled flights. In 2008, he initiated the establishment of the Parliamentary inquiry committee for the employment of Arabs in the public sector, serving as its chairman until 2012. He was favored several times in media surveys of the Arab-Palestinian population in Israel as the most popular Arab member of the Knesset and cited as best public speaker in the Knesset by parliamentary reporters. As of September 2014, Tibi remains Deputy Speaker and UAL-Ta'al Parliamentary Group Chairman. He is a member of the House Committee and the Finance Committee.The Knesset, State of Israel Political positions Tibi is an anti-Zionist. He supports an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 green lines and a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state established alongside Israel. He also opposes Israel's character as a Jewish state, claiming that its self- definition as Jewish is racist, and favors Israel becoming a \\"state of all its citizens\\". Accordingly, he supports removing icons that represent the special status of the Jewish majority, including the Law of Return, the flag, and the national anthem. He opposes the recruitment of Arab citizens of Israel into the IDF. Tibi also supports the Palestinian right of return, calling it a prerequisite for reconciliation, but has stated that he believes only a small percentage of Palestinian refugees would actually choose to move to Israel. Speaking to a March 3, 2018, London conference titled \\"Is President Trump legalizing the occupation?\\", the lawmaker denounced the recent Trump administration decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem in May.Alia Al Ghussain. (4 March 2018). \\"US Jerusalem move is 'official adoption of Israeli narrative'\\". Al Jazeera website Retrieved 4 March 2018. During the April 2019 Israeli elections, Tibi was frequently brought up by PM Netanyahu who used the slogan \\"It's either Bibi or Tibi\\" - a phrase which was criticized by Tibi and opponents of Netanyahu as playing on Jewish fears of Arab involvement in the Israeli political process to cast the election as a dichotomy between returning Netanyahu as prime minister or allowing Arab Israelis to join a government. Controversies Tibi continues to be considered controversial in the Israeli politics mainly due to his wide relations with Palestinian and Arab parties, and his speeches in the Knesset. However, Tibi is also known for having pronounced a moving speech to commemorate Holocaust Day in 2010 at the Israeli Knesset.

It was joined in an electoral alliance by the Arab Democratic Party (which held two seats in the outgoing parliament) and the southern faction of the Islamic Movement. The party initially went under the title of Mada-Ra'am, Mada being the acronym and common name for the Arab Democratic Party. In the elections, the party won four seats. During the Knesset term, the Arab Democratic Party became a faction within the United Arab List, and its name was dropped from the party title. The next elections saw the party increase its share of the vote and pick up five seats. However, internal disagreements saw three MKs leave; Muhamad Kanan and Tawfik Khatib left and established the Arab National Party, whilst Hashem Mahameed formed the National Unity ‚Äì National Progressive Alliance party. In the 2003 elections the party's support dropped by more than a third, with the party only just crossing the electoral threshold of 2%, and winning only two seats. For the 2006 elections the party entered an alliance with Ahmad Tibi's Ta'al party. Running together, the alliance won four seats, three of which were taken by the United Arab List. The partys' alliance was maintained for the 2009 elections, which initially saw the Israeli Central Elections Committee ban the party from participating, but this was overturned by the Supreme Court of Israel. In the elections, the alliance again won four seats. Shortly before the 2013 elections, el-Sana left the party to sit as an independent Arab Democratic Party member. After the electoral threshold to gain Knesset seats was raised from 2% to 3.25%, the party joined with Hadash, Balad, Ta'al, and the Islamic Movement to form the Joint List. For the April 2019 election, it is ran on a list with Balad. Ideology and support The party supports the two-state solution, and the creation of a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital; and equal rights for Arab citizens of Israel. Its constituency consists mostly of religious or nationalist Israeli Arabs, and enjoys particular popularity among the Bedouin ‚Äì in the 2009 elections, 80% of residents of Bedouin communities voted for the party. The Islamic Movement also operates in poor Arab towns and villages, as well as in Bedouin settlements, to mobilize voters. The southern faction of the Islamic Movement is now the dominant force in the party, whilst other factions include the Arab National Party.

Early life Harold Maclean was born on 14 May 1828; his father was a captain. Career Described as a \\"modest, humane and hard-working individual\\", Maclean was selected to serve as Inspector of Prisons for New South Wales. As sheriff of New South Wales, Maclean is credited with abolishing the treadmill punishment once meted out at jails in the region. Despite being heavily lauded for his capabilities, Maclean worked on a low salary. Maclean supervised the design and construction of Trial Bay Gaol. He advocated a number of principles of prison reform including the provision of substantial masonry accommodation rather than cheaply constructed barracks, the isolation of prisoners from each other (and hence bad influence and ideas) by the provision of a cell per prisoner. He was also a believer in the modern British penal model where long term prisoners reaching the last years of their sentence, were employed in the construction of public works projects. Here they could learn skills useful for future employment and enjoy new privileges and freedoms as they approached the time of their release from prison.

The second respondent was a franchise of the first applicant and occupied the premises through first applicant with the consent of Numetro. The dispute which arose was regarding the right of Ster Kinekor to sublet a shop virtually next door to Sweets from Heaven, as both entities sold similar products (sweets, confectionery and related products). The court a quo granted an interim interdict prohibiting the franchise to occupy the premises, based on the failure to provide free and undisturbed use of the premises. The applicants based their claim on * Ster Kinekor's failure to ensure free and undisturbed use and enjoyment of the leased premises in allowing the second respondent to compete with the second applicant; and * a tacit or implied term that the lessor would not permit the conduct of a business in competition with the business of the second applicant in close proximity of the latter's shop. The court referred to Pothier and Sishen Hotel (Edms) Bpk v Suid-Afrikaanse Yster en Staal Industri√´le Korporasie Bpk,1987 (2) SA 932 (A). but held that an impairment of usus alone is insufficient to found liability. Ster Kinekor would only be liable if its conduct constituted a breach of contract; therefore the issue must be decided on the express and tacit terms of a contract. A lessee of business premises, then, will succeed in a claim against a lessor for reduced profitability caused by the lessor's conduct only if the lessee is able to prove that the parties either explicitly or tacitly agreed that they would refrain from such conduct. On the facts however, there was no evidence of a tacit term being breached; therefore, there was no breach of contract. Kerr points out that the formulation of the application in Sweets from Heaven clearly indicates that the applicants meant to differ between tacit and implied terms. He raises the possibility that the court may have overlooked the distinction between the two categories and recommends the introduction of a different word, namely \\"residual terms,\\" for provisions which the law adds in the absence of agreement by the parties. Of paramount importance here is Kerr's statement of the law, where he suggests that \\"the lessee needs to prove that the deprivation of commodus usus is the result of a breach of a provision of the contract, whether that provision is express or passes the hypothetical bystander test or is added by law in the absence of agreement by the parties.\\" The reliance by the court on Wilkens NO v Voges, which deals with tacit terms and the near similarity in the meaning of the words \\"implied\\" and \\"tacit,\\" had the result that Malan J failed to deal with the alternative pleading regarding the residual term, which the law adds in the absence of agreement by the parties.

International Style  The Joshel House is a distinctive example of the International Style. The International Style emphasizes the expression of volume rather than mass, balance rather than symmetry, and the absence of ornament.

The Joshel House is devoid of ornament, relying for visual interest, instead, on the materials and on the building‚Äôs volume which has been conceived as a cubist composition.

The Dutch court then considered the issues under their local patent law and EU patent law. Acknowledging that Monsanto had established the presence of their patented genetic material in the soy meal, the court must decide if the presence alone of such genetic material is sufficient for infringement of Monsanto's patent at [25] and [26]. The courts analysis is primarily driven by the specific language regarding whether the genetic material is present, and if it performs its function therein. The court concludes that the genetic material present in the soy meal is dead material, and no longer performs its function. Therefore, in the courts interpretation Monsanto's patent is not infringed. Recognizing that there is profit being had by the soy producers in Argentina, without any reciprocal compensation to the patent holders, the court referred the following question to the ECJ: # Must Article 9 of Directive 98/44/EC be interpreted such that patent protection is provided when a product (genetic material) forms part of a material imported into the EU, but no longer performs its function at the time of the alleged infringement (yet could still possibly perform its function if inserted into a living organism)? # Proceeding on the basis that the genetic material claimed by Monsanto's patent is present in the soy meal imported by Cefetra and Toepfer, and it is incorporated for the purpose of Article 9 of the directive and it does not perform its function therein: does the protection offered under Article 9 preclude the national patent legislation from offering absolute protection to the product, regardless of whether it performs its function, and must Article 9 protection therefore be deemed exhaustive in the situation where the product consists of genetic information and is incorporated in material which contains the genetic information? # Does it make any difference, for the purpose of answering the previous question, that the patent was applied for and granted prior to the adoption of the directive and absolute patent protection was granted under national patent legislation prior to the adoption of the directive? # Is it possible, in answering the previous questions, to take into consideration the TRIPS Agreement, in particular Articles 27 and 30 thereof?  Judgment  The first question The ECJ addressed the first question by stating, \\"It follows from the foregoing that the protection provided for in Article 9 of the Directive is not available when the genetic information has ceased to perform the function it performed in the initial material from which the material in question is derived.\\" at [38] BIOTECH PATENT INFRINGEMENT IN EUROPE: THE ‚ÄúFUNCTIONALITY‚Äù GATEKEEPER, The John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law, Vol. 10, Issue 3, p. 540, 2011 at p. 540 The second question In response to question two the ECJ states, \\"Accordingly, in so far as the Directive does not accord protection to a patented DNA sequence which is not able to perform its function, the provision interpreted precludes the national legislature from granting absolute protection to a patented DNA sequence as such, regardless of whether it performs its function in the material containing it. The answer to the second question is therefore that Article 9 of the Directive effects an exhaustive harmonisation of the protection it confers, with the result that it precludes the national patent legislation from offering absolute protection to the patented product as such, regardless of whether it performs its function in the material containing it.\\" at [62-63] The third question The ECJ responds to question three as follows, \\"The answer to the third question is therefore that Article 9 of the Directive precludes the holder of a patent issued prior to the adoption of that directive from relying on the absolute protection for the patented product accorded to it under the national legislation then applicable.\\" at [69] The fourth question In response to question four the ECJ states, \\"The answer to the fourth question is therefore that Articles 27 and 30 of the TRIPS Agreement do not affect the interpretation given of Article 9 of the Directive.\\" at [77]  See also  * The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) * Patent Act 1995 (Netherlands)  References   External links  *Directive 98/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions *TRIPS agreement (PDF version) Category:Court of Justice of the European Union case law Category:Monsanto litigation Category:2010 in the European Union Category:2010 in case law Category:Regulation of genetically modified organisms ","title":"Monsanto Technology LLC v Cefetra BV and Others"},{"id":"39386059","text":"Eutelsat 3D is a communications satellite operated by Eutelsat which will provide services to Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. It will initially be located at 3¬∞ E in geosynchronous orbit in a fixed point above the equator, where Eutelsat already has two satellites Eutelsat 3A and Eutelsat 3C. Once Eutelsat 3B is launched in 2014 this satellite will be moved to 7¬∞E. The satellite has four footprints and broadcasts on both Ka band and Ku band. Three footprints will serve Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa in both Ka and Ku bands. The fourth footprint will cover sub- Saharan Africa but only in Ku band. It will have 56 transponders in total. The satellite was built by Thales Alenia Space using their spacebus 4000 satellite bus. The satellite will be launched by International Launch Services from pad 39 at Site 200 at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The launch will use a Proton-M rocket with a Briz-M upper stage. The first three stages of the Proton fire for the first 9 minutes, 42 seconds. After that the Briz-M upper stage takes over with five separate burns until the space craft separates from the upper stage 9 hours and 13 minutes after launch. The satellite launched on 14 May 2013 at 16:02 UTC and was successfully placed into geostationary transfer orbit. It was given the International Designator 2013-022A and the US satellite catalog reference 39163. Eutelsat name their satellites after their locations so it is likely that this satellite will change name when it is moved. Eutelsat 3C used to be called Atlantic Bird 4A when it was located at 7¬∞W.

History There are various references to a manor house prior to 1800 but we cannot be sure whether this is Nether or Over Silton. At that time Over Silton and all the Hillside Villages down to Coxwold were part of the Newburgh Estate. So this would imply that there was no need for a manor house, as the lords lived at the Newburgh Priory in Coxwold. In the early 1800s the Lords of Newburgh Estate were the Belasyse family, known as the Earls of Fauconberg. This line ended in 1825 due to a lack of male heirs. Sir George Wombwell inherited the Newburgh estate and on his death was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir George Orby Wombwell. Relics can be seen of Sir George Orby Wombwell‚Äôs ownership of Over Silton, his initials GOW on the gable end of Keepers Cottage is identical to many of the cottages in Coxwold village. Sir George sold Over Silton Estate, which included the village, surrounding farms and moorland, in 1866 to William Bradley Wainman and he built Over Silton Manor. William Bradley Wainman was from Carr Head Hall, Cowling, West Riding and was a wealthy landowner, his family making a fortune from the woollen industry in the 17th century. Carr Head Hall was the family home of the Wainmans for nearly 300 years and various similarities to Over Silton Manor can be noted in the surrounding architecture. William Bradley Wainman used materials and employed stonemasons from the Cowling area and they would be influenced by the fashion in the West Riding. William Bradley Wainman was a strong supporter of field sports and built Over Silton Manor as a country retreat for the purposes of his passion for shooting. The moorland area surrounding Over Silton provided excellent grouse shooting, the basin providing the birds with an ideal natural sanctuary. Although now prominently woodland (planted in the 1950s by the Forestry Commission) in the time of William Bradley Wainman this would have been the edge of the moorland, covered in heather and gorse and providing the natural habitat. Near the entrance gates to Over Silton Manor is the grave of a Laverack Setter, which at that time was the ultimate type of hunting dog in the country, and preceded the English Setter. On research into this dog breed, some of the dogs exchanged hands for over 80 guineas, which in today‚Äôs terms is the equivalent of a 3-bed house! It is doubtful that William Bradley Wainman ever actually lived at Over Silton Manor, but he probably did visit regularly and classed it as his second home, as on his gravestone it states him being of Carr Head and Over Silton - (the gravestone being at Kildwick Church near Cowling) On the death of William Bradley Wainman at the age of 59, having owned Over Silton Estate for just 6 years, his eldest daughter, Mary Amelia, inherited the family home at Carr Head and Edith Hinde, his second daughter, inherited the Over Silton estate. Over Silton Estate was passed to Miss Hinde (their only child) and she was known by her tenants as being a recluse and quite pedantic in nature. Stories are that she would arrive at the village unannounced and walk up the village inspecting the upkeep of the gardens. Miss Hinde lived in hotels and did not have a home.

Edna Kearns urged newspaper reporters to avoid publicizing misconceptions about the religious organization. The Quaker Oats Company was not founded by Quakers, Kearns argued, and it cashed in on the Quakers‚Äô reputation for honesty in business dealings. Many members of the Religious Society of Friends opposed the Quaker branding for oatmeal and other commercial products not endorsed by the religious body.

Early life :1945-1954  Mkondo was born of Karanga heritage in 1945 in Fort Victoria, (now Masvingo). He was the third born in a family of 18 children, the second son of Tangi Mkondo. Paul grew up in Nerupiri Village in Gutu a district of Masvingo Province. He later moved with his father Tangi Mhova Mkondo, who was a very hard-working & disciplined farm manager (who was asked by the white farm owner to relocate with him because he trusted & respected his work ethics), to Schoora Estate in Marandellas (now Marondera) in Mashonaland East Province.  Education and training 1955-1964  Mkondo did his Sub A (Grade 1) to Standard One (Grade 3) at Schoora Estate Primary School. After Standard One, Mkondo moved to another farm in Wedza, which became known as Edridge (Duva) Estate where he worked as a stable boy looking after horses, and then became the butler. During this time his father Tangi Mhova Mkondo joined fellow migrants recruited by Witswatersrand Native Labour Association (WNLA/ WENELA) to catch the Stimela train to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, South Africa. This was in order to pay for the controversial hut tax imposed upon black Rhodesians (Zimbabwe) by the colonial government, as traditional subsistence farming did not generate enough income to afford the tax. Mkondo had to work to support his mother and the rest of his siblings at a very young age. During the weekend he started weekend business of trading at the local market. He later went to Chemhanza Mission in Wedza a district of Mashonaland East Province, from 1957 to complete his primary education from Standard Two (Grade 4) to Standard Six. Mkondo then went to high school at Tegwani Mission near Bulawayo in Matabeleland South Province. At Tegwani Mission (now Thekwane High School) he met future fellow nationalists such as Canaan Banana and Edson Zvobgo. Mkondo was also classmates with union leader Gibson Sibanda. Mkondo as the Headboy led the biggest student protest against the Rhodesian Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. This resulted in him being black-listed and outlawed, resulting in him being one of the first political detainees at Gonakudzingwa Restriction camp alongside Joshua Nkomo. Mkondo during school vacations, used to enjoy the Outward Bound Camps, which were held at the Outward Bound Mountaineering Centre in Melsetter (now Chimanimani) in Manicaland Province. He became a part-time instructor which helped him self- finance his Secondary Education.Mkondo during this time also trained individuals on bushcraft,scouting and how to survive in the bush and became elite SAS special forces worldwide. Mkondo went on to become a full-time \\"Outward Bound Instructor\\" where he trained another future nationalist, Moven Mahachi, who later on was to confide in him in planning the escape of Robert Mugabe and Tezvara (In-Law) Edgar Tekere to Mozambique alongside Chief Rekayi Tangwena (whom he had befriended as an Outward Bound instructor) with the assistance of Samora Machel's FRELIMO party. After a few years as an Outward bound Instructor and Scout in the Eastern Highlands, Mkondo decided to continue his education. He enrolled at Bulawayo Polytechnic College to train in hotel catering, a course that was sponsored by the Rhodesian Breweries (Natbrew) and Anglo American Corporation. He was one of two black students accepted at the time for this course. The student who achieved the highest marks was to be offered a scholarship to study for a Bachelor of Science degree in Hotel Management at Blackpool Technical College (now Blackpool and The Fylde College) in the United Kingdom. Mkondo came first among the other students in the course, but was not offered the scholarship because of his colour. This was his first personal taste of racial discrimination, as he believed the scholarship was a lifetime opportunity to help him provide for his family. Mkondo then relocated to Highfields Harare, obtaining a job with the prestigious Park Lane Hotel in Salisbury as an assistant kitchen manager. Due to an altercation with some soldiers at a wedding, Mkondo was fired and later barred from future employment at any catering establishment. He sought out another job at Salisbury's Federal Hotel, but again cited discrimination by the predominantly Coloured guests.  Entrepreneurship and businesses establishment 1965-1969  Mkondo decided to open his own business in Lochinvar, and purchased the Club Hideout 99 with approval from the Rhodesian Liquor Licensing Board and the municipal authorities. This site later became an important meeting site for supporters of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), and stored weapons for the party's militant wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). Mkondo also participated in a series of urban bombings, such as the sabotage of petrol installations in Epworth. Throughout the 1960s, he worked as an insurance & financial advisor. His business acumen and strong work ethic set off his entrepreneurial spirit which made him start a garage and taxi business in Machipisa, Highfields. Mkondo eventually founded his own taxi company, Sharaude Glen Noah Taxi Services (Pvt) Ltd, which came to own the second largest taxi fleet in Rhodesia. At some point he also served as president of the country's Metered Taxi Operators' Association.  Political activity 1970-1980  Mkondo organised underground meetings for some of the political leadership, as many were his former teachers and colleagues from Thekwani High School in Plumtree. Some he had known since he had lived with them in Highfields Township in Salisbury (now Harare). When the Rhodesian Bush War intensified after 1972, Mkondo sent his wife abroad for medical training with ZANLA. Mkondo intended to close his business and follow her into exile, but was dissuaded by Herbert Chitepo and ZANLA commander Josiah Tongogara, who recommended he stay inside Rhodesia and assist with the postwar economic reconstruction when hostilities ende He was, however, appointed to ZANU's Treasury and Finances Committee in recognition of his sympathy to the nationalist cause. On the committee, Mkondo worked closely with fellow ZANU supporters Enos Nkala, Bernard Chidzero, George Tawengwa, Ben Mucheche, Tobias Musariri Snr. and others to funnel money to ZANLA for arms. He was also utilised as a liaison between the ZANU leadership detained in Gonakudzingwa restriction camp by the Rhodesian Security Forces, and those such as Mugabe, who had fled to Mozambique. With no travel restrictions, and being a well-known successful businessman in Southern Africa, Mkondo took trips abroad to promote ZANU's cause with international figures such as US President Gerald Ford, diplomats Henry Kissinger, Andrew Young and Pope John Paul II. He was instrumental in persuading the Ford administration to push for talks which resulted in the 1976 Geneva talks between black nationalists and Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith. Following the election of Mugabe as prime minister in March 1980, Mkondo helped many former guerrilla fighters re- integrate into civilian life. Mkondo was the favoured people‚Äôs candidate to represent Zanu PF for the Gutu South parliamentary seat in Masvingo Province where he was born and raised. Instead, Shuvai Mahofa due to gender equality issues was selected by the Gutu Zanu Pf Provincial leadership led by Vice President of Zimbabwe, Dr. Simon Muzenda, which Mkondo cordially accepted and then fully supported her tenure, as she was a Clans woman (VaTete) and an able politician. Mkondo in terms of international business, turned down many executive opportunities to work in Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 Index multi- national companies overseas , opting to remain in the new Zimbabwe.  Indigenous commercial farming :1980-2013  Paul Mkondo was an established commercial farmer. He started farming Zimbabwe's staple maize in the late 1970s in Lochinvar and Southerton in Harare. He also was the first indigenous commercial poultry farmer to have his own brand: Paul Mkondo Poultry. In the mid 1980s, Mkondo purchased Inyatsi Farm at competitive commercial agricultural property market rates at that time, from a white farmer in the Mazowe, Mashonaland Central area. He joined the Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU), and was one of the founding members of the Indigenous Commercial Farmers Union (ICFU), formed in 1992 to represent black commercial farmers. Paul Mkondo in tobacco fields on his Commercial farm in Mazowe, Mashonaland Central Mkondo, as Vice-President ‚Äì Affirmative Action of the IBDC organisation, was a founding father of the indigenisation and black economic empowerment of the Zimbabwean economy alongside similar business moguls and tycoons as Ben Mucheche (President), John Mapondera (Former President), Strive Masiyiwa, Chemist Siziba (former president), Jane Mutasa (IBWO), and James Makamba. This group worked on indigenisation laws with the support of the President Robert Mugabe, Vice-Presidents Simon Muzenda and Joshua Nkomo which formed the basis of the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act of 2007.  Death  Mkondo, was in the intensive care unit (ICU) post surgery for a month, whilst awaiting for his multi-disciplinary international medical consultants to medically air transport him to the reputable Milpark Hospital for stabilization first in South Africa, but their efforts were delayed by the local team. Mkondo died on 9 May 2013, in a Harare private hospital called Avenues Clinic in Zimbabwe.  Legacy  Paul Mkondo was the first African insurance executive and financial advisor to be recognised with the elite Life Million Dollar Roundtable International (MDRT). In new independent Zimbabwe he officially represented Zimbabwe and presented the new flag to the MDRT Organization with the blessings of the first Prime Minister of Zimbabwe H. E. Robert Mugabe nicknamed Jongwe. He was also on the MDRT standing committee. Mkondo was the first African President of the Life underwriters association. Mkondo with VaMutanga were the first pioneering African Indigenous Businessman in Rhodesia to establish a licensed Restaurant and Night Club backed by Amai Mutanga‚Äôs Blessing and Prayers. Mkondo was also the First African International Music Promoter In Highfields in the 60s. The protagonist, Simbai Saul Muhondo, in Samuel Chimsoro's novel 'Nothing is impossible' is based on Mkondo's biography (the period from Mkondo‚Äôs Birth to 1983 when book was also published). The book was well received and became part of the national education syllabus in English literature during the 80‚Äôs without people knowing that it was based on Mkondo‚Äôs life.Chimsoro,S.(1983) Nothing Is Impossible, Harlow, Penguin Longman.

Synopsis The poem follows an unnamed 'dark man' who rides the rails observing everything around him. The poem takes a sinister turn when the narrator confesses to rape. Genesis Stephen King wrote the poem on the back of a placemat in a college restaurant. According to King, the idea for the poem came out of nowhere: \\"this guy in cowboy boots who moved around on the roads, mostly hitchhiking at night, always wore jeans and a denim jacket...

Life  Abd al-Haqq II was made sultan in 1420 under the regency of a Wattasid vizier, and later was nominal sultan under Wattasid control until 1465. Abd al-Haqq was the son of Sultan Abu Said Uthman III, who made an unsuccessful attempt to recover Ceuta from the Portuguese in 1419. This led to instability in the Marinid state culminating in a coup in Fez in 1420, in which Abu Said Uthman III was assassinated. At that time, his son and heir Abd al-Haqq was just one year old. A succession struggle broke out immediately as other pretenders quickly emerged. Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi was governor of Sal√©. Hearing the news of the sultan's assassination, Abu Zakariya hurried to seize control of the royal palace of Fez, proclaiming the orphan child Abd al-Haqq as the new Marinid sultan and appointing himself his regent and chief minister (vizier). Morocco quickly descended into disorder and strife. By 1423 the regent Abu Zakariya al-Wattasi had emerged the effective ruler of the state. When Abd al- Haqq came of age in 1437, Abu Zakariya refused to give up the regency. In 1437 a Portuguese attempt to take advantage of the dispute and take Tangier by siege proved unsuccessful, raising the morale of the Moroccans and increasing the prestige of the sharifs who had led the defense. Abu Zakariya took full advantage of the victory to consolidate his power. Any thought of the regency being surrendered was forgotten. In January 1438, under his administration, the tomb of Idris II, founder of Fez and of the Idrisid dynasty, was rediscovered, becoming an important destination for pilgrims. Abu Zakariya was succeeded by his nephew, Ali ibn Yusuf, in 1448. Ali ibn Yusuf was in turn succeeded by Abu Zakariya's son, Yahya ibn Abi Zakariya, in 1458. Although Abd al-Haqq was nominally sultan, he held no power. He was murdered in 1465 during the 1465 Moroccan revolt.

The biggest basic difference in scoring is that the chain hit counter will not reset immediately when the chain meter empties; the counter will instead drop by 25% and decrease very quickly until the chain continues. The chain meter is also more easily kept above zero by using the laser. The arcade release has an \\"overflow glitch\\" that, when triggered, results in scores that are otherwise impossible. The \\"get point\\" counter beside the chain meter must exceed 21,474,836, at which point the score will begin to increase at an unintended fast rate. This glitch is removed in version 1.5.Hardcore Gaming 101: Dodonpachi Series Unlike past entries in the DoDonPachi series, there is no second loop in this game.

When Hina decided that the ultimate answer to humanity's problems was to eliminate the human person, the project was immediately shut down and the Element Dolls were frozen. Prior to the beginning of the game, Hina, now known as Hibachi, was mysteriously reactivated and destroyed the laboratory, and the incident was covered up. Hibachi now controls a computer system governing from deep within the technologically advanced City of Ideal, a paradise where humans live in harmony with nature. Believing that the only way to save humankind is to have them adopt a better form, she begins a war to force all humans on Earth to become machines. Hastily, the remaining humans of Earth revive the ancient DonPachi Corps to fight Hibachi's army of mechanized people. The new DonPachi's mission is to destroy Hibachi and her powerful computer system.

Context The station was built by the Midland Railway at the summit of the circuitous to line known as the Clowne Branch. History The station was opened without ceremony on 1 November 1888 as \\"Clown\\". All passenger trains called at all stations between and . The line was single track between Seymour Junction and Elmton and Creswell. Accordingly, the station had a single, curving platform and typical Midland Railway country station building very similar to those at and . Remarkably, the station survived into the 21st Century, being demolished in 2000. On 4 July 1938 the station was renamed \\"Clown and Barlborough\\", then renamed again by British Railways (BR) on 18 June 1951, this time by adding a \\"e\\" to become \\"Clowne and Barlborough.\\" BR went to this trouble to seek to distinguish the station from its neighbour, a mere 30 yards to the south, the ex-LD&ECR; station which it renamed .Both Clowne stations: via Picture the Past Passenger services Passenger services commenced on 1 November 1888. Initially the service of three trains each way, with a market day extra on Wednesdays and a Saturday evening extra, eastbound only. No service was ever provided on Sundays. All these trains plied between Mansfield and Chesterfield, calling at all stations to Elmton and Creswell, then Clown, Netherthorpe, Staveley and . A common thread between these stations is that every one of them was subsequently renamed at least once or, in the case of Whittington, relocated. The time taken for this sinuous journey was about an hour. By 1922 five trains a day, Monday to Saturday, plied the route, but this was the high-water mark. By 1952 only one train each way, Monday to Friday, served Clowne and Barlborough, timed to suit schools. It ran eastwards from Chesterfield in the morning as far as Elmton and Creswell, but was extended, unadvertised, to Shirebrook West during term time. This was reversed in the afternoons, starting unadvertised from Shirebrook West during term time, and from Elmton and Creswell on the public timetable. That service was withdrawn on 5 July 1954; the last train was operated, remarkably, by a brand new DMU. The station's goods facilities closed in July 1960, leaving its sole purpose excursions, such as for football matches, and Summer Saturday holiday traffic, notably from to . That called for the last time northbound on 11 August 1962, returning southbound the following Saturday. The last steam train to use the line was a non-stop enthusiasts' special on 16 October 1965. This train also traversed the Doe Lea Branch. Steam special through Clowne 1965 Freight Light engine movements and intermittent freight trains continued over the Clowne Branch until the early 1990s when an underground fire threatened to undermine the line, compounded by the expensive need to replace the points connecting the branch to what is now known as the Robin Hood Line at Elmton and Creswell. These points were replaced by plain line, as were those at Oxcroft Colliery Junction. Superb images of the area are available on lineOxcroft No.3 Signalbox: via signalboxes but note that, as the aerial view on the site shows, \\"Oxcroft Colliery No 3\\" signalbox was near Barlborough Colliery, not Oxcroft Colliery. Modern times A visit to several points along the branch on 20 July 2013 showed that the single track between Oxcroft Colliery through the station to Creswell Junction has been lifted and piles of concrete sleepers have been placed under road overbridges at Woodthorpe Road (between Shuttlewood and Mastin Moor) and immediately west of Clowne and Barlborough station site, to deter wheeled access to the trackbed. Overbridges remain Network Rail's responsibility and there is evidence of them undertaking maintenance. The trackbed and bridges remain intact and protected. Clowne and Barlborough station site was a riot of wild flowers. The western end of the lone platform can be identified, along with a fencing remnant. The platform as a whole can be identified by a clear difference in height from the trackbed. The station house is in private ownership and bears a former LD&ECR; clock on an outside wall, which could confuse the unwary. Yards west of the station site is the North Road overbridge. Immediately next to that bridge stands Clowne Methodist Church. The church's property is separated from railway property by a long fence in classic Midland Railway style. Possible Future The trackbed from Foxlow Junction to Seymour Junction and Oxcroft Disposal Point is protected as there remains the possibility of opencasting in the area. For example, in 2005 UK Coal (now Coalfield Resources), expressed an interest in extracting c530,000 tons near Mastin Moor.Potential opencasting: via coalfieldresources The Doe Lea line South from Seymour Junction to the former Markham Colliery (now known as \\"The Bolsover Branch\\") has been mothballed as it runs to the new Markham Vale Enterprise Zone at M1 Junction 29A. It is hoped that someone will invest in this infrastructure to create road-rail interchange facilities. The line through Clowne has not been removed or breached as it, too, might provide access to Markham Vale from a different direction.

The South Carolina Ports Authority (SCPA) was created by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1942 by Act No. 626 (Title 54 - Ports and Maritime Matters in South Carolina Code of Laws) as an instrumentality of the State possessing the powers of a body corporate.  Description of Operations  The South Carolina Ports Authority (SCPA) owns public port and transportation facilities in Charleston, North Charleston, Charleston County, Georgetown and Greer, South Carolina. The largest facilities are located in Charleston, where the SCPA operates five major ocean terminals capable of handling breakbulk and container shipments in addition to passenger vessels. All of SCPA's container terminal facilities are located at the Port of Charleston, where the primary focus is the movement of containerized shipments to and from the vessels calling the port. The Georgetown facility serves as a bulk and breakbulk facility. A previously run breakbulk facility in Port Royal facility was closed and transferred to the S.C. Department of Administration in 2016 to be sold. The role of the SCPA is as a terminal operator serving as receiver of export cargo from inland carriers and a receiver and dispatcher of import cargo. The SCPA is an operating port, as distinguished from a landlord port. The majority of the cargo and virtually all of the container cargo passing through the SCPA's facilities is bound for or originates from international destinations. In addition to national economic conditions, major factors affecting the SCPA's cargo volumes include global economic trends, currency exchange rates with overseas trading partners and consumer demand in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States.  Facilities   Port of Charleston  The South Carolina Ports Authority owns and operates five public marine terminals in the Port of Charleston. These facilities handle both containerized and non-containerized cargo, as well as cruise passengers. A sixth facility - the Hugh K. Leatherman Terminal - is a new container terminal at the former Charleston Navy Base under construction, with plans to open in 2021.  Port of Georgetown  A dedicated non-container port handling bulk and breakbulk cargo, the Port of Georgetown is located along the Sampit River adjacent to the Georgetown Steel Mill. the Port of Georgetown handles top commodities of steel, cement, aggregates, and forest products.  Inland Port Greer  Opened November 2013, the South Carolina Inland Port in Greer, SC extended the reach of the port more than 200 miles into the state's interior. Connected to the Port of Charleston via overnight rail offered by the Norfolk Southern, the inland port handles containerized goods to and from the fastest-growing part of the Southeast - the I-85 corridor.  Inland Port Dillon  Officials broke ground on Inland Port Dillon on March 10, 2017, and officially opened in April 2018. Located within the Carolinas I-95 Mega Site, Inland Port Dillon has close proximity to I-95, a critical transportation artery in the Southeast. The area is central to a significant base of existing Port users that represent base cargo opportunities for the facility. The initial phase is expected to handle at least 45,000 containers annually, offering overnight access to and from the Port of Charleston via an existing CSX mainline.SC Ports Breaks Ground on Inland Port Dillon  Economic Impact  A 2019 study by the University of South Carolina's Darla Moore School of Business concluded that the SCPA's statewide impacts include: * $63.4 billion in annual economic activity * 224,963 jobs * $12.8 billion in labor income * 10.2 percent of total annual gross state product * $1.1 billion in tax revenue  Capital Investment Plan  South Carolina Ports Authority plans to invest $1.6 billion in new and existing facilities through Fiscal Year 2022. The funding for the capital plan will be internally generated based on the Ports Authority's ability to borrow (in the form of revenue bonds) as well as its operating revenues. Additionally, the State of South Carolina has committed approximately $800 million in funding for port-related infrastructure projects in the works. These projects include a new dual-rail served container staging yard in North Charleston, a port access road tying the Ports Authority's new container terminal to I-26, as well as the state share of construction cost ($300 million) of the Charleston Harbor Deepening Project.  Governance  The South Carolina Ports Authority is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors, each appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate, along with two non-voting, ex-officio members - the state Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Transportation. They serve terms of seven years or until their successors have been appointed and qualified. A Review and Oversight Commission on the South Carolina State Ports Authority (ROCSPA), composed of members of the South Carolina General Assembly, was established in 2009. Despite its status as a public agency dedicated to the economic development of the State of South Carolina, the Ports Authority does not receive direct appropriations from the state for capital or operations expenses. Instead, the Ports Authority operates like a private business, and funds its operations and investment efforts through its own revenue stream and ability to issue bonds.SC Code of Laws Title 54  Leadership  Since its founding in 1942, the South Carolina Ports Authority has only had five leaders. * Cotesworth P.

The union with Teimuraz made her queen consort of Kakheti (1729‚Äì1736, 1738‚Äì1744). She was queen regnant of Kartli (1744‚Äì1746) in her own right under the name Tamar II.\\"Thamar II proclam√©e reine 1744\\", see Toumanoff (1990: 24). Biography Tamar was born to then-Prince Royal Vakhtang of Kartli and his Circassian wife Rusudan in 1696. Vakhtang ruled Kartli intermittently from 1703 until being forced by the Ottoman invasion into exile to the Russian Empire in 1724. At the age of 16, on 2 February 1712, Tamar married, as his second wife, Prince Royal Teimuraz of Kakheti, a younger brother of King David II of Kakheti (Imam Quli Khan). The wedding was lavishly celebrated in Vakhtang's capital city of Tbilisi and then in Manavi, Kakheti. The couple's subsequent life was marred by a civil strife, attacks by the Lezgians, and invasions from the Ottoman Empire and Persia. Teimuraz twice acceded to the throne of Kakheti, from 1729 to 1736 and again, from 1738 to 1744, when he resigned Kakheti to his son, Heraclius II, and established himself on the vacated throne of his in-laws in Kartli. During these years of turmoil, Tamar herself became involved in war and politics. During Teimuraz's absence at the headquarters of his Iranian suzerain, Nader Shah, in Kandahar from 1736 to 1738 Tamar counterbalanced the regency of Teimuraz's Muslim brother, Ali Mirza. She used her influence and the services of Prince Givi Cholokashvili to disrupt Ali Mirza's design for a revolt against Iran, thereby saving her husband and son from Nader's imminent revenge and eventually forcing Ali Mirza out of Kakheti in 1738. When Nader again summoned Teimuraz to his camp at Derbend in 1741, Tamar accompanied her husband, at the shah's request, as a proof of loyalty. Teimuraz succeeded in securing the shah's support for his dynastic ambitions in both Kartli and Kakheti, but this also invited a rebellion led by Prince Givi Amilakhvari. After three years of inconclusive fighting, the rebels were eventually defeated by Teimuraz, and Tamar in person accepted the courteous surrender of Amilakhvari in Surami in 1745. From 1744 until her death in 1746, Tamar was a co-regnant with her husband in Kartli, while their son, Heraclius, began his lengthy reign in Kakheti. Tamar was buried at the cathedral of Living Pillar in Mtskheta. After her death, Teimuraz married his third wife, Ana-Khanum Baratashvili. Children Teimuraz and Tamar were the parents of one son and three daughters: * Heraclius II (November 7, 1720 ‚Äì January 11, 1798), the king of Kakheti and of Kartli and Kakheti. * Princess Ketevan (Khoreshan), who married, in 1737 at Mashhad, Adil Shah of Iran (1719‚Äì1749). * Princess Elene (fl. 1743‚Äì1784), who married, c. 1743, Prince Zaza Tsitsishvili. * Princess Ana (1720 ‚Äì December 4, 1788), who married firstly, in 1744, Prince Dimitri Orbeliani (died 1776) and secondly Prince Ioane Orbeliani (c. 1702 ‚Äì 1781).

These were individually economically underdeveloped, and it was suggested that some form of association would result both in cost savings and their more rapid development. The Commission recommended an administrative union of the East African mainland territories, possibly to be joined later by the Central African ones. It also proposed that the legislatures of each territory should continue and saw any form of self-government as being a long- term aspiration. It did however reject the possibility of the European minorities in Kenya or Northern Rhodesia establishing political control in those territories, and rejected the claim of Kenyan Asians for the same voting rights as Europeans. Although the Commission's recommendations on an administrative union were not followed immediately, closer ties in East Africa were established in the 1940s. However, in Central Africa, its report had the effect of encouraging European settlers to seek closer association with Southern Rhodesia, in what became in 1953 the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Background to the Commission In 1914, a number of territories on East and Central Africa were under British sovereignty, but they were neither united nor administered in the same way. The East Africa Protectorate, or Kenya, had originally been the subject of a grant to a Chartered company, the Imperial British East Africa Company in 1888, but when the company began to fail it was taken over as a British protectorate in July 1895. Uganda, which had become a British protectorate in 1894. Zanzibar became a British protectorate in 1890, but retained a Sultan as ruler.Institute of Curriculum Development, (1988). East Africa from 1850 to the Present, pp. 25‚Äì7. Nyasaland had been a British protectorate since 1891, but Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia were administered by another Chartered company, the British South Africa Company, under a Royal Charter dating from 1889.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 210‚Äì11. Germany possessed German East Africa from 1885 to 1918, but after the First World War, Britain received a League of Nations mandate in 1922 over what was renamed Tanganyika Territory.Institute of Curriculum Development, (1988). East Africa from 1850 to the Present, p. 34. Also in 1922, a referendum was held in Southern Rhodesia in which the white minority electorate chose responsible government as an internally self- governing colony, rather than entry into the Union of South Africa. British South Africa Company rule in Northern Rhodesia ended in 1924, when it became a British protectorate.E A Walter, (1963). The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories, Cambridge University Press pp. 690‚Äì1. These changes resulted in a continuous block of British-controlled territories from the Zambezi northwards in which, following the principles first set out in 1923 by the Duke of Devonshire, who was then Colonial Secretary, the interests of Africans would be treated as paramount. However, the next Conservative Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery later attempted to qualify this principle, and gave tacit encouragement to the aspirations of non-native immigrant communities hoping to obtain a degree of self-government following the model of Southern Rhodesia. In Northern Rhodesia, the tiny white community aimed for a similar constitutional position to that in Southern Rhodesia.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 210‚Äì11, 217. In Kenya Colony, which was formed in 1920 from the former East Africa Protectorate, there was a significant immigrant community from British India, and a smaller Arab one, as well as a European community. From 1905, one Indian was nominated to the Kenya Legislative Council to represent Asian interests. In 1919, when Europeans became able to elect members to the Kenya Legislative Council, Asians were excluded from the franchise. The offer of a second nominated Indian seat on that council was refused in 1920 as unrepresentative of the size and economic strength of the India community. In 1927, India representation was increased to five members, of whom four were nominated, compared with eleven members elected by Europeans. There was also one nominated Arab member' and African interests on the Legislative Council were represented by a single nominated Europeans. Up to twenty official Legislative Council members, all but one European, could outvote the 18 communal representatives. There were then no Africans in the council, and the representatives of both the European and Indian immigrant communities opposed both their admission and any increase in African representation there.R G Gregory, (1971). India and East Africa: a history of race relations within the British Empire, 1890‚Äì1939, pp. 90, 179, 271, 310. The Commission's objectives The East and Central Africa territories were individually rather small and economically underdeveloped, so some form of association could result in cost savings. The inter-communal problems in Kenya were also of concern, so in 1927 the Colonial Secretary decided that these matters should be examined.Royal Institute of International Affairs, (1929). The Hilton-Young and Wilson Reports on East Africa p. 267-8. The Hilton Young Commission on Closer Union of the Dependencies of East and Central Africa, was a Commission of Inquiry appointed in late 1927 by the Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery, and it reported to him in January 1929. Its chairman was Edward Hilton Young, later 1st Baron Kennet, and it included Sir Reginald Mant, a former Financial Secretary to the Government of India, Sir George Ernest Schuster, a barrister and former Financial Secretary to the Government of Sudan, and J. H. Oldham, the Secretary of the International Missionary Council. The terms of reference, in abbreviated form, were: (1) To make recommendations on whether federation or another form of closer union could lead to more effective co-operation between the different Central and Eastern African governments, in particular on developing transport and communications, customs tariffs and administration, scientific research and defence; (2) To consider which territories could now or in the future be brought within any closer union, considering the League of Nations Mandate over Tanganyika Territory; (3) To make recommendations on changes in the powers and composition of the Legislative Councils of these territories: (a) as the result of forming any Federal Council or other common authority; (b) to associate the immigrant communities more closely in government; and (c) to secure more direct representation of native interests; (4) To suggest how the Dual Policy recommended by the Conference of East African Governors could best be applied in the political as well as the economic sphere. (5) To make recommendations on what improvements may be required in internal communications between the various territories to facilitate the working of federation or closer union. (6) To report on the financial aspects of any proposals they may make. Hilton Young Commission Report pp, 2‚Äì6. https://www.scribd.com/doc/74835698/CAB-24-201-Report-of-the-Commission-on- Closer-Union-of-the-Dependencies-in-Eastern-and-Central-Africa-1929 General recommendations The Commission interpreted its instructions as raising two main questions: (1) Should there be either federation or a closer form of union between the territories of Eastern and Central Africa to secure more effective co-operation between them? and (2) What form of constitution is suitable for those territories in which non-native immigrant communities have become permanently domiciled? It concluded that to achieve effective co- operation, a coherent \\"native policy\\" was required. The principles of this policy should be applied uniformly in all the territories, although adapted to different local circumstances. Secondly, the relationship between the indigenous African population and the immigrant communities had to be defined. If those immigrant communities were to be given a political role, they could not be allowed to change the terms of that native policy. Co-operation in transport and communications, customs, defence and research were of much less significance.Royal Institute of International Affairs, (1929). The Hilton- Young and Wilson Reports on East Africa p. 267. The \\"Dual Policy\\" referred to in the fourth term of reference was that proposed by Lord Lugard in his book \\"The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa\\". In colonies where climate and geography precluded extensive European settlement, Lugard suggested that their development must benefit their indigenous population as well as the economic interests of the colonial power. He recognised African interests as paramount, but encouraged settlement by immigrants if their interests did not conflict with those of the indigenous population. In East Africa, particularly in Kenya, the policy was complicated by the existence and political aspirations of both European and Asian settlers. The Commissioners considered that the policy of the British government towards both indigenous and immigrant communities should be agreed by all political parties.B. Malinowski, (1929). Report of the Commission on Closer Union of the Dependencies in Eastern and Central Africa, p. 317. The \\"Dual Policy\\" and \\"native policy\\" both required the creation and maintenance of resources for African development. The Report said that this should be the first duty of the government of each territory: only after this should any surplus be used to promote immigrant enterprises. The Commissioners considered that the first requirement was for indigenous communities to have sufficient land to maintain a reasonable living standard using traditional agriculture methods. This land should be reserved for the African population and protected from encroachment by immigrants. They also thought it was necessary to deal with land tenure, and anticipated a change from communal landholding to individual tenure. The Commission also considered labour issues, demanding a limit on the recruitment of more than a fixed percentage if workers as migrant labour and insisting on the inspection of work contracts and conditions.Hilton Young Commission Report, pp. 41‚Äì8.B. Malinowski, (1929). Report of the Commission on Closer Union of the Dependencies in Eastern and Central Africa, pp. 317‚Äì9 After considering the need to promote African development, the Commission reviewed the options for federation or closer union. It rejected any idea of an immediate formal federation in favour of increased regional co-operation. The Report envisaged the creation of a Central Executive Authority who would at first be a High Commissioner relying on existing administrative structures and later a Governor-General supported by an administrative Secretariat. This Central Authority would exercise a more effective supervisory and co-ordinating control on policy matters than was possible from London. The Commissioners emphasised the success of their recommendations depended on the relaxation of Colonial Office control of local legislatures, although Colonial Office officials would still set-out the main lines of policy. They proposed an initial period in which Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika would co-operate, using the existing East African Governors' Conference (which had been formed in 1926) and its secretariat to advise the Central Authority. In a second stage, representatives from Zanzibar, Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia would join and the Governor-General's Secretariat would be strengthened. The Commission suggested that the local legislatures would remain and that no central legislature would be created.Royal Institute of International Affairs, (1929). The Hilton-Young and Wilson Reports on East Africa, pp. 267‚Äì71. East Africa The Commission considered each East African territory in turn. For Kenya, it argued that there was no immediate possibility of the European minority ever achieving responsible government, but the issue of the political role of the immigrant communities had to be clarified. Hilton Young, in a minority opinion, suggested that responsible government could be achieved with elected European members forming the largest group in the Kenya Legislative Council, with one-third of seats, but this was opposed by the other Commissioners. Uganda presented no major problem and the Commission reported that nothing in its proposals conflicted with the League of Nations mandate for Tanganyika, which specifically allowed for an administrative union or federation with neighbouring territories. However, all legislation affecting Tanganyika needed to be scrutinised by the League of Nations Mandates Committee, whether it originated from the Tanganyika legislature or from any new central legislature. The Commissioners noted the differences between Zanzibar and the mainland territories, but also common interests. They suggested that Zanzibar could be associated with any Central Authority, without becoming a full member of any union.Hilton Young Commission Report, pp. 182‚Äì4, 201‚Äì3, 223‚Äì5, 228‚Äì31, 248. The Commission's final problem for East African was of the composition of the Legislative Council in Kenya and of the political claims made by the non-native inhabitants of this Colony. Their difficulty was to reconcile legitimate African political aspirations with the claims of politically-minded non-native settlers. It argued that, as the Legislative Council was the principal forum for the discussion of affairs and the place where laws were enacted, it must give to every race and interest a sense that their views were considered and safeguarded. It considered that a common electoral roll was impracticable, and that, as the Council was an advisory body, the number of community representatives was unimportant, provided those representatives were of sufficient strength and competence to express the views of their community. The Commission considered an Indian claim for a common electoral franchise in Kenya, based on level of civilisation rather than race or, failing that, an increased representation for the Asian community. It could not recommend a common franchise, but advocated increased Asian representation, and also an increase in nominations to represent African interests, including nominating persons of African descent, probably drawn from native Councils in Kenya.Hilton Young Commission Report, pp 204‚Äì10.Royal Institute of International Affairs, (1929). The Hilton-Young and Wilson Reports on East Africa, pp. 270‚Äì72. Central Africa The Commission's terms of reference also covered the possibility of a closer association between Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the territories of East Africa to the north. When Southern Rhodesia received responsible government in 1923, the administration of Northern Rhodesia was transferred from British South Africa Company to the Colonial Office, but both territories retained important links with each other and they faced the same problems of labour procurement and transport costs. The reaction of the settlers in Northern Rhodesia to the possibility of links with East Africa was that they preferred the \\"white south\\", which in this case meant Southern Rhodesia, as a partner.C Leys and C Pratt, (1960) A New Deal in Central Africa, p. 4. Although the majority of the Hilton Young Commission stressed the connection between Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and East Africa, the chairman, Sir Edward Hilton Young, felt that the main economic and political interests of the two territories lay in association with Southern Rhodesia. He stressed the existing transport links between Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia and the lack of such links between Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and East Africa, and the importance of Southern Rhodesia as an employer of workers from the two territories to its north. He was impressed by Southern Rhodesian arguments on a closer relationship with Northern Rhodesia, and proposed a form of closer association in which the Governor of Southern Rhodesia would become High Commissioner for the two northern territories. He also suggested that Northern Rhodesia should be partitioned, with the central, more economically advanced, portion being united with Southern Rhodesia. The majority of the Commission rejected both any form of union with Southern Rhodesia and partition. They emphasised the links that Nyasaland in particular had with East Africa and the unsuitability of much of the northern territories for European settlement. They considered that the British government could finance a rail connection from to Northern Rhodesia to Tanganyika, rather than relying on transport links through Southern Rhodesia and its congested port of Beira.H.

Subsequent events Despite the recommendation of Hilton Young Commission, that a union of East African territories was desirable, the British government decided against forming an East African union immediately, mainly on cost grounds. However, the progress that had started with the formation of the East African Governors Conference in 1926 continued with the joint East African Income Tax Board and the Joint Economic Council, both in 1940. In 1947 the East African High Commission was established as a joint administrative organisation, along the lines proposed by the Commission almost two decades earlier. The British government took no action to build the rail connection from to Northern Rhodesia to Tanganyika envisaged by the Commission, and no steps to link the administration of Central Africa to that of East Africa.Treaty for the Establishment of the East African Community (1999), Preamble http://www4.worldbank.org/afr/ssatp/Resources/HTML/legal_review/Annexes_fr/Annexes%20V_fr/Annexe%20V-11.pdfB Raftopoulos and A S Mlambo, editors (2009) Becoming Zimbabwe: A History from the Pre-colonial Period to 2008, pp. 86‚Äì7. The opposition of the British government to the partition of Northern Rhodesia proposed in Sir Edward Hilton Young's minority report and the majority report's promotion of links between Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and East Africa led the Southern Rhodesian government to accept that Northern Rhodesia would have to be absorbed as a whole or left as a separate territory. It took comfort from the minority opinion that the main economic and political interests of these two territories lay in association with Southern Rhodesia.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 214‚Äì5. In Northern Rhodesia, the efforts of the Colonial Office to protect and promote African interests were frustrated by the resistance of settler groups. These opposed the government's role in African education and supported the legal exclusion Africans from many administrative jobs. The principle of the paramountcy of African interests was entirely rejected by the majority of Northern Rhodesian settlers.I N. Moles, (1961). Race and Politics, p. 90. As the Commission's Report appeared to rule out responsible government for Northern Rhodesia by itself, in February 1928, two Northern Rhodesia settler representatives approached the Southern Rhodesian government to discuss terms for amalgamation. The terms offered were generous, including a high level of representation for them in a combined parliament, guaranteed ministerial office in any combined government and other concessions.C Leys and C Pratt, (1960) A New Deal In Central Africa, pp.4‚Äì5. In June 1930, the Colonial Secretary of the Labour Government, Lord Passfield, published his Memorandum on native policy in East Africa in June 1930. His statement of colonial policy was an emphatic reassertion of the principle of paramountcy of African interests, and he dismissed settler aspirations of self-government in Kemya and Northern Rhodesia. This had the effect of pushing Northern Rhodesian Europeans towards union with Southern Rhodesia.H.

He is a founding partner of the media consulting firm McMahon Squier and Associates and is also a founding partner of Purple Strategies, a bipartisan communications firm.  Early life  Mark Squier is the son of media consultant Bob Squier. As a teenager, Squier was introduced to his father's profession when he was hired by his father to carry and transport camera equipment for various political campaigns.  Career   Early political work  In 1978, Squier worked with his father on Bob Graham‚Äôs campaign for governor of Florida and was later hired as lead producer at Squier/Eskew Communications, a firm his father helped found. During his time with his father's firm, Squier produced advertisements for local and national candidates including former Texas Governor Ann Richards, then-Tennessee Senator Al Gore, Iowa Senator Tom Harkin and Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.  McMahon Squier and Associates  In 1991, Squier left Squier/Eskew Communications and co-founded Trippi McMahon and Squier, a media consulting firm, with Steve McMahon and Joe Trippi. The firm worked on local, national, and international political campaigns including that of Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in 1993. Three years later, the firm produced advertisements for the senatorial campaigns of Ron Wyden of Oregon, Mark Warner of Virginia, and John Kitzhaber's campaign for governor of Oregon. Also in 1996, Squier worked with Robert Weygand on his successful congressional primary campaign against fellow Democrat Joe Paolino, who had hired Squier's father Bob Squier as a media consultant. Squier's firm also worked with John Baldacci, including producing advertisements for his 2002 campaign for governor of Maine. In 2004, Squier, along with his partner McMahon, were hired as senior political strategists for former Vermont Governor Howard Dean's presidential campaign. The same year, the Media Fund hired Squier‚Äôs firm to be its lead advertising agency. Two years later, the firm developed advertisements for John Sarbanes' congressional campaign in Maryland. During the mid-2000s, Squier's firm changed names several times. In 2004, Joe Trippi left the firm, which was then renamed McMahon Squier and Associates. From 2007 to 2008, John Lapp joined the firm as a partner and the firm's name was changed to McMahon Squier Lapp and Associates. Following Lapp's departure, the firm returned to the name McMahon Squier and Associates. Other clients of Squier's firm include the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in both 2006 and 2008, and the House Majority Super PAC in 2012.  Purple Strategies  In 2008, Squier became a founding partner at Purple Strategies, a bipartisan communications firm located in Alexandria, Virginia. Other founding partners include Alex Castellanos, Bruce Haynes, and Steve McMahon. Current and former Purple Strategies clients include BP, Time Warner Cable, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, and the United States Chamber of Commerce.

Career Bithell credits his high school history teacher for helping him to get into games programming: when their class was given an essay assignment, Bithell asked instead if he could make a point-and-click adventure game about the topic in lieu of an essay. The teacher was impressed with the work and allowed Bithell to continue to present games instead of essays for the class. Bithell independently developed an early version of the Thomas Was Alone video game in 2010 while working for Blitz Games, where he was a junior designer, and later a level designer on games such as Tak and the Guardians of Gross, Invincible Tiger: The Legend of Han Tao, iCarly and Dead to Rights: Retribution, from 2007 to 2011. He developed the prototype game in 24 hours and released it for free online through the Kongregate website, receiving 100,000 'plays' in the first week. He joined Bossa Studios in February 2011, working to expand the flash-based Thomas to a full title and learning how to use the Unity engine in his time there. The full game was released on 30 June 2012 and went on to sell over a million copies, winning a BAFTA at the 9th British Academy Games Awards in the \\"Best Performer\\" category (for narrator Danny Wallace) and receiving a further two nominations (\\"Best Original Music\\" and \\"Best Story\\"). He left Bossa in January 2013 to \\"concentrate on indie development\\". He has since worked on a Robin Hood-based stealth game named Volume, which was released on 18 August 2015 for Windows, OS X, and PlayStation 4 and Vita platforms. In 2016, Bithell released EarthShape, a virtual reality game for Google Daydream. Bithell collaborated with composer Russell Shaw and animator Tim Borelli on the project. The game featured voice acting from British comedian Sue Perkins. In August 2017, Bithell released a new game Subsurface Circular, a first of what he calls \\"Bithell Shorts\\" that are designed as short, focused narrative games. In May 2018, Bithell released another short titled Quarantine Circular. Bithell is the lead developer behind John Wick Hex, a video game based on the John Wick film series. Bithell has gained significant notability in the video game industry due both to the unexpected success of Thomas and also for his views on the current industry as a whole. He has outlined the problems for fellow indie developers producing mobile games, commenting on the suitability of free-to-play mechanics for indie gaming and other issues.

The Order of the Griffon (German: Greifenorden) was a State Order of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Established on 15 September 1884, it was created to honour benevolence and outstanding service to the public. In August 1904, the Order of the Griffon was extended to citizens of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with the rulers of the two grand duchies serving jointly as the Grand Masters of the order. Classes The Order of the Griffon was awarded in three classes with six grades: ;First class *Grand Cross ;Second class * Grand Commander's Cross * Commander's Cross * Honour Cross (or Officer's Cross) ;Third class * Knight's Cross with Crown * Knight's Cross Appearance The badge of the order was a red enameled maltese cross, outlined in gold. On the centre of the cross is a disc with a golden griffon surrounded by a gold ring. The Grand Cross badge was worn at the left hip, hanging from a 4 in wide sash that goes over the right shoulder. The Grand Commander's and Commander's Cross badges were worn suspended from the neck on a narrower ribbon. These badges were slightly smaller than the Grand Cross badge, but otherwise identical in appearance. The Honour Cross was smaller still and did not have the gold ring surrounding the griffon in the centre.

She was executed for murdering her spouse, son and daughter in order to marry her lover. Life Metta Fock was the daughter of quartermaster noble Axel Erik Ridderbjelke and Helena Margareta Gripenmark. In 1783, she married the noble sergeant Henrik Johan Fock (1757-1802). The marriage was arranged. The couple had several children, four of whom, two daughters and two sons, were alive by 1800. The couple lived on the estate Lilla Gisslaved in Trevattna parish in V√§sterg√∂tland. It was a small farm with only one tenant, and their economic standard was very low for members of the nobility. The mental capacity of Henrik Johan Fock was restricted. He was described as \\"very foolish, though not insane\\",Henrik Fock: Sl√§kten Fock: personer och h√§ndelser under 450 √•r which was reportedly why he never advanced from the rank of sergeant: he was not able to manage the affairs of the farm, and Metta Fock therefore had her husband placed under the guardianship of her brother and took over the management herself. Metta Fock was rumored in the parish to have a lover, the married sergeant and game keeper Johan F√§gercrantz, who often visited Lilla Gisslaved and to whom she often sent letters. The messengers she sent to deliver the letters were always illiterate, but later claimed to have showed them to a major, who read them and later testified that they included love poems. Gossip also claimed that Johan F√§gercrantz had abused Johan Fock physically during one of his visits. Deaths In June 1802, Metta Fock's eldest son, the thirteen year old Claes, her three year old deaf mute daughter Charlotta, and finally her spouse Henrik Johan, all died within a couple of days after having experienced violent vomiting, temporarily improvement, followed by a hasty death. After their death, Metta Fock left home and spent a couple of days with her eldest daughter's fiance and then at the Norwegian border, before she returned. This caused rumors that she had murdered her spouse and her children in order to marry her lover. These events, coupled with the rumors of her love affair, resulted in a suggestion from the local l√§nsman to have an autopsy performed on the remains of her spouse. This demand was denied because it was deemed unnecessary, and the funeral was conducted. However, the governor gave order that the autopsy was to be conducted anyway and that the corpse was to be exhumed. The doctor, however, only looked at the corpse in the coffin and decided that it was impossible to conduct the autopsy because of the decay. After this, baron Adam Fock of H√∂ver√∂, the patriarch of the Fock family and her late spouse's cousin's nephew, had an autopsy performed by a doctor from Skara. He did so without asking for permission from the authorities, and offered the doctor a sizable sum if the result of the autopsy proved poisoning. Trial Metta Fock was arrested and accused of having murdered her spouse and two children with arsenic in order to marry her lover. She denied the charges. Fock was denied contact with the outside world during her arrest. She was repeatedly questioned, but denied contact with a defense lawyer. She called her own witnesses and tried to prove that there were maggots in the remains, which was known not to be present in the remains of the victims of arsenic poisoning, and that there had been measles present in the parish at the time of the deaths. In April 1804, Johan F√§gercrantz admitted to having an affair with her, but denied any knowledge of any murder. Johan F√§gercrantz was sentenced to 28 days on water and bread for fornication and adultery. In April 1805, a majority of the members of the court judged her guilt \\"more than half proven\\". However, Fock refused to confess and maintained her own version of events. A law at the time allowed for an accused person who could not be judged guilty but was regarded as dangerous for society to be kept prisoner awaiting their confession. This law was used for Metta Fock. She protested to the monarch and was granted a reprieve and allowed to summon more witnesses to her defense; however, the prison sentence was confirmed in November 1805. In 1806, she was placed as a prisoner at Carlsten awaiting her confession. She was the only female prisoner ever to be kept at Carlsten, which normally only housed male prisoners. She was kept in an isolation cell, and tended only by two priests, who were to encourage her to confess the truth. Imprisonment and execution On 10 December 1805, during her time in prison, Metta Fock made a message of appeal by embroidery on 27 bits of linen cloth which she had sewn together, as she was not granted the right to pen and paper. In it, she stated her innocence and complained about the treatment she had received. The appeal came to be in the possession of Sophie Adlersparre, who donated it to Nordiska museet in her will, where it is still kept. In April 1809, she confessed to her guilt. She later retracted her confession and started to defend herself again, but without success. She was sentenced to be executed by decapitation followed by burning; prior to this, her hand was to be cut off. The execution took place on 7 November 1810 at F√§gredsmon in V√§sterg√∂tland.  Metta Fock in fiction The case was described in the book Trefalt mord? ('Trice Murder?') by the lawyer Yngve Lyttkens (1996), who describes the investigation and trial as partial, the confession of Fock as doubtful, and Metta Fock as a potential victim of a miscarriage of justice. A song is dedicated to her by Stefan Andersson in the album Skeppsr√•ttan (2009). She is the main subject of the novel Mercurium by Ann Rosman (2012), in which she is portrayed as innocent.

These are based on procurement of some 1,200 providers and 13,000 services, including both cloud services and (professional) specialist services as of November 2013.  Overview  Cloud computing caused a significant change in the way information systems can be delivered. Given this, the UK Government initiated the G-Cloud programme of work to deliver computing based capability (from fundamental resources such as storage and processing to full-fledged applications) using cloud computing. G-Cloud established framework agreements with a large number of service providers; and lists those services on a publicly accessible portal known as the Digital Marketplace. Public Sector organisations can call off the services listed on the Digital Marketplace without needing to go through a full tender process. After plans were announced in March 2011, the government aimed to shift 50% of new government IT spending to cloud based services by 2015. Furthermore, the government established a \\"Cloud First\\" approach to IT, mandating that central government purchases IT services through the cloud unless it can be proven that an alternative is more cost effective. In June 2013 G-Cloud moved to become part of Government Digital Service (GDS) with the director Denise McDonagh moving to be CTO of the Home Office. Tony Singleton, COO of GDS, took over as director of G-Cloud. A new version of the G-Cloud framework is normally released about every 6 to 9 months. G-Cloud version 9 went live in May 2017; as of November 2017, the release date for version 10 had not been finalised.  Framework agreements   Calls  G-Cloud had several calls for contract to establish framework agreements. Major US vendors Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google were initially excluded by the UK government in 2012 (G-Cloud 3) but AWS has since been added in 2013 (G-Cloud 4) and Google in 2018 (ref). Following hints by the head of the programme, GDS chief operating officer Tony Singleton, that the call for G-Cloud 4 would be open by the \\"end of July\\", the G-Cloud 4 call opened on the 6 August 2013. The blog entry also stated that the tendering process has been improved, with the use of the Government Procurement Service. G-Cloud stated it expects to make calls roughly every three to six months, but with no fixed frequency. Contract calls are listed on the Government Contract Finder website. In April 2013 the G-Cloud V call for framework contracts was listed as starting in March 2014. G-Cloud V opened on 25 February 2014. The press noted the name of the G-Cloud call for framework agreements moved from suffixing the call with Roman numerals (G-Cloud I, II and III) to using the Arabic numeral 4.  Classifications  Suppliers define the service that they are offering as part of the framework agreement, and those details will be made available in the Digital Marketplace. These details include such things as Business Impact Level (e.g. IL2) that the service is accredited for, and how users will be on- boarded and off-boarded. In particular is the requirement to enable users to leave the service (off-board) if they wish to move to a different provider of the same service. As of G-Cloud 9, services are classified into 3 lots: * Lot 1: Cloud Hosting (IaaS) and (PaaS): Cloud platform or infrastructure services that can help buyers do at least 1 of: deploy, manage and run software and provision and use processing, storage or networking resources * Lot 2: Cloud Software (SaaS): Applications that are typically accessed over a public or private network e.g. the internet and hosted in the cloud * Lot 3: Cloud Support  Digital Marketplace  The Digital Marketplace (previously CloudStore) is a publicly accessible, searchable database of services offered under G-Cloud. The first service was offered in February 2012. Following criticism of the original CloudStore interface, CloudStore was substantially reworked by May 2013. In 2014, the Government Digital Service announced it would be replacing the CloudStore with a new platform called the \\"Digital Marketplace\\", currently in beta. The Digital Marketplace aims to integrate the Digital Services framework in 2015 and ultimately other framework contracts. Services can be searched by free text search as well as by continual narrowing of the field using various search criteria such as business impact level supported, cost, deployment model (e.g. Public Cloud, Private Cloud).  Procurement  The Digital Marketplace procurement processes handle selection and procurement of services. They do not replace internal processes for securing funds. However, assuming funds are available, procurement from the Digital Marketplace does not require a full tender or mini-competition.

This observation was first coined by Mickey Gilley in his song, \\"Don't the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time\\" in 1975. Subsequently, it caught the attention of social psychologists who used scientific testing to gather evidence in support of the idea. The first experiment James W. Pennebaker et al. (1979) conducted the first experiment testing this observation. Using 52 males and 51 females as subjects at three bars near a college campus, experimenters asked individuals the following question: \\"On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates 'not attractive', 5 indicates 'average', and 10 indicates 'extremely attractive,' how would you rate the opposite-sex individuals here tonight.\\" The experimenters took this survey at 9:00 pm, 10:30 pm and at midnight. Results showed that individuals' perception of people's attractiveness in the bar increased the later it got. Theory The freedom of potentially going home with someone in the bar is threatened as the night comes closer to ending, according to the reactance theory (Brehm, 1966). Pennebaker et al. (1979) also suggested dissonance theory as an explanation, proposing that as the night progresses, individuals intention to leave with someone becomes stronger. However, leaving the bar with someone who they may find unattractive causes dissonance, increasing the perceived attractiveness of the potential mate. Other studies Following the first study performed by Pennebaker et al. in 1979, Nida and Koon (1983) found evidence of the closing time effect in a country and western bar but did not find it in a campus bar. Gladue and Delaney (1990) found that individuals of the opposite gender became more attractive as a factor of time, but that photos of the opposite gender did not. They found that male participants rated the most attractive photos higher but ratings of the least attractive photos also decreased. Females showed no changes over time in their photo ratings of males. Madey, Simo, Dillworth, and Kemper (1996) found the effect in a nightclub near a university, but only for participants not in a relationship. The authors argued that only participants not in a relationship should experience a threat to their choice of companion. Sprecher et al. (1984) did not find a closing-time effect. The effect of alcohol Johnco, Wheeler and Taylor (2010) measured the attractiveness of participants over a night while also controlling for the effect of alcohol consumption by measuring their blood alcohol content with a breathalyzer each time that they measured individuals' perceptions of physical attractiveness. They used BAC as a time varying covariate in a repeated measures design, with 87 participants at a beachside pub in Sydney, Australia on four consecutive Saturday nights, between 9 pm and 12 am. They found that both perceptions of attractiveness as well as BAC increased as a factor of time. They concluded that BAC explained a significant portion of the increase in opposite-sex attractiveness but that a substantial effect remains after adjusting for BAC. Other possible explanations One other possible explanation about the cause of this perception of higher attractiveness is \\"mere familiarity or exposure\\" (Zajonc, 1968). Previously seen stimuli may be perceived more positively than new stimuli. Another explanation comes from the commodity theory (Brock, 1968). According to commodity theory, as people find mates in the bar and leave with them, there is a scarcity of individuals left in the bar. This scarcity increases the desirability and perceived attractiveness of those left in the bar. References # Brehm, J. W. (1966). A theory of psychological reactance. New York: Academic. # Gilley, M.

Wreck of Royal Tar Ship career Royal Tar was the first steamer on the route between St. John, Eastport and Portland, Maine. It was built at the shipyard of William and Isaac Olive, Carleton, and launched in November 1835. Last voyage On sailing from its berth at Peter's wharf, Eastport on October 21, the ship had a crew of 21, and 70 passengers, including a number of women and children. The passenger list was larger than usual, as it had the members of a menagerie, Burgess and Dexter's Zoological Institute, managed by a Mr. Fuller. The animals included an elephant, two camels, and a variety of captive beasts and birds. There was also a large waxwork exhibit and a huge show wagon called an omnibus, as well as wagons required for carrying the cages, with the horses needed to pull them. Two of the ship's four lifeboats were offloaded to make room for the animals. There was heavy weather along the coast in the latter part of October 1836, and when Royal Tar left Eastport on the evening of October 21, the wind was blowing so hard from the westward that the steamer put into Little River (near Cutler) for safety. The gale continued for three days, but on the afternoon of October 24, another attempt was made to resume the voyage. Finding a heavy sea outside and the wind still from the westward, the steamer put into Machias Bay and again came to anchor, remaining until midnight, when the wind shifted to the northwest and the voyage was again resumed. Fire At about 1:30 on the afternoon of October 25, the engineer reported that the water had been allowed to get too low in the boiler. On hearing this report, the captain ordered the engine stopped and the safety valve opened, the steamer being brought to anchor about from the Fox Islands, in Penobscot Bay. The fire in the furnace was extinguished, but in about a half hour, the steamer was found to be on fire under the deck over the boiler, near the animal cages. An effort was made to extinguish the flames by means of a hose attached to the pump, but it proved fruitless. The fire spread rapidly and soon consumed the firefighting equipment. Rescue The ship only had two lifeboats remaining. Captain Reed and two of the crew, lowered the small boat at the stern and got into it, in order to prepare rafts and save as many people as possible. Sixteen able- bodied men lowered the second and larger boat and rowed away, until they reached Isle au Haut. The steamer endeavored to make for the nearest land. Captain Reed stood by with the boat, and as the terrified passengers began to jump overboard, was able to save several lives. Of the animals, only the two horses survived. The fire was seen by the US revenue cutter Veto, which reached the scene half an hour later. The schooner's boats were small and of little use to the rescue. Captain Reed and his men, however, used their boat to rescue about 40 more persons. Despite their efforts, 32 lives were lost. Aftermath On November 12, a schooner arriving at Portland reported having passed the remains of a burned steamer near Cash's Ledge. A traveler's trunk, with about $90 in it was picked up at sea. This was the only trace of the ship recovered, although debris was later spotted. Four men, nine women and ten children were lost. Several of the men became well known locally in the later years, including Andrew Garrison, Captain John Hammond, John Ansley, George Eaton, James H. Fowler, and W. H. Harrison. Stinson Patten, of Fredericton, and J. T. Sherwood, British consul at Portland, were also among the saved. The passengers continued on to Portland. The ship was uninsured and the total loss was estimated at about $100,000. The captain, with others of the crew, reached St. John on the following Saturday, where he learned that his son had died on the same day as the fire. Captain Reed became harbormaster of St. John in 1841, and died in August 1860. For a number of years it was the custom of the St. John men who survived the disaster to take supper together on the anniversary of the fire. Treasure The ship's safe, containing a large number of gold and silver coins, was forgotten during the rescue attempt. Subsequent efforts to find either the wreckage or the safe have proven fruitless.

He served as the head football coach at two high schools in Jacksonville, Florida, Robert E. Lee High School from 1972 to 1988 and the Bolles School from 1989 to 2016. Youth Rogers was born in Bay City, Michigan where his father was stationed in 1943, but the family soon returned to Florida. His nickname ‚ÄúCorky‚Äù came from his father, Chuck, who read about World War II hero Colin Kelly from Madison, Florida who called his own son Corky. Chuck worked 20 years as a correspondent for Associated Press before beginning a career with the City of Jacksonville in the Recreation Department. There was a strong father-son tradition in the Rogers family. Chuck was a member of Robert E. Lee High School's first graduating class and played football there. Corky also graduated from Lee High School in 1961 where he was a three-sport athlete, playing for the Generals‚Äô 1960 unofficial state championship football team, the 1961 baseball state championship team and the basketball team. Chuck was football captain in his senior year at the University of Florida and Corky wanted to do likewise. Unfortunately, Florida wasn't interested in Corky, so he enrolled at the Florida Military Academy prep school and spent a year under coaching icon Willard ‚ÄúDub‚Äù Palmer. Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Dodd offered Rogers a scholarship, so he became a Yellow Jacket. Rogers was a quarterback on the Tech freshman team, a varsity defensive back for two seasons, then a wide receiver for his senior year in 1965. Coach Dodd made a big impression on the young Rogers and he told this story at an interview: > ‚ÄúYears later, (Coach Dodd) was down here for an alumni reception at a hotel > out at the beach. My wife and I went out to see him. He was on the balcony > where this elderly woman was serving boiled shrimp. Coach Dodd said, > ‚ÄòY‚Äùknow, if you tell that lady her hair looks nice, you‚Äôre not going to run > out of boiled shrimp all night, and what‚Äôve you done? Something honest, fair > and nice. Do that and people are going to want to do something nice for > you.‚Äô > That‚Äôs the best coaching lesson I ever got.\\" Rogers was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in 1966, but his college deferral had expired, so he was required to serve a year of active military duty in the Army Reserve. He was back in Baltimore the next season, but with receivers like Raymond Berry, Jimmy Orr and John Mackey on the roster, Rogers didn't make the final cut. He began playing semi-pro football in Atlanta while taking classes to finish his college requirements. He married a flight attendant named Linda in 1968. After receiving a degree in Industrial Management from Georgia Tech, he returned with his wife to Jacksonville. The couple had two daughters, Tracy and Jennifer. Both are now married and there are several grandchildren. Rogers sold insurance for a short time until he was offered a job as an assistant football coach at Jean Ribault High School and teaching at Ribault Junior High. Lee Rogers spent three years as an assistant at Ribault before taking the head coaching position at his alma mater, Lee High School, in 1972. He recorded 10 straight district titles from 1977-1986 and coached future Green Bay Packers Edgar Bennett and LeRoy Butler, who went on to become a four-time All-Pro safety. Rogers won his 100th game in 1984, but the goal that eluded him at Lee was a state championship, and it still bothered him: > \\"It certainly is one of the real disappointments in my career. We had the > players to do it. We just didn't get it done and I'm the one that must > answer for that. But I do think it was a growing period in my life where I > learned what it takes. And maybe not winning one kept me that much more > hungry when we came over to Bolles.\\" Lee's record in 1987 was 6‚Äì4, which ended a string of 10 consecutive district titles. A hit and run by a drunk driver left Rogers with a shattered left leg in March, 1988. He spent two months in St. Lukes Hospital, followed by almost a year on crutches and 18 surgeries over the years to correct the injury. At the time, Frank Callihan was Bolles' Athletic Director. While Rogers was hospitalized, Callihan made several visits and privately expressed his desire for Rogers to coach at Bolles. Rogers began to think about his future at Lee. The team's 1988 season improved to 8‚Äì2, while Bolles went 5-5, and the Bolles Athletic Director was ready to make a coaching change. In 1989, Rogers decided to leave Lee High School after 17 successful seasons and a record of 141-39-1. He accepted the head football coach position at the Bolles School, a private school of the affluent (high school tuition in 2013 was $21,200) which was traditionally viewed with envy or as the enemy by the public-school system. Rogers kept his long-time assistant, Wayne Belger. Bolles Rogers took over the football program at Bolles, a well-financed private school with both a strong academic and athletic reputation. In 2005, Sports Illustrated ranked it as the 9th-best high school athletics program in the country. The campus looks like a small college and contains sports facilities that many colleges would envy. Rogers and his coaching staff began a year-round strength building program using weight training. All team members understand the importance and are committed to this requirement. Callihan commented: > \\"The first day Corky was introduced to the players in the weight room, he > got down and bench-pressed more weight than any of them did. Wayne Belger > did the same thing. That got the kids' attention. They won't tolerate the > players not fulfilling their weight-room obligations.\\" The following year, Rogers was invited to coach the South team in the 1990 North-South All-Star Football Classic, the predecessor of the U.S. Army All- American Bowl. Since their arrival, Rogers and his coaching staff have transformed a good program into a great one. In 1994, his fourth year at Bolles, Rogers notched his 200th career win. The wing-T offense helped the Bulldogs win ten state championships and four runner-up finishes that span three school size classifications. The 300th win came in 2002, the same year he was named Sunshine Network Coach of the Year and FACA-Dairy Farmers Football Coach of the Year, and he was nominated for NFL High School Coach of the Year. Rogers‚Äô success has catapulted him to the top of the list of Florida's winningest high school football coaches. He took over the top spot with his 314th win in September 2004. Notably, among the Florida high school coaches with more than 300 wins, Rogers was the only coach with fewer than 100 losses. Public schools are generally limited to students living within the school district boundaries. Private schools can enroll students regardless of where they live. A common misconception about Bolles is that they recruit and their teams are composed of blue-chip college prospects. They usually aren't, so Rogers had to maximize the potential of players with no chance of ever playing college ball. Rogers stated, \\"As coaches, we don't do a lot to make Division I football players; they pretty much make themselves. Where we come in is to have more influence on the guy who struggles just to be competitive.\\" Rogers taught the character-building skills necessary to be successful in football, and more importantly, life. A stable coaching staff is beneficial, too. As of 2004, only three coaching assistants had left the Bolles program during Rogers' leadership; two of those have since returned. In 25 years at Bolles, his record was 244‚Äì33. Prior to the 2005 season, Bolles was named as one of the \\"top 25 teams to watch in the nation\\" by Street & Smith's. Rogers was named USA Head Coach for NFL Global Junior Championships IX, and he received the Life Membership Award from the American Coaching Association \\"for outstanding contributions to high school athletics and the coaching profession\\". Bolles won their record ninth state championship in 2008, and 10th state championship the following year.Cushnir, Chad: \\"Bolles Wins Class 2B Football Title\\" First Coast News, December 12, 2009 After recording his 400th win early in the 2011 season, Rogers joined an exclusive group of eight coaches. At the end of the 2012 season, he was tied for 3rd place in most wins with G. A. Moore in Texas, who retired in 2011 with a record of 423‚Äì97‚Äì9. In second place is John T. Curtis, Jr. of Louisiana, who became the second coach to pass the 500-win milestone. Curtis's record going into the 2013 season was 520‚Äì54‚Äì6.Times-Picayune, October 27, 2011.

Corky Rogers Day On December 18, 2005, during halftime of the Jacksonville Jaguars 10‚Äì9 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rogers received a silver tray celebrating his accomplishments and the honor of being the 2004-05 National High School Coach of the Year. A video of highlights in the coach's 34-year career was played on the stadium JumboTrons. Over 300 current and former players took the field during the presentation. Players from every team coached by Rogers participated. Some had not seen Rogers since their high school graduation. The reunion continued after the ceremony ended, with pictures and interaction between the coach and players. J.D. Hall, head football coach at Mandarin High School commented, \\"Corky is more than a just a football coach. He was a father figure to me.\\" All Century Team Bolles' Corky Rogers was named to the Florida High School Athletic Association's All- Century Team Coaching Staff. As part of its ongoing celebration of ‚Äú100 Years of Florida High School Football,‚Äù the FHSAA announced a 33-player and 12-member coaching staff for the All-Century Team.

Prior to the operation, he had an electrocardiogram, which showed seven blocked arteries. He was immediately transported to the hospital by ambulance and the next day he had a septuple bypass. The cardiothoracic specialist who performed the procedure was a Bolles alumnae. Rogers took off two months for recovery and rehabilitation, but returned to school in late March and was back on the field in time for spring practice of the 2012 season. Future When asked how long he planned to continue coaching, Rogers said, \\"You just don't know how you're going to feel from one year to the next\\". Coach Rogers will continue to coach until activities like fishing and golfing become more important or his health becomes an issue. After his heart surgery, he stated that if he can't give 100% and do the job that the kids deserve, he'll step down.

The Arab World mainly consists of the Arabic-speaking countries and populations in North Africa and Western Asia. The standard definition of the Arab world comprises the 22 countries and territories of the Arab League: 10 countries in Africa, and 12 countries in Asia. Geographically, it stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. It has a combined population of around 422 million people. The Arab World is divided into five main geographic regions: the Maghreb in Northwest Africa, the Nile Valley and the Horn of Africa in Northeast Africa, the Levant in the eastern Mediterranean, and the Arabian Peninsula in southwestern Asia. Egypt is the only transcontinental country by virtue of the Sinai Peninsula, which lies in Asia. The vast area covered by the Arab World encompasses wide and diverse geographical features ranging from deserts and shrublands to Mediterranean forests and snow-capped mountain ranges. Deserts reign in most of northern Africa where the Sahara exists, the world's hottest desert where some of the sand dunes can reach 180 metres (590 ft) in height. The Arabian Peninsula is mainly covered by a range of deserts: the Nefud in the north, which is a stony desert; the Rub' Al-Khali or \\"Great Arabian Desert\\" in the south, and between them, the Dahna desert. In contrast, the Arab World boasts some of the highest mountain ranges in both Africa and Asia. The Atlas Mountains rise from the northern Sahara to peak of 4,167 m before cascading east towards the Mediterranean and west towards the Atlantic Ocean. The Hijaz mountains rise parallel to the Red Sea on the western edge of the Arabian Peninsula, separating the coastline from the inland deserts. Mountains like the Mount Lebanon and the Taurus Mountains mark the edges of the Levant, providing heavy rainfall and snowfall, thus nurturing the areas' forest landscapes. The areas within the Arab World witnessed the first forms of civilization, specifically in Ancient Egypt, the Levant and Mesopotamia. Throughout history, numerous civilizations, both local and foreign, settled in and ruled the Arab World each of them leaving its trace of monuments and landmarks. This made the regions within the Arab World a mosaic of remnants from most of the civilizations of the Old World. In some countries, you can find Ancient Roman temples next to an Umayyad palace, or a Crusader castle in a Mamluk old town, or even an Eastern Orthodox Church next to an Ottoman mosque. Maghreb Timgad, Algeria Oasis in Ubari, Libya El Djem amphitheater, Tunisia The Maghreb is usually defined as much or most of the region of Northwest Africa, west of Egypt. The traditional definition as being the region including the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya. The term maghrib is in origin an Arabic word for \\"west\\", denoting the westernmost territories that fell to the Islamic conquests of the 7th century. Partially isolated from the rest of the continent by the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara desert, inhabitants of the northern parts of the Maghreb have long had commercial and cultural ties to the inhabitants of the Mediterranean countries of Southern Europe and Western Asia, going back at least to the Phoenicians in the 1st millennium BC (the Phoenician colony of Carthage having been founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia c. 800 BC). The region was somewhat unified as an independent political entity during the rule of the Berber kingdom of Numidia, which was followed by Roman Empire's rule or influence. That was followed by the brief invasion of the Germanic Vandals, the equally brief re-establishment of a weak Byzantine rule by the Byzantine Empire, the rule of the Islamic Caliphates under the Umayyads, the Abbasids, and the Fatimids. The most enduring rule was that of the local Berber Muslim empires of Almoravids, Almohads, Hammadids, Zirids, Marinids, Wattasids (to name some of those among the most prominent) during the 8th to 13th centuries. The Ottoman Turks ruled the region as well. In 1989, the five modern states of Northwest Africa established the Maghreb Union to promote cooperation and economic integration in a common market. Maghreb is home to 1 percent of the global population as of 2010. Maghrebi people include Moroccans (along with Sahrawis), Algerians, Libyans, Mauritanians, and Tunisians. Maghrebis are largely composed of Berber and Arab descent with European and Sub-Saharan elements. Various other influences are also prominent throughout the Maghreb. In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the moriscos and muladies, that is, the indigenous Spaniards who had earlier converted to the Muslim faith and were fleeing, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, from the Spanish Catholic Reconquista. Other European contributions included French, Italians, and others captured by the corsairs. Another significant group are Turks who came over with the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. A large Turkish descended population exists, particularly in Tunisia and Algeria. The impact of all these superimposed cultures are noticeable in the diverse culture of the Maghreb, as well as in its architecture, heritage, and cuisine. Tunisia Hammamet, Tunisia Tunisia is the smallest country in North Africa with an area of almost 165,000 square kilometres (64,000 sq mi) and an estimated population of just under 10.7 million. Its name is derived from the capital Tunis located in the northeast. The south of the country is composed of the Sahara desert, with much of the remainder consisting of particularly fertile soil and 1,300 kilometres (810 mi) of coastline along the Mediterranean. Tunisia's climate is temperate in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers. Until recently, Tunisia's main attraction was on its northeast coastline around Tunis; however, the Seventh National Development Plan of 1989 created several new tourist areas around the country. The tourism sector now represents 6.5% of Tunisia's GDP and provides 340,000 jobs of which 85,000 are direct jobs, or 11.5% of the working population with a high share of seasonal employment. This sector is popular mainly on the east coast, totaling more than 95% of beds. At the heart of the city lies the Medina of Tunis, built on a gentle hill sloping towards the Tunis Lake, a historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as Zitouna Mosque. Inside the Medina lie the souks, a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty. Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets. Another popular destination is Carthage, a 3,000-year-old Phoenician colony and capital of the ancient Carthaginian Empire. Hammamet is a famous coastal destination due to its beaches and suitability for swimming and water sports. Sousse's center is designated as a World Heritage Site, with the citrus Orchards and olive groves surrounding the old town are backed by long stretches of sandy shores. Algeria Constantine, Algeria Algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest in Africa and in the Mediterranean Basin, with a total area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi). The territory of today's Algeria was the home of many ancient prehistoric cultures, including Aterian and Capsian cultures. Its area has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient Berber Numidians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arab Umayyads, Berber Fatimids, Berber Almoravids, Berber Almohads and later Turkish Ottomans. Algeria's southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara. To the north, the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is Mount Tahat (3,003 m). There are several UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Algeria including Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad, the first capital of the Hammadid empire; Tipasa, a Phoenician and later Roman town; and Dj√©mila and Timgad, both Roman ruins; M'Zab Valley, a limestone valley containing a large urbanized oasis; also the Casbah of Algiers is an important citadel. The only natural World Heritage Sites is the Tassili n'Ajjer, a mountain range. Algiers is the country's cosmopolitan capital, displaying much of the French Architectural heritage due to years of colonization. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the deys, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the casbah or citadel, 122 metres (400 ft) above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle. The city is sometimes nicknamed \\"Alger la Blanche\\" (\\"Algiers the White\\") because of the glistening white of its colonial-era buildings as seen rising up from the sea. Libya Mauritania Nile Valley Egypt Sudan Horn of Africa Djibouti The Arrei Mountains. Djibouti is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea in the north, Ethiopia in the west and south, and Somalia in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden at the east. Djibouti occupies a total area of just 23,200 km2 (8,958 sq mi). In antiquity, the territory was part of the Land of Punt. The Djibouti area, along with other localities in the Horn region, was later the seat of the medieval Adal Sultunate and Ifat Sultanate. In the late 19th century, the colony of French Somaliland was established following treaties signed by the ruling Somali and Afar Sultans with the French. Djibouti is a multi-ethnic nation, with a population of over 790,000 inhabitants. The Somali and Afar make up the two largest ethnic groups. Both speak Afro-Asiatic languages, which serve as recognized national languages. Arabic and French constitute the country's two official languages. About 94% of residents adhere to Islam, a religion with a long-standing presence in the region. There is not much seasonal variation in Djibouti's climate. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with winter rainfalls. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from 32 to 41 ¬∞C (90 to 106 ¬∞F), except at high elevations, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. The Goda Mountains lie northwest of the Gulf of Tadjoura, Tadjoura Region in Djibouti. They rise to 1,750 metres (5,740 ft) above sea level and are the nation's largest heavily vegetated area. The ecology of this landform is considered an isolated outlier of the Ethiopian montane forest ecological zone, an important island of forest in a sea of semi-desert. Lake Assal (literally translated to \\"honey lake\\") is a crater lake in central-eastern Djibouti. It is a saline lake which lies 155 m (509 ft) below sea level in the Afar Triangle, making it the lowest point on land in Africa and the third lowest land depression on Earth after the Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee. There is no outflow from the lake and, due to high evaporation, the salinity level of its waters is ten times that of the sea, making it the most saline in the world after Don Juan Pond. Somalia Tourism in Somalia was traditionally noted for its numerous historical sites, beaches, waterfalls, mountain ranges and national parks. In the pre-independence period, European explorers would occasionally travel to Somalia and other parts of the Horn of Africa to visit the region's numerous historical sites described in old documents like the 1st century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Following Somalia's independence in 1960, the Ministry of Tourism was established in order to regulate the national tourist industry. In 1969, the Law on Fauna (Hunting) and Forest Conservation was passed, which defined and provided for the establishment of controlled areas, game reserves and partial game reserves. It was later amended in 1978. Tourism in Somalia is today regulated by the reconstituted national Ministry of Tourism. The autonomous Puntland and Somaliland regions maintain their own tourist offices. Headquartered in Mogadishu, the Somali Tourism Association (SOMTA) also provides consulting services from within the country on the national tourist industry. Due to the long absence of governmental regulation, it is uncertain how many international inbound tourists visit Somalia per year. However, visas and stay permits are now mandatory for all foreign nationals. As of April 2013, the re-established Somali Immigration Department requires all undocumented foreigners to register at its offices in the capital. Indian Ocean islands Comoros Comoros is a sovereign archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean, located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa, between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar. Other countries near the Comoros are Tanzania to the northwest and the Seychelles to the northeast. Its capital city is Moroni, situated on Grande Comore the largest island in the archipelago. As a nation formed at a crossroads of many civilizations, the archipelago is noted for its diverse culture and history. The Union of the Comoros has three official languages ‚Äì Comorian, Arabic and French. Officially, in addition to many smaller islands, the country consists of the four major islands in the volcanic Comoros archipelago: northwesternmost Grande Comore (Ngazidja); Moh√©li (Mwali); Anjouan (Nzwani); and southeasternmost Mayotte (Maore). Although the Comoros has many natural resources for tourism, such as its beaches and marine environment, it does not have as strong a tourist industry as its regional competitors R√©union, Mauritius, and Seychelles. Its weak tourist industry is mainly because of its insecure political climate, with many political upheavals over the past three decades. Tourists in the Comoros are mainly wealthy Americans and Europeans, while much of the investment in hotels has come from South Africa. The main tourist attractions in the Comoros are its beaches, underwater fishing, and mountain scenery. Moh√©li is a picturesque tourist attraction. Grand Comore has an international airport and most of the Comoros' few hotels. Levant alquds \\"Cedars of God\\" Forest, Lebanon Jerash, Jordan The Levant is the cultural and geographic region east of the Mediterranean sea, south of the Anatolian Peninsula, west of the Iranian plateau, and north of the Arabian Desert. The region has many names like the \\"Fertile Crescent\\", \\"Eastern Mediterranean\\", \\"Syria (region)\\", \\"Mashriq\\" which is the Arabic word for \\"Levant\\". The Eastern Mediterranean Muslims, Christians, Circassians and Christian Maronite Cypriots populations speak Levantine Arabic also known as Mediterranean Arabic (ÿ¥ÿßŸÖŸä). These populations share not only the language, but the geographic position, cuisine, some customs, and a very long history. Geographically-speaking, the Levant boasts some of the most diverse natural features in the Arab World. The Syrian Desert, a 200,000-square-miles wide rocky and flat desert, occupies the center of the Levant and is considered a continuation of the Arabian Desert. To its east lies Mesopotamia, fertile agricultural plains traversed by two rivers: Euphrates and Tigris. Both rivers originate from Anatolia and are fed by numerous tributaries; the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region. In the western Levant, hilly terrains and mountain ranges rise parallel to the Mediterranean coastline from the north to the south encompassing the: An-Nusayriyah Mountains, Lebanon Mountains, Galilee Hills, Samarian Hills, and Judaean Mountains. This mountainous barrier receives a substantial amount of precipitation and snow, and enjoys a thick forest cover, mainly Mediterranean woodlands and forests. Between the Mountains and the shoreline extends a densely populated narrow and fertile coastal plain. The Levant is considered the Cradle of Civilization, as it witnessed the first formations of human culture. Historically, the Levant was populated and controlled by local civilizations, sometimes one controlling all others. Through the passing time, the Levant was subject to occupation by several foreign empires, mainly Persians and Romans, before falling under the control of the Byzantines after the Decline of the Roman Empire. The rise of Islam in Arabia followed by the Muslim conquests subjugated the Levant to the rule of the Rashidun Caliphate, followed by other Islamic dynasties like the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Mamluks, and finally the Ottomans. After World War I, the Levant was divided between France and Britain according to the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement into spheres of influence, eventually leading to the emergence of several new states. Palestine The Palestinian territories refers to East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. In 2010, 4.6 million people visited the Palestinian territories, compared to 2.6 million in 2009. Of that number, 2.2 million were foreign tourists while 2.7 million were domestic. In the last quarter of 2012 over 150,000 guests stayed in West Bank hotels; 40% were European and 9% were from the United States and Canada.http://www.travel-impact-newswire.com/2013/03/europeans-dominate- visitor-arrivals-to-palestine-in-2012/#story3 Major travel guides write that \\"the West Bank is not the easiest place in which to travel but the effort is richly rewarded.\\"Israel and the Palestinian Territories. p254.

Palestinian tour guides or transportation companies have not been able to enter Israel since 2000, and in 2009, Israel's Ministry of Tourism deleted the West Bank and any Palestinian area from its materials. Former Palestinian Authority Tourism Minister Kholoud Diibes has commented \\"that Israel collects 90% of [religious] pilgrim-related revenue\\". Foreign tourism has been restricted to East Jerusalem and the West Bank since the August 2013 indefinite closing of the Rafah crossing located between Egypt and the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip.http://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-shutters-gaza-border- crossing-indefinitely/ There is essentially no tourist flow to Gaza since 2005 because of the ongoing Israeli military land, sea, and air blockade. In 2013 Palestinian Authority Tourism minister Rula Ma'ay'a stated that her government aims to encourage international visits to Palestine, but the occupation is the main factor preventing the tourism sector from becoming a major income source to Palestinians. There are no visa conditions imposed on foreign nationals other than those imposed by the visa policy of Israel. Access to Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza is completely controlled by the Government of Israel. Entry to the occupied Palestinian territories requires only a valid international passport.

Jordan borders Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north and Israel to the west, sharing control of the Dead Sea with the latter. It consists of an arid plateau in the east, irrigated by oasis and seasonal water streams, with highland area in the west of arable land and Mediterranean evergreen forestry. The Jordan Rift Valley of the Jordan River separates Jordan from Palestine and Israel. The highest point in the country is Jabal Umm al Dami, at 1,854 m (6,083 ft) above sea level, its top is also covered with snow, while the lowest is the Dead Sea ‚àí420 m (‚àí1,378 ft). The most common tourist site is Petra capital of the Nabateans, a rose-stone city carved out of the cliffs and hidden among a complex of arid narrow gorges. Another historical site is Jerash, an ancient Roman city famous for its well- preserved street grid, hippodrome, and fine colonnades. Several other towns like Al Karak and Ajloun are home to large-scale well-preserved Crusader citadels. Jordan has significant religious sites as well like the Jordan River, which is the river where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist, Madaba, a highly religious site renowned for its mosaics, and Mount Nebo, where Moses was said to have gone to get a view of the Promised Land before he died. Aqaba is the country's only outlet to the sea. The city houses numerous resorts and hotels and is famous for its Red Sea coral reefs. Wadi Rum is a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern Jordan; it is the largest wadi in Jordan. Popular activities in this desert valley environment include camping under the stars, riding Arab horses, hiking and rock-climbing among the massive rock formations. Iraq Arabian Peninsula Pilgrims in Mecca Ras al-Jinz, the easternmost point of the Arabian Peninsula Oman Dubai Marina, United Arab Emirates Madinat Jumeirah and Burj Al Arab The Arabian Peninsula is a land mass situated north-east of Africa. Also known as Arabia or the Arabian subcontinent, it is the world's largest peninsula and covers 3,237,500 km2 (1,250,000 mi2). The area is an important part of the Asian continent and plays a critical geopolitical role of the Middle East and Arab World due to its vast reserves of oil and natural gas. The peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the Red Sea between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the Red Sea to the west, the Persian Gulf to the northeast, and the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea to the southeast. The northern portion of the peninsula merges with the Syrian Desert with no clear border line, although the northern boundary of the Arabian Peninsula is generally considered to be the northern borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The most prominent feature of the peninsula is desert, but in the southwest there are mountain ranges which receive greater rainfall than the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. The peninsula's constituent countries are (clockwise north to south) Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates on the east, Oman on the southeast, Yemen on the south and Saudi Arabia at the center. The island nation of Bahrain lies off the east coast of the peninsula. Six countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), also known as the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers the greater part of the peninsula. The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. The history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 20,000 years ago. The region has twice in world history had a global impact. The first was in the 7th century when it became the cradle of Islam. The second was from the mid-20th century when the discovery of vast oil deposits propelled it into a key economic and geo-political role. At other times, the region existed in relative obscurity and isolation, although from the 7th century the cities of Mecca and Medina had the highest spiritual significance for the Islamic world, Mecca being the destination for the Hajj annual pilgrimage. For much of its history most of the Arabian Peninsula has been controlled by a patchwork of tribal rulers. Saudi Arabia The mountains, valleys and Red Sea beaches with turquoise water are known for some of the world's finest diving and attract some, but comparatively few, tourists. Some other spots are hard to reach, such as the Nabatean ruins, a four-hour drive from Medina, the nearest city with an airport for visitors to fly into. The Kingdom is almost totally dependent on oil, a habit Prince Sultan Bin Salman wants to change by forming the Saudi Commission for Tourism & Antiquities in 2000. There are several museums in Saudi Arabia like the Royal Saudi Air Force Museum and the National Museum of Saudi Arabia. The Royal Saudi Air Force Museum or \\"Saqr Al-Jazira\\" is located on the East Ring Road of the Saudi capital Riyadh between exits 10 and 11. A Saudia Lockheed L-1011 Tristar serves as a gateguard visible from the ring road. The museum gives the history of the Royal Saudi Air Force from its establishment in the 1920s to the present day. The museum comprises an outdoor static park and a large and modern indoor museum. The National Museum of Saudi Arabia is another major national museum in Saudi Arabia. Established in 1999, it is part of the King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre in Riyadh. It covers several topics about Islam, Prophet Muhammad's journeys, and the pre- Islamic history of Arabia. Diriyah is an old town, designated as a World Heritage Site, that used to be the ruling capital of the First Saudi State. Another Major World Heritage Site is Mada'in Saleh composed of gigantic tombs and burial chambers carved out of stone cliffs with native artistic designs. Tourism in Saudi Arabia is largely based around religious pilgrimage. Mecca receives over three million pilgrims a year during the month of Hajj, and around two million during the month of Ramadan in Umrah. Oman Muscat seafront, Oman Sultanate of Oman is the easternmost country of the Arabian Peninsula. Oman's coast is lined with many soft sand beaches. Activity for beach visitors include sunning, swimming, kite-surfing, diving, snorkeling, boating, surfing, beach combing and shell collecting. The beaches are popular with families, walkers, and joggers. They are lined with restaurants, snack bars and cafes. Desert safari is becoming a very popular activity; it can be either done on camels or by four-wheel drives. Nearly every Omani city and town has its own fort. Most of them were built or had major expansions during Al-Yarubi dynasty rule of Oman in between 1624 and 1744. They represent the fine Omani architecture and prosperity at that time. In times of war and with high and thick walls, their purpose was as a refuge for the people and a last line of defense for the town. Forts were prepared to withstand long siege with water wells, food storing capacity and secret tunnels ending many kilometers away from the walls of the fort. In times of peace they served as a center of governance, a place for education and a social interaction point. Some of these famous forts are the Nakhal fort and the Bahla fort, both of which are designated as World Heritage Sites. Other World Heritage sites include the \\"Frankincense Route\\", a set of locations that collectively contributed to the flourishing of frankincense trade for many centuries., and the \\"Falaj\\", a rare 2000-year-old water system and irrigation structure. Many of Oman's old cities are still well-preserved and serve as traditional souqs. Omani Souqs (Markets) are preferable locations to purchase handicrafts and are always bustling with tourists. Omani markets are characterized by their diversity. Old markets are full of handicrafts like silver, gold, textiles and masterpieces produced by other Omani industries like daggers and coexist with modern shopping malls and other shopping centers. United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates, or UAE, is country on the southeast edge of the Arabian Peninsula, overlooking the Persian Gulf. The UAE is composed of 7 Emirates, or principalities, each ruled by a historic Arabian dynasty. The country was formed when the seven emirates decided to form a federation back in 1971, and later witnessed a huge economic and development boom with the discovery of oil. The Capital of the UAE is Abu Dhabi, while Dubai is the largest city and major financial center. The other emirates are Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al- Quwain. Tourism Plays a vital role in the economy of the United Arab Emirates, with the number of visitors surpassing 10 million tourists per year.http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/tourism/dubai- welcomed-record-breaking-10-million-tourists-last-year Dubai maintains the highest share of tourists among the other emirates. Dubai gained a lot of media attention with ambitious mega-projects like: Burj Khalifa, the world's highest tower, The Dubai Mall, the world's biggest shopping mall, the Palm Islands, a series of three artificial palm-shaped islands, the World Islands, the man-made archipelago in the shape of the world map, Burj Al Arab, the world's only 7-star hotel, Madinat Jumeirah, a 40 hectares traditional Arabian resort town, Dubai Marina, a 3-km long canal city with the highest residential tower in the world, Dubai Fountain, Ski Dubai, Downtown Burj Dubai, among several others. Dubai also maintains some historic landmarks, dating back to the city's heritage as a small fishing and trading outpost along the Persian Gulf, like the: Dubai Creek, a saltwater inlet that was the center of Dubai's ancient trade and pearling industry, Dubai Spice Souk, the old merchants' market selling frankincense, shisha, herbs, textiles, incense, rugs and artifacts, Dubai Gold Souk, a traditional bustling Souk with over 300 gold retailers, Grand Mosque (Dubai), a century-old sandstone mosque with a 70-meters high minaret, Al Bastakiya, a well-preserved old town famous for its iconic Wind Towers, Al Ahmadiya School, one of the most ancient educational institutions, Al Fahidi Fort, an 18th-century grand Arabian Fort turned into a museum, Al Souk Al Kabir, one of the oldest residential & commercial districts in Dubai, among several other sites. The Geographic nature of the UAE provides several opportunities for tourism. The UAE enjoys a 650 km stretch of coastline along the Persian Gulf, and a significantly smaller coast along the Gulf of Oman. Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend far inland, with several islands and coral reefs dotting the shoreline. The desert landscape inland is dominated by rolling sand dunes disrupted by a handful of oasis, like the Liwa Oasis. Abu Dhabi, the country's capital and second- largest city, boasts its share of tourist attractions as well; most importantly: Emirates Palace, a grand Arabian Palace/Hotel with a 1.3 km beachfront & 100 hectares of gardens, Ferrari World, the world's largest indoor amusement park, Yas Marina Circuit, the site of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Yas Hotel Abu Dhabi, the hotel built over a section of the Formula One circuit, Abu Dhabi Corniche, a pedestrian seaside promenade along the city's coastline, Yas Island, a man-made multi-use leisure island, Sheikh Zayed Mosque, a vast mosque structure composed of 82 domes and is entirely covered with white marble.

The alleged lessee was given the right to use five orchards, in return for which he was obliged to install and commission a microjetting system in that orchard of the leased premises known as \\"Girlsland.\\" When the alleged lessee failed to install and commission the system, the alleged lessor issued summons to compel him to do so. The court referred to the case of Black v Scheepers, where it was held that rent had to be paid in money or fruits, and that the provision of meals was not rent. On appeal, it was argued that payment for light and water, which were undertaken as separate obligations, could be counted as rent. The court said that this was incorrect. The court held that practical considerations are decisive. The essential different between lease agreements and other agreements lies in the rule relating to the nature of the consideration payable. It is not in accordance with public policy that parties should find themselves in a position different from that to which they thought they had agreed. The court held, however, that the contract was not a lease, as the consideration was something other than money or fruits. The judgment of the court has been criticised by the eminent scholar AJ Kerr, who observes that the court does not explain what it has in mind when it refers to \\"practical considerations.\\" It is correct, he acknowledges, that the court must consider the true nature of the contract even if the parties use terminology relevant to lease contracts. In Jordaan, both parties intended their contract to be a lease, but the court held that it could not be a lease. Kerr argues that, if the court had recognised the contract as a lease, neither of the parties, nor any third party, would have been prejudiced. Kerr concludes that the decision in Jordaan ought not to be followed, hoping that in future the courts will follow Rubin v Botha1911 AD 568. instead or, if they do not, that they will develop the law to allow rent to be paid in money or in other ways not limited to fruits  See also  * Rubin v Botha * South African law of lease  References  * Jordaan NO and Another v Verwey 2002 (1) SA 643 (E). * Rubin v Botha 1911 AD 568.

In 1635 his father took him to New England, where he graduated M.A. at Harvard College in 1647. He finished his studies in England, probably returning with his brother Samuel in 1650. Mather was assistant to George Mortimer (died 1688) at Harberton, Devonshire (a Parliamentary sequestered vicarage), and succeeded him there in 1655. In 1656 he was presented by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell to the sequestered vicarage of Barnstaple, Devonshire, in which the vicar, Martin Blake (1593‚Äì1673), B.D., was reinstated at the Restoration. After the Restoration, Mather then went over to Holland, and for some years was pastor of the English Church at Rotterdam. On the death of his brother Samuel, he succeeded him (1671) as minister at New Row, Dublin. In 1688, the year of the Glorious Revolution, he left Ireland, and became pastor of the independent church in Paved Alley, Lime Street, London, vacant by the death of John Collins (1632?‚Äì1687). Mather joined the \\"Happy Union\\" of 1691, but was a leader in its disruption owing to the alleged heresies of Daniel Williams (1643?‚Äì1716), D.D. On the withdrawal of William Bates (1625‚Äì1699), D.D. (who sided with Williams), from the Pinners' Hall lectureship, Mather was appointed (1694) in his place. He died on 26 July 1697, and was buried at Bunhill Fields, where a long Latin inscription was placed upon his tombstone. A still longer Latin epitaph is in Isaac Watts's Lyric Poems. cites: He was of tall stature.

History  In 1859, a provisional committee of citizens was formed with the object of building a Sailors‚Äô Home in Sydney to provide them with comfortable accommodation while the seamen were on shore. In 1860, land in George Street North in the Rocks area of Sydney was designated as a suitable site and construction began in 1863, using a design similar to sailors‚Äô homes in other seaports. Construction continued from 1864 to 1926. The original name for Sailors home is Seamen's Mission, but it changed to avoid the pun. The Home opened its doors in February 1865. Naval personnel lodged there until 1891 when the Royal Naval House, with accommodation for 300, opened in nearby Grosvenor Street. The sailors used to consume opium and alcohol, because in the nineteenth century, opium is legally consumed. Passersby could smell opium when near the Sailor's home.

Lani is a word for sky.Wiktionary entry for \\"Lani\\": Lani Nui means ‚Äúthe great‚Äù. An alternative (or secondary semantic layer) to ‚Äúfire‚Äù is ‚Äúone‚Äù, or ‚Äúfirst‚Äù as with kahi. This is possible through a phenomenon known in linguistics as t-glottalization or glottal replacement, which occurs when the letter ‚Äút‚Äù shifts to become the glottal stop, or okina.

Shot simultaneously shot in Hindi and Telugu, the film stars Puneet Singh Ratn (Hindi), Sharwanand (Telugu), Anaika Soti and Mahesh Thakur. The film tells the story of Satya, an immigrant who comes to Mumbai aiming to refashion the mumbai underworld. The film is the fourth installment of the Gangster Trilogy. Director Ram Gopal Verma hinted that Satya 2 will be his last film on the underworld and that now he wants to make romantic movies. Satya 2 was released on 28 October 2013 in U. A. E. and 8 November 2013 in India. The film received mixed reviews, Subhash K. Jha of Bollywood News stated that Ram Gopal Varma returns to form with Satya 2. Samreen Tungekar of Bolly spice has stated \\"Ram Gopal Verma had made it clear that Satya 2 is not a sequel to Satya, and he has evidently made no attempt of making this film look like a prequel or a sequel too. Satya 2 stands as an independent story and does well for itself as a film.\\" The Telugu version was partially reshot in Tamil as Naanthaanda. This film marks the Tamil-language directorial debut of Varma. Plot The storyline of Satya 2 is narrated by a voice (Makrand Deshpande) about the underworld whose activities have slowed down from the last decade in Mumbai (Hyderabad in Telugu version). The story is based on Satya (Puneet Singh Ratn/Sharwanand) who comes to Mumbai and starts working for Lahoti (Mahesh Thakur), a construction magnate. In trying to beat a competitor in a deal, he gets involved with the mafia and other underworld elements who don't have the clout anymore. Later, he kills RK who is the retired mafia leader and his son since his son wanted to kill Satya due to a feud between them. During this time, he gets his friend production money for a film and gets a flat and brings his girlfriend Chitra (Anaika Soti) to live there. He makes enemies all around and in a shootout with cops, loses his girlfriend and also his friend. But, even thought he is captured, he is able to get out of jail through the Company he creates with his connections and begins his reign as the newest underworld leader in Mumbai/Hyderabad.

If Satya was a story of a man who came in 1998 and shaped the then existing underworld, 'Satya 2' is about another man who comes in 2013 to reinvent the underworld. To that extent I would say this is a futuristic film not in terms of science fiction but in terms of that there's no precedent for the protagonist of 'Satya 2'. He starts a new underworld company based on his study of the mistakes of all the earlier dons and also on the ways he develops to deal with the modern day policing methods\\" said Ram Gopal Varma. \\"The police is completely caught off guard by this never before experienced menace of the new Company and the reason for this is that the police will always be lesser than a criminal enterprise in their vision ...That is because the police is merely an evolved system whereas a criminal entrepreneur for want of a better word is a visionary in his own field. Only after a new kind of crime happens will the police learn how to contain or prevent it. So it follows that if a completely new kind of a criminal appears on the horizon, their past experience will be null and void and they will again have to start from scratch So in one line 'Satya 2' is about a man whose thinking starts where the earlier Dons thinking ended and where the police cannot even begin to think.\\" said Ram Gopal Varma. Production \\"As a film maker I have been doing a deep study of the underworld and its gangsters for more than two decades primarily for the purposes of gathering subject matters for my films and to get inspired for characters from real life references..And that's how films like Satya and company happened... Then one day it occurred to me what if a guy out there studied the same gangsters not for becoming a film maker but for the purpose of becoming a gangster himself.it's that idea of mine which finally shaped itself into Satya 2. A new age gangster will obviously be armed with the mistakes of the earlier gangsters and also with the modern day policing methods\\". said Ram Gopal Varma. One romantic song of Satya 2 was shot in Kashmir in June 2013. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) passed Satya 2 with A certificate with 3 cuts. Satya 2 is made within the budget of Rs 15 crore. Soundtrack The background score of the film has been composed by Shakthikanth Karthick. The soundtrack of the film consisted of nine tracks composed by Nitin Raikwar, Sanjeev-Darshan, Kary Arora and Shree D and lyrics by Moied Elhaam, Nitin Raikwar, Kumaar, Sonny Ravan and Shree D on 15 October 2013. Critical reception Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 3 out of 5 stars and stated that Satya 2 has the right elements that make a quintessential gangster film. Madhureeta Mukherjee of Times of India gave it 2 out of 5 stars. The Telugu version released to negative reviews with Sangeetha of The Hindu advising to \\"skip this and watch the original Satya. Box office Satya 2 opened to an average opening-day occupancy of around 5 percent, the overseas market being no different with the film seeing a release in UAE. Owing to this the film had an opening day collections of with coming from Mumbai itself keeping in accordance with the wide release with the rest coming from East Punjab and DUP with collections of around and , respectively.

Due to decreased demand for service and the heavily deteriorated condition of the tracks and bridges, CSX Transportation (Seaboard's successor) and Seminole Gulf Railway, who had been leasing the line from CSX since 1987, came to an agreement with Sarasota County to abandon the railroad line south of Palmer Ranch. In return, Sarasota County, in conjunction with The Trust for Public Land, purchased and acquired the right of way in December 2004 for $11.75 million to use as a public recreational trail. The Legacy Trail opened to the public on March 28, 2008. Legacy Trail near State Road 681 overpass (milepost 898). In 2011, a pedestrian overpass was built to carry the trail over the Venice Bypass, a major six-lane highway. Prior to the overpass's construction, trail users had to use a crosswalk at an adjacent intersection. The $3.1 million overpass is tall, spans , and was built with federal stimulus funding. Another pedestrian overpass constructed by FDOT over Laurel Road started construction in November 2017 and was completed in late 2018. Northern extension Sarasota County is planning to extend the Legacy Trail beyond its current northern terminus into the city of Sarasota. The extension will continue the trail along the railroad corridor an additional to Fruitville Road, connecting with Payne Park towards downtown Sarasota. In early 2017, Seminole Gulf Railway and CSX announced their intention to abandon an additional of the remaining southern segment of the railroad up to a point just south of Fruitville Road. In December 2017, Sarasota County, in conjunction with The Trust for Public Land, purchased and acquired of the former railroad corridor right of way for $7.9 million, which extended the county's ownership of the corridor up to Ashton Road, approximately north of Clark Road. In November 2018, Sarasota County voters approved a referendum to acquire and improve of the former railroad corridor and constructing the trail. Construction also includes two overpasses and trail connection improvements. Route description Legacy Trail near Nokomis The north end of the Legacy Trail is just south of the Seminole Gulf Railway's current terminus near Palmer Ranch. From there, it travels south in a straight line towards Venice. It passes through Oscar Scherer State Park in Osprey and has a direct connection with the park's trails. After leaving the park, the trail continues south, passes underneath State Road 681 and through Nokomis. South of Nokomis, the trail crosses Dona Bay and enters Venice. The trail overpasses U.S. 41 Bypass then to the historic Venice Seaboard Air Line Railway Station, which is also used as a SCAT bus station. At the station, the trail goes on to connect with the Venetian Waterway Park at Venice Avenue, another trail that continues south along the Intracoastal Waterway to the Gulf of Mexico. The Legacy Trail contains references to its past as a Seminole Gulf Railway corridor. The trail's milepost numbers (numbered 892‚Äì902) correspond to the railroad's original mile numbering. The original trestle bridge crossing remains at South Creek, located just south of the Oscar Scherer State Park trailhead. Information plaques are placed along the trail detailing the history of the railroad corridor. Roadway crossings also include decorative railroad crossing signals with crossbucks reading Sarasota Rail Trail. Future An extension to North Port is planned. The North Port extension or North Port Connectors would connect to the Legacy Trail in Nokomis and run along T. Mabry Carlton Reserve and an FPL utility easement through Deer Prairie Creek Preserve. The Legacy Trail is also planned to be part of the Southwest Coast Regional Connector, an initiative by the Florida Department of Transportation to built a continuous multi-use trail from Tampa to Naples.

It is the terminus of the Coast Line to Copenhagen, the Little North Line to Hiller√∏d and the Hornb√¶k Line to Gilleleje. It also provides easy access to the ferries to Helsingborg, Sweden. History The railway station under construction in 1891 The first railway station in Helsing√∏r was built in 1863 as the terminus of the North Line from Copenhagen to Helsing√∏r by way of Hiller√∏d in 1863. In 1891, the station was moved to its current location close to the harbour in order to provide easier access to the ferries to Helsingborg in Sweden. The current station was inaugurated on 24 October 1891. In 1897, Helsing√∏r station also became the terminus of the new Coast Line, a more direct railway line between Copenhagen and Helsing√∏r along the coast of the √òresund. From 1908, all trains on the Hornb√¶k Line (opened in 1906) were continued from Gr√∏nnehave station in the northern part of the city to Helsing√∏r station, arriving and departing from a special railway halt in the street next to the station building. Architecture Front facade of Helsing√∏r station Main lobby Track area Formerly located on a sea bed, this station building rests on 1,600 poles embedded into the ground. It was designed by architect Niels Peder Christian Hols√∏e in collaboration with Heinrich Wenck in a Neo-Renaissance style locally known as Rosenborg Style after Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen. It imitates Christian IV's Dutch Renaissance-style buildings from the first half of the 17th century and is characterized by red brickwork combined with sandstone ornamentation Dutch gables and an abundance of turrets with copper-clad spires. The main entrance is flanked by marble columns. The room facing the sea, which now houses a restaurant, originally served as private chambers for the royal family. In 1984, DSB embarked on a comprehensive restoration of the station building. It included new tiles in the original patterns on floors and exposure and restoration of the original decorations on walls and ceilings. The work was completed in 1987, and the main building including the platform roofs was listed in 1990.  Station facilities  Inside the station building there is a combined ticket office and convenience store operated by 7-Eleven, automated ticket machines, toilets and lockers. Adjacent to the station are the Helsing√∏r ferry terminal and the Helsing√∏r bus terminal.

Biography Veselin Marinov was born in the town of Polski Trambesh (near Veliko Tarnovo) on August 4, 1961 to Yordanka and Stefan Marinov. Career  Early beginnings  Veselin started his involvement with music when he was in the 7th grade. He started to play and sing in a school group. During the compulsory military service Veselin Marinov realized that the music is his destiny and he applied in National Academy of Music (Bulgaria). In 1981, at the beginning of his studies, he was invited to become the lead singer of Bulgarian rock band Impuls. His first stage appearance was on 2 December 1982 in Vidin, Bulgaria. The band produced progressive rock music, and their first song with Marinov on vocals was Midnight music. The first song which was composed by Marinov himself was You came. In 1983, he graduated the Pop Music Department of Bulgarian Music Academy in the class of Petar Dimitrov. In 1984, Veselin underwent two operations of the vocal cords and left Impuls.  Solo career  In 1987, his first solo album, \\"From love\\", was released. After releasing his second album (\\"About Love\\"- 1990), Veselin Marinov relocated to Germany due to financial problems and very low sales of his plate. He has been working in Germany for four years and has released two albums there. Marinov returned to Bulgaria in 1994 because of a tooth inflammation. After the surgery he started working with the leading authors in Bulgaria, Toncho Rusev and Evtim Evtimov, and recorded three of his most popular songs - \\"You are the love\\" (bulg. \\"–¢–∏ —Å–∏ –ª—é–±–æ–≤—Ç–∞\\"), \\"Bitter wine\\" (bulg. \\"–ì–æ—Ä—á–∏–≤–æ –≤–∏–Ω–æ\\") and \\"For you, Bulgaria\\" (bulg. \\"–ó–∞ —Ç–µ–±, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏–π–æ\\"). These songs bring him great success and make him one of the most beloved and popular names in Bulgarian pop music. The albums that follow - \\"Bitter Wine\\" (1995) and \\"Wine and Love\\" (1999) are some of the best-selling in Bulgaria since 1989. Veselin Marinov releas–µs a new album almost every year since 1998.  Christmas  Veselin Marinov is the only performer in Bulgaria (and maybe in the world), who has two solo albums with original Christmas songs - Christmas Dream (–ö–æ–ª–µ–¥–µ–Ω —Å—ä–Ω) - 2003 and The most expensive gift in the world (–ù–∞–π-—Å–∫—ä–ø–∏—è—Ç –ø–æ–¥–∞—Ä—ä–∫ –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∞) - 2010. He makes concert tours with his Christmas songs every December in the biggest cities of Bulgaria. Filmography  Concerts  Marinov is the singer with the most concerts in Bulgaria. He performs in at least 60 solo concerts each year. He has 25 concerts (by 2018) in the biggest (4000) and most prestigious concert hall in Bulgaria and one in the largest (13 000) multifunctional hall.

Its principal concert venue is the Olavshallen. The orchestra is organised as a trust and receives public assistance from the Norwegian government, Tr√∏ndelag county and the municipality of Trondheim. History The precursor ensemble of the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra & Opera held its first concert 10 December 1909, at the Frimurerlogen ('Masonic Lodge') in Trondheim, with an ensemble of 29 players. Through the 1920s, the orchestra's musical activities were modest, but this changed in the 1930s, with an increase in the availability of better-trained musicians and increased financial subsidies, to allow for increased (though not abundant) pay to the orchestra musicians. During World War II, the Frimurerlogen was renamed the Deutsches Haus, while the country was under German occupation, and the orchestra gave concerts in various Trondheim churches. Following World War II, the orchestra returned to the Frimurerlogen as its resident venue and remained there until 1989. In 1947, the orchestra created its first full-time posts for the musicians, which led to the establishment of the Trondheim Chamber Orchestra. In 1952, the orchestra established the Princess Astrid Music Award to recognize talented young Norwegian musicians, with pianist Kjell B√¶kkelund as the first winner. This competition continues to this day, held every two years. In 1962, Norwegian Radio (NRK) and the state of Norway formally took over control of the orchestra. In 1989, the Olavshallen was completed, and the orchestra relocated from Frimurerlogen to the new concert hall that year. The orchestra currently consists of about 85 musicians, and gives around 100 concerts annually. In 2009, the orchestra started to develop a professional opera and musical theatre department. The orchestra's current chief conductor and artistic leader is Han-na Chang, since the 2017‚Äì2018 season. She had previously served as principal guest conductor of the orchestra, beginning with the 2013‚Äì2014 season. Her appointment as chief conductor occurred in March 2016. She is the first female conductor to be named chief conductor of the orchestra. In November 2018, the orchestra announced the extension of Chang's contract as chief conductor through the 2022‚Äì2023 season.

Her father was an entrepreneur who had travelled from Liverpool, England, to the Los Islands, off the coast of what is now Guinea, in the mid 1700s. Her mother was African. Her father probably followed local custom, which dictated that a stranger would have to establish his position in society by marrying his landlord's slave or a daughter of a slave woman. Heard's father sent her to England, most likely near Liverpool (where there were usually 50-70 Africans and mixed-race offspring of traders receiving an English education). Upon completing her studies, she returned to West Africa and set up a trading post on the Bereira River, following her father's trade. Eventually, she inherited her father's slave-trading factory and connections. By 1794, she had established a monopoly on the slave trade in the area and owned the main wharf in Bereira, several trading ships, and a warehouse. This success was in part due to the Islamic jihad in Futa Jallon; the vanquished were enslaved. Bereira itself was seized by the Muslims, but this had no detrimental effect on her business. She became recognised as the unofficial queen of the river up to the end of the century. Her wealth and political influence also earned her a reputation for diplomacy; she mediated a longstanding dispute that had endured from 1800 to 1807 between several local chiefs and the Sierra Leone Company and averted a war. She appears to have retired from the slave trade after this. According to a visitor, she furnished her house in the European style. In 1807, she had another house built.

He competed at the 1912 Summer Olympics and 1924 Summer Olympics. Early life and family Aur√©l von Kelemen was born on 20 April 1888 Budapest, Hungary to M√≥ric Kelemen, a judge. His brother Korn√©l Kelemen was a politician, member of the Party of Hungarian Life. He had a younger brother named Ern≈ë, a journalist, who ran a revisionist media agency in Amsterdam. Sport career He was a member of Magyar Atl√©tikai Club of Budapest between 1907 and 1944. He was a five-time national doubles champion. In 1920 he finished third at the Slovakia International Championships at Kassa. He represented Hungary in one Davis Cup tie, playing doubles alongside B√©la von Kehrling and subsequently lost to Jean Borotra and Ren√© Lacoste in 1925. In 1927 he was drafted into the international team challenge between Hungary and Austria and won the doubles tie partnering P√°l Aschner against the pair of Herbert Kinzl-Mayer. Personal life Aur√©l von Kelemen graduated at the k.u.k. Cadet School in Traiskirchen as a horse artillery First Lieutenant. In 1909 he was the first member of the newly established aviator class of the Magyar Atl√©tikai Club. He flew with a Gnome powered Farman plane. In 1922 he was appointed the Chief operating officer of the same Club. A year later he was elected the vice-president of the Hungarian Tennis Association. In 1926 he organized the first ever Hungarian nationwide youth tennis programme. In 1927 he was one of the founders of the first Hungarian Tungsram covered court at the V√°rosliget. In 1927 he introduced the usage of red clay in Hungary. Up to 1944 he was a master course lecturer at the Faculty of Physical Education and Sport Sciences of the Semmelweis University. In 1925 he published his own tennis guide entitled A modern Lawn Tennis sport. His profession was poultry farming and being an animal husbandry expert. He was awarded the title of Oberregierungsrat (a senior administrative position) by Hungarian Governor Mikl√≥s Horthy in 1930 for his sport merits. Controversy In June 1930 Kelemen and his associate and co-owner of their conglomerate Duray √©s Kelemen Term√©nykereskedelmi R√©szv√©nyt√°rsas√°g were accused of embezzlement and as a result were arrested. The case, better-known as the Equine nutrition-panama, was a military concession affair, where Kelemen's firm supplied the army with horse nutrition and allegedly bribed logistics officers to bypass the shipment regulations. Overall 29 quartermaster officers and 11 paymasters were arrested. Testimonies of these officers, many of whom received loans from Kelemen's company, cleared up his role and it was proven that he didn't gain any advantages in exchange for the loans. Kelemen was released on probation shortly after. The case was closed in December 1930, all charges against Kelemen and his business partner were dismissed, although many high-ranked military officers were sentenced to several years in prison.

In the modern era, the Inzerillo clan has been associated with the late John Gambino through heroin trafficking, and also has links to the former Gambino boss, Frank Cali. History Founded in 1950s, the clan is most known for its leader Salvatore \\"Totuccio\\" Inzerillo. For at least half a century they were considered the \\"aristocracy of Palermo's mafia\\". Related to the Spatola, Mannino, Castellano, Gambino, and Di Maggio families, they first landed in the US in 1956, settling in Cherry Hills. Their protector in the US was the boss Carlo Gambino, Inzerillo's cousin. In Sicily the clan was historically allied with the capomafia Stefano Bontade and it was mainly devoted to the organization of a large-scale trafficking of morphine from the Far East. The Inzerillos were overwhelmed in the mafia war that exploded between 1981 and 1983 in the streets of Palermo. Salvatore was killed by Kalashnikov fire on 10 May 1981 in Palermo. After that, the Corleonesi under Salvatore Riina killed his brothers Santo (who died in Palermo) and Pietro (found dead in New Jersey in the trunk of a car with $5 in his mouth and two dollars on his genitals), an uncle and the eldest son Giuseppe. The whole family fled to the United States except Filippa Spatola, Inzerillo's wife, and son Giovanni. Subsequently, the Sicilian Mafia Commission, under pressure from the American Cosa Nostra, decided to grant a pardon to the rest of the Inzerillo family, on the condition that none of them, nor their descendants, would ever return to Sicily. Gone for nearly 20 years, in early 2000 the Inzerilli were back in Palermo, and in the summer of 2007, murders in Palermo seemed to herald a new Mafia war. The first of the family to reappear was Franco, who had been thrown out of the US. Giovanni Inzerillo, Salvatore's son, was later indicted and arrested on 7 February 2008, in Operation Old Bridge against the Gambinos in New York and their connections in Palermo, involved in drug trafficking.Dozens Arrested in Italy and US in Major Mafia- busting Operation, La Repubblica, February 7, 2008Cosa Nostra-Lcn Connections: The Documents from Palermo Antimafia, La Repubblica, February 7, 2008  References  Category:1950s establishments in Italy Category:Sicilian Mafia clans ","title":"Inzerillo Mafia clan"},{"id":"39387754","text":"Willem Stibolt (9 June 1890 - 5 April 1964) was a Norwegian tennis player.

It served with 2nd Indian Cavalry Division on the Western Front. It was redesignated XVII Brigade, RHA in February 1917 and XVII Army Brigade, RHA just before being disbanded in April 1918. History II Indian Brigade, RHA II Indian Brigade, RHA was formed in December 1914 for the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division in France. It commanded *N Battery, RHA from IX Brigade, RHA at Secunderabad, India *V Battery, RHA from XII Brigade, RHA at Meerut, India *X Battery, RHA from XIII Brigade, RHA at Mhow, India * II Indian RHA Brigade Ammunition Column Each battery was armed with six 13 pounder guns. The brigade served with the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division on the Western Front and the brigade commander acted as Commander Royal Horse Artillery (CRHA). In practice, the batteries were permanently assigned to the cavalry brigades, viz: * N Battery with 9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade * V Battery with 7th (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade * X Battery with 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade then 3rd (Ambala) Cavalry Brigade from 15 September 1915 when it arrived from 1st Indian Cavalry Division In June 1916, 7th (Meerut) Cavalry Brigade (complete with V Battery, RHA) left the division and was reformed for service in Mesopotamia. Its place was taken by the Canadian Cavalry Brigade with its attached Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Brigade (A and B Batteries, RCHA each with four 13 pounders). Other than the Battle of the Somme in 1916 (Battle of Bazentin Ridge, 14‚Äì17 July and Battle of Flers-Courcelette, 15‚Äì22 September) and the Battle of Cambrai in 1917, the division was not involved in battle. Instead, it was held in reserve in case of a breakthrough, although it did send parties to the trenches on a number of occasions. They would hold the line, or act as Pioneers; such parties were designated as, for example, the Mhow Battalion. XVII Brigade, RHA On 26 November 1916, 2nd Indian Cavalry Division was renamed 5th Cavalry Division. Consequently, on 24 February 1917, the brigade was redesignated as XVII Brigade, RHA. In March 1918, the 5th Cavalry Division was broken up in France. The British and Canadian units remained in France and the Indian elements were sent to Egypt to help constitute 2nd Mounted Division. The brigade became XVII Army Brigade, RHA at this time, though this new identity was short lived. On 13 March, G Battery, RHA joined from IV Brigade, RHA (3rd Cavalry Division) to bring the brigade back up to three batteries. On 9 April, G and N Batteries, RHA left for V Army Brigade, RHA. On 17 April 1918, the brigade HQ was dissolved.

He competed for Bohemia in tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Early life and family Fuchs-Robƒõt√≠n was born 25 January 1889 in Prague to aristocrat Robert Fuchs, proprietor of the paper mill B√∂hmisch- Kamnitzer Papierfabriken Robert Fuchs in Kamenice and the Holzstoff‚Äì und Papierfabrik Robert Fuchs in Haunoldm√ºhle. The company exported paper products worldwide to South America, India, Indonesia, China, Japan, the Middle East and Australia. His father was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown third class. Later for his philanthropic ventures Emperor Franz Josef I also granted him the title of noble, which allowed him to bear the name Robettin (in Czech: Robƒõt√≠n), Rodƒõk or Ronƒõk, compounded with the German prefix \\"Fuchs Edler von Robbetin\\", and also a coat of arms. Karel's mother was Hermine von Poster, daughter of the factory owner and wholesaler from Budapest Karl Ludwig Ritter von Poster. Karl had two brothers Herbert and Oswald. The former married Hanna Fuchs-Robettin (n√©e Werfel) an thus she is the sister-in-law of Karel. Karel studied at the Czech Technical University in Prague and started to play tennis there at his college years. After World War I the family moved from Austria to Czechoslovakia and officially changed their name to Fuchs-Robƒõt√≠n (a nominal form that was rejected by Austrian Aristocratic department of the ministry before). The father died in 1925 in Prague. Tennis career At the age of nineteen he was one of the many Bohemians who competed in the international lawn tennis tournament of the Hungarian Athletics Club of Budapest. In 1919 he was a team member of the inter-club match between LTC ≈òevnice and LTC ƒåerno≈°ice, a tie which they won nine rubbers to five. Karel became a one-time national tennis champion, a feat, which he accomplished in 1920 in singles category. He represented Bohemia at the 1912 Summer Olympics in three events: outdoor singles, outdoor doubles (with Jarom√≠r Zeman), and indoor singles. He was also entered in the indoor doubles event (with Jaroslav Just) but did not play. In 1921 he was a member of the Czechoslovak team facing Belgium but lost both of his rubbers. In 1922 he was a part of a relief match for the Verdun Restoration Fund held at Wimbledon, in which he was defeated by Gerald Patterson in singles and again by Patterson and Rupert Wertheim in doubles with Friedrich Rohrer. The same year he played at the World Hard Court Championships but fell in the first round in singles but reached the quarterfinals of the consolation tournament but was beaten by Marius van der Feen. In doubles he met Henri Cochet and Jean Borotra in the second round but the French world class team proved to be too strong for him and his Czech teammate Pavel Macenauer. In 1923 he entered the World Hard Court Championships again but was eliminated by Roger Danet. In doubles he partnered Ladislav ≈Ωemla and lost to the French team of Pierre Canivet and R. Barbas. Despite his initial successes he retired early in 1924 although he did return to court in 1927. In 1930 he was ranked joint 14‚Äì15th shared with Felix Pipes on the official Czechoslovak rankings. Next year he slipped to joint 16-17‚Äì18th shared with Pipes and Bertrand. Ice hockey career Unlike his brothers Karel stayed in his home country after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938. He kept on practising at the I. Czech Lawn Tennis Club, which also had an ice hockey department. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the club life has changed. Surprisingly, in many aspects for the better. As any international sports meetings had ceased including tennis and hockey, which encompassed actually one and the same group of athletes gather daily at the club and diligently trained as domestic competition continued during the war. All this resulted in the season 1940 ‚Äì 1941 the club's victory over an age-old rival LTC Prague (2:1) and hence triumphed in the Protectorate hockey league. Karel competed there with his son RobƒÉ as forwards. Later, ƒåLTK didn't decline, but the club was held among the best three teams for ten more years. Many of Karel's clubmates and tennis opponents would later gone on to become 1947 World Ice Hockey Champions as part of the Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team. Personal life Karel finished his studies and became an architect. In 1921 he was the secretary of the Czechoslovak Tennis Association and became the President in 1929 and held the office to 1938. Later he stayed in touch with tennis and devoted himself to design tennis courts including the tennis stadium LTC Praha in Letn√°. Apart from the sports interests, the Fuchs-Robƒõt√≠n brothers took over the family business after Robert's death. Karel was appointed the chairman of the Economic Association of Paper Industry in Prague in the meantime. He also served as a chairman of the Technical Museum in Prague. He wrote a book on tennis, the Jak se nauƒçit hr√°t tenis d≈ô√≠v ne≈æ ostatn√≠ (How to learn to play tennis before others) and was an editor of the monthly magazine Stoln√≠ tenis a tenis (Table tennis and tennis). He also published two economy books relating to timber and paper manufacturing in 1921 and 1933. He received the Honor of Czechoslovak Physical Education and Sport in 1964. Karel married Anda Havliƒçek and they two sons, RobƒÉ and Karliƒçek.

On July 30, 1864, the house coined its name due to damage caused by a cannonball striking the house from a Union Army attack in the War between the states. The Cannonball House was constructed originally as a planter's townhouse in 1853. It was built by and for Judge Asa Holt. This explains why this house is also known as the \\"Mansion of the Old South\\" and the \\"Home of Judge Asa Holt.\\" The house was built using an authentic Greek revival architectural style and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The recreated meeting rooms of the Adelphean (ŒëŒîŒ†) and Philomathean (Œ¶Œú) societies (the world's first college sororities established at Wesleyan College in 1851 and 1852, respectively) are on display inside the house. The entire house is furnished to the 1853-1870 period. The rear of the Cannonball House is occupied by a hand-molded two- story brick kitchen. The upper level of this house served as servants' quarters. Few structures of this type remain in the Southern United States today. A bronze cannon, forged in 1864 at the Macon Arsenal, is on display in front of the Cannonball House.  History  The damage was done by the U.S. Army, under General George Stoneman, firing a cannonball from the location of what is now known as the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park, across the Ocmulgee River. The Union's iron cannonball bounced into the front of the house's left middle column after first striking sand sidewalk. These events occurred during the Battle of Dunlap Hill on July 30, 1864. No one was killed, or even injured during this assault, but the cannonball finally ended in the interior hallway after passing through a parlor. The Cannonball House is the only home in Macon that received damage. Due to failure to pay taxes, the city of Macon wanted to tear the home down and turn the site into a parking lot while descendants of the family were living in it in 1962. Thanks to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the house was purchased from the last family member living in the home, Miss Elizabeth Martin. They would make an apartment for her upstairs, and she was the first tour guide of the house. The Cannonball House was owned by Judge Asa Holt during the war and remained in the family until 1962 when it was sold to the United Daughters of the Confederacy.  Current uses  Artifacts from the antebellum era through the reconstruction era play a major role in the Cannonball House's mission to glorify Georgia's heritage. Community members and visitors have the house's devotion of presenting them historical educational programs, exhibits, and events with the intention of engaging and inspiring them. The Cannonball House currently holds a collection of Civil War artifacts and provides visitors with the opportunity to shop in the gift shop, explore the garden, and join historical and educational tours. Currently, the house serves as a historic house museum that culturally and architecturally presents the past of Macon. It is owned and operated by The Friends of the Cannonball House, a non-profit organization.  Collections  Historical pieces are held in the house today. Several collections that the house contains includes the Alpha Delta Pi (Adelphean), Phi Mu (Philomathean), Civil war, general museum, and the servant's quarters.  Adelphean Collection  The Adelphean Society, today known as Alpha Delta Pi, is the first national collegiate women's society. This society's original furnishings are in the parlor today, along with the founders' portraits. The Adelphean Society's diamond symbol is an important part of the display in the room, as well.  Philomathean Collection  Today known as Phi Mu, the Philomathean Collection in the house contains the founders' portraits, jewelry personalized with the Philomathean motto, original light fixtures, marble mantel, and a glass chandelier.  Civil War Collection  The Civil War museum that is a part of the house displays Georgian officers' uniforms and their used weapons. Uniforms include the jacket of Richmond Depot Type II. Company flags can be found in this collection, such as the Jackson Artillery Flag.  General Museum Collection  Textiles and period clothing are found and rotated in the general collection. Quilts handmade between 1850 through 1920, nineteenth century wedding dresses, original day dresses, and children's clothing all rotate in and out of display due to their fragility.  Servant's Quarters  The Servant's Quarters' collection holds two beds, trunks, and spinning wheels. There are three tables and tea sets. More items include a wardrobe, straight chairs, a weasel, pie safe, grain bin, and bathtub.

Like most wild gourds and squashes, it is creeping vine and is often found climbing over other vegetation. It has been found only in the western provinces of Guayas and Manabi. There is evidence that it was domesticated in Ecuador around 10,000 years ago, likely for its seeds, but no direct records exist and it is no longer cultivated. It is resistant to many diseases of cultivated Cucurbita species, and has been used to breed resistance to several diseases into common squashes.

Peacock, Scott, Senior Editor (2000), Gales Contemporary Authors, Volume 82 , pp. 143-146 Aside from \\"Samuel Edwards\\", which would seem to have been his dedicated by-line for tie-in work, Gerson used the following nine pseudonyms in addition to his own name: Anne Marie Burgess; Michael Burgess; Nicholas Gorham; Paul Lewis; Leon Phillips; Donald Clayton Porter; Dana Fuller Ross; Philip Vail; and Carter A. Vaughan.Hawk, Pat (1995), Hawk's Author's Pseudonyms II , p. 225 Life He was the son of Sam Gerson, who directed the Shubert theaters in Chicago. Gerson attended the University of Chicago, and served as the campus correspondent for the Chicago Herald-Examiner. Following graduation, he became a reporter at the paper. He later joined Chicago-based WGN as a publicity writer, subsequently becoming its talent director and main scriptwriter. After his World War II military experience in Army intelligence, he began writing TV scripts before beginning his career as an author in 1950. He and his wife Marilyn had a son and three daughters. Literary focus Gerson's primary focus was on historical novels, mostly stand-alone, with American history receiving considerable attention. Of note, he wrote a number of historical novels about colonial America and also the United States in its formative years. Gerson also wrote a large number of biographies and biographical novels. These included several on U.S. presidents, such as Andrew Jackson, James Polk, and Theodore Roosevelt. Many of his biographic works also focused on notable women in history such as Empress Theodora of the Byzantine Empire; William the Conqueror's formidable wife, Matilda of Flanders; and Pocahantas. During the latter stages of his career, Gerson wrote two series of American historical novels having characters that continued through the series. Using the pen name Dana Fuller Ross, the first was the popular twenty- four book Wagons West series that began in 1978 and is currently being republished. The first four books in this series describe the initial wagon train to Oregon beginning in 1837. Beginning in 1979, Gerson initiated a second series called White Indian using the pen name of Donald Clayton Porter. Set in the late 1600s, it portrays the life of Renno, a child of settlers, who was raised by the Seneca to become a senior warrior. Bibliography Gerson was one of the most prolific writers of modern times, with over 150 books verifiably counted to his credit. His work can be divided into three major parts: standalone novels, including biographical ones; series novels, usually under a house pseudonym; and nonfiction. Besides his own name, he also wrote under several pen names.Burke, W.J. and Howe, Will D.

He competed in two events at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Apart from his supremacy in the Russian national championships he was a Maltese champion and various French Riviera titleholder. Early life and family Russian Imperial Family (latter pictured) leaving Crimea Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston was born on in 1893 to Count Nicholai Felixovich Sumarokov- Elston reserve Lieutenant of the Cavalry Regiment and Countess Sofia Mikhaylovna Koskul. He was the great-great-great-great-grandson of poet Alexander Sumarokov and the Great Great Grandson of Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov. He was the nephew of tennis player Count Pavel Sumarokov-Elston, who was his first coach and doubles partner, grandson of Count-General Felix Sumarokov-Elston, Governor of Kuban Oblast, and cousin of the infamous Prince Felix Yussupov, who later became known as one of the collaborators who conspired to kill Grigori Rasputin, cult leader and mentor of Empress consort of Russia Alexandra. Felix provided his own palace for the murder spot and also shot Rasputin once before murdering him with the help of his accomplices. Mikhail had a sister called Elena and a brother Nicholas. At the age of twelve he had a surgery on his right hand, which as a result was rendered unsuitable for tennis and he later switched to left-hand play. First he moved to Dresden and was trained by Kurt Bergmann and George K. Logie. In 1906 he entered the second-class tournament of the Bad Homburg Championships, where he defeated Jack Hillyard amongst many to claim his first title. With this he set a record of being the youngest winner ever at the time in the history of the tournament. In 1908 his father and brother died within two weeks of each other. He moved back to his homeland and graduated first at the Annenschule then at the Law Faculty of the St. Petersburg University. He volunteered for the Russian Red Cross motorized ambulance unit at the outbreak of World War I, and was assigned to the Black Sea Fleet. Her mother died on 3 April 1915. He was invalided out of the military service on 26 November 1916 and travelled home to St. Petersburg. Mikhail was arrested for a couple of days by the Bolsheviks, but released because of disagreement among the people who detained him. The family permanently emigrated from Russia in the midst of the Russian Revolution, which emerged from the social fallback of the World War. First they fled to Koreiz where they were joined by fugitive Felix Yussupov who had been freed from his house arrest due to his involvement in the Rasputin murder. They agreed to join the White Army, but General Anton Denikin refused the request because the princes had ties to the Imperial dynasty. They sailed to Malta on 13 April 1919 aboard the British battleship , which also transported several other Russian nobility exiles, including Empress Maria Feodorovna. From there they moved to Rome. In 1920 he further moved to Nice, where he lived for 17 more years. Tennis career Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston was an eight-time national tennis champion, and also a two-time national indoors champion. He was successful in singles five consecutive times between 1910‚Äì14, two more time in mixed doubles and also a doubles champion. He is still the youngest All-Russia champion to date with his 14 years of age at the time of his first triump. He won his first indoor trophy in 1911 in St. Petersburg. On international level his first main tournament was the 1905 Bad Homburg Cup (of which he won the second-class edition) but lost in the second round to Irving Wright. The next year at the Wiesbaden Championships, where he ‚Äì still an adolescent ‚Äì was forced to withdraw from the second round after beating Herr von Parpart in the kick-off round. He played in several other tournaments throughout Germany, France and Switzerland before returning to Russia. There he won city tournaments in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Altogether he was crowned two-time St. Petersburg champion in 1912 and 1914 and two-time Moscow champion in 1910 counting the singles and doubles. Only a week after his first St. Petersburg title Sumarokov traveled to Sweden to participate in the 1912 Summer Olympics with veteran player Aleksandr Alenitsyn. That tournament was also his only preparation for the games as he had to pass his high school diploma exams prior. The Olympic draw suffered a setback on expected entries of well-known players due to scheduling conflicts with the 1912 Wimbledon Championships. Even Alenitsyn withdrew from the singles outdoor event before its start. The first match against the Swedish champion Carl Setterwall saw an easy two set lead for Sumarokov the third was taken by Sweden after a twenty-game tie and the fourth last set was secured by Russia. In the next round 1912 French Championships finalist Oscar Kreuzer waited for his opponent. The match, which was witnessed by Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna had a back-and-forth fight so fierce that Sumarokov torn the strings of his racquet and had to change it but that could't save him from losing to the German in four sets. He found consolation in the doubles tournament where he and Alenitsyn reached the quarterfinals. The first Russian Championships opened for foreign player registration were held for the first time in 1912. Among the non-Russian entrants were Ludwig von Salm-Hoogstraeten, Harold Kitson and Einer Ulrich. The first of these big tests came in the semifinals against Count Salm. The Austrian lost in straight sets only showing resistance in the second. The final match should have been a showdown between Kitson and Sumarokov but lasted short. After Sumarokov scored the first set 6:3 Kitson got frustrated, complained to the chair umpire, grabbed his towel and left the court citing a right hand injury, which resulted in a walkover home victory. He became the undisputed champion after winning the doubles and mixed doubles as well with Count Salm and Ekaterina Hirschfeld respectively. 1913 started the same way as the year before, Mikhail had to pass his University exams so he had few chances to practise before setting out to Paris for the World Hard Court Championships. There he advanced through the first round beating E. Chelli. In the second round he was drawn to face young French prodigy and reigning Olympic champion Andr√© Gobert. It was a quick defeat as Sumarokov couldn't adapt to the fast-paced net-volley game of Gobert. He was also eliminated from the doubles contest in the very first round mostly due to his partner Paul Aym√©'s leg injury, which he suffered the previous night and kept them handicapped the whole match. Oddly it is thanks to these early exits that he was eligible for the consolation tournament, which was organized for the losers of the first two rounds. There he played his first match against one- half of his recent doubles opponents William le Maire de Warz√©e d'Hermalle (who had a 6-1 head-to-head record against fellow Belgian Champion Paul de Borman at the time). This proved to be a tough warm-up for the later matches and it went two sets six-all before Elston broke through. His former doubles partner Paul Aym√© resigned from the quarterfinal for unknown reasons and gave him a walkover. In the semifinal came a pleasant surprise as the defending consolation title-holder Felix Pipes lost to him in two fast sets. The final was a rematch from the Russian Championships with Ludwig von Salm- Hoogstraeten. The day was struck with extreme heat so intense that it was dangerous to health. After a four set deuce the two finalists agreed to leave the decision to the drawing of lots and finish the match. The luck favored Salm and therefore he was announced the winner. The Cup was awarded to him but as soon as the chairman of the International Lawn Tennis Federation Henry Wallet realized that the winner's name was traditionally engraved onto the cup he reversed his decision and divided the prizes. Two weeks later Sumarokov was schedules to retain his title at the second annual Russian International Championships. It had a star-loaded 136-competitor field with Frenchmen Maurice Germot, Max Decugis and British Arthur Lowe and Charles P. Dixon all were present. In the first semifinal Sumarokov encountered Germot and overcame him in three straight sets while in the other all-English semifinal Dixon triumphed over Lowe. The final showed that the Russian player could stand the ground against world top ten challengers as well. From a two-one set disadvantage he closed the match with a two love-sets and kept his title after 2 hours 54 minutes battle. He then lost to Dixon in the first round of the doubles but beat him again for the mixed doubles title. Although never played in the Davis Cup he represented Russia in the international matches against Great Britain and France in the last two consecutive years preceding the First World War. First in 1913 against the England team of Roderick McNair, Albert Prebble, Arthur Lowe and Charles P. Dixon. The two tennis federation agreed in a 12-match tie with 8 singles and 4 doubles rubbers. Sumarokov was still exhausted from his recent Russian Championships final with Dixon and thus lost easily to Lowe and decided to step back from further participation and had to be replaced with inexperienced players. As a consequence the Russian team lost. This marked the first time that an official national tennis team was formed. In the 1914 Russian Championships he became a five-time champion after defeating Heinrich Kleinschroth in a five-set final. Curiosity of the Russian- German meeting was that the Sarajevo regicide happened during the tournament (which later escalated into World War I) and Russia had sent an envoy to France to strengthen a possible alliance against the German Empire. Just two weeks later the first Russia-France team match was held. It was agreed to follow Davis Cup rules and the French delegation was an all-Olympian squad of Maurice Germot, Max Decugis, Albert Canet, √âdouard M√©ny de Marangue The team challenge was interrupted in the middle with the outbreak of World War I and the visitors only managed to get onto the last train home before Germany declared war on the Russian Empire on 19 July. After the war he won the Malta Championships in 1919. The following year he clinched his first French title at the South of France Championships beating home favorite Alain Gerbault in a five-set final. The next year in Nice he was eliminated in the semifinal stage by Gordon Lowe. However he did defend his South of France title by beating Giovanni Balbi de Robecco by only dropping two games. This was the first time he partnered Suzanne Lenglen for the mixed contest, which they won. In 1922 he was triumphant in Nice] as well, grabbing the singles trophy easily against Maurice F√©rrier. He took the doubles as well with Gerbault. He defended the South of France title for the second time against legendary Henri Cochet having had beaten Charles Aeschlimann on his way to the final. At the same tournament he also repeated his last year feat with Lenglen by overcoming Lord Rocksavage and Elizabeth Ryan in the mixed final. He almost celebrated his first triple crown trophy with his teammate Gerbault but fell short in the doubles final against Rocksavage-Cochet. It is worth to note that it was the first time Sumarokov played on grass courts. In 1923 the team of Sumarokov- Lenglen dropped the same title to Randolph Lycett and Elizabeth Ryan. In 1931 at the Parc Imperial L.T.C. de Nice George Lyttleton-Rogers and his partner Rosie Berthet had an overwhelming victory over Sumarokov-Elston and Miss. J. Franks in the mixed final. The same year he was also mixed doubles runner-up in two other tournaments at the New Court Lawn Tennis Club and Cannes Lawn Tennis Club losing both times. He reached the semifinals of the doubles and mixed in the Nice Tennis Club tournament. He won the Russian √âmigr√© Tennis Championships three consecutive times beginning from 1935. He turned professional in 1936. Playing style and equipment He played left-handed with a heavy topspin, after he had to give up his right-handed style due to a childhood injury. His left-hand serve was so rare that he gave exhibition matches in Germany to Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia and Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia. According to his contemporary coach Alexandr Stakhovich he was a baseline player with a formidable backhand. Sumarokov played with Doherty, Slazenger and Driva racquets. In 1911 he changed to Maxim racquets. The manufacturer even released an autographed series of racquets with \\"Sumarokov\\" written on it with golden embossed letters. Later he adjusted his game to putting a curl to the ball as well as hitting it hard and with a high trajectory as described by Henri Cochet in his book Tennis. He is thought to be the first who used this method, which became popular decades later, and being used by many players most notably Jimmy Connors and Guillermo Vilas. Personal life Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston was well educated and at the age of thirteen he already spoke five languages. Apart from playing tennis he was an amateur chess player as well. He was in a great relationship with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and played tennis with a couple of times. In 1913 he was elected an honorary member of the Stade Fran√ßais in Paris. He married Natalia Nikolaevna Bellik in 1932. The next year she gave birth to their daughter Sofia. They moved to London in 1937, where led the Anglo-Russian Sports Club in Chiswick. Died in the University College Hospital in 1970 and was buried in the Chiswick New Cemetery. In 2002 he was inducted to the Russian Tennis Hall of Fame for his sport merits.

Hodgson was appointed knight bachelor in 1979.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 6 Nov 2014 He also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1979. As chairman, Hodgson felt that ICI needed to increase business in Europe, improve productivity and shift from bulk chemicals to higher value-added products. A fierce efficiency drive led to the loss of 30,000 jobs. His successor John Harvey-Jones carried out many of the changes that Hodgson had initiated. Biography Maurice Arthur Eric Hodgson was born in Bradford and educated at Bradford Grammar School. He read Chemistry at Merton College, Oxford and joined ICI at Billingham in 1942. By 1944 he was leading research connected with the Atom Bomb. In the late 50s he was posted to New York for three years. He returned in 1960 to become Research Director of ICI's Heavy Organic Chemicals Division. As Chairman, Hodgson was hampered by near blindness after a cataract operation: For a time papers were read to him; he obtained a TV system to magnify the text;ICI Magazine, published monthly for employees and he used Speed Reading. He retired from ICI in 1982 and became chairman and chief executive of British Home Stores. In 1985 this merged with Habitat to become Storehouse and he served on their board until 1989. In 1984 he attempted to save Dunlop but after a short time its bankers took control. Hodgson was knighted in 1979. He was awarded the Messel medal of the Society of Chemical Industry and the George E. Davis medal of the Institution of Chemical Engineers. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1979. Hodgson enjoyed watching horse races and became an owner. In 1945 he married Norma Fawcett; she died in 2002.

The bill would extend the geographic boundaries of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and would allow the United States Military to establish naval defensive sea areas and airspace reservations when necessary for national defense. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. If enacted H.R. 573 would accomplish two main things. First, to the government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, it would convey submerged lands surrounding such Islands and extending three geographical miles outward from their coastlines. Second, it would include the Northern Mariana Islands among the islands where the President of the United States may establish naval defensive sea areas and airspace reservations when necessary for national defense. Procedural history H.R. 573 was introduced into the House by Rep. Gregorio Sablan (D-CNMI) on February 6, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and then to the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs.

As a native of Bradford, he investigated the speech of West Yorkshire in his early work. His first publication, Emily Bront√´ and the Haworth Dialect, compared the speech of the servant Joseph in Wuthering Heights with information on the Haworth dialect from two informants. He was one of the first to apply Labovian methods in Britain with his research in 1970-1 on the speech of Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield. He concluded that the speech detailed in most of dialectology (e.g. A. J. Ellis, the Survey of English Dialects) had virtually disappeared, having found only one speaker out of his sample of 106 speakers who regularly used dialect. However, he found that differences in speech persisted as an indicator of social class, age and gender. This PhD dissertation was later adapted into a book, Dialect and Accent in Industrial West Yorkshire. The work was criticised by Graham Shorrocks on the grounds that the sociolinguistic methods used were inappropriate for recording the traditional vernacular and that there was an inadequate basis for comparison with earlier dialect studies in West Yorkshire. His 1980 book The study of dialect: an introduction to dialectology was a critical history of dialect studies. He also wrote a generally positive review of the very successful textbook Accents of English by John C. Wells. After a brief appointment art University College Cardiff in the early 1960s, Petyt spent most of his professional career at the University of Reading, lecturing in linguistic science. Later in his career, he published the book The Growth of Reading in 1993. He retired to the Yorkshire Dales and wrote a review of dialect studies in the Sedburgh area in 2014, which he donated to both the Sedbergh and District History Society and the Yorkshire Dialect Society.

The premise revolves around the fictional general manager of the Cleveland Browns (Costner) deciding what to do after his team acquires the number one draft pick in the upcoming National Football League draft. The film premiered in Los Angeles on April 7, 2014 and was released in the United States on April 11, 2014. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office failure grossing just $29 million against its $25 million budget. Plot On the morning of the 2014 NFL Draft, Cleveland Browns general manager Sonny Weaver Jr. must decide how to use the seventh overall pick to improve the team, but he has other problems on his mind. His semi- secret girlfriend Ali Parker, the team's salary cap analyst, is pregnant, and the recent death of Sonny's father causes tension with his mother. Sonny had fired his father, a legendary coach for the Browns which he later admits was for his mother's sake because his father refused to retire even with failing health. The Seattle Seahawks hold the first overall draft pick, and general manager Tom Michaels offers to trade it to Sonny; this would allow the Browns to draft highly-rated quarterback prospect Bo Callahan. Sonny initially declines, but under orders from team owner Anthony Molina to \\"make a splash,\\" reluctantly makes the deal, trading away the Browns' first-round draft picks for the current season plus the next two years. The unexpected opportunity to obtain Callahan excites Browns fans, but splits the team's front office and players. The trade goes public after a tweet by Ohio State linebacker Vontae Mack, who had been Sonny's original choice as first pick. Vontae tells Sonny to re-watch college footage of him and Callahan playing against each other, with Mack coming out on top. Sonny begins to have doubts about Callahan's ability under pressure, and the Browns' investigations also bring Callahan's character into question. When the draft begins that evening, Sonny agonises over the choice before drafting Vontae Mack at number one. Roger Goodell's announcement of the selection shocks the rest of the league, and disrupts many of their plans for their own picks. Molina is irate and flies back to Cleveland, intent on firing Sonny. Head coach Vince Penn is also incensed and threatens to resign. Rumors spread about Callahan as other teams avoid selecting him. However, the Seahawks are still in contention to pick Callahan with the seventh pick, and Sonny senses an opportunity. He convinces the rookie general manager of the Jacksonville Jaguars to trade him their pick at sixth in exchange for the Browns' second-round draft picks for that season plus the next two years. Sonny then calls Michaels; in return for passing on Callahan, Sonny demands his first-round picks back, along with punt returner David Putney. After fraught negotiations, the Seahawks seal the deal and choose Callahan at sixth pick. With his now-restored seventh pick, Sonny appeases Penn and Molina by selecting skilled running back Ray Jennings of Florida State, himself the son of a former Browns player. Molina and his team celebrate an outstanding draft for the Browns. After the draft party, Sonny reconciles with his mother over his excellent draft performance and her soon- to-be first grandchild.

Cameos with real-life NFL figures such as league commissioner Roger Goodell and ESPN sportscaster Chris Berman were filmed before and after the draft took place. The rest of the film began filming on May 8, 2013. 2014 NFL Draft As in the film, the Cleveland Browns made splashes at the draft, trading up to select quarterback Johnny Manziel with the 22nd pick. The team also made several deals, trading away their fourth pick to the Buffalo Bills but for their ninth pick, as well as their 2015 first round pick. They later traded up to the eighth pick to draft Justin Gilbert. Finally, after watching Manziel drop farther than projected, they again traded up for the 22nd pick. Chris Berman, who played himself in the fictionalized draft, commented at the 2014 NFL Draft that the events surrounding the Cleveland Browns were more exciting than the film. Unlike the film, the Browns selected the much-hyped Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, as opposed to passing on Bo Callahan, the fictionalized first pick favorite. Marketing The first poster and trailer for the film were released on December 23, 2013. Reception Box office The film grossed $28.8 million in North America with an additional $604,801 overseas for a worldwide total of $29.5 million, against a budget of $25 million. The film grossed $9.8 million in its opening weekend, finishing in fourth place at the box office behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Rio 2, and Oculus (the latter two also being new releases). Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 59% based on 153 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It's perfectly pleasant for sports buffs and Costner fans, but overall, Draft Day lives down to its title by relying too heavily on the sort of by-the-numbers storytelling that only a statistician could love.\\" On the aggregated review site Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Chicago Sun-Times critic Richard Roeper gave the film a \\"B\\", stating the film is \\"a sentimental, predictable, sometimes implausible but thoroughly entertaining, old-fashioned piece.\\" On the contrary, Jack Hamilton of Slate was harshly critical. \\"The 'filmmaking' here consists of making sure the camera is pointed at people who are explaining the film's plot to one another, preferably while they are wearing logos and standing in front of more logos,\\" he wrote. He suggested the NFL's involvement had made the film too upbeat. \\"[It] isn't so much a movie as a movielike infomercial for the kinder, gentler NFL ... In the wake of labor strife, off-field scandals, and the ongoing CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) crisis, the NFL is doubling down on its fantasy of paternalism, and Draft Day is that fantasy's porn film.\\" Former Green Bay Packers vice president Andrew Brandt criticized Draft Day as \\"lacking any true depiction of how an NFL team operates leading up to and during the draft\\", and less realistic about the business of sports than Jerry Maguire and Moneyball.

The film, shot in black-and-white, is set during the mid-17th century English Civil War. The film was released on 2013 on multiple platforms simultaneously, including cinemas, home media and video on demand. It was also broadcast on Film4 on the day of its release. Plot During a battle of the English Civil War, an alchemist's assistant named Whitehead flees from the strict Commander Trower. Whitehead is saved by a rough soldier named Cutler, who kills Trower before he can apprehend Whitehead. Whitehead then meets two army deserters, the veteran Jacob and the witless Friend. The four leave the battleground in search of an ale house that Cutler claims is nearby. Cutler instead leads them to a field with many mushrooms growing in it, where he cooks a meal with some mushrooms and encourages the others to eat, in order to make them more obedient; save for Whitehead who is fasting. Following their meal they haul an Irishman, the Wizard O'Neill, seemingly out of the ground using a rope wrapped around a strangely carved wooden post buried in the ground. O'Neill is a rival alchemist for whom Cutler works; and who had stolen documents from Whitehead's master, which Whitehead is trying to recover. O'Neil quickly asserts authority over the group and tells them of a treasure hidden somewhere in the field. The group goes to O'Neill's camp, where O'Neill tortures Whitehead into subservience to use him as a human Divining Rod. After using Whitehead to locate the treasure, which it turns out is near the camp, O'Neill orders Jacob and Friend to dig for it while he leaves Cutler to supervise, and goes to sleep in a tent. Jacob soon succumbs to the influence of the hallucinogenic mushrooms, and after several hours of digging he attacks Friend. Cutler laughs and urinates on them, and when Jacob attempts to attack him, Cutler accidentally shoots Friend. Whitehead is unable to save him, and Friend dies, telling Jacob to deliver a message to his wife, telling her that he hates her. Cutler is forced to finish digging by himself, while Jacob lies down in the undergrowth, and Whitehead deposits Friend's corpse in a thicket. Cutler eventually nears reaching the treasure, attracting the attention of O'Neill, who discovers Jacob and Whitehead gone. Reaching where Friend's corpse is, O'Neill pursues Whitehead, who ingests a considerable quantity of mushrooms, heightening his awareness but suffering a hallucinatory experience, wherein he conjures a violent wind to blow away the camp's tent. Cutler discovers that the \\"treasure\\" is just a skull, which he shoots in anger. Jacob comes back to join Whitehead in escaping from O'Neill. Cutler angrily berates O'Neill, blaming him for trusting Whitehead and lying to him about the alehouse - which was simply a ploy to entice Jacob and Friend - and abuses him. O'Neill promptly kills Cutler and then pursues Whitehead and Jacob, who scavenge Cutler's weapons and return to the overturned camp. As they are preparing for an attack, Friend appears alive and reveals their location to O'Neill. As Jacob throws Friend to the ground to stop him, O'Neill shoots Jacob in the gut, but Jacob returns fire breaking O'Neill's leg. Jacob dies from his injuries, after he and Whitehead surmise that the treasure was the friendship they shared. Friend brandishes Cutler's pike and charges O'Neill, but O'Neill kills him with his last shot. Whitehead takes advantage of the situation to finally kill O'Neill by shooting him in the back of the head. Whitehead buries his friends' corpses in the hole and leaves the field. Wearing O'Neill's clothes, he gathers his master's stolen documents and returns to the hedgerow where he first met Cutler, Jacob and Friend, from which battle sounds are rising. After he wades through the hedge, he sees Friend, Jacob and himself standing together, implying he is still under the effects of the mushrooms in the field behind him. Cast * Reece Shearsmith as Whitehead * Michael Smiley as O'Neill * Peter Ferdinando as Jacob * Richard Glover as Friend * Ryan Pope as Cutler * Julian Barratt as Commander Trower Production A Field in England is directed by Ben Wheatley based on a screenplay by Amy Jump. Wheatley became interested in the film's historical setting of the English Civil War when he filmed a documentary about the Sealed Knot, a historical reenactment society. In his research, Wheatley also learned about the use of hallucinogens during the 17th century. He said, \\"People were grinding mushrooms into dust and blowing it into people‚Äôs faces and then doing magic tricks.\\" Wheatley sought funding to produce the film, which he had planned for years. The film was ultimately developed and financed by Film4.0, a division of Film4 that serves as an innovation hub. Variety reported that the film was described as \\"a psychedelic trip into magic and madness\\". Wheatley said A Field in England combines \\"the more psychedelic elements\\" from his previous films Kill List and Sightseers and \\"weaves in our take on historical drama\\" with the English Civil War. The film was shot in black-and- white. The Observer said the style was part of a resurgence with films like The Artist, Much Ado About Nothing, Frances Ha and Nebraska. Wheatley said he and cinematographer Laurie Rose made a spontaneous decision to film in black and white. Wheatley and Rose watched Culloden and other films by Peter Watkins, as well as arthouse films from the 1960s and 1970s, to explore the style. The pair experimented with camera tests before filming A Field in England and committed to the \\"unfussy\\" style. With a production budget of ¬£300,000, filming began in late September 2012. It took place in the countryside outside Guildford in Surrey. Filming lasted for . Release A Field in England screened in competition at the 48th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival on 2013, where it won the Special Jury Prize. It was released in the United Kingdom on 2013 through several platforms simultaneously. The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"A Field in England will mark the first time a homegrown title has been released simultaneously in theaters, on DVD, free TV and video-on-demand.\\" The film had received funding from the BFI Distribution Fund New Models strand, \\"which supports experimental release models\\". Film4 and its arms 4DVD and Film4 Channel collaborated with distributor Picturehouse Entertainment and with the BFI Distribution Fund for the rollout. Wheatley compared the multi-platform release to how the band Radiohead released its album In Rainbows for free. Drafthouse Films acquired the rights to distribute the film in North America. It partnered with Cinedigm in September 2013, and they released the film on 6 February 2014 on various platforms and formats. For the cinema release of A Field in England in the UK, Weltons Brewery brewed a limited edition ale to give to cinema-goers. The beer had the tagline \\"Open Up and Let the Devil In\\" to tie into the use of hallucinogens in the film. The ale was bottled with yeast, which required a slow pour to ensure \\"continuous secondary fermentation\\" for the beer to be fresh. Reception The film received positive reviews. On film aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an 88% rating, with an average score of 7.2/10, based on reviews from 67 critics. It has a score of 73/100 (indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\") on Metacritic, based on reviews from 19 critics. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that A Field in England was a \\"grisly and visceral\\" film that was \\"exposed to the elements, shivering with fever and discomfort\\". Bradshaw said that Wheatley has \\"cleverly alighted on the one period that suits his stripped-down visuals and subversive instincts perfectly\\". Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote that the film was Wheatley's \\"most unclassifiable yet, blending historical drama, 1960s psychedelia and formal experimentation\\". He said, \\"Flawed as it is, A Field in England is some achievement, drumming up an earthly inferno out of next to nothing‚Äîdirt and wind, a patch of land, some blokes with scraggy beards. The result, in a minor-key fashion, is a blast‚ÄîApocalypse Now among the hedgerows.\\" Stephen Dalton, reviewing for The Hollywood Reporter, said, \\"A strikingly original historical thriller spiced with occult mysticism and mind- warping hallucinations, British director Ben Wheatley's fourth feature has all the midnight-movie intensity of a future cult classic.\\" Dalton noted flaws in the film but said that beside them, A Field in England is a rich, strange, hauntingly intense work from a highly original writer-director team.\\" Peter Debruge of Variety called A Field in England \\"a defiantly unclassifiable cross-genre experiment... that simultaneously reinvents and regurgitates low- budget British cinema as it goes\\". Debruge said of the director's approach, \\"Clearly, Wheatley is bored with the paint-by-numbers approach of his horror contemporaries, but has swung so far in the opposite direction here, the result feels almost amateurishly avant garde at times, guilty of the sort of indulgences one barely tolerates in student films.\\" Writing The Guardians Peter Bradshaw said A Field in England had \\"a more literary screenplay\\" than \\"the improv feel\\" of Wheatley's previous films. Bradshaw compared the writing to that of Dennis Potter and Edward Bond. He also found the British tone similar to the films Straw Dogs and Withnail and I. The Independents Romney said, \\"The screenplay contains much juicy period dialogue, although the gist is often lost amid hectic cuts, drunken camera moves and the men's habit of grabbing each other by the throat.\\" For Romney, \\"the sharpest moments of clarity\\" in the narrative came in the dialogue. The Hollywood Reporters Dalton wrote, \\"One of the film's pleasures is its rich dialogue‚Äîa ripe blend of Shakespearean finery, salty swearing and lowbrow toilet humor.\\" The trade paper noted, \\"Jump sets up some interesting tensions between Christian faith and Pagan witchcraft, science and sorcery, soldiers and scholars.\\" Cinematography The Guardian wrote that \\"the monochrome images\\" were similar to those of the 1975 film Winstanley. The Independent said the photography had \\"furious visual panache and... ominous, often abstract beauty\\". The Hollywood Reporter commended the \\"terrific\\" cinematography of \\"ravishing monochrome vistas punctuated by extreme close-ups of plants, animals, insects and tormented human faces\\". Variety wrote, \\"The commitment to monochrome brings out a beauty largely absent in previous collaborations with d.p. Laurie Rose, though his handheld style and axis- breaking setups often disorient‚Äîand not necessarily in ways that help the psychic imbalance the pic means to achieve.\\" Cast and characters The Guardian wrote, \\"Smiley is a great O'Neil, scary and commanding, while Shearsmith's Whitehead is hilariously submissive.\\" It added about Shearsmith's role, \\"His performance here is equal to and better than the 'gothic' characters he has created on television.\\" Variety also commended Shearsmith's performance as leaving \\"the strongest impression\\". The trade paper expressed disappointment at a general lack of character development, \\"Although Wheatley and Jump have gotten away with eliminating exposition and traditional character detail in the past, it's frustratingly difficult to follow what this motley group is searching for, much less to distinguish between the various personalities.\\" Editing Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump edited the film together. Variety said the editors \\"hypnotize the audience by cutting back and forth between shots of the various characters, folding and mirroring the images into disconcerting hallucinations\\". The Independent wrote that the editors' \\"big firework display\\" was that of a psychedelic experience, which was \\"a stroboscopic pandemonium of mirror images, flash cuts, bursts of light\\". Music and sound The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"Sound designer Martin Pavey and composer Jim Williams also deserve special mention for underpinning these ostensibly calm pastoral scenes with a constant undertow of clanging, churning menace.\\" The Independent commended Pavey's work, \\"Everything floats unmoored, dialogue has the same sonic status as the wind or the eerie music.\\" See also *List of films featuring hallucinogens *List of black-and-white films produced since 1970 References External links * ‚Äì official site * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:2010s historical horror films Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:English-language films Category:British films Category:British historical horror films Category:British black-and-white films Category:English Civil War films Category:Films directed by Ben Wheatley ","title":"A Field in England"},{"id":"39388327","title":"Connect (album)"},{"id":"39388368","text":"(1277‚Äì1360) was a Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk, founder of My≈çshin-ji Temple and a principal member of the extant ≈åt≈çkan lineage, from which all modern Rinzai Zen derives.

In an interview on Gaydar Radio, he said \\"...we hadn't actually met until the day of recording the vocals. We spoke on email and we recorded the vocals down at Dave Pemberton's studio in Essex. It was a great day. Very, very relaxed. It was a bit nervous at first, obviously meeting Toyah but it was a very good day. It took about three hours and all done, pretty much, in one take.

Until 2008, it was a division of Rockefeller University.Rockarch.org\\"New Governance at the Rockefeller Archive Center,\\" Rockefeller Archive Center Newsletter, 2008. http://rockarch.org/publications/newsletter/nl2008.pdf  Founding and history  The Rockefeller Archive Center was initially established in 1974 as a division of Rockefeller University. It is located in the Hillcrest house, in Pocantico Hills, North Tarrytown, NY, adjacent to the Kykuit estate. Hillcrest was initially constructed in 1963 for Martha Baird Rockefeller, wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., although she did not ever stay in the house. Martha played a key role in collaborating with architect Mott Schmidt for design of the house, as evidenced by sketches and letters. The 32-room mansion is situated on 24 acres, and the property was given to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund at Martha's death in 1971. Lower-level storage vaults with temperature and humidity control were constructed in 1974 as the beginnings of the Rockefeller Archive Center, which opened its doors in 1975. Construction was done to create 2.5 floors of archival storage below the existing residence. The house continues to contain other family artwork and artifacts, including John D. Rockefeller Jr.‚Äôs oak-paneled office from 26 Broadway, relocated to Hillcrest in its original configuration.  Collections  While the Rockefeller Archive Center was initially conceived as a repository for records of Rockefeller University and Rockefeller Family philanthropic projects, it now more broadly contains the records of over 40 organizations and more than 100 individuals, including the Social Science Research Council, Asia Society, the Ford Foundation, Trilateral Commission, Russell Sage Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Rockefeller University, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Henry Luce Foundation. Rockefeller family records contain material dating back to 1857, and include letters, records of Nelson Rockefeller's governorship of New York, photographs of Rockefeller properties, and more. The archives collection includes documents, personal records and correspondence, films, photographs, audio, and video. In 2018, collections included 55,000 cubic feet of records, approximately 1 million photographs, 25,000 audiovisual items, 18,000 microfilm reels, and 45 terabytes of digital data. A large portion of these audiovisual materials have been digitized. Collections are cataloged and available for research; over 400 researchers from around the world visit the archives each year, archives staff respond to approximately 2000 email reference requests, and the Center manages a grant program which funds researchers to visit for on-site research. Only the expurgated records of deceased family members are publicly available to scholars and researchers; all records pertaining to living members are closed to historians. However, as Nelson Rockefeller's researcher, Cary Reich, discovered, in the case of Nelson's voluminous of papers, only about one-third of these files had been processed and released to researchers up to 1996. He reports that it will be many years before all the papers will be open to the public, despite Nelson's having died in 1979.Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) papers on Nelson not released - see Cary Reich, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds to Conquer 1908-1958, New York: Doubleday, 1996.(pp.774-5) (Note: Reich died before completing the second volume of his life.) In addition to working with a wealth of archival records in print format, archivists at the Rockefeller Archives Center work to promote the preservation of digital records of non-profit organizations, and work directly with foundations to help them care for their own records ‚Äì including digital records ‚Äì which can eventually be transferred to the Rockefeller Archives Center for safekeeping. The effort has been developed as Project Electron, and it includes a repository for digital records and their metadata, as well as an API that helps other organizations share records with the repository. Created in partnership with Marist College, Project Electron is an open source system designed to help non-profit organizations keep abreast of digital record management and archiving. Major subject areas represented in the collection include: * Agriculture * The Arts * African-American history * Education * International Relations * Economic Development * Labor * Medicine * Philanthropy * Politics * Population * Religion * Social Sciences * Social Welfare * Women's history  Educational programming  The Center provides educational programming for local schools which supports students and teachers in doing research projects on various aspects of American history by giving access to primary source material from the Rockefeller Archives Center collections. Students are given the opportunity to create projects with the help of staff and archivists, to visit the Archives, and to present final research projects in a public forum.Matthew Lyons MLS (2002) K-12 Instruction and Digital Access to Archival Materials, Journal of Archival Organization, 1:1, 19-34, DOI: 10.1300/J201v01n01_03 pg. 32 References  External links  * Rockefeller Archives Center website * Category:Rockefeller Foundation Category:Archives in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States Category:Foundations based in the United States Category:Philanthropic organizations based in the United States ","title":"Rockefeller Archive Center"},{"id":"39388486","text":"RS-232 / Current loop converter For serial communications, a current loop is a communication interface that uses current instead of voltage for signaling. Current loops can be used over moderately long distances (tens of kilometres), and can be interfaced with optically isolated links. There are a variety of such systems, but one based on a 20 mA current level was used by the Teletype Model 33 and was particularly common on minicomputers and early microcomputer which used these as computer terminals. As a result, most computer terminals also supported this standard into the 1980s. History Long before the RS-232 standard, current loops were used to send digital data in serial form for teleprinters. More than two teleprinters could be connected on a single circuit allowing a simple form of networking.E. A. Parr, Industrial Control Handbook, Industrial Press Inc., 1998, , page 648 Older teleprinters used a 60 mA current loop. Later machines, such as the Teletype Model 33, operated on a lower 20 mA current level and most early minicomputers featured a 20 mA current loop interface, with an RS-232 port generally available as a more expensive option. The original IBM PC serial port card had provisions for a 20 mA current loop. http://www.bb-elec.com/Learning-Center/All-White- Papers/Current-Loop/Current-Loop-Application-Note/curentlp.pdf Current Loop Application Note, retrieved July 11, 2017 Signaling conventions A digital current loop uses the absence of current for high (space or break), and the presence of current in the loop for low (mark). This is done to ensure that on normal conditions there is always current flowing and in the event of a line being cut the flow stops indefinitely, immediately raising the alarm of the event usually as the heavy noise of the teleprinter not being synchronized, something that would not have been possible if the idle state had been no current flowing. Electrical characteristics The maximum resistance for a current loop is limited by the available voltage. Current loop interfaces usually use voltages much higher than those found on an RS-232 interface, and cannot be interconnected with voltage-type inputs without some form of level translator circuit. For full-duplex communication between two devices, two pairs of wires would be used. There is no common standard for current loop interfaces, so details such as timing, connectors, wire color codes, and so on, are all application specific.

Found on wood, it is actually parasitic on the fungus Phaeolus schweinitzii. It has a convex yellow- to rusty brown cap, yellow to yellow-brown pores and stipe, and a brown spore print. Its edibility is unknown. Taxonomy and naming Originally described by Franz Joseph Kallenbach in 1929 as Boletus lignicola, it was given its current name by mycologist Albert Pil√°t in 1969. He first placed it in the genus Pulveroboletus before erecting the new genus Buchwaldoboletus on account of its occurrence on wood (rather than in the ground), decurrent and arcuate pores, the yellow mycelium at the base of the stipe, the blueing flesh and lack of hyphal clamps. Other genera in which the species has been placed include Xerocomus by Rolf Singer in 1942, Gyrodon by Paul Heinemann in 1951, and Phlebopus by Meinhard Moser in 1955. The species name comes from the Latin words lignum \\"wood\\" and the verb c«ílƒõre \\"to inhabit\\". Buchwaldoboletus lignicola is a member of the genus Buchwaldoboletus, which with the genus Chalciporus form group of fungi that is an early offshoot in the family Boletaceae. Many members appear to be parasitic. Description The cap is convex, becoming more broadly so in age, and measures in diameter. The cap margin has a band of sterile tissue that is rolled inwards when young. The cap surface is initially finely velvety but often develops fines cracks in maturity. Its color is rusty brown to yellow brown. Easily peeled off the mushroom, the skin is separated from the yellow flesh by a thin gelatinous layer, and can in fact be moved back and forth across the cap. The flesh may stain blue where it has been cut or otherwise injured, although this reaction is slow to develop, or may not occur at all. The pores are small and angular, measuring 1‚Äì3 per millimeter, while the tubes are 3‚Äì12 mm long. The pore surface is yellowish to brownish yellow in maturity, and stains bluish-green with injury. The stipe measures long by thick, and is roughly the same width throughout its length, or narrower at the base. There is a yellow mycelium at the stipe base. The smell is mild and sweet, but has occasionally been described as foul in old specimens. The edibility of B. lignicola is not known with certainty. The mushroom produces an olive-brown spore print. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure 6‚Äì10 by 3‚Äì4 ¬µm. Distribution, habitat and ecology Buchwaldoboletus lignicola has been recorded across Europe from the far northern subarctic regions south to Switzerland, and North America from Ontario and Quebec south to Pennsylvania. It is considered endangered in the Czech Republic. It is only found where the fungus Phaeolus schweinitzii grows, and microscopic tests have revealed it is parasitic on that species. The two are found with coniferous trees such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), eastern white pine (P. strobus) and European larch (Larix decidua), and less commonly deciduous trees such as wild cherry (Prunus avium).

(also known as Sex Psycho and The Demon in Miss Jones) is a 1970 pornographic horror film written and directed by Walt Davis and starring Alex Elliot, Walt Davis, Charles Lish, Rick Cassidy, John Holmes, Andy Bellamy, Susan Wescott, and Sandy Dempsey.  Plot  Eva Blue gets high on marijuana in her living room, and falls asleep on the couch. A woman named Elise is then shown in bed with her husband, Nick, who she tries to talk into having sex with her. Nick ignores his wife's advances (not for the first time) and berates her appearance, housekeeping, and cooking before heading to a business appointment, mentioning on his way out that they have been invited to dinner at Eva Blue's house. Elise calls her lover over, and Nick buys a meat cleaver at a hardware store. At the Blue residence, Eva's husband Jerry is having sex with his brother in-law, Marshall. After Marshall ejaculates, Nick and Eva enter the room, and Nick hacks Jerry in the throat with the cleaver, splattering blood on Eva's face. Eva sends Marshall out to get the coffin they intend to put her husband's body in, and makes a reluctant Nick have sex on the bed containing Jerry's mutilated remains, which Eva at one point fellates while riding Nick. Marshall returns with the casket, and after Jerry's corpse is placed in it, Nick forces Eva and Marshall to have sex with him on top of it. As the trio moves the coffin, two of Eva and Jerry's swinger friends drop by unexpectedly, and insist on group sex. After the orgy, Marshall and the couple leave, and Elise (who Nick and Eva intend to kill) arrives for dinner. Eva spins a lie about getting a call from her ill mother, and pretends to leave while Nick convinces Elise to have sex in one of the bedrooms. While Elise is in the middle of performing oral sex on Nick, Eva and Marshall sneak into the room, and as they are about kill Elise with the cleaver, Elise spots them, and bites off Nick's penis in shock. As Elise chokes to death on Nick's severed genitalia, Eva and Marshall go into hysterics, and run away screaming. Eva is then shown waking up on her couch, implying the events of the film were just a drug-fueled dream she had. As Eva goes to prepare dinner, the meat cleaver is shown lying on the floor.

WB was put out very limited on VHS as Sex Psycho by Something Weird Video once again because of the deranged subject of the film SWV was threatened with shipping pornographic material over state lines, and again the film was pulled in 1995. A decade later, the company reissued the film on DVD-R, under the name The Demon in Miss Jones. In 2014, a remastered cut version of the film, this time under its original name Widow Blue!, was released on standard DVD by Vinegar Syndrome, in a triple feature with Evil Come, Evil Go and Oh! You Beautiful Doll.  Reception  Widow Blue! was praised by Fred Adelman of Critical Condition, who wrote \\"Davis (who appears as Jerry) liked to give his audience some shock value along with the hardcore sex, but theatergoers at the time were not prepared for it. He was way ahead of his time. All of Davis's films should be re-evaluated today. He should have a cult following\\". Paul Freitag- Fey of Daily Grindhouse stated Widow Blue! \\"spirals into a blend of perversion that would make even the most hardcore genre fan blush\\" and \\"It's all ridiculous, and it would have been unwatchable if it weren't for Davis's sense of humor, resulting in a movie that seems to have been made with a John Waters-like sense of awareness as to how to deliberately revolt the audience\\". Widow Blue! was described as \\"a completely insane hardcore gore film\\" by Nathaniel Thompson of Mondo Digital, who said that while the film was nowhere near good \\"anyone who wants to jump way in the deep end of crazed '70s cinema will really meet their match here\\". In a review for Rock! Shock! Pop!, Ian Jane said that it had a good cast, and that the fast-paced and quirky film's content, bad music, cheap gore, and lack of production values made it \\"a trash film of the highest order\\".

Technical details Polygonally turned parts may have several points, teeth, or other forms at the ends or along their circumference. The technique requires synchronisation of the movement of the polygonal turning mill and the part being machined. Polygonal turning allows rapid production and clean machining of advanced geometries. The polygon turning unit has a multitude of inserts, and is synchronized so that when an insert cuts the turning bar stock, it cuts the bar at the same radial position each time the workpiece rotates. This enables geometries such as hexes, squares and flats to be machined at faster speeds than by milling.

A nonzero sequence y(n) is called hypergeometric if the ratio of two consecutive terms is rational, i.e. y (n+1) /y(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}(n). The Petkov≈°ek algorithm uses as key concept that this rational function has a specific representation, namely the Gosper-Petkov≈°ek normal form. Let r(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[n] be a nonzero rational function. Then there exist monic polynomials a, b, c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} [n] and 0 eq z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K} such that r(n) = z \\\\frac{a(n)}{b(n)} \\\\frac{c(n+1)}{c(n)} and #\\\\gcd (a(n), b(n+k)) = 1 for every nonnegative integer k \\\\in \\\\N, #\\\\gcd (a(n), c(n))=1 and #\\\\gcd ( b(n), c(n+1))=1. This representation of r(n) is called Gosper- Petkov≈°ek normal form. These polynomials can be computed explicitly. This construction of the representation is an essential part of Gosper's algorithm. Petkov≈°ek added the conditions 2. and 3. of this representation which makes this normal form unique.  Algorithm  Using the Gosper-Petkov≈°ek representation one can transform the original recurrence equation into a recurrence equation for a polynomial sequence c(n). The other polynomials a(n),b(n) can be taken as the monic factors of the first coefficient polynomial p_0 (n) resp. the last coefficient polynomial shifted p_r(n-r+1). Then z has to fulfill a certain algebraic equation. Taking all the possible finitely many triples (a(n), b(n), z) and computing the corresponding polynomial solution of the transformed recurrence equation c(n) gives a hypergeometric solution if one exists. In the following pseudocode the degree of a polynomial p(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[n] is denoted by \\\\deg (p (n)) and the coefficient of n^d is denoted by \\\\text{coeff} ( p(n), n^d ). algorithm petkovsek is input: Linear recurrence equation \\\\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \\\\, y (n+k) = 0, p_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[n], p_0, p_r eq 0. output: A hypergeometric solution y if there are any hypergeometric solutions. for each monic divisor a(n) of p_0(n) do for each monic divisor b(n) of p_r(n-r+1) do for each k=0,\\\\dots,r do \\\\tilde{p}_k (n)= p_k (n) \\\\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} a(n+j) \\\\prod_{i=k}^{r-1} b(n+i) d = \\\\max_{k=0,\\\\dots,r} \\\\deg (\\\\tilde{p}_k (n)) for each root z of \\\\sum_{k=0}^r \\\\text{coeff} (\\\\tilde{p}_k (n), n^d ) z^k do Find non-zero polynomial solution c(n) of \\\\sum_{k=0}^r z^k \\\\,\\\\tilde{p}_k(n) \\\\, c(n+k)=0 if such a non-zero solution c(n) exists then r(n)=z \\\\, a(n)/b(n) \\\\, c(n+1)/c(n) return a non-zero solution y (n) of y (n+1) = r(n) \\\\, y (n) If one does not end if a solution is found it is possible to combine all hypergeometric solutions to get a general hypergeometric solution of the recurrence equation, i.e. a generating set for the kernel of the recurrence equation in the linear span of hypergeometric sequences. Petkov≈°ek also showed how the inhomogeneous problem can be solved. He considered the case where the right-hand side of the recurrence equation is a sum of hypergeometric sequences. After grouping together certain hypergeometric sequences of the right-hand side, for each of those groups a certain recurrence equation is solved for a rational solution. These rational solutions can be combined to get a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation. Together with the general solution of the homogeneous problem this gives the general solution of the inhomogeneous problem.  Examples   Signed permutation matrices  The number of signed permutation matrices of size n \\\\times n can be described by the sequence y(n) which is determined by the recurrence equation4 (n+1)^2 \\\\, y(n) + 2 \\\\, y(n+1) + (-1) \\\\, y(n+2) = 0over \\\\Q. Taking a(n) = n+1,b(n)=1 as monic divisors of p_0 (n) = 4(n+1)^2, p_2(n) = -1 respectively, one gets z = \\\\pm 2. For z=2 the corresponding recurrence equation which is solved in Petkov≈°ek's algorithm is4(n+1)^2 \\\\, c(n) + 4(n+1)\\\\, c(n+1) - 4(n+1)(n+2) \\\\, c(n+2) = 0.This recurrence equation has the polynomial solution c(n) = c_0 for an arbitrary c_0 \\\\in \\\\Q. Hence r(n)=2 (n+1) and y(n) = 2^n \\\\, n! is a hypergeometric solution. In fact it is (up to a constant) the only hypergeometric solution and describes the number of signed permutation matrices.  Irrationality of \\\\zeta(3)  Given the sum : a(n)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n{\\\\binom{n}{k}^2\\\\binom{n+k}{k}^2}, coming from Ap√©ry's proof of the irrationality of \\\\zeta(3), Zeilberger's algorithm computes the linear recurrence : (n+2)^3 \\\\, a(n+2)-(17n^2+51n+39)(2n+3) \\\\, a(n+1)+(n+1)^3 \\\\, a(n)=0. Given this recurrence, the algorithm does not return any hypergeometric solution, which proves that a(n) does not simplify to a hypergeometric term.

Hansen, discoverer of M. leprae in 1873 The history of leprosy was traced by geneticists in 2005 through its origins and worldwide distribution using comparative genomics. They determined that leprosy originated in East Africa or the Near East and traveled with humans along their migration routes, including those of trade in goods and slaves. The four strains of M. leprae are based in specific geographic regions. Strain 1 occurs predominantly in East Africa, Asia, and the Pacific region; strain 2 in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal/North India, and New Caledonia; strain 3 in Europe, North Africa, and the Americas; and strain 4 in West Africa and the Caribbean. They created a map of the dissemination of leprosy in the world. This confirmed the spread of the disease along the migration, colonisation, and slave trade routes taken from East Africa to India, West Africa to the New World, and from Africa into Europe and vice versa. In 1873 G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway discovered the causative agent of leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae. This was the first bacterium to be identified as causing disease in humans. From the 19th century, European nations adopted some practices of India and China, administering naturally occurring oils. They were given by injection and orally, and were believed to cure some people, but results were often disputed. It was not until the 1940s that the first effective treatment, promin, became available.Guy Henry Faget The search for additional anti-leprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. Multidrug therapy (MDT) combining all three drugs was first recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations in 1981. These three anti-leprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens. Etymology The word leprosy comes from ancient Greek ŒõŒ≠œÄœÅŒ± [l√©prƒÅ], \\"a disease that makes the skin scaly\\", in turn, a nominal derivation of the verb ŒõŒ≠œÄœâ [l√©p≈ç], \\"to peel, scale off\\". ŒõŒ≠œÄŒøœÇ (Lepos) in ancient Greek means peel, or scale; so from ŒõŒ≠œÄŒøœÇ derives ŒõŒµœÄŒµœÅœåœÇ (ŒõŒµœÄŒµœÅœåœÇ, \\"who has peels‚Äîscales\\") and then ŒõŒµœÄœÅœåœÇ (\\"leprous\\").Greek Dictionary Tegopoulos-Fytrakis, Athens, 1999 The word came into the English language via Latin and old French. The first attested English use is in the Ancrene Wisse, a 13th-century manual for nuns (\\"Moyseses hond..bisemde o √æe spitel uuel & √æuhte lepruse.\\" The Middle English Dictionary, s.v., \\"leprous\\"). A roughly contemporaneous use is attested in the Anglo-Norman Dialogues of Saint Gregory, \\"Esmondez i sont li lieprous\\" (Anglo-Norman Dictionary, s.v., \\"leprus\\"). Throughout history, individuals with leprosy have been known as lepers. In the 21st century, this term is falling into disuse as a result of the diminishing number of leprosy patients. Because of the stigma to patients, some prefer not to use the word 'leprosy', preferring 'Hansen's disease'. The term 'leprosy' is still used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.\\"What Is Leprosy?\\", THE MEDICAL NEWS from News-Medical.Net, Web. 20 Nov. 2010 Historical accounts Historians have made persistent claims that symptoms of leprosy are described among skin afflictions in ancient Greek, Middle Eastern and Indian documentary sources. Scholars acknowledge that it is difficult to make retrospective diagnoses of leprosy from symptoms described in ancient writings, but believe that Hippocrates discussed leprosy in 460 BC. Documentary evidence also indicates that it was recognized in the civilizations of ancient China, Egypt, Israel, and India. Leprosy was also described in Ancient Rome by the authors Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BC - 37 AD) and Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD). Many English translations of the Bible translate tzaraath as \\"leprosy,\\" a confusion that derives from the use of the koine cognate \\"ŒõŒ≠œÄœÅŒ±\\" (which can mean any disease causing scaly skin) in the Septuagint. While the condition may sometimes be a symptom of the disease described in this article, it has many other causes as well. In addition, ancient sources such as the Talmud (Sifra 63) make clear that tzaraath refers to various types of lesions or stains associated with ritual impurity and occurring on cloth, leather, or houses as well as skin. The Feng zhen shi Â∞ÅË®∫Âºè (Models for sealing and investigating), written between 266 and 246 BC in the State of Qin during the Warring States period (403-221 BC), is the earliest known Chinese text which describes the symptoms of leprosy, termed under the generic word li Áôò (for skin disorders). This text mentioned the destruction of the nasal septum in those suffering from leprosy an observation that would not be made outside of China until the writings of Avicenna in the 11th century; according to Katrina McLeod and Robin Yates it also stated lepers suffered from \\"swelling of the eyebrows, loss of hair, absorption of nasal cartilage, affliction of knees and elbows, difficult and hoarse respiration, as well as anaesthesia.\\" In 1846, Francis Adams compiled The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta, which included a commentary on all medical and surgical knowledge and descriptions and remedies from the Romans, Greeks, and Arabs. Descriptions of what is believed to be leprosy are included.Francis Adams, The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta: Translated from the Greek with Commentary Embracing a Complete View of the Knowledge Possessed by the Greeks, Romans and Arabians on All Subjects Connected with Medicine and Surgery, 3 vols.

Retrieved 2010-01-31. Skin infections causing symptoms similar to leprosy were likely common in the ancient world. In particular, tinea capitis (fungal scalp infection) and related infections on other body parts caused by the dermatophyte fungus Trichophyton violaceum are abundant in the late 20th century throughout North Africa and the Middle East. They may also have been common in biblical times. Likewise, the disfiguring skin disease favus is caused by Trichophyton schoenleinii, which appears to have been common throughout Africa and Eurasia before the advent of modern medicine. As late as the 17th century in Europe, persons with severe favus and similar fungal diseases (and potentially also with severe psoriasis and other diseases not caused by microorganisms) tended to be classified as having leprosy. The painting The Regents of the Leper Hospital in Haarlem 1667 by Jan de Bray (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem, the Netherlands) shows a young Dutchman with a vivid scalp infection. It may have been caused by a fungus, but he is being cared for by three officials of a charitable home intended for leprosy sufferers. The use of the word \\"leprosy\\" before the mid-19th century, when microscopic examination of skin for medical diagnosis was first developed, can seldom be correlated reliably with leprosy as it is understood today. Genetic analysis DNA analysis has been applied to the origins and history of leprosy. Geneticists in 2005 used comparative genomics to study these aspects, including the paths of how the disease was spread throughout the world. They determined that leprosy originated in East Africa or the Near East and traveled with humans along their migration routes, including those of trade in goods and slaves. The four strains of M. leprae are based in specific geographic regions. Strain 1 occurs predominately in East Africa, Asia, and the Pacific region; strain 2 in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal/north India, and New Caledonia; strain 3 in North Africa, Europe, and the Americas; and strain 4 in West Africa and the Caribbean islands. The researchers created a map showing the dissemination of leprosy by these strains. The disease clearly accompanied humans along their migration, colonisation, and slave trade routes taken since ancient times. Some peoples traveled from East Africa to India, millions were taken in the slave trade from West Africa to the New World, and others traveled from Africa into Europe and vice versa. In 2009 skeletal remains from the second millennium B.C. were discovered at Balathal, in Rajasthan, northwest India. Study and analysis of these remains were documented as the oldest skeletal evidence for leprosy. The scholars who studied these remains suggest that, if the disease did migrate from Africa to India during the third millennium B.C., \\"at a time when there was substantial interaction among the Indus Civilization, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, there needs to be additional skeletal and molecular evidence of leprosy in India and Africa so as to confirm the African origin of the disease.\\" Evidence for the disease was later confirmed in the human skeletal remains from the archaeological site of Harappa, in Pakistan. The disease was thus present in the urban centers of the Indus civilization before 2000 B.C., further supporting the hypothesis it migrated here as part of the Third Millennium B.C. Interaction Sphere, an exchange network the spanned the Arabian Sea. Discovery of bacterium After the end of the 17th century, Norway, Iceland, and England were the countries in Western Europe where leprosy was a significant problem. Norway appointed a medical superintendent for leprosy in 1854 and established a national register for people with leprosy in 1856. This was the first national patient register in the world. Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, was discovered by G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it the first bacterium to be identified as causing disease in humans. Hansen observed a number of nonrefractile small rods in unstained tissue sections. The rods were not soluble in potassium lye, and they were acid- and alcohol-fast. In 1879, he stained these organisms with Ziehl's method and noted the similarities with Koch's bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). There were three significant differences between these organisms: (1) the rods in the leprosy lesions were extremely numerous, (2) they formed characteristic intracellular collections (globii), and (3) the rods had a variety of shapes with branching and swelling. These differences suggested that leprosy was caused by an organism related to but distinct from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Hansen worked at St. J√∏rgens Hospital in Bergen, founded early in the fifteenth century. St. J√∏rgens is now preserved as a museum related to the history and research of leprosy, Lepramuseet. Hansen's finding was opposed principally by his father- in-law, Daniel Cornelius Danielssen, who considered it a hereditary disease. He had described it as such in his book, Trait√© de la Spedalskhed ou Elephantiasis des Grecs‚Äîthe standard reference book on leprosy from 1848 until the death of Danielssen in 1895. While Danielssen's book was a highly used source and provided a solid foundation for worldwide leprosy understanding, it was soon surpassed. In 1867 Dr. Gavin Milroy finished the Royal College of Physicians' Report on leprosy. His work, which compiled data from all corners of the British Empire, agreed with Danielssen that leprosy was a hereditary disease. In addition, he said that leprosy was also a constitutional disease that could be mitigated by improvements to a patient's health, diet, and living conditions.Edmond, Rod. Leprosy and Empire: A Medical and Cultural History (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006). Historical treatments The disease was known in Ancient Greece as elephantiasis (elephantiasis graecorum). At various times blood was considered to be a treatment either as a beverage or as a bath; sometimes the blood of children or virgins was required, suggesting associations of ritual purity. Europeans associated this practice with the Ancient Egyptians, but it appears to have been developed independently in China. This practice was used until at least 1790, when the use of dog blood was mentioned in De Secretis Naturae. Paracelsus recommended the use of lamb's blood, and blood from dead bodies was sometimes used. Snakes were also used, according to Pliny, Aretaeus of Cappadocia, and Theodorus. Gaucher recommended treatment with cobra venom. Boinet, in 1913, tried increasing doses of bee stings (up to 4000). Scorpions and frogs were used occasionally instead of snakes. The excreta of Anabas (the climbing fish) was also tried. A bishop instructing clerics suffering from leprosy from Omne Bonum by 14th-century clerk James le Palmer (British Library, MS Royal 6 E VI, vol. 2, fol. 301ra). Medieval depictions of leprosy commonly showed the patient to have red spots. Alternative treatments included scarification with or without the addition of irritants including arsenic and hellebore. Castration was also practiced in the Middle Ages. A common pre- modern treatment of leprosy was chaulmoogra oil. The oil has long been used in India as an Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of leprosy and various skin conditions. It has also been used in China and Burma. It was introduced to the West by Frederic John Mouat, a professor at Bengal Medical College. He tried the oil as an oral and topical agent in two cases of leprosy and reported significant improvements in an 1854 paper.Indian Annals of Medical Science This paper caused some confusion. Mouat indicated that the oil was the product of a tree Chaulmoogra odorata, which had been described in 1815 by William Roxburgh, a surgeon and naturalist, while he was cataloging the plants in the East India Company‚Äôs botanical garden in Calcutta. This tree is also known as Gynocardia odorata. For the rest of the 19th century, this tree was thought to be the source of the oil. In 1901, Sir David Prain identified the chaulmoogra seeds of the Calcutta bazaar and of the Paris and London apothecaries as coming from Taraktogenos kurzii, which is found in Burma and Northeast India. The oil mentioned in the Ayurvedic texts was determined to be from the tree Hydnocarpus wightiana, known as Tuvakara in Sanskrit and chaulmugra in Hindi and Persian. The first parenteral administration was given by the Egyptian doctor Tortoulis Bey, personal physician to the Sultan Hussein Kamel of Egypt. He had been using subcutaneous injections of creosote for tuberculosis. In 1894 he administered subcutaneous injection of chaulmoogra oil to a 36-year- old Egyptian Copt who had been unable to tolerate oral treatment. After 6 years and 584 injections, the patient was declared cured. An early scientific analysis of the oil was carried out by Frederick B. Power in London in 1904. He and his colleagues isolated a new unsaturated fatty acid from the seeds, which they named 'chaulmoogric acid'. They also investigated two closely related species: Hydnocarpus wightiana and Hydnocarpus anthelmintica. By comparing material from the trees, they isolated both chaulmoogric acid and a closely related compound, 'hydnocarpus acid'. They also investigated Gynocardia odorata and found that it produced neither of these acids. Later investigation showed that 'taraktogenos' (Hydnocarpus kurzii) also produced chaulmoogric acid. Administration of the oil was difficult. Taken orally it is extremely nauseating. Given by enema may cause peri-anal ulcers and fissures. Given by injection the drug caused fever and other local reactions. Despite these difficulties, a series of 170 patients were studied in 1916 by Ralph Hopkins, the attending physician at the Louisiana Leper Home in Carville, Louisiana. He divided the patients into two groups - 'incipient' and 'advanced'. He reported that in the advanced cases, 25% (at most) showed any improvement or arrest of their condition; in the incipient cases, 45% showed an improvement or stabilization of the disease (mortality rates were 4% and 8%, respectively). The remainder absconded from the Home, apparently in improved condition. Given the apparent usefulness of this agent, a search began for improved formulations. Victor Heiser the Chief Quarantine Officer and Director of Health for Manila, and Elidoro Mercado the house physician at the San Lazaro Hospital for lepers in Manila, decided to add camphor to a prescription of chaulmoogra and resorcin, which was typically given orally. This was at the suggestion of Merck and Company in Germany to whom Heiser had written. They found that patients could tolerate this new compound without the nausea that had accompanied the earlier preparations. Heiser and Mercado in 1913 administered the oil by injection to two patients, with the result that they were cured of the disease. Since the doctors had been using the oil in conjunction with other materials, the results were not clear. Two additional patients were treated by injections of oil alone and appeared to be cured of the disease. The following year, Heiser reported on an additional 12 patients, but the results were mixed. Researchers worked to develop less toxic injectable forms of this oil. Merck of Darmstadt had already produced a version of the sodium salts in 1891. They named this sodium gynocardate in the mistaken belief that the origin of the oil was Gynocardia odorata. Bayer in 1908 marketed a commercial version of the esters under the name 'Antileprol'. At the University of Hawaii, the young chemist Alice Ball developed a chemical process that made the oil less hydrophobic and therefore more readily absorbed by the body. Sadly she died before she could see the results of her work: after being treated with the modified oil, 78 patients were able to return home from leper colonies in 1920. Despite the common side effects and continuing debates about its efficacy, chaulmoogra oil remained the best available treatment for leprosy into the 1940s. To ensure a supply of this agent, Joseph Rock, Professor of Systematic Botany at the College of Hawaii, traveled to Burma to procure seeds of the trees. The local villagers located a grove of trees in seed, which he used to establish a plantation of 2,980 trees on the island of Oahu, Hawaii between 1921 and 1922. There continued to be numerous leprosy patients in the islands. Asylums Medieval leper bell Contrary to popular opinion, people were not universally isolated in leprosy asylums in the Middle Ages. In Europe, asylums offered shelter to all manner of people, including some who would have had skin complaints that included leprosy. The expansion of asylums in England between 1100 and 1250 was not necessarily in response to a major epidemic of leprosy.Carole Rawcliffe, Leprosy in Medieval England (Woodbridge, UK: Boydell P, 2006)(346) Additionally, leprosy did not disappear in Europe after the medieval period as a result of a \\"great confinement\\" of leprosy-affected people in leprosy asylums. In Portugal, for example, there were 466 cases in 1898. By 1938 there were sufficient numbers to warrant the construction of Rovisco Pais, to treat people affected by the disease.Sir Leonard Rogers and Ernest Muir, 3rd ed., Leprosy (Bristol: Wright and Sons, 1946), p. 22 This was not only to treat those returning from the New World, but also for rural dwellers infected within Portugal, as the records of Rovisco Pais show. Spain also had cases enough to engage public attention. In 1902, Jesuits Father Carlos Ferris and Joaquin Ballister founded the Patronato San Francisco de Borja, Fontilles. In 1904, there were still 552 cases treated there and more than 1,000 in total estimated in Spain.Rogers and Muir (1946), Leprosy, p. 21 This documentation affirms the genetic tracking carried out by Monot et al. (2005) that traces exchanges along the trade and slave routes from Africa, to Spain and Portugal, to the West Indies, and back again to Spain and Portugal. At the same time, there was an autochthonous strain that had persisted from an earlier period. Numerous leprosaria, or leper hospitals, were founded in the Middle Ages; Matthew Paris, a Benedictine monk, estimated that in the early thirteenth century, there were 19,000 across Europe. The first recorded leper colony was in Harbledown, England. While leprosaria were common throughout Europe in the early, middle, and late Middle Ages, how leprosy was dealt with in the Middle Ages is still viewed through the \\"distorting lens\\" of \\"nineteenth century attempts by physicians, polemicist, and missionaries\\" who tried to use \\"the past for evidence to support their own campaigns for mandatory segregation.\\"Rawcliffe, 5 The leprosy asylum or leprosarium of the past had many designations and variations in structure and degree of restriction. In the medieval period, it also offered basic support to many indigent people, amongst whom some would have suffered from leprosy. In England, these houses were run along monastic lines and required those admitted to take vows of poverty, obedience and chastity.Rawcliffe,7 Those flouting the rules could be expelled. Within the Christian framework, the disease was associated with symbolic significance. Withdrawal from everyday life was considered symbolic of ritually separating themselves from the world of the flesh, as a redemptive action, on behalf of the whole of society.Brody, Saul Nathaniel. The Disease of the Soul: Leprosy in Medieval Literature (Ithaca: Cornell Press, 1974). The Order of Saint Lazarus was a hospitaller and military order of monks that began as a leper hospital outside Jerusalem in the twelfth century. It remained associated with leprosy throughout its history. The first monks in this order were leper knights, and they originally had leper grand masters, although these aspects of the order changed over the centuries. From this order was derived the name lazar house. Radegund was noted for washing the feet of lepers. Orderic Vitalis writes of a monk, Ralf, who was so overcome by the plight of lepers that he prayed to catch leprosy himself (which he eventually did). The leper would carry a clapper and bell to warn of his approach. This was as much to attract attention for charity as to warn people that a diseased person was near. The leprosaria of the Middle Ages had multiple benefits: they provided treatment and safe living quarters for people with leprosy who were granted admission; they eased tension amongst the healthy townspeople; and they provided for a more stable populace for the authorities to govern.Leung, Angela Ki Che. Leprosy in China: A History (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009). Modern treatments MDT patient packs and blisters Promin was synthesised in 1940 by Feldman of Parke-Davis and company. Although Parke-Davis synthesised the compound, it seems certain that they were not the first. In the same year that Gelmo described sulphanilamide (1908), Emil Fromm, professor of chemistry in the medical faculty of the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, in Germany, described another compound related to the sulphonamides: this was diaminodiphenylsulphone or dapsone (DDS). No one recognised the potential of this compound until Buttle and his colleagues at the Wellcome laboratories and Fourneau and the researchers at the Institut Pasteur simultaneously found in 1937 that dapsone was ten times as potent against streptococcal infection in mice and about a hundred times as toxic as sulphanilamide. Until the introduction of treatment with promin in the 1940s, there was no effective treatment for leprosy. The efficacy of promin was first discovered by Guy Henry Faget and his co-workers in 1943 at Carville, Louisiana. Robert Cochrane was the first to use DDS, the active component of promin, at the Lady Willingdon Leprosy Settlement, in Chingleput, near Madras, India. John Lowe was the first to successfully administer DDS orally at Uzuakoli Leper Settlement, in Nigeria, in spite of indications that the drug was highly toxic. Both innovations made it possible to produce a treatment that was cheap, seemingly effective, and could be distributed on a large scale. Scientists eventually realised that DDS was only weakly bactericidal against M. leprae, and it was considered necessary for patients to take the drug indefinitely. When dapsone was used alone, the M. leprae population quickly evolved antibiotic resistance. By the 1960s, the world's only known anti- leprosy drug became ineffective against resistant bacteria. The search for more effective anti-leprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. The first trials of combined treatment were carried out in Malta in the 1970s. Multidrug therapy (MDT) combining all three drugs was first recommended by a WHO Expert Committee in 1981. These three anti-leprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens. None of them is used alone because of the risk of developing resistance. As this treatment was quite expensive, it was not quickly adopted in most countries where the disease is endemic. In 1985, leprosy was still considered a public health problem in 122 countries. The 44th World Health Assembly (WHA), held in Geneva in 1991, passed a resolution to eliminate leprosy as a public-health problem by the year 2000 ‚Äî defined as reducing the global prevalence of the disease to less than 1 case per 10,000. At the Assembly, the World Health Organization (WHO) was given the mandate to develop an elimination strategy by its member states. This was based on increasing the geographical coverage of MDT and patients‚Äô accessibility to the treatment. Novartis produces this medication for free. Overview of some nations India The Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine says that leprosy, as well as cures for it, were described in the Hindu religious book Atharva- veda.Lock et al; p. 420 Writing in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2008, Kearns and Nash state that the first mention of leprosy is in the Indian medical treatise Sushruta Samhita (6th century BC).Kearns & Nash (2008) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Paleopathology (1998) holds that: \\"The Sushruta Samhita from India describes the condition quite well and even offers therapeutic suggestions as early as about 600 BC\\"Aufderheide, A.

The surgeon Sushruta lived in the Indian city of Kashi by the 6th century BC,Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007) and the medical treatise Sushruta Samhita attributed to him was documented during the 1st millennium BC. The earliest surviving excavated written material that contains the works of Sushruta is the Bower Manuscript‚Äîdated to the 4th century AD, almost a millennium after the original work.Kutumbian, P. (2005) Ancient Indian Medicine. Orient Longman ; pp. XXXII-XXXIII Despite these earlier works, Europeans believed that the first widely considered accurate description of the disease was that of Galen of Pergamum in 150 AD. In 2009, a 4,000-year-old skeleton was uncovered in India that was found to contain traces of leprosy. The discovery was made at a site called Balathal, which is today part of Rajasthan. This is believed to be the oldest known physical case of the disease. This pre-dated by 1500 years the previous earliest recognized case, dating to 6th-century Egypt. It is believed that the excavated skeleton belonged to a male, who was in his late 30s and belonged to the Ahar Chalcolithic culture. Archaeologists have said that this is the first such example that dates to prehistoric India. This finding supports the evidence of the disease spreading to India by human migration routes from its origin in Africa. In 1874, the Missions to Lepers began to offer support to leprosy asylums that offered shelter to people affected by leprosy in India. Gradually, they instituted a policy of segregating males and females in the institutions. The asylum superintendents believe that this separation was beneficial in order to avoid infecting the children of diseased parents and to prevent further births. At this time, there were still debates about the transmission of the disease. The Leprosy Mission were heartened to find that the separated children did not develop the disease.Tony Gould, A Disease Apart: Leprosy in the Modern World. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2005). Print. In 1881, around 120,000 leprosy patients were documented in India. The central government passed the Lepers Act of 1898, which provided legal provision for forcible confinement of leprosy sufferers in India, but the Act was not enforced.Leprosy ‚Äî Medical History of British India , National Library of ScotlandJane Buckingham,Leprosy in Colonial South India: Medicine and Confinement(Palgrave, Macmillan, 2001) China Regarding ancient China, Katrina C. D. McLeod and Robin D. S. Yates identify the State of Qin's Feng zhen shi Â∞ÅË®∫Âºè (Models for sealing and investigating), dated 266-246 BC, as offering the earliest-known unambiguous description of the symptoms of low- resistance leprosy, even though it was termed under li Áôò, a general Chinese word for skin disorder. Angela Leung's Leprosy in China: A History (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009) is the authoritative source on leprosy in China. This 3rd-century BC Chinese text on bamboo slip, found in an excavation of 1975 at Shuihudi, Yunmeng, Hubei province, described not only the destruction of the \\"pillar of the nose\\" but also the \\"swelling of the eyebrows, loss of hair, absorption of nasal cartilage, affliction of knees and elbows, difficult and hoarse respiration, as well as anesthesia.\\" Indonesia In the 21st century, the rate of prevalence across Indonesia is slightly under one new case per 10,000 people, with approximately 20,000 new cases detected each year.\\"Self-Care: Leprosy-related disabilities,\\" in Invisible People: Poverty and Empowerment in Indonesia, Irfan Kortschak, 2010 But, the rate is considerably higher in certain regions, particularly South Sulawesi (with more than three new cases per 10,000 people) and North Maluku (with more than five new cases per ten thousand people). MDT is provided free of charge to patients who require it in Indonesia. Several hospitals in major population centers are specifically intended to deal with the medical needs of those affected by the disease. While the early detection and treatment of leprosy has improved over the years, approximately ten percent of patients in Indonesia have already suffered significant nerve or other damage prior to the identification and treatment of their disease. This is because of lack of awareness as well as the pervasive stigma that discourages those with the disease from seeking treatment. PERMATA (Perhimpunan Mandiri Kusta) Indonesia was established in 2007 to fight the stigma associated with leprosy and eliminate discrimination against those suffering from the disease. The organization was founded by a small group of individuals who had all been treated for leprosy. The founders worked to establish links with key figures amongst those suffering from the disease in communities in South Sulawesi, East Java and NTT, the three provinces where the rate of incidence of the disease is amongst the highest in Indonesia. Iran The Persian polymath Avicenna (c. 980‚Äì1037) was the first outside of China to describe the destruction of the nasal septum in those suffering from leprosy. Japan In a document written in 833, leprosy was described as \\"caused by a parasite that eats five organs of the body. The eyebrows and eyelashes come off, and the nose is deformed. The disease brings hoarseness, and necessitates amputations of the fingers and toes. Do not sleep with the patients, as the disease is transmittable to those nearby.\\" This was the first document concerning believed infectious aspect of the disease. Japan passed leprosy prevention laws in 1907, 1931, and 1953 that were based on segregation of persons with the disease; this approach intensified leprosy stigma. Lepers were seen as being incurable and infectious. Males admitted to leprosaria in Japan were sterilized, and females found to be pregnant were forced to have abortions. These extreme actions were done to prevent children of diseased parents from being born lest they carry the disease. Doctors during this time still mistakenly believed that leprosy was a hereditary disease. The 1953 law was abrogated in 1996. More than a decade later, in 2008 there were 2717 ex- patients in 13 national sanatoria and two private hospitals.

Creek Town was part of the Old Calabar region in the Bight of Biafra.Nair 1977, p. 242. Old Calabar was a series of towns up the Cross River, which is in the Southeast edge of present- day Nigeria. Honesty is an example of African agency in the Atlantic Slave Trade because he was a strong, savvy, and intelligent leader who worked with the Europeans instead of against them, which brought about changes that would forever affect the region. Early life Although his exact date of birth is unknown, Eyo was cited to have been born in 1788 by an epitaph located on a tower of the Creek Town Presbyterian Church. As a child, Eyo served as a cabin boy to English traders in the Triangle Trade network.Nair 1977, p. 246. It was during this time that he learned to speak and write the English language. He also learned the ways of the slave trade and how to do business which would benefit him as a ruler later on in life. After his father lost the throne, his family fell upon hard times and Eyo found himself in the employment of his father's rival, the Great Duke Ephraim, after his father died in 1820. Working for the duke in Duke Town, another town in the Calabar region, allowed him to improve his English and trade skills while establishing himself.Nair 1977, p. 247. Coming to power Honesty's father, Eyo Nsa (Eyo I), ruled Creek Town before him but there was a break between them caused by legitimacy claims to the throne. This ultimately resulted in Eyo I being removed from power as the Great Duke Ephraim made claims over the entire Calabar region. Eyo, while serving in Duke Town, began to contact distant family in an effort to get them to come back to Creek Town and re-establish a lineage.Nair 1977, p. 248. In 1834, the Eyo II house was formed and the Great Duke Ephraim died allowing Eyo to be crowned in 1835 or 1837, the date is uncertain. His rule of the region would be marked with political agency through cooperation instead of confrontation with the Europeans. European interaction Honesty welcomed the Europeans with open arms instead of fighting them with everything he had, like some rulers in the area did and had done. He saw them as educated, learned men who could help him establish a stronger political hold in the region through economic power. Eyo had experience with white traders from the travels of his youth and he continued his connections through the slave trade network that had been in place for decades before him. He had dealt in slaves from both selling and buying as he was trying to employ enough men to run his aspiring palm oil industry. His relationships with these \\"super-cargoes\\", huge trading outfits of the Triangular Trade Network, were well fostered and even gained him the name \\"Honesty\\" for his fair trade policies and willingness to work with the European traders.Nair 1977, p. 256. However, in 1842 a Commander Raymond issued Eyo Honesty II and King Eyamba V, another ruler in the region, papers that negotiated the end of the slave trade.Nair 1977, p. 250. On 4 December 1842, Honesty returned the signed Anti-Slave Trade Treaty to Raymond but took the opportunity to expand the economic market of Creek Town. To compensate for the loss of slave trade Eyo invited the Europeans into his lands to set up industries that would diversify the economy. Such industries to come would be cotton, coffee, sugar cane, and an immense increase in palm oil which had existed alongside of the slave trade.Nair 1977, p. 251. Religion With the invitation extended to the Europeans, missionaries were some of the first to come. These people coming to do \\"God's work\\" would influence the politics of the region more than any of the economic changes in the region. In 1846 the first missionaries arrived in Creek Town, these missionaries were the precursors to the Presbyterian Church, previously mentioned, that sports Eyo's epitaph. Upon their arrival Eyo was cited saying, \\"Now I am sure God will love and bless me, for I am very glad you come with this book.\\"Hackett 1989, p.60. Although Honesty's kingdom was Efik, a pagan religion, Eyo still appreciated and respected the missionaries and their Christianity. His respect for the missionaries ultimately resulted in law changes over his domain.Hackett 1989, p.64. Such reforms include: the elimination of human sacrifice, the allowance of widows and twins to return to Creek Town, the elimination of \\"Ekpenyong\\" the household idol of the region, and the ending of Sunday markets. In addition to altering laws, Eyo also translated the church services put on by the missionaries, mainly Rev. Waddell.Hackett 1989, p.61. Eyo maintained his agency by collaborating with the Europeans who encountered his kingdom and left a reputation that is best stated in Religion in Calabar by Rosalind I.J. Hackett, \\"The Efik, epitomized by King Eyo Honesty, showed the capacity to adapt internally, to 'modernize' without becoming 'westernized' or 'Christianized'\\".Hackett 1989, p.71.

GOLD was one of 11 proposals selected, of the 42 submitted, for further study in September 2011. On 12 April 2013, NASA announced that GOLD, along with the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON), had been selected for flight in 2017. GOLD, along with its commercial host satellite SES-14, launched on 25 January 2018.  Mission concept and history  GOLD is intended to perform a two-year mission imaging Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere from geostationary orbit. GOLD is a two- channel far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging spectrograph built by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder and flown as a hosted payload on the commercial communications satellite SES-14. Additional organizations participating in the GOLD mission include the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Virginia Tech, the University of California Berkeley, the University of Central Florida, Computational Physics Inc., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Boston University, and Clemson University. In June 2017, SES announced the successful integration of GOLD with the SES-14 satellite under construction at Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, France. GOLD was launched on 25 January 2018 at 22:20 UTC aboard Ariane 5 flight VA241 from the Guiana Space Centre.  Scientific Objectives  The scientific objectives of the GOLD mission are to determine how geomagnetic storms alter the temperature and composition of Earth's atmosphere, to analyze the global-scale response of the thermosphere to solar extreme-ultraviolet variability, to investigate the significance of atmospheric waves and tides propagating from below the temperature structure of the thermosphere and to resolve how the structure of the equatorial ionosphere influences the formation and evolution of equatorial plasma density irregularities. The viewpoint provided by GOLD geostationary orbit ‚Äì from which the same hemisphere is always observable ‚Äì is a new perspective on the Earth's upper atmosphere. This viewpoint allows local time, universal time and longitudinal variations of the thermosphere and ionosphere's response to the various forcing mechanisms to be uniquely determined.

It is a privately held company, headquartered in Sierre, Switzerland and founded in 2001. The company was founded to oversee production of cookware with the coating after it was awarded a gold medal at the International Inventor‚Äôs Fair in Geneva in 1999. In addition to a variety of different cookware models, the brand features knives, blenders and a selection of silicone tools. History HORT Coating Center In 1974, HORT Coating Center SA was founded in Sierre, Switzerland as a research company that explored nonstick materials and coating surfaces. HORT used wet-spraying and powder-spraying processes to coat a wide range of products, including machinery parts for airplanes, coffee makers, and Swiss watches. Prior to 1999, HORT Coating Center used a titanium-reinforced Polytetrafluoroethylene nonstick coating. In the early 1990s, the HORT Coating Center began testing methods for improving the coating, the main criteria being better hardness and thermal conductivity. These criteria led to diamonds, in the form of tiny particles. Diamonds are the hardest natural substance, and HORT discovered that their low coefficient of friction added to their utility as reinforcement for Polytetrafluoroethylene nonstick coatings. The Swiss Diamond \\"SD\\" coating was released after two years of preliminary testing to determine the most cost-effective formulation and application process. Swiss Diamond International In 1999, HORT Coating Center received the gold medal at the International Inventor‚Äôs Fair in Geneva, for the diamond-reinforced nonstick coating. Soon after, it was revealed that the coating could be used on not only machinery parts but also on nonstick cookware, which started to appear in the marketplace in the 1950s. In 2001, HORT Coating Center became the manufacturing center for Swiss Diamond International, dedicated to the production of nonstick cookware. Nonstick Coatings HD Coating As part of their research and development efforts, Swiss Diamond International developed a new formula for the coating in the early 2000s. The new coating is high-density, abbreviated \\"HD\\". By exchanging twenty per cent of the formula's components, the engineers were able to improve the coating's performance in industry-standard abrasion tests. The coating was improved by more than thirty percent in both nonstick release performance and longevity over time. The coating formula was patented by HORT Coating Center, and is used exclusively on Swiss Diamond cookware. In 2002, Swiss Diamond International released a line of induction cookware with the diamond reinforced coating. XD Coating Swiss Diamond also sells a proprietary XD coating as an alternative to their HD coating. The XD coating is more durable and has better food release properties.

Engraving depicting the Dutch massacre of sodomites. Published in Amsterdam, 1731. The Utrecht sodomy trials (Dutch: Utrechtse sodomieprocessen) were a large-scale persecution of homosexuals that took place in the Dutch Republic, starting in the city of Utrecht in 1730. Over the following year, the persecution of \\"sodomites\\" spread to the rest of the nation, leading to some 250 to 300 trials, often ending in a death sentence. History As of 1730, the Dutch Republic had just experienced an epizootic disease in its cattle population, while its dikes were threatened by shipworm. Several disasters had hit the country: the flooding of Stavoren in 1657, the collapse of the Utrecht Dom Church's nave in 1674 due to an intense storm now thought to have been a bow echo and the earthquake of 1692 were all ascribed to divine wrath. These circumstances had readied the minds of the Dutch for moral panics, and the homosexual part of the population became their scapegoat. The ruins of the Dom Church's nave had for years been a meeting place for homosexuals when in April 1730, the city authorities started an investigation at the request of the Dom's sacristan, Josua Wils. A number of men, including a Zacharias Wilsma, were arrested and interrogated. Their confessions indicated the presence of networks and meeting places of homosexuals elsewhere in the Republic. In July of the same year, Holland followed suit and a nationwide wave of prosecutions ensued; several men in high positions were suspected, but fled before they could be arrested. In Utrecht, some forty men were tried, of whom 18 were convicted and strangled. Death by strangling was the most common punishment for homosexual acts in the Dutch Republic, but other punishments during the 1730‚Äì31 purge included hanging and drowning in a barrel of water. The convicts' remains were either burnt, cast into the sea or buried under the gallows. Protestant preachers supported the purge, using among other things the aforementioned shipworm in the Dutch dikes as evidence of God's wrath against homosexuals. Of the trials outside of Utrecht, those in the village of Zuidhorn acquired particular infamy. Grietman Rudolf de Mepsche of Faan used the occasion to persecute his political enemies. He had a total of 22 people sentenced to death and executed, after two more had died at the rack. Overall, though, most accusations appear to have been true, the victims of prosecution having mostly been actual homosexuals, leading Rictor Norton to comment that \\"this is properly described as a pogrom (...) rather than a hysterical witch- hunt\\". Earlier and later persecutions Several waves of prosecution followed during the eighteenth century: in 1764 (Amsterdam), 1776 (several cities), and 1797 (Utrecht and The Hague). As noted in the case of Joost Schouten, it was preceded by other episodes of persecution and execution, such as that which occurred in Dutch colonial possessions like Batavia, capital of the seventeenth century Dutch East Indies Peter Murrell: \\"Sin and Sodomy in the Dutch East Indies\\" History Today: 63.6: (July 2013): 10-17 Sodomonument thumb The city of Utrecht has recently decided to confront this reputation for persecution. The Dom Square was once a place where, in the ruins of the middle nave of the church, gay cruising took place. Since 1999 it has hosted a stone, the so-called Sodomonument, commemorating the deaths of the persecuted sodomites, and telling that the terminology has changed to homosexuality, and the city wants its women and men to live their lives in freedom. Legacy As a result of the trials, the demonym Utrechtenaar gained a second meaning as a slang term to denote homosexuals (first attested in a dictionary of 1861), esp. among students. In common usage, though, it is still used as a demonym, alongside the alternative Utrechter, with the latter being the preferred term in newspapers, while Utrechtenaar is more common on the internet (as of 2004).

Life and career Early life Turner was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, to the late Allison and Evelyn (Peters) Turnbull. At the age of 19, he qualified for the All Canadian Track Team, and would continue to compete for Canada from 1950‚Äì1956, winning two Canadian long jump championships and representing Canada in the long jump at the 1954 British Empire Games in Vancouver. In 1952, at the age of 21, he moved to the U.S. and enrolled in the University of Dubuque, Iowa. He received a Bachelor of Arts and Science degree from the University of Dubuque in 1955. While recuperating from a serious sporting injury, Turner taught himself to play guitar‚Äîa skill that would soon change the course of his life. Though he enrolled in a post graduate program at Texas Tech University, Lubbock in 1956, he would not stay long. In 1956, Turner befriended Buddy Holly, a young Lubbock musician who would soon achieve worldwide success. Like Holly, Turner left his studies to pursue music in 1957. Turner and Holly ultimately wrote thirteen songs together. And, Holly was just the first of many up and coming singers that would be mentored by Turner over the course of his lifetime. Life in music In 1957, Scotty wrote his first songs for his good friend Hal Goodson, also from Texas Tech. Hal Goodson recorded two songs at Petty Studios in Clovis, NM ‚Äì \\"Who's Gonna Be The Next One Honey\\" and \\"Later Baby\\". These were the first songs that (Jerry) J.I. Allison recorded, several months before recording Peggy Sue with Buddy Holly. From 1957‚Äì1959, Turner was lead guitarist for Tommy Sands and his band The Raiders (a.k.a. The Sharks, which included pre-Wrecking Crew drummer Hal Blaine). From 1960‚Äì1961, Turner was lead guitarist and musical director for Guy Mitchell, and served in the same capacities for Eddie Fisher from 1961 to 1963. In 1963, Turner joined A&M; Records as a writer/producer. From there, he went on to be general manager of Central Songs publishing company in Hollywood, and eventually became executive producer of the country division of Liberty/Imperial Records in Hollywood. In 1968, Liberty Records was bought for $38 million by Transamerica Corporation (an insurance company) and combined with their other label United Artists Records. Following that merger, Turner was transferred to Nashville to take over the country division of the newly merged Liberty/Imperial/United Artists. After leaving the label, he served as an independent producer on several albums for Slim Whitman, garnering Turner four U.K Gold Records, and produced recording sessions for artists such as (in alphabetical order) Bobby Bare, Larry Butler, Jimmy Bryant, Vicki Carr, Johnny Carver, Jimmy Clanton, Roy Clark, Rosemary Clooney, Penny DeHaven, Glen Garrison, Waylon Jennings, Bobby Lewis, Willie Nelson, Harry Nilsson, Bill Phillips, Del Reeves, Ray Sanders, Mel Tillis, Cliffie Stone, and Jerry Wallace among others. Turner also worked in both film and television. He had a number of songs included in movies (see Compositions section below for more details), and his television credits include serving as music director for \\"Christmas on the General Jackson\\" (which led to the release in 1988 of a soundtrack album of traditional Christmas songs produced and arranged by Turner and Ron Bledsoe, and performed by Mel Tillis, Kathy Mattea, Lynn Anderson, Butch Baker, Donna Fargo, David Lynn Jones and The Cannons), \\"The Roger Miller Show\\" (Tanya Tucker, Lyle Lovett) and making appearances on \\"The Perry Como Show\\", \\"The Milton Berle Show\\", \\"The Mike Douglas Show\\", Oprah Winfrey's \\"A.M. Chicago\\", \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" and \\"A Current Affair\\".
