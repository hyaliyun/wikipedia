Cotacachi is located at an altitude of and had a population of 8,848 in 2010.\\"Cotacachi\\". https://www.citypopulation.de/php/ecuador.php?cityid=100350, accessed 8 Jun 2017. Cotacachi is an artisan city that is famous for its leather goods and handicrafts. Cotacachi residents are also well known for their carne colorada (filet of pork cooked in red achiote sauce), and queso de hoja (soft cheese wrapped in a plant leaf). The city of Cotacachi holds a UNESCO medal for being free of illiteracy. In 2000 the entire canton was declared the first ecological county of South America. Geography The city is located 8 km (5 miles) northwest of the artisan city of Otavalo, about 4.8 km (3 miles) west of the Panamerican Highway (Route 35). It lies in the valley between the volcanos of Imbabura and Cotacachi. There are two main entrances to the city, both stemming exit off the Panamerican Highway. The first entrance feeds directly into the city's main square, while the other turns into the famed Calle 10 de Agosto (locally known as Leather Street). Demography Cotacachi dancers Cotacachi and the surrounding communities boasts one of the highest concentrations of indigenous people in the country of Ecuador. Due to its location close to the metropolitan areas of Ibarra and Quito, as well as proximity to the coastal province of Esmeraldas, it is also home to great diversity. Many mestizo people (coming from Quito) and many Afro-Ecuadorians (coming from Esmeraldas) live in and around the city. In recent years, the demographic has shifted to include many foreign retirees. On a recent census, the number of resident foreigners totaled more than 500. Climate The climate is mild year-round. Situated in the inter-Andean valley temperatures are generally between 21 and 27 degrees C (70 and 80 degrees F) during the day, and between 10 and 16 degrees C (50 and 60 degrees F) at night. Leather Cotacachi is considered the \\"Leather Capital of Ecuador\\". With over 50 separate artisanal leather shops in the city, many of the leather goods sold in other parts of Ecuador are produced in Cotacachi. Inti Raymi An annual fiesta of San Juan, San Pedro, y San Pablo (also known as Inti Raymi, or the \\"Sun Festival\\" in Kichwa) in late June is celebrated in the city, with many different ceremonies and the main event, known as \\"taking of the plaza\\", during which the groups of dancers from different communities circle the biggest town square, site of the Municipality and the town Cathedral, several times. Children, men and women have different days assigned to perform the dance. Men's day sometimes degenerates into altercations between various indigenous communities in the area, and is often seen as once a year opportunity for \\"settling scores\\", while women's occasional fights are playful and not intended to harm. The indigenous communities, mestizo majority population and the group of expats co-exist uneventfully throughout the rest of the year. The ritual is a temporary enactment of social upheaval via the symbolic storming of the city, remembering ancient rivalries - so ancient, that in fact nobody can tell how exactly did they start. Distinctive black leather hats for the fiesta are worn by some male participants during the ceremonies and the parade. The San Juan hats have greatly exaggerated, stiff and circular flat brims that extend over the shoulders and crowns that are high, square, and pointed, bearing many types of symbols. Perhaps intentionally, the design also serves to protect wearers from the rocks. Sometimes intervention by police is required if the participants become too rowdy. In the last years the safety of the participants and onlookers greatly improved, due to the careful scheduling and monitoring of the arrival of dancers from different communities to town. Tourism Cotacachi is popular with tourists because of its proximity with Otavalo and also because of the second most famous crater lake in Ecuador, Cuicocha (Guinea Pig Lake). Located 10 minutes by taxi from Cotacachi, Cuicocha is popular with hikers and small boats ply the lake.

Life and work Ra√∫l Alberto Peralta was born in √Ålvarez, located in the Rosario Department of the Santa Fe Province, Argentina in 1937. He first sang on a local radio station in 1955 and was subsequently invited to perform on Radio Belgrano and Radio El Mundo in Buenos Aires. Enjoying early popular acclaim, he gained his first professional contact with Columbia Records in July 1957, by which he recorded with Tango orchestra leader H√©ctor Varela. Touring the country with fellow vocalist Rodolfo Lessica, he was, by then, known to his public as Ra√∫l Lavi√©. Recording for Phillips with orchestra leader H√©ctor Stamponi in 1959, the following year Radio Libertad launched the Ra√∫l Lavi√© Show, his first as a host. Introducing a succession of young musicians to listeners, in 1962 these contacts helped earn him a spot in a new, teen-oriented musical comedy series, El Club del Clan. Playing a self-confident social animal, Lavi√©'s vocal talents came through in his Spanish-language interpretation of Paul Anka standards, among others'. Days before the first episode, in September of that year, Lavi√© was granted an interview by news anchor Lidia Elsa Satragno. Recently separated from his first wife, Lavi√© courted the television host, who was already a household word in Argentina by her nickname, \\"Pinky.\\" The couple married in 1965 and had two sons.Ra√∫l Lavi√© Widely popular during its 1963 season, El Club del Clan was produced for the cinema in 1964. The show, however, quickly lost favor among its fickle teen audience and it was canceled later that year. Partial to the melancholy Tango, Lavi√© returned to the genre, recording with Osvaldo Fresedo and Horacio Salg√°n, among others. Lavi√© was soon cast in a number of theatre roles, debuting on the stage at the National Comedy Theatre in Gregorio de Laferr√®re's Locos de verano (Summer Madness). His performance earned him an invitation to Mexico City, where he was cast in the title role in a local production of Man of La Mancha in 1968. His 1964 film role also opened doors for Lavi√© in cinema and he starred in 17 films in subsequent years, notably Lautaro Mur√∫a's Un guapo del 900 (The Cad) in 1971 and Leopoldo Torre Nilsson's Boquitas pintadas (Painted faces) in 1974. His marriage with Pinky became strained, resulting in their separation in 1974, and he subsequently married his current wife, Laura Basualdo. Continuing to perform in the theatre, as well as a tango vocalist and film actor, he accepted the leading roles in Bob Fosse's Pippin and in Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba the Greek.Clar√≠n Todo Tango Touring internationally in 1985 with Claudio Segovia and H√©ctor Orezzoli's Tango Argentino, Lavi√©'s voice remained in great demand among Tango fans in Argentina and elsewhere. He joined Tango dancer Juan Carlos Copes and the cast of Manuel Gonz√°lez Gil's De Borges a Piazzolla on their international tour in 1997 and returned to Broadway with Tango Argentino in 1999. He returned as Don Quixote in a Buenos Aires revival of Man of La Mancha in 2005, for which he received the Golden Ace, a prestigious Argentine award in the world of theatre.

Despite showing promise in the early part of his career, he eventually achieved very little, although he did score in eight consecutive matches in 1931. Football career Early days Haddleton was born in Chester-le-Street in County Durham and worked in the coal-mines, playing football for various colliery sides in the north east including Easington Colliery Welfare and Horden Colliery Welfare. He was spotted by scouts from Southampton and moved to the south coast in October 1930. Southampton He made an immediate impression at The Dell, scoring eleven goals from seventeen games for the reserves. He made his first-team debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat in the Second Division at Bury on 18 April 1931. The following season, he replaced the injured Willie Haines after the first match of the season. He scored in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Manchester United on 2 September and then scored at least once in each of the next seven games. This run of nine goals in eight consecutive matches remains a club record. After scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 3 October, he then only scored once more in the next five games. He was initially replaced by Ted Drake, who had also made a name for himself in the reserves, and only made a further three appearances for the \\"Saints\\" first-team, spending the rest of the season back in the reserves. At the end of the season, he was one of three players (together with fellow forwards Bill Fraser and Bert Jepson) who were sold to Fulham as the Saints were in serious financial difficulties and needed to raise funds. In his brief career at Southampton, Haddleton made 17 first- team appearances, scoring ten goals. Later career At Fulham, Haddleton scored twice on his debut and added two more goals from three matches, but was unable to displace Frank Newton as a regular in the side. In the summer of 1933, he move to Swindon Town where he was moved to an inside forward role, with either Tommy Armstrong or Fred Fisher in the centre, but failed to score in seven matches. He moved again in July 1934, this time to the Midlands to join Walsall where he was played at outside right alongside prolific goal- scorer Gilbert Alsop. After 15 appearances in the Third Division North, in which he scored four goals, Haddleton fractured his leg and was eventually forced to retire. After football On abandoning his career as a professional footballer, Haddleton returned to Hampshire to live in Eastleigh where he was employed at the Pirelli General cable works, turning out for the works team.

The magazine is based in Concord, North Carolina. The monthly magazine ceased publication in 2008. As of April 2009, the website was still active. History Stock Car Racing was launched in May 1966. At the time, Jim Davis was publishing a drag racing magazine called Super Stock, so with the existing production staff, the printer, and the distribution network already in place, Jim Davis was planning to add a second magazine to his business. It was Dick Williford who suggested that Davis start a magazine on stock car racing, because no other magazine had devoted full coverage to stock cars. Jim Davis recalled, \\"Speed Sport News was about it.... Some of the general automotive magazines like Motor Trend would have occasional articles about stock car racing...\\". However, there was no magazine, at the time, devoted exclusively to stock car racing. So Jim Davis and business associate John \\"Monk\\" Reynolds, following the suggestion from Dick Williford, began Stock Car Racing in May 1966. The first issue, on the cover, showed a picture with defending NASCAR champion Ned Jarrett and another cover photo of racer Curtis Turner (1924‚Äì1970). The magazine had limited success in the first years. Jim Davis noted, \\"It was extremely difficult, because NASCAR didn't want anything to do with us. They didn't like the idea of outsiders coming in and, in their opinion, making a profit off of their shows.\\" Jim Davis met with NASCAR officials to arrange an agreement; he noted, \\"Monk and I called NASCAR and asked for a meeting so we could explain to them what we were going to do. They eventually had Monk and me down there [to Daytona], essentially to have a meeting about what we were doing.\\" Regardless, NASCAR was still not very receptive to the idea of a publication covering the sport, and Davis said that the press credentials were sometimes difficult to obtain because of that mindset. The magazine persevered, however, by the tactics of staffing the big NASCAR races with an on-site photographer and publishing the related stories as written by local newspaper writers. Davis and Reynolds began publishing the magazine in Alexandria, Virginia, and they eventually implored Dick Williford to come and help to keep the magazine in publication. Jim Davis, while covering drag racing with SuperStock, had become acquainted with Williford from seeing him at various drag racing events over the years. Williford was employed as a PR rep for Chrysler and had turned to drag racing (along with Richard Petty) when Chrysler pulled out of NASCAR in 1965. Williford, who had first suggested that David create a stock car publication, was vital in getting the early issues of Stock Car Racing to press. He did much of the writing and legwork necessary to publish the magazine. \\"There is no way the magazine would have gotten off the ground without him,\\" Jim Davis recalled. \\"He [Williford] set up all the contacts with the stringers we used at all the major NASCAR superspeedways. Monk and I didn't know any of those people and knew almost nothing about NASCAR racing.\\" Three years later, in 1969, Jim Davis sold his interest in both magazines, Stock Car Racing and Super Sport, to John Reynolds. Davis then started an advertising agency there in Alexandria, VA. By 1995, Davis had moved to Westchester, California, and co-founded Professional Products, working as the chief operating officer. In January 2012 Davis retired from Professional Products but retained an ownership position in the company. He launched an internet business called Performance Injection selling a line of performance auto parts. John Reynolds eventually sold both magazines to Lopez Publications. Since then, several other companies have owned Stock Car Racing, including Primedia.

The episode was written by Clyde Phillips and directed by Keith Gordon. In the episode, which takes place several months after the second-season finale, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) mistakenly kills an innocent man but forms a friendship with the man's brother, well-known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits). Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), meanwhile, has turned over a new leaf in her life and is determined to become a detective. To carry the remainder of the third season, Dexters writers introduced Miguel as a new character so that his relationship with Dexter could serve as a \\"central arc\\". In order to allow them to explore Dexter's psychological and emotional reactions, the writers revealed Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) to be pregnant. They also had Dexter kill an innocent person to develop the ongoing theme of rebellion despite initially rejecting the idea of Dexter killing \\"somebody who doesn't deserve it\\". Filming of the episode began in early June in Los Angeles, California at Sunset Gower Studios, though a small crew flew to Miami, Florida, where the show is set, to film short pieces of Dexter, which were integrated into \\"Our Father\\" and other episodes. The episode brought in 1.22 million viewers, an improvement from second season's premiere and finale, and attracted mixed reviews from critics. Plot Several months after the deaths of James Doakes and Lila Tournay, Dexter Morgan's life has returned to normal. He looks up a drug dealer, Fred \\"Freebo\\" Bowman (Mike Erwin), whom he believes to have killed two female college students. Pretending to want to buy heroin, Dexter visits Freebo's house, where he sees his girlfriend Teegan Campbell (Jelly Howie). He returns to the house at night and finds Freebo fighting with another man (Nick Hermz). When the man attacks Dexter, he stabs and kills him in self-defense. Dexter flees, shocked about breaking his father Harry's \\"code\\" and killing an innocent person. Dexter is called to the scene the following day and discovers that the man was Oscar Prado, the brother of prominent Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado. Miguel seeks an explanation and consolation from Dexter, and invites him to Oscar's wake. Dexter attends, leaving his sister Debra alone on their dead father's birthday. He begins to question Harry's code and whether his loyalty is necessary. At the Miami-Metro PD, Det. Angel Batista is promoted to a sergeant. Det. Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington), recently transferred to the department, is being investigated by Internal Affairs. Sgt. Yuki Amado (Liza Lapira) asks Debra repeatedly to keep an eye on Quinn, but Debra declines even when she discovers that \\"snitching\\" may earn her a detective's shield. Debra discovers from one of Quinn's informants, Anton Briggs (David Ramsey), that Oscar was a drug addict and in Freebo's debt. However, after Debra loudly divulges the information in Miguel's presence, Lt. Mar√≠a LaGuerta asks Batista to remove her from the case. Batista puts her on the case of a \\"Jane Doe\\" who Dexter recognizes as Teegan. Meanwhile, Dexter's girlfriend Rita craves chocolate pudding and, recalling the last instance of this, realizes that she is pregnant. Production Jimmy Smits joined the cast because Miguel was dissimilar to his previous roles Dexters writing staff began meeting in March 2008 to brainstorm ideas for the third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, \\"we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he has spent most of his adult life taking lives.\\" They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be \\"the central arc of the season\\", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, \\"They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods.\\" In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that \\"That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season.\\" Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were \\"protecting the character\\". He thought that it was \\"very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it\\". Phillips said that \\"We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake.\\" Production was scheduled to commence in late May, but was delayed until early June. A small crew flew to Miami with Hall and, according to producer Sara Colleton, filmed \\"a lot of pieces‚Äînot just Dexter walking in and out of his door or car, but also scenes that we know we'll need and can use\\", before returning to the show's permanent sets at Sunset Gower Studios in Los Angeles. Reception \\"Our Father\\" brought in 1.22 million viewers, a 20 percent improvement on both the second season's premiere and finale, and Showtime's highest-rated drama season premiere since 2004 when Nielsen Media Research began compiling their ratings for premium networks. In the United Kingdom, the episode was the ninth most-watched program in its timeslot with 194,000 viewers and an audience share of 1.2 percent, a significant decline from \\"It's Alive!\\", the second-season premiere. \\"Our Father\\" received mixed reviews from critics; some thought that it was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was \\"frustrated\\" by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, \\"I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to.\\" Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was \\"an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat\\" but that Smits as Miguel could improve \\"even [a] great [show] like Dexter\\". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, \\"Dexter has gone from an eight to a six\\" on a scale of one to ten, saying that the show \\"has lost its edge\\" with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was \\"not sure yet whether [the third season's changes are] good\\". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that \\"the series has settled into a state of complacency\\" and could not \\"escape the feeling I've seen this before\\". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that \\"the whiff of normalcy for Dexter\\" gives viewers \\"a magnificent tease\\" and likened the fast-moving plot to \\"the urgency of brilliance\\". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was \\"pleasantly surprised by Smits\\" and said that, thus far, \\"season three is a good one\\". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was \\"thrilled\\" to see Smits join the cast, said, \\"What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits.\\" Daniel Fienberg, writing for Zap2it, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was \\"as good as TV acting gets\\" and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, \\"the show's creative team appears to have done it again\\".

It resulted in the deaths of five marchers, including a woman. Early life Griffin was born to Johnny and Lizzie Griffin. He had a brother John and three sisters: Geraldine, Francis, and Janie. He grew up picking cotton and played with blacks as a child. He worked at a gas station as a \\"halfway mechanic\\". He joined the Ku Klux Klan when he was 18. While its influence had declined since the 1920s, individual chapters were sometimes active. Later he said that he had joined to prevent mixing of the races, particularly in marriage. Griffin claimed that the African-American customers he served at the gas station would ask for his services personally even though they knew of his KKK membership: \\"As much as I'm on TV, I'm sure everyone of them knew I was in the Klan. They knew what I was. And I knew they was in the N.A.A.C.P. What they do is their business.\\" Greensboro massacre His activities with the Klan brought Griffin notoriety. But his leadership of joint KKK and American Nazi Party members to confront a November 3, 1979 march in Greensboro by members of the Communist Workers Party gained him national coverage and notoriety. A violent confrontation erupted after Klansmen drove through the gathering activists, who responded by hitting the cars. The KKK and ANP members took rifles, shotguns, and handguns from their cars and started shooting, killing five marchers, four of whom were CWP members. A woman CWP member was among those killed. Four of the dead were white men; one was a black woman. On the morning of the shootings, Griffin's Klansmen and American Nazis, in a nine-vehicle caravan, veered from the destination and at 11:30 drove through a group of people gathering for the noon rally. The police were not yet in place to protect the marchers, who had a permit for the event. Griffin said he told his members to go without robes and guns, but many had rifles, shotguns and handguns in the trunks of their cars. \\"We had just planned to fly our American flags across the street to show them we love our country,\\" Griffin said. Witnesses agreed that the marchers began hitting the cars, but accounts differed widely as to the next events. The marchers contended that the Klansmen and the Nazis left their cars and opened fire with shotguns, rifles and pistols; video coverage confirmed this. Five marchers were killed and 10 injured. The Klansmen and Nazis contended that they reacted in self-defense to having their cars attacked. They said the marchers fired the first shot. Griffin said the shots that hit the demonstrators were not aimed at them. \\"Someone fired a shot -- and all hell broke loose,\\" Griffin said. \\"We had every right to be drive down that street with nobody touching the cars. I didn't come to shoot or kill nobody.\\" While Griffin said that the shootings were not planned, a police informant had advised the police that the group intended to have violent confrontation. Despite this, the police were not in place before the march. Klansmen claimed the fight broke out between the groups because Communists tried to pull a 79-year-old Klansman out of his car. In 1980, six Klansmen and Nazis, not including Griffin, were prosecuted by the state for first-degree murder and felony riot. They were acquitted by an all- white jury, which concluded they acted in self-defense. In 1984, after a three-month federal civil rights trial, Griffin was among nine Klan members acquitted in federal court, also by an all-white jury, on charges of violating the marchers' civil rights. In 2005, Griffin told a group studying the Greensboro massacre that he never would have gone to that rally had he not been goaded by the inflammatory rhetoric of the labor organizers. At a forum in 2005, Griffin was asked why no Klansmen were killed in the crossfire: \\"Maybe God guided the bullets.\\" KKK and other activity In 1965, Griffin and another man were convicted of posing as detectives investigating a racial incident at a school. In 1980, Griffin was charged in a cross burning in Lincoln County, North Carolina. In 1979, he was identified in The New York Times as Grand Dragon of the North Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He later founded the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He has most recently been identified as the imperial wizard of the Mount Holly-based Cleveland Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. For most of the last three decades, the Klan has lost both prominence and viciousness, according to the Anti-Defamation League and other anti-hate groups. But its opposition to illegal immigration has helped draw new sympathizers, and Griffin tried to be a leader in that effort. \\"Shoot one, and let them know we are sealing our borders,\\" Griffin said in an interview with WCNC.com of Charlotte, North Carolina. He and other Klan officials were in the midst of rebuilding, exploiting fears over illegal immigrants. \\"People are tired of this mess,\\" Griffin told The Charlotte Observer in 2007. \\"The illegal immigrants are taking this country over.\\" Personal life and death Griffin was married to Linda Griffin and they had six children: Linda, Shirley, John, James, Christine and Virgil Lee, Jr. Griffin resided in Mount Holly, North Carolina. By the late 1990s, Griffin had suffered two heart attacks, bypass surgery, and a ruptured disc in his neck. Griffin died on February 11, 2009 at the age of 64 in Gaston Memorial Hospital located in Gastonia, North Carolina. He had been ill for some time, but his obituary did not state his cause of death.

Temperatures of 95 F (35 ¬∞C) are not uncommon in summer, while winter temperatures have been known to drop to -70 F (-57 ¬∞C). Several hundred Alaska Natives and others live in the Yukon Flats area. Though most of the region's people are concentrated in the villages of Fort Yukon, Venetie, Beaver, Stevens Village, Chalkyitsik, and smaller settlements, numerous hunting cabins and seasonal settlements also dot the region. The region also potentially contains a large deposit of crude oil and natural gas. In 2008, a land trade was proposed between Doyon, Limited and the federal government. The exchange was to consolidate land holdings by the native corporation but was not completed.

Raja Man Singh, governor of the Mughal emperor Akbar, confiscated the Jagir of the refractory pathan jagirdar of Rajshahi named Lashker Khan and bestowed the Zamindary on the saintly Bhatsacharya for his learning, but he declined. However, his son Pitambar was granted the Lashkarpur estate permanently. On his death, his son Nilambar received the title of Raja from Emperor Jahangir.

Geography  Dhanuks are found in the Indian states of Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Dhanka people in Rajasthan claim that their name is a variant and they are the same community. However, the veracity of this claim is extremely difficult to ascertain due to the numerous other claims. Their claim sometimes seem contradictory to the Madheshi people who are found in Terai Nepal. The state has a community called Dhanuk or Dhanushk, whose traditional occupation was watchmen.  In India   Bihar  The Dhanuk of Bihar are deemed to be an Other Backward Class in India's reservation system. In the early phase of history this cast was said to be a warrior caste. They are frontliner warrior who used bow and arrow as their weapon. But the consequent defeat in a series of war forced them into slavery and forced them to be engaged in different kind of occupation. since they had not enough land they stared work as agricultural labourers. In the 19th century, Dhanuks were among the communities of the region whose landless members were employed as agricultural labourers. Such labourers were considered as slaves under the kamia system and were often referred to as Jotiyas. The Dhanuks had largely escaped the system towards the end of the century. Many of the former slave workers took up lowly positions in the industries and commerce of the developing towns, aided by improvements in transport, but were ultimately no better off either economically or socially.  Haryana  The Dhanak of Haryana, also known as Kabirpanthi Pandit, is a community of weavers. They have been granted Scheduled Caste status in the reservation system, and are found throughout the state.  Uttar Pradesh  In Uttar Pradesh, Dhanuks are given Scheduled Caste status and at the time of the 2011 Census of India, their population was 651,355 people. There is some ambiguity in the use of the term dhanuk in the state. As per some scholors this cast was largely associated with the scheduled tribe Bhil. However some scholars like Professor Susan Wadley has described the Dhanuk as a \\"midwife caste\\".

He was part of what has been referred to by some as the \\"first-family of magic\\". Carl's father Samuel, a practicing German physician, was the first to enjoy magic as a hobby. Samuel's first son Carl (Compars), was born in 1816 and left medical school at an early age to pursue a career as a magician. He was the first in the family to gain fame as a conjurer. By the age of thirty, Carl was recognized as one of Europe's most accomplished magician. Alexander Herrmann, who was 27 years younger than his brother Carl, also became a world-famous magician. Father's career as magician According to Herrmann legend, Alexander's father was a part-time magician and full-time physician. Samuel Herrmann was a favorite of the Sultan of Turkey, who sent for the magician often. The Sultan paid a princely sum for the entertainment. It was said that Samuel even performed for Napoleon Bonaparte. The story goes that he was receiving so much attention from the elite of Paris with his magic shows, that word spread to Napoleon himself. The self-crowned emperor wanted Samuel to perform for him. Napoleon reportedly gave Samuel a gold watch for his performance.Magician's Handbook: Tricks And Secrets Of The World's Greatest Magician Herrmann The Great by H. J. Burlingame.The Master Magicians by Walter B. Gibson (1966). Alexander carried the gold watch on the day of his death. It was passed on to his widow. Eventually his practice demanded more of his time, so he eventually quit magic entirely. With the birth of his oldest son Compars in 1816 in Hanover Germany,Illustrated History of Magic by Milbourne Christopher (1973). he decided to settle down to continue his practice. This is the myth. The reality is confusing. Some reports say that Samuel was never a professional magician, but a physician who only did magic as a hobby. Another report says that he was never a physician, but rather was a traveling magician who never quite achieved fame, as his son was soon to do.Magic: A Pictorial History of Conjurers in the Theater by David Price (1985). He played small towns around from 1817 in Germany and moved his family to France. He played institutes and lyceums of Paris and gave performances until 1855. He taught his skills to his oldest son Compars, also known as Carl. There is no record of him performing in well known theatres. But he did play the colleges in Paris and Versailles. Samuel entertained the pupils of the Grandes √©coles (founded by Lazare Carnot) near Versailles. With this performance, his son Carl was admitted to the school tuition free. Samuel continued in this way even after his son Carl became a famous magician. Samuel retired about 1860 and lived quietly with his wife Anna on a pension set up by Carl. Early years Carl, was slender, somewhat demonic in appearance. He wore an imperial beardNapoleon III and handlebar moustache to perpetuate or enhance the Mephistopheles look. As he got older the hair on is head got thin. Carl's humor was sly, and he presented his magic in a mysterious manner. He was from the old school of magic. The critics of his day said his performing ability was on par with the most talented actors, singers, and dancers of the 19th century. While attending classes at Grandes √©coles, he tried to fit in with his upper crust classmates at the prestigious school. He went to Fontainebleau (which was a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris) with his classmates. Fontainebleau was renowned for its large scenic forests which surrounded the city and dozens of villages. It was a favorite weekend getaway for Parisians, as well as for the reigning monarchs of the time. Young Carl played on the palace grounds with his friends as a cavalcade came up the road. They realized they were trespassing so they fled leaving poor Carl to take the fall. So Carl swiftly climbed a tree in the dense Forest of Fontainebleau. Even though he was hidden by the thick foliage, he began to trill bird calls. Two young princes of King Louis-Philippe of France, Antoine and Henri, heard the trills. They wanted to catch a glimpse of the birds. They parted the leaves and saw the grinning Carl perched inside. The citizen king and the ladies in the carriage were so amused, they invited him to entertain at the palace.cite Illustrated History of Magic by Milbourne Christopher 1973 Carl lived in Paris as a young man. His father, Samuel, urged him to study medicine. But Carl was more interested in performing.cite The Master Magicians by Walter B. Gibson 1966 He had early success as a magician, but tried to please his father by earning a living away from the stage. He was in his twenties when he was out of work and desperate for money. So turned to the only profession he knew and that was magic. Career Carl left school and joined a company of actors. From there he branched out on his own. He started off like all magicians today and that is with doing school shows. Then he progressed to private performances. From there, he got hired to perform at theatre exhibitions. He practiced ventriloquism as well as magic. His career was interrupted by his services with the French Army. When he left the army, he returned to France. While there, he was a constant visitor to the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin, starring its namesake, Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin. He was most impressed by the many new illusions presented by the former watchmaker turned magician. Illusions were new at the time and Carl thought it would nice to own such fine tricks. He finally earned enough to buy equipment for a three-hour production. He bought most of his illusions from Robert-Houdin's trusted assistant LeGrande. LeGrand made replicas of Houdin's equipment and sold them to French magician Robin, Scottish magician John Henry Anderson, and Carl. Herrmann set out to tour with his own show. The first stop for Carl was England. He took the pirated tricks to London and first appeared at the Adelphi Theatre. In 1848, Carl performed at the Haymarket Theatre in London where he billed himself as the Premier Prestidigitateur of France and the First Professor of Magic . In 1848, The Illustrated London News critiqued the 32-year-old magician's performance in April. \\"He was not only adept at tricks of his predecessors Phillipe and Doebler had shown, he also introduced several striking new mysteries of his own.\\" They praised tricks like the Inexhaustible Bottle , which produces endless quantities of different liquors in what seems to be an endless quantity; The Portfolio, items such as flowers, turtle doves, and a live boy would be produced from the empty portfolio; and the Second Sight, items are named from a blindfolded assistant. What the Illustrated London News did not know was that those marvels where created by Robert-Houdin in Paris. When he premiered in London later in the year at the St. James Theatre, Robert-Houdin was not happy with his friend presenting duplicates of his tricks. Also, he was annoyed by Carl's title. He felt he was the Premier Prestidigitateur of France. Herrmann was glad to let him have the title. But did keep The First Professor of Magic in the World. Two years later he took Robert-Houdin's pirated illusions and performed in Germany, Austria, and Italy. In Portugal, he was decorated by the king and became Chevalier Herrmann. It was during this tour he was developing his sleight of hand skill and adapting them to his program. After producing four goldfish bowls, he would walk into the audience and invited the spectators to inspect his arms and his long coattails. Those that assumed this was where they came from would not expect there could be more. Then from the same cloth, Carl produced a fifth bowl. Carl kidnaps little brother After Carl finished his tour of Europe, he returned to his parents‚Äô home in Paris in 1853. He was greeted by his fifteen brothers and sisters. He was most taken in with the youngest Alexander. Carl was thrilled to find out that the eight-year-old Alexander was already showing an interest in magic. So, without the family consent, Carl kidnapped the young man and took him to Saint Petersburg, Russia to teach him the art of magic. While there, he took his younger brother with him on a tour that started in Russia.cite Magician's Handbook: Tricks And Secrets Of The World's Greatest Magician Herrmann The Great by H.J. Burlingame He suspended his young brother before Czar Nicholas I. The then nine-year-old acted as a blindfolded medium in the Second Sight. Czar Nicholas gave Carl an engraved gold watch decorated with diamonds, pearls, and amethysts. Alexander remained with Carl until they arrived in Vienna. Samuel did not want Alexander to suffer the same fate as Carl. His father was ready to bring kidnap charges against him. Samuel's anger caused their mother to come there and insisted upon Alexander's return to Paris. They reached a compromise. Alexander would stay with Carl until the tour was over. Alexander continued his duties as assistant. Carl didn't just teach Alexander how to pop out of boxes, he served as a role model and inspiration for his younger brother. He was teaching him advance sleight of hand. Some that he had learned from their father. He also taught him new moves that Carl picked up on his own. He was thrilled that Alexander was an eager and willing student. Carl continued with this throughout their excursion through Europe. After touring places like Germany, Austria, Italy, and Portugal, the tour ended in Vienna. Carl liked it so much, he made Vienna his home. As promised, he sent Alexander back home to Paris. While there, Alexander showed what he had learned from Carl to their father. Samuel was impressed with Alexander's skill. He decided to let him continue in magic. Carl was to mentor his young brother. Alexander stayed in Paris until he was about 11 years old. Then he returned to Vienna to meet up with Carl. He promised Samuel to teach Alexander things other than magic. While in Vienna Alexander attended college. But, it was sleight of hand that was to be his main interest. Carl mentors Alexander Alexander went with Carl on nearly every tour. At first he returned to his role as assistant. This time though he did not float on a pole. Carl discarded those illusions from the last tour when Robert-Houdin discovered that LeGrand was responsible for selling replicas of the fruits of his creations. He had the mechanic arrested. It is not known whether Carl bought the illusions directly from LeGrand or from another source. What is known is that he discarded them in favor of tricks using pure sleight of hand. He found that the audiences enjoyed these tricks better. His new approach brought him triumphs in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. In January 1861 he was in Havana, Cuba. His admirers said, \\"You don't need a wand to work your imitable wonders. But,\\" they added, \\"We thought you merited the finest one ever made.\\" They presented him with a diamond sapphire gold wand. Engraved on the staff was his portrait along with an inscription. Carl added this to his ever growing collection. From Cuba, they sailed to New Orleans. There he gave his first twenty-four performances in the United States at the St. Charles Theatre. The only thing that stopped the run was the outbreak of the American Civil War. Carl and Alexander packed their bags quickly and caught the last train north. Without any bookings, they sought the prominent New York opera impresario B. Ullman. Ullman arranged for the Herrmann's to perform at the Academy of Music on 14th St. The impresario told reporters that Prof. Herrmann's magic, \\"‚Ä¶was as much acknowledged in Europe as Jenny Lind's was in music.\\" Carl was impressed with the progress of his brother Alexander's skills. He decided to have Alexander became a real part of Carl's show. By the time they arrived in the America in 1860, Alexander was seventeen. Audiences noticed his adroitness. His dexterity soon rivaled that of Carl. Jealously brewed on that tour, but never surfaced. They appeared at the Academy of Music which is generally known for their opera's, but when the two Herrmann's arrived, the music played second fiddle to the wonders the two wizards produced. The posters of the time mentioned that Herrmann's, \\"‚Ä¶ distinguishing feature is the entire absence of any apparatus, all effects being solely produced by extraordinary manual skill.\\" During the beginning of their show, Carl announces that his younger brother was his successor-to-be. Five weeks of full houses brought Carl receipts totaling thirty-five thousand dollars that would be about $700,000 in today's dollars). With the Civil War in full swing, the Herrmann's headed for Central and South America. A few years later, they parted company. Alexander appeared on his own until he met up with Carl in Vienna in 1867. They formed their second co- partnership and returned to the U.S. to resume their tour there. According to Walter B. Gibson's book The Magic Masters, \\"...and implanted the name Herrmann quite firmly there.\\" The Herrmann name eventually became synonymous with magic. Eventually the two magic brothers would go their separate ways. Carl tours Europe With the departure of Carl, Alexander began his own career in 1862. Carl returned to play to the capitals of Europe. Alexander brought his own show to London in 1871 and began his three-year stretch at Egyptian Hall that he called his one thousand and one nights. Carl retired during Alexander's three-year stint at Egyptian Hall. Meanwhile, the financial panic of 1873 wiped out Carl. On May 9, the Vienna Stock Exchange crashed. They no longer were able to bankroll the corrupt mismanagement of the Deutsche Bank. A series of Viennese bank failures resulted. This caused a deflation of the money available for business lending.Financial Panic of 1873 He needed money and the only way to pay his debts was to return to performing. The two magical brothers met again in 1885 in Paris. Carl was still miffed at Alexander from his triumph at Egyptian Hall. Carl was not about to retire until he regained his fortune. So, an agreement was made between the two brothers to split the world. Compars was to return to Europe and Alexander to the United States. The death of Prof. Herrmann Alexander leaves Paris to go back to America. He becomes an established institution. A few years later, While in New York, Alexander heard the news of the death of his brother Carl. Professor Herrmann died on June 8, 1887 in Karlsbad in Germany.Max Dif - Historie et √âvolution Technique de la Prestidigitation - Tome I, p. 271 Alexander was very shocked. Even with the rivalry between them, he could not help but feel that he owed everything to him. \\"We've always had a warm and brotherly feeling towards each other\\", he told a newspaper. After Carl's death in 1887, Alexander continued with the profession until his own death in 1896. The Herrmann name continued as Alexander's wife Adelaide became the first woman to win notable fame as a magician. Alexander's nephew Leon had accompanied Adelaide, adding another \\"Herrmann\\" name to the magical family tree. Leon died in 1909, at the age of 42.

The Salango community has deep ancestral roots that represent about 5,000 years of history and culture. Worldview Salango is a pre-Columbian settlement that is located at the southern end of a sandy cove on the south coast of the province of Manabi. Salango Island is located just off the coast. The worldview of the people has been developed through the different cultures that have existed here starting from the Valdivia culture, Machalilla, Engoroy-Chorrera, Bahia, Guangala and Mante√±os. Through the archaeological remains found, it is surmised that their ancestors‚Äô spirituality and understanding of the world around them was very large, but in particular, it was bound up with their environment as alive, of ocean and hilly forest, preserving and protecting it as well as transmitting their spiritual knowledge to new generations. The Pueblo Manta that consists of the comunas Salango, Las Tunas, El Pital and Agua Blanca keeps alive these spiritual, cultural and pre-Columbian symbols of their own ancient worldview, which are presented in their cultural celebrations. The worldview of the Pueblo Manta has always been connected to the shell spondylus, from the Valdivia culture until today. Salango. Salango Town. Comuna Salango Salango is located on the shores of the Pacific, in southern Manabi Province, in the buffer zone of the Machalilla National Park. The community seeks to consolidate its development process by promoting ecotourism. This would allow them to use their natural and cultural resources in a way related to the ancient heritage of their ancestors. Amongst the natural attractions is the island of Salango, home to beautiful species of seabirds such as blue-footed boobies, frigates, and pelicans among others. Nearby is a marine sanctuary, a site with schools of tropical fish and coral reefs, ideal for diving. In the heart of the community is the Research Center and Museum Salango CIMS. It protects and exhibits an archaeological collection of 245 pieces that represent more than 4500 years of cultural heritage before the conquest. The center operates laboratories and has collections of archaeological, fauna, fish, and mollusks for studies and investigations. Included in the center is the hacienda house. It is operated as a historic museum devoted to the last 100 years of Salango‚Äôs history. Salango Museum The museum grounds function as an educational center for deepening the understanding of the area‚Äôs cultural and marine resources. Programs are provided for children and adults of different educational levels. Geopolitics They are located on the southern coast of Ecuador, in the canton Puerto Lopez, Manabi province. The Salango community is located along the south of the Ecuadorian coast, in the canton of Puerto L√≥pez, Manab√≠ Province. It is composed of villages of Salango Rio Chico. Land - legalization Salango acquired legal status as a commune in the No. 074 Agreement, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock on October 30, 1979. After a process of analysis and discussion of its historical past and identification, it was recorded in the Development Council for Nationalities and Peoples of Ecuador CODENPE by Agreement 016 on 19 April 2004, as a community of ancestral roots. It has a communal territory of 2536 hectares. Its principal economic activity is fishing. The Community of Salango of the Canton Puerto Lopez, Manab√¨ Province, holds property rights to a territory of about 2,536 hectares. It is made up of the small towns of Salango and Rio Chico. These communities are descendants of the Pueblo Manta Huancavilca, with 5,000 years of history and culture. The first settlements belonged to the Valdivia culture, followed by Machalilla, Engoroy-Chorrera, Bahia, and Guangala. The last period before Spanish exploration has been called the Regional Integration Period Mante√±a (800-1530 AD). In 1526, Spanish explorers first encountered native sailors of Salango. At that time the powerful chiefdom known as Salangome was the nucleus of a \\"League of Merchants\\" that dominated the sea trade. (Historian Jacinto Jij√≥n y Caama√±o, who was one of the first to study the Manta, likened this group to the Hanseatic League of Europe.) They traded in a large variety of seafood and related products, including the Spondylus shell, or thorny oyster (actually a scallop). It was sacred to many pre-Hispanic cultures in South America. These shells were traded to inland communities, such as that of the Quitu in Ecuado, as well as to other indigenous peoples in a larger network reaching to present-day Chile, Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. During the colonial era, the Spanish colonists imposed Catholicism on the indigenous peoples. By a synod of 1535, they also abolished the use of the original languages of Ecuador's coastal communities and required the use of Spanish. Traces and words of native languages remain, such as colonche, vine, Tuzco, Sercapez, Valdivia, and Salango. Due to their natural advantages and resources, outside parties attempted to take over many communities, or to appropriate their resources. In 1937 the Ecuadorian government enacted the Law of Organization and Management of Communes, which was intended to protect and ensure the existence and functioning of rural peasant communities and place them under the protection and supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The creation of a comuna in an area included \\"every town that does not have the status of parish and was known as annexed, neighborhood, community, bear the name of community.\\" But the Act assumed that all rural communities were peasant communities, and did not account for the cultural and historical diversity of either towns and or their ancestral communities. Subsequent reforms have not changed this view. In the 21st century, indigenous communities have appealed to constitutional law and international norms to protect themselves. The Salango commune, aware of its historical and ancestral roots chose to separate the regime of the Communal rights and its former legal status. It exercised collective rights guaranteed in the Ecuadorian constitution and in Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO). It recorded its new status as the Community Salango under Agreement No. 016 on April 19, 2004 in the Consejo de Desarrollo de las Nacionalidades y Pueblos del Ecuador CODENPE. This agency is responsible for defining policies for the reconstruction, strengthening and development of the indigenous towns and communities in the country. In 2004 Salango developed its Comprehensive Plan for Community Development of Salango \\"PIDCOSA\\"; this was the basis for the Parish Development Plan. In addition, it has helped stimulate the projects \\"Ecotourism and Community Development of Handicraft\\" and \\"Production of Ecosystem Services\\". In 2001 the Salangome Ecological Association declared a section of ocean to the north of the island Salango as a marine sanctuary. It intends to develop it for conservation, especially conservation of those species that reside on the seafloor. The site will also serve as a venue for research and tourism in Salango. As part of PIDCOSA, the \\"Community Management Research Center and Museum Salango CIMS,\\" project was developed in the beginning of 2005. The community officially took over the management of CIMS. The National Institute of Cultural Heritage declared the archaeological collections, which include 245 museum pieces, as belonging to the cultural heritage of the Commune Salango. On March 31, 2011 the Ecuadorian Ministry of Tourism, issued the regulations for the Registration of Tourist Community Centers. By this traditional communities, which are legally organized and trained, can develop community tourism activities.

During the 1850s it was taken over by the Colonial Government, from then on numbers of the inmates expanded rapidly, as penal institutions started to close down across the colony and their invalids were sent up to the Hospital.http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/R/Royal%20Derwent%20Hosp.htm The hospital was closed in late 2000, as smaller community-sited care institutes proceeded rapidly, and the hospital could no longer be funded by the Tasmanian State Government. Today parts of the hospital site are currently sitting derelict and has been the subject of a great deal of vandalism and was badly damaged by separate arson attacks in January 2008 and December 2010 http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2010/12/14/193091_tasmania-news.html Further pieces of the site, which have been sold to private ownership, have been reopened as a tourist drawcard with a motel, two cafes, various boutique stores and two antique stores. On the 6th of September 2018, further arson attacks caused extensive damage to Ward G. The building is expected to be demolished.http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Travel-g504312-d1994837/New- Norfolk:Australia:Willow.Court.Asylum.html Haunting Willow Court has become notorious for supposed hauntings and ghost sightings since it shut down according to paranormal enthusiasts, so much so that in February 2011 the Derwent Valley Council agreed to a paranormal investigation. The action was criticised by the former mayor, several councilors, advocacy groups supporting previous residents, ex staff and inhabitants of New Norfolk because there were still people living who had been incarcerated in the hospital or had relatives there and it was considered to demonize previous residents and staff. There is no evidence of such haunting claims that have been verified by science, but this is keenly spoken about by believers of the paranormal.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-22/ghost-hunters-haunt-old- mental-asylum/1952878 Personnel * Dr Bruce Maitland Carruthers OBE (1892‚Äì1951), a former Director-General of Health in Tasmania was the administrator of the Lachlan Park Hospital 1935‚Äî1936.

The area is a major waterfowl breeding ground, and after a proposal to flood the Yukon Flats via a dam on the Yukon River was turned down, the Yukon Flats were deemed worthy of protection. On 1 December 1978, US President Jimmy Carter designated the Yukon Flats as a National Monument on the basis of the Antiquities Act of 1906. In the course of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of December 2, 1980, the area boundaries were changed after political criticism and the status was downgraded to that of a wildlife refuge. It is the third-largest National Wildlife Refuge in the United States, although it is less than one- half the size of either of the two largest, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.USFWS Annual Lands Report, 30 September 2007 The refuge is administered from offices in Fairbanks.

He is said to have been the paramount chief of all the T≈´ranganui-a-Kiwa tribes around 1525. His influence was large, it extended into the Ruakituri Valley and the Whakap≈´naki district as far as the Huiarau Range beyond Lake Waikaremoana. Whakapapa Whakapapa of RuapaniThe aristocratic lines of descent from Pawa and Kiwa of the Horouta waka converged upon Ruapani and his rule was undisputed.article in TE NUPEPA O TE TAIRAWHITI ‚Ä¢ SATURDAY, APRIL 7, 2007); this page (in Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand) also mentions ancestry from TƒÅkitimu waka and from Hine Hikirirangi His whakapapa is shown in two images: # the first image showing his descent from Pawa, the captain of the Horouta waka and Kiwa, priest of the Horouta, who is also known as the navigator.Gundry, Sheridan ‚Äì Historic journeys; East Coast Driving Tours. Publ. New Zealand Historic Places Trust, Gisborne Branch Committee, Gisborne 2000, p. 6 right #In the second image his estimated date of birth is shown. MackayMackay 1949, p. 3 gives a slightly different version of the history, resuming an address by Captain W. T. Pitt to the Rotary Club of Gisborne in 1934. When ‚Äúthe TƒÅkitimu waka called in at Nukutaurua (Mahia Peninsula), The captain (Kiwa) left the waka and, with a small party, set off overland for Turanga (Poverty Bay). There he met Pawa, Horouta's captain. To celebrate the occasion they agreed that Kahutuanui (Kiwa's son) should wed Hine-a-Kua (Pawa's daughter). The descendants of this illustrious couple married with the issue of Paikea (who was reputed to have journeyed to New Zealand on the back of a whale); with those of Maia (who was said to have crossed the seas on a gourd), and with the Toi people. When the seventh generation was reached, the head chief was Ruapani, in whom converged all the lines of Maori greatness.‚Äù Ruapani is also said to be descendant from Hine Hikirirangi, the sister of Pawa. She was the ancestor who nurtured the k≈´mara (sweet potato) she had brought from Hawaiki in her sacred basket.whakapapa with descendance from Hine Hikirirangi, in Te Ara Popoia Ruapani lived in his pƒÅ, Popoia, near Waituhi, some 20 km north west of T≈´ranga-nui-a-Kiwa (Now known as Gisborne). He had three wives; in order, Wairau, Uenukuk≈çihu and RongomaipƒÅpƒÅ. When Ruapani died, T≈´hourangi took RongomaipƒÅpƒÅ as his wife and founded the Tuhourangi iwi in Rotorua, which is also part of the Te Arawa confederation of tribes. Popoia is located north of Waituhi and is adjacent to Lavenham Road. The site is still visible today but is located on private farmland. Mitiri, ch. 10 writes extensively about Kahungunu, ‚Äúone of the most amazing characters in MƒÅori history‚Äù, who once visited a pƒÅ on Titirangi (now known as Kaiti Hill), where ‚ÄúKahungunu saw the smoke of the fires of a large settlement inland on the opposite side of the Waipaoa River. On asking who was living there, he was told that the pa was Popoia, owned by Ruapani, the principal chief of the whole district. So to Popoia our hero journeyed, and was so well thought of that Ruapani gave him his daughter Rua-rere-tai as wife. Kahungunu settled in the pa, and doubtless became a useful fellow. Time passed on until Rua-rere-tai was about to give birth to a child and she was desirous of something tasty with which to vary her diet. She asked her husband to procure some birds for her to eat in order to cause the milk to flow for his (as yet unborn) child. On reaching the forest he found a nest of a tieke in a hollow tree, from which he obtained some young birds. He took them to the village and cooked them, thus fulfilling his wife's desire. Not long after, the child, a girl, was born, and was named Rua-herehere-tieke, thus commemorating the finding of the young birds.‚Äù Legacy Ruapani‚Äôs legacy is evident in the whakapapa (genealogy) lines of all the tribes in the T≈´ranganui-a-Kiwa district. With the emergence of these tribes ‚Äî including, Te Aitanga-a-MƒÅhaki, Rongowhakaata and NgƒÅi TƒÅmanuhiri ‚Äî Ruapani‚Äôs influence began to wane and he retreated inland to the home of his relations in the Lake Waikaremoana area, where he lived out his days. Upon his death Ruapani was interred in a sacred cave called Kohurau at Whare K≈çrero in the Wainui Beach area. A number of hap≈´ today still identify themselves as NgƒÅti Ruapani, including those in the Whakap≈´naki area through to Lake Waikaremoana and the people of ≈åhako Marae in Manutuke. ‚ÄúRuapani had three wives and, in all, twenty-five children. Among those who could claim descent from him were Te Kani-a-Takirau, Heuheu, Te Rauparaha, Tomoana, Te Kooti, Wi Pere, Sir J. Carroll, Sir Maui Pomare, Sir A. T.

He was the first Dalit to be appointed vice-chancellor of an Indian university. Life and career Bullayya was born in 1918 in Peravali, near Vemuru, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. He had to travel long distances to receive his education. Bullayya received a B.A. degree with honours from Andhra University, and served as principal of a B.Ed. college in Kurnool. He later became a District Educational Officer in Kurnool, Krishna and other districts and served in the Education Department as a senior-level officer. After the formation of Andhra State in 1953, Bullayya was appointed Director of Public Instruction. As Director of Higher Education for the government of Andhra Pradesh, he was instrumental in bringing about educational reform. He considered the 10+2+3 plan in Andhra Pradesh before it was recommended by the Kothari Commission. In November 1968, Bullaya was appointed vice-chancellor, continuing in that post until December 1974. He sympathised with socially- and economically- disadvantaged students, and was concerned about their welfare. Six affiliated colleges were permitted to establish postgraduate departments in selected subjects for the purpose of decentralisation. Coaching classes for civil- service examinations and the Continuing Education Scheme were introduced. For the first time in South India, a School of Correspondence Courses was established due to Bullayya's efforts. When university buildings were damaged after the 1970 cyclone which struck Visakhapatnam Bullayya showed photographs of the damage to University Grants Commission authorities in New Delhi, seeking grants for the repair of the buildings. The UGC granted funds not only for repairs, but for constructing new buildings. Bullayya later served at the Union Public Service Commission in an advisory capacity on behalf of Telugu- speaking candidates at the UPSC Interview Board. He was chairman of the Andhra Pradesh and all-India units of the Boy Scouts and a director on the Andhra Bank Board. Bullayya's wife, Samyuktha, was also an educator and former chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Housing Board. His brother's sons Lankapally Ramesh Babu and Suresh Babu are public servants in Sanjeeva Reddy Nagar, Hyderabad. Dr. Bullayya College at Visakhapatnam was named after him. He founded Dr. V.S.

Life  Ernst Lohmeyer (1931) Ernst Lohmeyer was born on July 7, 1890, in Dorsten (Westfalen), as a son of parson, Carl Heinrich Ludwig Lohmeyer (1851‚Äì1918). On July 24, 1912, he wrote his bachelor's thesis on \\"Der Begriff der Diatheke in der antiken Welt und in der Griechischen Bibel\\". In 1914, he wrote a dissertation \\"Die Lehre vom Willen bei Anselm von Canterbury\\", for which he received a doctor of philology. After his army service between 1913 and 1918, he graduated in Heidelberg (1918) and was appointed Professor extraordinarius (1920), and Professor ordinarius (1921). He worked as professor of New Testament Theology at the University of Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw). He was rector of the university in 1930 and 1931. Lohmeyer opposed the Nazis and all related fascist impulses within the German church and society from their onset in the early 1930s.Andreas K√∂hn, Der Neutestamentler Ernst Lohmeyer: Studien zu Biographie und Theologie. T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004. pp. 154-155. He demonstrated his friendship and solidarity with Jewish professors Martin Buber and Jonas Cohn, in an era of strong antisemitism. Lohmeyer wrote to Martin Buber in 1933 that \\"the Christian faith is only Christian as long as it retains in its heart the Jewish faith\\".\\"Der christliche Glaube ist nur solange christlich, als er der j√ºdischen in seinem Herzen tr√§gt\\". Andreas K√∂hn, Der Neutestamentler Ernst Lohmeyer: Studien zu Biographie und Theologie. T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004. p. 298. In this period, his Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, like other Protestant churches, was very quiet on the Jewish question. Gerhard Kittel even attacked Buber. On October 15, 1935, he was demoted from a professorship in prestigious Breslau to the relative backwater of Greifswald for his opposition to the Nazis. During World War II, Lohmeyer served in the Wehrmacht. He became a military officer in the Netherlands and Belgium and on the German East front, on the territory of Poland, and Russia. He remained a Wehrmacht officer from 1939 to 1943 and distinguished himself by wise and courageous leadership and benevolent oversight of occupied areas. After the war, he was a natural choice for rector of the reconstituted University of Greifswald, where he had been a New Testament professor since 1935. On February 15, 1946, Lohmeyer was arrested by the Soviet NKGB, at midnight and whisked away while his home was being ransacked before the eyes of his astonished wife. He vanished without a trace. His family knew no details for the next twelve years.Andreas K√∂hn, Der Neutestamentler Ernst Lohmeyer: Studien zu Biographie und Theologie. T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004. p. 140. Lohmeyer's headstone Lohmeyer was killed on September 19, 1946 while in Soviet custody. His death was officially confirmed on December 12, 1957. He was rehabilitated by the Russian government on August 15, 1996. Lohmeyer published over three hundred items,Andreas K√∂hn, Der Neutestamentler Ernst Lohmeyer: Studien zu Biographie und Theologie. T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004. pp. 332-333. among them monographs on New Testament ecclesiology, the Philippians- Colossians-Philemon corpus, the Gospel of Mark, New Testament history and backgrounds, the Book of Revelation, the relation between Old and New Testament traditions, the historical Jesus, eschatology, and Pauline theology. He interprets the Book of Revelation as a thoroughly eschatological book. He was also the author of hundreds of works still unpublished.Andreas K√∂hn, Der Neutestamentler Ernst Lohmeyer: Studien zu Biographie und Theologie. T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004. pp. 301-304.

Beltz was promoted to Oldsmobile general manager at age 43 in 1969 when Harold N. Metzel retired. Beltz died in May 1972 from cancer at the age of 46. He was revered in the automotive industry as a visionary ahead of his time. Throughout his career, Beltz became known as much for his engineering brilliance as his charisma, his always clever sense of humor and impeccable taste in cars. According to legend, John Beltz and his staff led Oldsmobile through undoubtedly its best years and the Oldsmobiles from 1949 to 72 define Olds as the Rocket division of GM. It is said that during his time at the helm of Oldsmobile, Beltz represented Michigan and the auto industry in its purest form, when cars were king and the auto industry worker, both blue and white-collar, was the lifeblood of the state. Beltz was featured in the July 1969 issue of Hot Rod magazineHOT ROD Covers - The 1960s¬ªPhoto 115 posing with some experimental Olds versions that never saw production. The Car Connection notes that Beltz's best friend and Olds PR man Fritz Bennets recalls that Beltz \\"was a favorite of the press. Bennets recalls a press conference in the Sixties when an overly eager reporter failed to ask a question but delivered a lengthy opinion. To the delight of other writers, Beltz interrupted and said, 'if you want to make a speech, hire a hall.' Bennets felt that Beltz reacted too strongly and asked him to meet with the writer. He concurred and met with his critic over lunch.  Car & Driver Cover  Beltz was also featured on the February 1971 cover of Car and Driver magazine (his most legendary editorial appearance), shown in the Sonoran desert at the GM Proving Grounds near Phoenix, leaning against a Toronado with his sunglasses on. In the corresponding article within the issue, the writer dubbed Beltz the ultimate \\"real car man\\" and Beltz discussed the Toronado and briefly, his other favorite Olds model, the high-performance 442. When asked why he built the Toronado, Beltz, in typical fashion, simply responded \\"It just makes you feel like God.\\" Other notable Beltz quotes from Gordon Jennings' piece include: Discussing his love for automotive engineering: \\"I just fell in love with that machinery. I still love it. Love to see it change from lines on paper to finished form. All the time I was Chief Engineer, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the first prototype of a new car. I'd look for excuses to go out there in the shops and look at cars. I still do.\\" \\"But there's a lot more to the Toronado buyer than education and income: He's a guy who has made it - and knows that he has. Basically he's not buying a car to prove anything, because he has already proven it.\\" Writer Gordon Jennings wrote of Beltz, \\"Listening to John Beltz, which was what we mostly did, because he will talk at length on the subject of Toronados with little prompting - and very lucid speech it is - we found ourselves becoming almost too favorably predisposed to like the new Toronado. In fact, a few hours with John Beltz will make anyone ready to go out and buy an Oldsmobile.\\"  Setting the Pace  Beltz was also discussed at length in the coffee table tome \\"Setting the Pace: Oldsmobiles First 100 Years\\" in which co-workers and friends at Olds spoke about John Beltz the man, as well as his influence on the industry during an era of \\"new frontiers.\\" Bill Murphy, who was assistant controller at Olds in the '60s described Beltz as \\"absolutely brilliant. He had a real sense of humor though a lot of it was biting. John had no time for people who weren't interested in their job, or working hard, keeping up to date. He had no patience for that. You had to know what the answer was or you wouldn't give it. John had a wonderful vocabulary, a great fund of stories and sparkling wit, but he was tough and didn't hesitate to call a spade a spade.\\" The book discusses Beltz's transition to GM of Oldsmobile in 1969, saying, \\"If Beltz had been well liked before, he was even more popular now - even among the press, who loved his candor and colorful language.\\" Beltz became well known for his ability to win the hearts and minds of the press and the people. Hurst Olds engineer Jack \\"Doc\\" Watson also discussed Beltz's likable personality, explaining, \\"It was so funny. Anyone who knew John Beltz knew that whatever was on his mind came right out of his mouth. One time he said, 'Doc, you're a nice young man, but I just have to tell you that we know you're buddies with [Pontiac General Manager John] DeLorean, so he's going to get all your good stuff.\\" Oldsmobile's Bob Somers recalled a meeting he attended with Beltz at the GM building in downtown Detroit, introducing the XP-90, otherwise known as the \\"all-plastic\\" car. After Beltz and Somers' presentation, the board turned the proposed project down, and Somers said, \\"Roche's [James M., chairman of the GM board at the time] man gets up and he's got a flimsy overhead transparency. It's got figures I can't even read - little tiny numbers... the guy gets up there and goes whish, right through it. He gets all done and nobody knows what he said. Roche says, 'And that's why we're not going to do it.' And John says, 'Jesus Christ, not only can I not read it, I didn't understand it.' Right in front of the chairman of the board... So that was John Beltz.\\" The book also discusses Beltz's death in 1972, and the devastation within the Oldsmobile family over losing one of their most beloved bosses. Product delivery manager at the time of Beltz's death, Bob Richards said, \\"the number-one general manager. He to me was THE general manager. He was just a take-charge, take-over sort of guy. Once he said this is it, everyone knew he meant it.\\" Assistant Motor Engineer at the time, Tom Leonard also discussed Beltz at the time of his death, saying \\"John was a super guy. He was probably the most people-oriented person I ever knew. We knew something was wrong, but nobody knew it was cancer. He kept things to himself until the end.\\" Assembly Plant Superintendent Ken Ricks recalled a meeting with Beltz \\"Just a couple of weeks before he quit working. I got a call to come up to his office... I went in and saw him sitting behind that desk. He was saffron yellow, looking terrible. He said, 'I tried to get down to the plant to see you three or four times and I just couldn't make it. My only purpose in asking you up here is to tell you how much I appreciate your work.' And you know, that gets a guy right where it hurts. I would have rather had that than a $5000 a month raise. That's the kind of man he was.\\"  Family  Beltz was survived by two daughters, Johnna and Anna, and wife Loentine. Beltz's eldest daughter, Johnna Beltz-Snyder, succumbed to pancreatic cancer in 2007. Johnna is survived by two children, daughter Elizabeth and younger son John. John Snyder is now heavily immersed in the auto industry as a writer for Winding Road magazine. Beltz's daughter Anna is married to Mike Miller (mentored by Beltz in his formative years) who went on to race for Jack Roush in the SCCA professional Trans-Am series, top alcohol dragsters and open wheel cars in the Formula Atlantic series. He formed the manufacturing company Stealth Technologies & Engineering in 1989 which is now Orchid Orthopedic Solutions LLC.

Montenay has always been regarded as a lady-in-waiting to Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant Queen of Navarre, partly because she dedicated her work to the Queen. An intriguing aspect of Montenay's Calvinist life is that she was married in 1562 to Guyon de Gout, a devout Catholic. Montenay was born in Toulouse. She came from an affluent military family, but was orphaned when young and was taken into the court by the Queen of Navarre, whom she served first as fille d'honneur and later as dame d'honneur. Her position enabled her to acquire a thorough grounding in the classics and exposed her to Evangelism.An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers - Katharina M. Wilson (editor)/Christopher Smith (1991) She died at Sainte-Germier, near Toulouse. Emblemes ou Devises Chrestiennes Montenay's book is an important milestone in the history of emblem books, inasmuch as it was written by a female member of the Reformed (Calvinist) faith. Montenay claims in her foreword that the book represents the first collection of Christian emblems. However, there are earlier emblematic works such as Claude Paradin's \\"Devises heroiques\\" (Lyons:, 1551; 1557). Montenay's Emblemes signals the beginning of a systematic exploitation of these emblems in religious propaganda. It was illustrated using allegorical engravings by Pierre Woeiriot rather than the more traditional woodcuts. It is unusual in calling for participation by the reader in recognising biblical allusions, both verbal and visual, and serves to both educate and entertain. Montenay's work was thought to have first appeared in 1571, but a copy in the Royal Library in Copenhagen shows that it first appeared in 1567 and had been languishing in the hands of her publishers, Jean Marcorelle and Philippe de Castellas, since 1561. The delay may be explained by the religious turmoil of the time making early publication unwise. The Peace of Saint-Germain in 1570 raised hopes which were soon dashed by the 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. In 1584 a Latin version was published, followed in 1619 by the Frankfurt-am-Main polyglot edition in Spanish, Italian, German, English and Dutch. The same illustrations are used in all three editions, so that the plates needed moving between Lyons, Zurich and Frankfurt. The motto or title included in each engraving is in Latin, and is invariably a quotation from the Vulgate version of the Bible, a book with which the common people shared an easy familiarity. The reader was expected to be able to place the quotations in context.French Emblems - Alison Adams The Scottish calligrapher Esther Inglis revised an emblem by Montenay to honour her patron, Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar.Thomas Lange, 'A Rediscovered Esther Inglis Calligraphic Manuscript in the Huntington Library', Papers of the Bibliographic Society of America, 89 (1995), pp. 339‚Äì42.

Life Astle was born on 22 December 1735 at Yoxall on the borders of Needwood Forest in Staffordshire, the son of Daniel Astle, keeper of the forest. He was articled to an attorney, but did not follow up his profession, and went to London, where he was employed to make an index to the catalogue of the Harleian manuscripts, printed in 1759, 2 vols, folio.Dictionary of National Biography, article Astle, Thomas; :s:Astle, Thomas (DNB00). He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1763, and about the same time George Grenville employed him in the arrangement of papers and other matters which required a knowledge of ancient handwriting, and nominated him, with Sir Joseph Ayloffe and Andrew Colt√©e Ducarel, as members of a commission to superintend the regulation of the public records at Westminster. On the death of the two colleagues, John Topham was substituted; he and Astle were removed under Pitt's administration. The same persons were appointed by royal commission in 1764 to superintend the methodising of the records of state and council preserved in the State Paper Office at Whitehall. In 1765 Astle was made receiver-general of sixpence in the pound on the civil list, and on 18 December of the same year he married Anna Maria, the only daughter and heiress of the Rev. Philip Morant, the historian of Essex.Sweet, p. 74. In 1766 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society, and in the same year he was consulted by a committee of the House of Lords on the subject of printing the ancient records of parliament. He suggested the employment of his father-in-law in this work, and succeeded him upon his death in 1770. After the death (1775) of Henry Rooke, chief clerk of the Record Office in the Tower, Astle was appointed to his place; and on the decease of Sir John Shelley, Keeper of the Records, in 1783, obtained the higher office. On the death of Morant in 1770 he came into possession, through Mrs. Astle, of his father-in-law's library of books and manuscripts as well as of a considerable fortune. He died at his house at Battersea Rise, near London, on 1 December 1803, of dropsy, in his sixty-ninth year. By his wife he had nine children. He is buried in Battersea Parish Church and his monument was designed by the London sculptor Charles Regnart.Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660‚Äì1851, Rupert Gunnis Collections and works Astle eventually brought together the most remarkable private collection of manuscripts in the country. Thomas Percy acknowledges his help while investigating ballad literature. He was a conductor of The Antiquarian Repertory, and contributed to the Archaeologia and Vetusta Monumenta of the Society of Antiquaries. In the latter appeared his contribution on unpublished Scottish seals. The editorship of the Taxatio Ecclesiastica and the Calendarium Rotulorum Patentium (Record Commission, 1802, 2 vols, folio), has been ascribed in error to Astle; John Caley edited the former work, and Caley with Samuel Ayscough the latter one. His printed books, chiefly collected by Morant, were purchased from the executors in 1804, for the sum of ¬£1,000, by the founders of the Royal Institution. The collection of manuscripts was left by will to the Marquis of Buckingham, in token of the testator's regard for the Grenville family, upon payment of the nominal sum of ¬£500. The marquis caused a room to be erected by John Soane for their reception at Stowe. Astle was an efficient and zealous keeper, working on storage and indexation.Sweet, p. 283. A Catalogue of the MSS. in the Cottonian Library ... with an account of the damage sustained by fire in 1731 and a catalogue of the charters preserved was published by Samuel Hooper in 1777, with a dedication to Astle. He had no literary connection with the Will of King Alfred (1788), often said to have been translated by him. Sir Herbert Croft was the editor of this work; the translation and most of the notes were furnished by the Rev. Owen Manning. Besides many contributions to the Archaeologia between 1763 and 1802, Astle published the following works: *The Will of King Henry VII, London, 1775, 4to. *The Origin and Progress of Writing, as well Hieroglyphic as Elementary, illustrated by engravings taken from marbles, manuscripts, and charters, ancient and modern: also some account of the origin and progress of printing, London, 1784, 4to, with 31 plates; the 'second edition, with additions,' London, 1803, 4to, 31 plates and portrait, contains Appendix on the Radical Letters of the Pelasgians (published separately in 1775) *An Account of the Seals of the Kings, Royal Boroughs, and Magnates of Scotland, London, 1792, folio, 5 plates; also published in Vetusta Monumenta, 1796, iii. Astle's chief work, The Origin and Progress of Writing, was a contribution to the English literature of palaeography, intended to be a work of diplomatics.Sweet, p. 236. The plates were engraved by Benjamin Thomas Pouncey. The preparation of the text and notes of the edition of the Rotuli Parliamentorum ut et petitiones et placita in Parliamento, etc. [1278‚Äì1503], London, 1767‚Äì77, 6 vols, folio, was undertaken by Morant and John Topham down to 2nd Henry VI, and after that period by Topham and Astle. Dr. John Strachey saw the volumes through the press. The Will of Henry VII was reproduced by Astle in 1775 from the original in the chapter house at Westminster.

Endocytosis: The membrane of the cell invaginates, creating a small circular pit that is taken into the cytosol of the cell. This circular membrane coated pit is a vesicle that is transported to the lysosome of the cell to be degraded by enzymes. Cytosis is a transport mechanism for the movement of large quantities of molecules into and out of cells. There are three main types of cytosis: endocytosis (into the cell), exocytosis (out of the cell), and transcytosis (through the cell, in and out). Etymology and pronunciation The word cytosis () uses combining forms of cyto- and -osis, reflecting a cellular process. The term was coined by Novikoff in 1961.Rieger, R.; Michaelis, A.; Green, M.M. 1991. Glossary of Genetics. Classical and Molecular (Fifth edition). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, .  Endocytosis  Endocytosis is when a cell absorbs a molecule, such as a protein, from outside the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane. It is used by most cells, because many critical substances are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the cell membrane. The two major types of endocytosis are pinocytosis and phagocytosis. ;Pinocytosis :Pinocytosis, also known as cell drinking, is the absorption of small aqueous particles along with the membrane receptors that recognize them. It is an example of fluid phase endocytosis and is usually a continuous process within the cell. The particles are absorbed through the use of clathrin-coated pits. These clathrin-coated pits are short lived and serve only to form a vesicle for transfer of particles to the lysosome. The clathrin-coated pit invaginates into the cytosol and forms a clathrin-coated vesicle. The clathrin proteins will then dissociate.Rappoport JZ (June 2008). \\"Focusing on clathrin-mediated endocytosis\\". The Biochemical Journal412 (3): 415‚Äì23. . What is left is known as an early endosome. The early endosome merges with a late endosome. This is the vesicle that allows the particles that were endocytosed to be transported into the lysosome. Here there are hydrolytic enzymes that will degrade the contents of the late endosome. Sometimes, rather than being degraded, the receptors that were endocytosed along with the ligand are then returned to the plasma membrane to continue the process of endocytosis. Mechanism of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Clathrin- coated pits in endocytosis: The membrane of the cell invaginates using the protein clathrin. The clathrin uses actin to pull together the sides of the plasma membrane and form a vesicle inside the cellular cytosol. ;Receptor- mediated endocytosis :Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a mode of pinocytosis. Proteins in the clathrin coat on the plasma membrane have propensity to bind and trap macromolecules or ligands. However, it is not the receptors in the pit that caused the pinocytosis. The vesicles would have formed regardless of whether or not the receptors and ligand were there.Mukherjee S, Ghosh RN, Maxfield FR (July 1997). \\"Endocytosis\\". Physiological Reviews 77 (3): 759‚Äì803. . Retrieved 2012-11-14 This is why it is still a continuous non-triggered event, unlike phagocytosis, which is explained below. ;Phagocytosis :Phagocytosis, also known as cell eating, is the absorption of larger particles such as bacteria into the cytosol. In smaller single- celled organisms, this is how it feeds. In larger multicellular organisms, it is a way of destroying old or damaged cells or ingesting microbial invaders. In the case of ingesting a bacterium, the bacterium will be bound by antibodies in the aqueous environment. When this antibody runs into a receptor on the surface of a cell, the plasma membrane responds by extending itself to surround the bacterium. Thus, phagocytosis is not a randomly occurring event. It is triggered by a ligand binding to a receptor. Some cells are specially designed to phagocytize. These cells include Natural Killer cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. All of these are involved in the immune response and serve to degrade foreign or antigenic materialLodish, H. Berk, A., Kaiser, C., Kreiger, M., Bretscher, A., Ploegh, H., Amon, A., Scott, M. (2012) Molecular Cell Biology (7th ed.). W.H. Freeman and Co. New York: New York.  Exocytosis  Exocytosis (L) and Endocytosis (R) Exocytosis is when a cell directs the contents of secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane. The vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and their content, usually protein, is released out of the cell. There are two types of exocytosis: Constitutive secretion and Regulated secretion. In both of these types, a vesicle buds from the Golgi Apparatus and is shuttled to the plasma membrane, to be exocytosed from cell. Exocytosis of lysosomes commonly serves to repair damaged areas of the plasma membrane by replenishing the lipid bilayer.Xu, J., Toops, K. A., Diaz, F., Carvajal-Gonzalez, J. M., Gravotta, D., Mazzoni, F., ... & Lakkaraju, A. (2012). Mechanism of polarized lysosome exocytosis in epithelial cells. Journal of Cell Science 125(24): 5937-5943 ;Constitutive secretion (irregulated exocytosis) :This is when the vesicle that buds from the Golgi Apparatus contains both soluble proteins as well as lipids and proteins that will remain on the plasma membrane after fusion of the vesicle. This type of secretion is unregulated. The vesicle will eventually travel to the plasma membrane and fuse with it. The contents of the cell will be released into the extra-cellular space while the components of the vesicle membrane (plasma membrane lipids and proteins) will establish themselves as part of the cell's plasma membrane. ;Regulated secretion (regulated exocytosis) :This is when the cell receives a signal from the extra-cellular space, such as a neurotransmitter or hormone, that regulates the fusing of the vesicle to the plasma membrane and the release of its contents. The vesicle is transported to the plasma membrane. There it sits until it receives a signal to fuse with the membrane and release its contents into the extra-cellular space.Lodish, H. Berk, A., Kaiser, C., Kreiger, M., Bretscher, A., Ploegh, H., Amon, A., Scott, M. (2012) Molecular Cell Biology (7th ed.). W.H. Freeman and Co. New York: New York.  Transcytosis  Transcytosis is a type of cytosis that allows particles to be shuttled from one membrane to another. An example of this would be when a receptor normally lies on the basal or lateral membrane of an epithelial cell, but needs to be trafficked to the apical side. This can only be done through transcytosis due to tight junctions, which prevent movement from one plasma membrane domain to another. This type of cytosis occurs commonly in epithelium, intestinal cells, and blood capillaries. Transcytosis can also be taken advantage of by pathogenic molecules and organisms. Several studies have shown that bacterium can easily enter intestinal lumen through transcytosis of goblet cells.Nikitas, G.; Deschamps, C.; Disson, O.; Niault, T.; Cossart, P.; Lecuit, M. (2011). \\"Transcytosis of Listeria monocytogenes across the intestinal barrier upon specific targeting of goblet cell accessible E-cadherin\\". Journal of Experimental Medicine 208 (11): 2263‚Äì2277. . . Other studies, however, are exploring the idea that transcytosis may play a role in allowing medications to cross the blood-brain barrier. Exploiting this fact may allow certain drug therapies to be better utilized by the brain.Y. Joy Yu, et al. (2001). ‚ÄúBoosting Brain Uptake of a Therapeutic Antibody by Reducing Its Affinity for a Transcytosis Target‚Äù. Science Translational Medicine 3 (84): 84ra44. . Methods of cytosis not only move substances in, out of, and through cells, but also add and subtract membrane from the cell's plasma membrane. The surface area of the membrane is determined by the balance of the two mechanisms and contributes to the homeostatic environment of the cell.

His rule is famous for the political stability which he maintained in that time period and the thriving of literature, especially poetry. Classical literature (prose and verse) as well as many rock inscriptions and royal grant letters (patent letters, sannas) have been found, rendering much information pertaining to this period. Early life His mother was Sunethra Maha Devi. His father was Lameni Jayamahalena (Prince Jayakahalena), a lord. If so, he is the grandson of Prince Parakramabahu, who was Savulu Vijayabahu's son. Savulu Vijayabahu is the fifth to go by that name. His son Parakramabahu is the one who ruled the country, from Dedigama. Another scholar says that Jayamahalena was the grandfather of Parakramabahu. However, he is supposed to belong to the family, that came after Parakramabahu V. Parakramabahu VI was allied with Ming China who forcibly dethroned Alakeshvara in favor of him. As documented in Chinese records, Parakramabahu VI was elected by the Sinhalese present at the Ming court, nominated by the Ming emperor, and installed by Admiral Zheng He with the backing of his fleet.. Coronation Although most sources say 1415 as his year of coronation, they also say that he coroneted after ruling three years from Raigama. Saddarmalakaraya says the coronation was in 1410. Parakramabahu VI's queen's name is Swarnamanikya or Ranmenika. A new palace was built in Jayawardane-pura Kotte. A 'Temple of the Tooth' was also constructed. Rule King Parakramabahu VI suppressed the revolts in Malayarata. The chiefs of Vanni who wielded power there, were defeated by this king. In 1435, a south Indian invasion from the Vijayanagara Empire, is recorded. Sri Lankn sources say that the king thwarted the invasion successfully but south Indian records contradict this. Soon after this time, king Par√¢kramab√¢hu VI directed a naval attack on south Indian ports, resulting from a dispute that arose after the incident of steeling of a cargo ship by an Indian called Rayan Malavar around the year 1443.A. S. F. Weerasuriya, Kurukula Charithaya, p.232-8 (1960) Sujatha Publishers Conquering Yapa Patuna This battle was led by king Par√¢kramab√¢hu VI's adopted son, Prince Sapumal (Sembagapperumal). Selalihini Sandeshaya records that the prince returned after winning the Yapa Patuna (Jaffna), about year 1449. The king took advantage that AryaChakravarthi could no longer get military assistance from Vijayanagara. As troops advanced across Mannar to Jaffna by land, naval forces must have cut south Indian assistance by patrolling the Palk Strait. The first fierce battle happened in JavaKotte (Chavakacheri) near Elephant pass. Later Jaffna was attacked and Arya chakravarthi was forced to retreat to India. The fifteenth century route to Yapa Patuna , Padma EDIRISINGHE (Sunday Observer) Retrieved 20 November 2015 Demise In year 1463, there was a rebellion in the hill country and Sena sammatha Wikramabahu became king of Senkadagala. The king died in 1467. And his grand son Jayabahu became king. But this was followed by much political turmoil. The stability of king Par√¢kramab√¢hu VI would not return for centuries to come. Contribution to literature He also played a main role in the contribution to literature. King Parakramabahu VI showed a great interest in literature and arts. Also the offering of Royal favour is influenced to flourish of Sinhalese Literature. His period is considered as the Golden Era in Sinhalese Literature. That was the heyday of 'Sandesha Poetry.' Contribution to Buddhism He had built a 'Dalada Maligawa' which imbuded with 3 floors for reposing the tooth relic. So also he constructed a Greatest monument having honour of his mother called 'Papiliyane Sunethradevi Piriwena'.

The FRCPC was in the area of Medical Science 1973. The F.A.C.P. was in Preventive Medicine His research interests were wide. In 1936 he and Dr G. Schepers took the famous paleontologist, Doctor Robert Broom, to the Sterkfontein caves, near Johannesburg, South Africa, where Broom made important discoveries of hominid fossils, Australopithecus africanus.  Professional positions and appointments  In his University teaching he saw epidemiology as a broad comprehensive subject studying the determinants of disease. From this point of view epidemiology includes the basic medical sciences, microbiology, environmental chemistry and clinical medicine. However, by 1975, in the English speaking academic world, epidemiology had become a narrow statistical subject, involved mainly with analysis and past epidemic surveys and clinical trials. The Department of Epidemiology and Biometrics grew and M.Sc. and Ph.D. Programs were developed. Between 1950 and 1980 the pundits were claiming antibiotics would solve the problems of most infectious disease. The fact that bacteria develop resistance to medicaments was not considered. In 1973 le Riche and Dr. Michael Lenczner raised the importance of infectious and tropical disease imported into Canada by travellers, immigrants and refugees. Governments were not interested in these situations. By 1981 it became clear that AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) was a serious infectious disease. In 1953 he received a part-time commission in the Canadian Armed Forces, serving in the 23rd Field Ambulance, under Lieut. Col. David Thompson in Ottawa. In 1968 he became a member of the Defence Research Board and for many years he was Consultant on preventive medicine to the Defence Medical Council. Outside the University he served on many committees including those of the Ontario Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Association. During 1966-72 he was on the Metropolitan Toronto Hospital Planning Council under the chairmanship of Dr. H. Hoyle Campbell, plastic surgeon, who with Dr. Shouldice, pioneered outpatient surgery in Toronto. Some of the excellent recommendations of the Council were carried out in 1998 and 1999. For many years he served as the Medical Research Council Associate Committee on Hospital Infections, Chairman Professor E.G.D. Murray. As a result of this association the book on \\"The Control of Infections in Hospitals\\" was published in 1966. Other committees were the Professional Education Committee of the American Public Health Association, Examiners Committee, Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, Nursing Research Committee, Ontario Council of Health Care 1969, Physicians Services Inc. Research Grants Committee, Second International Conference on Agriculture, University of Reading, England, Committee, Canadian Cancer Research Foundation, Committee on Acupuncture, Ontario Council of Health, Report on Reorganization of the City of Toronto Health Department. He was Chairman of the Canadian Society for Tropical Medicine and International Health 1976-1978. He was a member of the Committee on Preventive Medicine, Medical Council of Canada. In the University he was on the Planning Strategy Committee, Planning and Priorities Subcommittee, and many others. Research on Medical Care included surveys on the work of Medical Officers of Health in Ontario, and the work of Optometrists and Ophthalmologists in Ontario. For a few weeks he was visiting professor, Wayne County Medical School, Detroit and Distinguished Lecturer at Dalhousie Medical School. In 1956 he first appeared with Dr. Arthur Kelly, Canadian Medical Association on a television program. This was the beginning of a 25-year career in radio, television and the daily press, which covered many aspects of health care, nutrition and communicable diseases, and medical politics. He became a good communicator, and public speaker. His academic interests were nutrition, infections, populations, and environmental destruction. He was a Fellow of the American Public Health Association and Fellow of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine. For 18 years he was on the part-time staff of the Department of Family Practice and Extended Care at Sunnybrook Hospital. He was awarded the Defries medal and granted Honorary Membership of the Canadian Public Health Association.

A priest before he became a monk at Cluny, he was appointed cardinal-bishop of Tusculum sometime between 1121 and 1123. He served as a papal legate on four occasions: to Poland and Hungary around 1124, to Carinthia in 1126, to the Crusader states in 1128 or 1129 and to Aquitaine from 1131 until 1137. He took the side of the Antipope Anacletus II in the papal schism of 1130 and was deposed as cardinal-bishop by the Second Lateran Council in 1139. An accomplished Latin stylist, Gilo wrote the majority of the Historia de via Hierosolymitana, a verse history of the First Crusade (1096‚Äì1099). He also wrote the Vita sancti Hugonis abbatis Cluniacensis, a biography of Abbot Hugh of Cluny (1024‚Äì1109). A couple of letters he wrote in connection with his third legation have also survived and are highly regarded for their style and eloquence. Life Paris and Cluny Gilo's birth date is unknown, but may be placed in the final quarter of the 11th century.Werner Maleczek, \\"Egidio (Gilo)\\", in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 42 (Rome: 1993). His birthplace was Toucy in the county of Auxerre, but he was living in Paris when he wrote the Historia, as he says in Book IX: \\"Gilo, a resident of Paris and a native of Toucy, which by no means disowns me.\\"C. W. Grocock and J. E. Siberry, eds. and trans., The Historia Vie Hierosolimitane of Gilo of Paris (Clarendon Press, 1997), pp. xviii‚Äìxxiv. According to the prologue to Book IV, he was already of advanced age when he wrote it. He had tried at least once before to write an epic poem and had written light verse in his youth. In the explicit of two manuscripts, Gilo is said to have been a cleric of the diocese of Paris at the time he wrote the Historia, which was before he became a monk. He was writing before 1120, probably in the first decade of the 12th century. Gilo entered the Benedictine abbey of Cluny during the abbacy of Pons of Melgueil (1109‚Äì1122). On account of his literary reputation, he was tasked by Pons with writing a biography of Hugh of Semur, Pons's predecessor as abbot. This work was not completed before Hugh's canonization, which was celebrated at Cluny by Pope Calixtus II on 6 January 1120. This was probably the occasion on which Gilo joined the papal entourage. He wrote most of his Vita sancti Hugonis in Rome, as he says in the dedicatory epistle addressed to Pons. Becoming a cardinal In Rome, Gilo was elected bishop of Tusculum and created a cardinal by Calixtus II. Accounts differ about the date of his elevation. According to some sources, his is the third signature on the papal bull Ad universos fideles dated 28 December 1121. His name appears as Aegidius Tusculanus episcopus. According to others, he is first attested as a cardinal- bishop only in a papal bull of 6 April 1123. His predecessor, Divitius, is said to have signed a papal privilege on 16 May 1122. His consecration may have taken place on 20 September or 20 December 1122 or possibly as late as 7 March 1123. It was considered a great honour to be elevated to a cardinal- bishopric without first having been a deacon or presbyter. Gilo spent most of 1123 with Calixtus and the papal entourage. He stayed with the pope in Benevento in September and October. Between April 1123 and March 1125, he is absent from papal records. He is again absent between May 1125 and May 1128. These periods correspond to his service as a papal legate abroad. Polish and Carinthian legations Gilo served as a legate in Poland and Hungary in the 1120s, but the exact time of this legation is uncertain. It most likely took place before the death of Calixtus II in December 1124. It is known only from copies of documents in later Polish cartularies. At the request of Duke Boles≈Çaw III, Gilo confirmed the possessions of the Benedictine monastery of Tyniec acquired in 1105 and the boundaries of the new diocese of W≈Çoc≈Çawek. Pope Eugenius III issued a confirmation of Gilo's acts in April 1148. Gilo could not have been in Poland in mid-1125. On 7 March 1125, he signed a privilege of Pope Honorius II in Rome. He is also mentioned in Roman documents of April and May 1125. In the late 1120s, Gilo undertook a second legation to the southeast of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1126, he consecrated a cemetery for the Benedictine abbey of Arnoldstein in the diocese of Aquileia in the Duchy of Carinthia. This is known only from a 15th-century copy of the document.Franc Kos, Gradivo za zgodovino Slovencev v srednjem veku, IV (Ljubljana, 1915), p. 53 n. 90. His remit almost certainly extended beyond Carinthia and 1126, since he is only seen again at Rome on 7 May 1128, when he signed a privilege of Honorius II. Given the uncertainty in their date, Gilo's Polish and Carinthian visits are sometimes combined into a single legatine mission, in either 1123‚Äì1125 or 1125‚Äì1128. Levantine legation The purpose of Gilo's third legation was to resolve the dispute over the status of the archdiocese of Tyre, whether it was a suffragan of the patriarchate of Antioch or Jerusalem. In 1127, Honorius II ruled in favour of Jerusalem, but Patriarch Bernard of Antioch refused to recognise the decision. Patriarch Warmund of Jerusalem consecrated William I as archbishop of Tyre. In 1128 William arrived in Rome to receive his pallium. Honorius granted it and restated his ruling of the previous year, sending Gilo, an experienced legate, to enforce it.Bernard Hamilton, The Latin Church in the Crusader States: The Secular Church (Routledge, 2016 [1980]), pp. 66‚Äì67. Gilo's third mission is better known than his first two. He embarked for the Holy Land in the first half of July 1128 in Bari, taking the same ship as the archbishop of Tyre. Two of Gilo's letters survive, including one addressed to Bernard. Archbishop William II of Tyre mentions it in his Historia, while praising Gilo as a \\"most eloquent and literate man\\" and his letters as \\"very famous\\". The mission was ultimately a failure. Bernard never relented before his death in 1135. Some sources have Gilo returning to Rome in December 1128 and signing papal privileges in March and April 1129, while others have him in the Holy Land in 1129‚Äì1130. Papal schism In the disputed papal election of February 1130, Gilo took the side of Anacletus II, afterwards regarded as an antipope, against Innocent II. This was probably an act of Cluniac solidarity, since Anacletus had studied at Cluny. Cluny itself, however, sided with Innocent. Abbot Peter the Venerable wrote a letter dated no later than 1134 encouraging Gilo to change sides. In early 1131, Gilo was sent by Anacletus to be his legate in southern France (i.e., the Duchy of Aquitaine), where Anacletus' main supporter was Bishop Gerard of Angoul√™me. Although Gilo remained in France for several years, Gerard took the leading role in converting the French aristocracy to their faction. Soon after Gilo's arrival, Gerard was elected archbishop of Bordeaux. In the summer of 1131, in one of the archbishop's first acts, he granted the church of Saint-Pierre-de-Bensac to the abbey of Sainte-Croix. Gilo, joined by cardinals Gregory of Santa Maria in Aquiro and Roman of Sant'Adriano al Foro, was present in Bordeaux to witness this. Afterwards, he took up residence in Poitiers, where Peter the Venerable visited him in the spring of 1133. In 1135, Gilo was excommunicated by Innocent II's legate, Geoffrey of Chartres. This did not induce a change of position. That year he authenticated with his seal an agreement between a knight and the abbey of Saint-Hilaire in Poitiers. Also that year in Poitiers, acting in his capacity as papal legate, he resolved a dispute between the abbey of Montierneuf and its dependency of Foye-Montjault. Gerard died in March 1136 and that year Duke William X of Aquitaine abandoned the cause of Anacletus, making Gilo's position in Poitiers difficult. He met Peter the Venerable in Grenoble in 1137, but it was only after the death of Anacletus on 25 January 1138 and a second letter from Peter that he reconciled himself to Innocent II. He returned to Rome and was readmitted as a cardinal. In this capacity he signed papal documents on 21 June 1138 and continued at the papal court until 29 March 1139, signing documents on 26 July 1138 and on 7 and 28 February and 2 March 1139. During the Second Lateran Council in April, however, he was denounced along with the other followers of Anacletus and deposed. Gilo is never mentioned again after his deposition. Probably he died not long after. He was dead by 19 April 1142, when Imarus is first recorded as cardinal-bishop of Tusculum. Works Historia The Historia de via Hierosolymitana is a verse history of the First Crusade. It, or at least the part written by Gilo, is preserved in five manuscripts. A sixth manuscript contains additional sections written by an anonymous poet called \\"Fulco\\" or the \\"Charleville poet\\". Although both poets have a classicizing tendency, Gilo is the more learned. His Latin and his hexameters are of high quality for the 12th century. The hero of his account is Bohemond of Taranto, while the Charleville poet prefers Godfrey of Bouillon.Grocock and Siberry 1997, p. xiii. The work in its fullest form is divided into nine books, but Gilo's original work apparently only contained five, one each on the siege of Nicaea; the first siege of Antioch; the second siege of Antioch; the capture of Bara, Ma øarrat an-Nu øman and Tartus; and the fall of Jerusalem. With the Charleville poet's additions, these became books IV, V, VII, VIII, and IX. There are unique details in Gilo's work that suggest that he had access to eyewitnesses.Grocock and Siberry 1997, p. xiv. Vita The Vita sancti Hugonis abbatis CluniacensisA. L'Huillier, Vie de saint Hugues, abb√© de Cluny, 1024‚Äì1109 (Solesmes, 1888). was mostly written between the canonization of Hugh (1120) and the resignation of Pons (1122). Gilo's is just one of eight biographies of Hugh of Semur, but it is the most detailed. Pons also asked Ezelo of Li√®ge and Hildebert of Lavardin to write biographies of Hugh. That of Ezelo is lost, but may have been used by Gilo as a source. Gilo also had access to eyewitnesses and acquaintances of Hugh at Cluny. Hildebert made use of Gilo's Vita for his own more famous biography. Gilo's biography was designed for spiritually edification. It devotes most of its space to Hugh's virtues and miracles. His political activities during the Investiture Contest and his construction a new church at Cluny are covered tersely. The Vita is preserved in two manuscripts, now in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Lat. 12607 and Lat. 13090. References Further reading *Karol Maleczy≈Ñski. Studia nad dokumentem polskim.

Bhai Iqbal Singh and Bhai Khem Singh were directed by Sant Ji to search, locate and reveal to mankind the hitherto hidden holy site (land) where several saints, sages and Rishis were believed to have performed hard penance from time immemorial. This place had also been hallowed by the visit of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru. Sant Ji told the duo that the sacred site was located in the lower Himalayas somewhere near the town of Nahan (in Himachal Pradesh). Following the directive of Sant Teja Singh, the young team of Bhai Iqbal Singh & Bhai Khem Singh searched a vast territory trying to locate the sacred spot; but in vain. Bhai Iqbal Singh then beseech ed Sant Ji to allow him to resign his job in Punjab to take up employment in Himachal Pradesh. This step, he believed would facilitate the search for the sacred site. Sant Ji acceded to his request and blessed him \\"May the Guru abide with you.\\" Iqbal Singh in Himachal Pradesh Responding to an advertisement in the newspaper, Iqbal Singh applied for & secured the job of Agricultural Officer in Himachal Pradesh. His search for the sacred spot continued in right earnest. He suggested to Sant Ji that land was suitable for setting up a spiritual centre near the Kalka-Shimla highway, easily accessible by car. Sant Ji turned down the suggestion saying that the envisaged site was further deep in the Himalayan jungles. Bhai Iqbal Singh searched tirelessly for the sacred spot but to no avail. Discovery of the village Bharru About 50‚Äì60 km from Solan, there was a village Baru spread over 400 Acres owned by one Thakur Joginder Singh. It was densely forested & had several springs. Under a huge walnut tree near a spring, sadhus would come & meditate from time to time. The Thakur would welcome them & offer them food. The Natural Ambiance Surrounding Baru Sahib One day, a wise old ascetic came and sat under the walnut tree and was soon lost in deep meditation (samƒÅdhi). When he opened his eyes, the Thakur offered him food. But the sadhu looked at him and said, \\"Joginder Singh, you will not stay here for long. This is Guru Nanak's land. From the time of \\"Satya Yuga\\", saints and sages have performed penance here. Even Guru Gobind Singh Ji visited this place & blessed it. A time shall come when Guru Nanak's Sikhs gather here, meditate on the Divine Name, recite Gurbani; and spread the Divine Message throughout the world.\\" The Thakur, thinking that the holy man had put a curse on him; took away the food in anger. After a few hours, when his anger had abated, he returned with the food at the prompting of his wife but found that the sadhu had disappeared. Meanwhile, in the heart of the God-enlightened Sant Teja Singh had flourished a keen desire to discover the sacred spot. Around the same time, it so happened that the Thakur fell out with the village folk and decided to sell off his estate. News of this turn of events got through to Sant Ji by supernatural sources and he promptly sent a message to Bhai Iqbal Singh at Dhaula Kuan that a village Baru in Tehsil Sarahan of district. Nahan had been put up for sale. Bhai Iqbal Singh set off on foot for Baru 35 km away. On reaching the spot, he discovered that it had all the features prophesied earlier by Sant Ji. Baba Iqbal Singh sent a letter to Sant Ji saying that the village Baru seemed to be exactly the place he had envisioned for setting up a spiritual center. Sant Ji came down to Nahan from the village Cheema in Punjab and without visiting or negotiating the price, bought the entire 400 Acres of land at Baru in the year 1956. Devotees throng the village Baru \\"The Land of Peace\\" In 1959, 82 years old Sant Teja Singh Ji accompanied by 15-20 devotees trekked 35 km in the Himalayas to reach Baru Sahib. They set up camp and built a mud-hut, in which the first Akhand Path (Non-Stop reading of Guru Granth Sahib) was started. At the conclusion of Akhand Path, with tears in his eyes, Sant Ji performed the poignant Ardas, \\"True Master! When will you usher in the time when students from all over the world gather here and mould their lives in accordance with the teachings of Guru Nanak and bring peace to the world.\\" After the Ardas, the devotees came over to Sant Ji and said \\"There is no habitation and no roads around here. This jungle has only wild animals like monkeys and bears. Who will trek through the jungles to this remote spot.\\" Sant Ji replied, \\"Just as a tiny banyan seed grows into a huge tree, in the same way this place will develop into a great center of spiritual education where high quality scientific education will also be imparted. In due course, roads will be built and all those whose hearts are brimful of love for Guru Nanak and who have toiled to accumulate spiritual capital from the previous births, will be drawn to this place.\\" Sant Ji's prophecy comes true Sant Teja Singh entrusted the responsibility of managing and developing the activities at Baru Sahib to Baba Iqbal Singh. The mud-hut housing the Gurdwara was expanded. In due course, roads were built; vehicles began to ply and by 1975, six rooms were constructed. Thereafter, in 1981-82, the construction of the cement and brick Gurdwara and Ashram building was started. In 1986, the now famous Akal Academy had its beginning in the Ashram building with just five students. Over the years, the academy grew at an incredible pace to its present size. It is now an 11-storeyed building and has 1538 boys and girls on its rolls. Of these, 200 are overseas students; 100 from the US alone. 350 students are getting free education. A few of them belong to those families of the survivors of 1984 carnage, who have not yet been settled, children of martyrs of Punjab, children from underprivileged communities (Vanjara) in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and Nanak Panthis from Uttar Pradesh. Besides the Akal Academy, The Kalgidhar Society manages an orphanage, an old age home, a home for widows and destitute women, a 280-bed charitable hospital, a music centre, a spiritual academy for women wherein 200 young girls are getting free training besides board and lodging. As a foray into Higher Education, the Society has started Eternal University which today runs 24 programs including B.Tech. and B.Sc Nursing. The Teachers Training centres impart free training to around 2000 girls from the under-privileged classes. They are later absorbed as Teachers in the Akal Academies. Apart from Akal Academy Baru Sahib, The Kalgidhar Society manages 129 English medium Schools under pattern of CBSE in various parts of rural Northern India. In these academies, some 60,000 students are receiving quality education besides being groomed in spiritual education Gurmat. Inspired by these children, grown ups are renouncing vices and approximately five lakhs have turned over new leaves.

It includes the hamlets of Gorenji Novi Svet (, ) to the northwest and Dolenji Novi Svet () to the southeast, as well as the isolated Vrbanƒçek farm. The area is mostly covered by needleleaf forest with many karst dells, sinkholes, and caves. The village has little arable land and sparse meadows, and so its residents have traditionally made a living from forestry. Name The name Novi Svet literally means 'new area, new territory'. The name refers to the fact that the area was settled more recently than neighboring villages after wooded land was cleared. History Some Slavic settlement may have already taken place in Novi Svet as early as the sixth century. Novi Svet was mentioned in historical sources in the 15th century in connection with iron working; the blast furnace that it supplied shut down in the 1589 due to a lack of ore. Settlers are said to have arrived in larger numbers in Novi Svet from Vehar≈°e in nearby Medvedje Brdo after the iron mining was abandoned there in the late 16th century, and also during French rule in the early 19th century in an effort to avoid military service. Between the First and Second World Wars, the territory of Novi Svet lay west of the Rapallo border, in the Kingdom of Italy. The remains of the Italian border and customs posts along the road from Hotedr≈°ica to Godoviƒç are located in the northeastern territory of Novi Svet.

Established in 1993, the band has released two full-length albums. History Corpus Mortale was founded in Copenhagen in 1993 by Nicholas Masch√∏ln and S√∏ren Jensen, followed by Martin Rosendahl completing the lineup in 1994. From the beginning the band was interested in playing death metal, and released their demo Corpus Mortale in 1995. The demo was critically acclaimed, and inspired the band to increase their efforts. Morten Jensen was recruited as a fourth member on guitar in 1996 and after only three months Corpus Mortale entered the studio to record their second demo entitled Integration. This demo received a more widespread and positive reaction than the first, and all 800 copies were sold out within 7 months. Following a number of tours between 1997 and 1999, S√∏ren and Morten Jensen decided to leave the band after another recording attempt, the unreleased album Spritism. Following this, Brian Eriksen and Jens Lee (formerly of Iniquity) joined, and a final demo, Succumb to the Superior was released. The release of this demo generated positive reactions, and a deal of label interest. In the summer of 2001, Jens Lee left the band due to commitment issues. After another MCD, Sombre and Vile, the band focused on the release of their first full-length album,Interview with Nicholas Masch√∏ln: With Lewd Demeanor. Following this album's release, the band signed with Dutch record label Neurotic Records.Corpus Mortale's Neurotic Biography: The album released on 23 November 2003, supported by a European tour with Konkhra, Homo Iratus and Illnath. A music video for the song Mass Funeral Pyre was released also. Brian Eriksen was replaced on guitar by Mads H√•rl√∏v (ex-Iniquity) as a session member.Interview with Martin Rosendahl: With this new lineup, the band entered the studio to record a 3 track EP named Seize the Moment of Murder on Nuclear Winter Records. In 2007 through Willowtip Records they released their second full-length album, A New Species of Deviants through Willowtip Records in the USA and Neurotic Records in the rest of the world. Following a contract renewal, Brian Eriksen rejoined the band, and Nicholas Masch√∏ln left after fourteen years. Rasmus Scmidt (The Omnihil, ex-Downlord) replaced Nicholas and the band continues to tour in support of their most recent album. In October 2008, after seven years in Corpus Mortale, Roar Christoffersen decided to leave the band. The reason for this was to concentrate on his other music project Bastards Corpus Mortale quickly found a replacement for Christoffersen in Andreas Lynge of The Cleansing. Andreas played his first gig in Corpus Mortale at the Copenhagen Death Fest on 6 December, and the Royal Metal Fest on 9 January in √Örhus. Currently Corpus Mortale is working on material for a new album in addition to several tourdates to be announced. The songs on the new album will include titles such as Feasting Upon Souls and Love Lies Bleeding. Also planned is a merchandising deal with Relapse Records, a brand new t-shirt design which will be made available worldwide. In September Corpus Mortale signed to American label Deepsend Records. Deepsend will release the Danes‚Äô third album \\"FleshCraft\\" this fall, with a special web-only Pre-Order which will ship prior to the release date in stores. \\"FleshCraft\\" will come to be known as a defining statement of Danish death metal. The year's best death metal album is also amongst the best from Denmark ever.

The outer lip of the peristome is broad, expanded and reflexed. It is white in color, its upper end perforated by an oval hole. The outer margin of the peristome has four long folds within it, of which the columellar and the lower and upper palatal are subequal, the inner end of the latter being strongly bent upward. The suprapalatal fold is smaller and oblique, almost transverse. Above it is a small upper superpalatal fold, which has united with the angle-lamella to form the wall of the respiratory foramen, perforating the end of the lip.

Overlooking the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River to the east, Baltimore's Downtown to the north and railroad tracks to the south, Mt. Auburn Cemetery is surrounded by the Cherry Hill, Westport, Mt. Winans and Lakeland communities. History One of the most historic and largest African American cemeteries in Baltimore, Mt. Auburn Cemetery was formed in 1872, by the Reverend James Peck in protest to segregation against the White Methodist Church. Its grounds encompass and holds more than 55,000 interred. Designated on the local and national historic registers, the cemetery was once known as \\"The City of the Dead for Colored People\\" since it was the only place a person of color could be buried. Once part of a farm, the land was given to the Methodist Church and assigned to the Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church to oversee its grounds. Over the years the cemetery has been in total neglect with only a few of its front acreage remaining identifiable as a cemetery. Mt. Auburn Cemetery holds the remains of some of Baltimore's and the nation's \\"movers and shakers\\" of the local civil rights movement. In addition to runaway slaves, the cemetery contains the remains of the first African American ship chandler; clergymen; the first female funeral home director, Civil War and civil rights activists, lawyers, doctors, teachers, military veterans, founders of national fraternities‚Äô and sororities‚Äô and the ancestors of thousands of African- American families.

The company was formed on 18 February 2009 when Simon Douglas, former managing director of Zavvi and business partner Les Whitfield, purchased five stores from Zavvi Entertainment Group which was placed in administration on 24 December 2008. All stores closed in early 2010 after less than a year of trading.. History  Virgin Megastores  Richard Branson started his first Virgin store on London's Oxford Street in 1971. In 1979, the company opened their first Megastore at the end of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. Between the 1980s and 1990s, the chain grew, most notably through its merger with Our Price whilst under the ownership of WH Smith. By the 1990s Virgin Megastores had become an international franchise as part of the Virgin Group. During the early to mid 2000s Virgin Group decided to sell off most of its Virgin Megastores to various companies, including the French stores to the Lagardere Group and the American stores to Related Companies. Head in Leeds, West Yorkshire.  Zavvi  In September 2007 it was announced that the UK arm of the Virgin Megastores brand was to break away from the Virgin Group, in a management buy-out offer led by managing director Simon Douglas and finance director Steve Peckham. EUK, of the Woolworths Group, was the main supplier of Zavvi under an exclusive supply deal. As a result of EUK entering into administration, on 24 December 2008, the entertainment retailer was also forced into administration as it was unable to source stock on favourable terms direct from suppliers. As a result of its administration Zavvi closed the majority of its 130 stores, with some sold to rival HMV, and some others to a new company, Head Entertainment.  Head Entertainment  Head Entertainment was formed on 2 February 2009 by Simon Douglas, former managing director of Zavvi, Mark Noonan, former Director of Trading of Zavvi and their business partner Les Whitfield. Les Whitfield also founded the entertainment retailer Impulse which he sold in July 2007. On 18 February, the day in which the final set of store closures was announced, Zavvi's administrators Ernst & Young sold 14 of the stores to HMV, and five to Head Entertainment. An additional two stores were purchased on 20 February 2009. A third additional store, the former Zavvi store at The Mall, Cribbs Causeway in Bristol was also going to be purchased, but the company was unable to reach an agreement with the landlord. The store was subsequently taken over by HMV who relocated from their former premises at Cribbs Causeway and employed some of the former Zavvi staff. All of the remaining stock which Zavvi owned was sold to Head Entertainment. It is thought that the partners in Head paid less than 20p a unit for the Zavvi stock.  Product range  Head Entertainment sold a range of products from Audio, Books, CDs, Computer software and hardware, DVDs and Video Games; a similar product mix to the stores it replaced (Zavvi, and previously Virgin Megastores). Much of the stock retailed in Head Entertainment stores was ex-Zavvi stock.  Operations and decline  Head Entertainment operated stores in Bristol Broadmead, Dundee, Leeds, Merry Hill, Bluewater, Manchester Arndale Centre, Cardiff and Liverpool One.

Life After Higher Civic School (Hogere Burger School, HBS), Lacombl√© trained in navigation at the Royal Netherlands Naval College in Willemsoord in 1914. In 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant (Lieutenant ter Zee or LtZ) 3rd class and was posted to the East Indies. There he was assigned to the De Ruyter, then under the command of LtZ N. Maats. Three months later he was made lieutenant second class and posted to the torpedo service on board the torpedo training ship HNLMS Koningin Emma der Nederlanden. He then moved into submarines until the end of 1927, making some trips back to the Netherlands. In 1928, as lieutenant second class, he was made first officer on board the Brino and within a year rose to lieutenant first class.

The name is derived from a hunting stand, from which the surrounding countryside could be scanned for game. Stand Old Hall, built on the highest point in Whitefield overlooking Pilkington Deer Park (now the junction of Stand Lane and Ringley Road) was the manor house of the Pilkington family, Lords of the Manor of Pilkington and Bury. Stand Old Hall was replaced by Stand Hall around 1515 after the Earl of Derby took control of Pilkington. The old hall was converted into a barn and in the 19th century it became a shippon (cowshed). The old hall fell into disrepair and was demolished in the early 1960s. The view from Stand Hall was described in 1806. \\"The large town of Manchester spreads along the valley in front of the house at some miles distance, and the less one of Bury is seen distinctly to the left, surrounded by villages, with simple cottages dispersed along the plain. The hills of Lancashire, Derbyshire, Cheshire, and Yorkshire rising in succession, spread in a vast amphitheatre, till lost in the immensity of space; while the rugged tops of the Welsh mountains, which I gazed upon as old friends, hide their heads in the clouds, of which they seem to form a part.... The neighbourhood abounds with families of immense wealth, and reminds me of what Clapham Common is to London. The villas of the gentry are handsome, and their pleasure grounds are tastefully laid out. The rich woods and green park of Heaton House, the seat of the Earl of Wilton, appear from the terrace of Stand Hall to much advantage; but the most prominent feature in this landscape is the pretty church of Prestwich.\\" All Saints' Church on Church Lane is a Grade I Listed Anglican parish church designed by Charles Barry and built between 1821 and 1826. Stand Grammar School was founded in 1688 under the will of Henry Siddall and had close connections with the Unitarian Chapel in Ringley Road. The school ran into financial difficulties in the early 20th century and was taken over by Lancashire Education Committee in 1908. A new school was built on Church Lane on seven acres of land bought from the Earl of Derby and opened on 6 September 1913. When the new building was opened the Old Standians Association put up a memorial to the school's distinguished former pupil, Robert Clive, who became 1st Baron Clive, also known as \\"Clive of India\\". The school catered for both boys and girls until 1937 when a separate girls' school was opened on Higher Lane. The boys' school continued to develop with 700 pupils on roll and eventually became part of Bury College and was demolished in 2001. The alternative rock band Elbow met whilst studying at Stand College in the 1990s. Stand Grammar School for Girls on Higher lane was later renamed Philips High School and is now a comprehensive school and specialist maths and computing college.

It was begun about the year 313,Aaron P. Johnson, Ethnicity and Argument in Eusebius' Praeparatio evangelica (2006), p. 11. and attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over pagan religions and philosophies. It was dedicated to Bishop Theodotus of Laodicea.. Contents The Praeparatio consists of fifteen books completely preserved. Eusebius considered it an introduction to Christianity for pagans, but its value for many later readers is more because Eusebius included information from historians and philosophers not preserved elsewhere. Much of what Eusebius reports about philosophy he copied from the works of the Peripatetic philosopher Aristocles of Messene. Among the most important of these otherwise lost works are: * Excerpts from Timon of Phlius' book Python including what is known as the Aristocles Passage in which Pyrrho summarizes his new philosophy of Pyrrhonism, and which represents a translation of the Buddhist three marks of existence into ancient Greek. * A summary of the writings of the Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon; its accuracy has been shown by the mythological accounts found on the Ugaritic tables. * The account of Euhemerus's wondrous voyage to the island of Panchaea, where Euhemerus purports to have found his true history of the gods, which was taken from Diodorus Siculus's sixth book. * Excerpts from the writings of the Platonist philosopher Atticus. * Excerpts from the writings of the Middle Platonist philosopher Numenius of Apamea. * Excerpts from the works of Porphyry, the Neoplatonist critic of Christianity (\\"On Images\\", \\"Philosophy from Oracles\\" \\"Letter to Anebo\\", \\"Against the Christians\\", \\"Against Boethus\\", \\"Philological Lecture\\"). * Excerpts from the Book of the Laws of the Countries (also known as the Dialogue on Fate) by the early Christian author Bardaisan of Edessa, the Syriac original of which was not discovered until the 19th century. Influence This work was used by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463‚Äì1494) as a resource for his well-known oration A Speech by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Prince of Concord. Meaning of \\"praeparatio evangelica\\" The term also denotes an early church doctrine, praeparatio evangelica, meaning a preparation of the gospel among cultures yet to hear of the message of Christ. \\"[Early Christians] argued that God had already sowed the older cultures with ideas and themes that would grow to fruition once they were interpreted in a fully Christian context.\\" Philip Jenkins, The Next Christendom, (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2002), 122. Eusebius' own Praeparatio Evangelica does not adopt the common notion (which occurs at least as early as Clement of Alexandria) of Greek philosophy as a \\"preparation for the Gospel.\\" Eusebius instead offers a lengthy argument for the wisdom of the ancient Hebrews becoming a preparation for Greek philosophy (at least Platonic philosophy, see Praep.ev. 11-13). For Eusebius, the Greeks stole any truths they possessed from the more ancient Hebrews. References External links * Evangelicae praeparationis libri XV - Tomus I, by E. H.

Family The son of Arthur Goddard (-1884),Rochester, The Bendigo Advertiser, (Monday, 14 January 1884), p.3. and Matilda Goddard, n√©e Clark, William George Goddard was born at Corop, Victoria on 24 February 1880. Football WAFL A late-comer to VFL football, Goddard played a game for South Fremantle in 1900 and spent five years at North Fremantle before going to Victoria; and, in June 1903, he was suspended for entering the opposition's change rooms after the match and assaulting one of its players.Football, The West Australian, (Thursday, 25 June 1903), p.6. He had previously visited the eastern state in 1904 when he toured with the Western Australian interstate football team. VFL (South Melbourne) Goddard, who was a centreman, performed well in his first season at South Melbourne but missed out on a place in their 1907 Grand Final team. He played fourteen games for South Melbourne in 1908. Application for clearance (1909) In 1909, having played in all of South Melbourne's pre-season practice games, yet not having been being selected to play, and \\"[having] seen a couple of the Carlton players who told him that he could get a game\\" and \\"[having seen] one of the committee, and [having] decided to apply for a clearance\\", Goddard took the extraordinary step of independently applying for an (unsolicited) clearance to Carlton.Migratory Footballers: A Peculiar case, The Argus, (Thursday, 20 May 1909), p.5. The VFL Permit Committee (the chairman was C.N. Hickey, also secretary of the Fitzroy Football Club) met on 19 May 1909, and considered Goddard's request. An in camera discussion (the press excluded) was held between the Committee, Goddard, Jack Worrall, the Carlton delegate, and Henry Hawkins Skinner,Geoff Browne, \\"Skinner, Henry Hawkins (1851‚Äì1912)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1988, accessed online 15 October 2018. the South Melbourne delegate. Noting that, although South Melbourne had agreed to release Goddard ‚Äì having informed Goddard \\"that he will not be selected in our team as we do not considered him good enough as a player\\" ‚Äì it also noted that Jack Worrall stated that \\"This application has been made without the consent of my committee, and I further wish to state the committee do not desire the services of Mr. Goddard\\". The Committee refused his application;Victorian League: Permit Business, The Age, (Thursday, 20 May 1909), p.8. and, \\"in answer to a question by Goddard as to whether he could apply to go to another club, [the Committee] said, \\"Your clearance is not sufficient to entitle you to a permit to play with any club\\".\\"Notes, The (Kalgoorlie) Sun, (Sunday, 6 June 1909), p.3. As a consequence, Goddard did not play anywhere at all in the VFL in 1909; and, although there was talk of him possibly going to play with Prahran in the VFA,For example, \\"Rumour says that Goddard, the South Melbournite, will be seen in the uniform of the two blues before long\\" (Chat, The Prahran Telegraph, (Saturday, 8 May 1909), p.2.) there is no evidence of him ever having done so. VFL (Carlton) He was granted a clearance from South Melbourne to Carlton in 1910;Victorian League Permit Committee, The Age, (Saturday, 7 May 1910), p.14. and played there as a defender. In a tumultuous season for Carlton, which began with the sacking of coach Jack Worrall and ended with two players (Doug Fraser and Alex Lang) suspended for taking bribes, Carlton still managed to make the Grand Final. Goddard played at back pocket in the 1910 Grand Final, in which Carlton lost to Collingwood by 14 points. VFL (St Kilda) In 1911, he crossed to St Kilda, with whom he played seven senior games. WAFL Goddard continued to play in the WAFL well into his 30s and was a member of East Fremantle's 1914 premiership side. His final season was in 1918 (at the age of 38); and only an injury stopped him from ending his career with another premiership, with East Fremantle winning that year's Grand Final. Death He died at Fremantle on 26 August 1939.Deaths: Goddard, The West Australian, (Monday, 28 August 1939), p.1.

Twelve human lives were lost, along with one million sheep, thousands of cattle and countless native animals. \\"The temperature became torrid, and on the morning of the 6th of February 1851, the air which blew down from the north resembled the breath of a furnace. A fierce wind arose, gathering strength and velocity from hour to hour, until about noon it blew with the violence of a tornado. By some inexplicable means it wrapped the whole country in a sheet of flame ‚Äî fierce, awful, and irresistible.\\"Picturesque Atlas of Australasia published in 1886 Causes The Black Thursday bushfires, were caused in part by an intense drought that occurred throughout 1850 when the continent suffered from extreme heat. On 6 February 1851, a strong furnace-like wind came down from the north and gained power and speed as the hours passed. It is believed that the disaster began in Plenty Ranges when a couple of bullock drivers left logs burning unattended, which set fire to long, dry grass affected by the recent drought. The year preceding the fires was exceptionally hot and dry and this trend continued into 1851. The primary cause of catastrophic bush fires during this period lies in a poor understanding of local fire regimes and in inappropriate landscape management by settlers. Aboriginal people had managed these areas for tens of thousands of years, using fire-stick farming to clear out fuel build up and maintain tracts of walkable land and hunting grounds. Their displacement by Europeans meant a complete regime shift in the ecology of the Australian bush with the result that tremendous fires become possible. Conditions and progress The weather reached record extremes. By eleven it was about in the shade. The air cooled to by one o'clock and rose to around four o‚Äôclock. Survivors claimed the air was so full of smoke and heat that their lungs seemed to collapse. The air was so dark it made the roads seem bright. Pastures and plains became shrivelled wastelands: water-holes disappeared, creeks dried up, and trees turned into combustible timber. Clouds of smoke filled the air; forests and ranges became one large \\"sheet of flames\\". The hot north wind was so strong that thick black smoke reached northern Tasmania, creating a murky mist, resembling a combination of smoke and fog.Maitland Mercury, and Hunter River General Advertiser (Tasmania), Saturday 22 February 1851 Homes, crops and gardens were consumed by the rushing fire leaving a quarter of Victoria in a heap of desolate ruins. The community fled to water to escape the suffocating air around them, returning after everything was over to the sight of \\"blackened homesteads\\" and the charred bodies of animals that could not escape. The weather at sea was even \\"more fearful than on shore\\". The intense heat could be felt out to sea where a ship came under burning ember attack and was covered in cinders and dust. Eventually, a southerly breeze and light rain cooled the surface.

The catastrophic fire caused the loss of human life, cattle, and land for miles and affected many regions including Portland, Plenty Ranges, Western Port,Empire, Sydney 19 Feb 1851 the Wimmera and Dandenong districts, Gippsland, and Mount Macedon. Farms across the region were destroyed, along with a number of settlements in Gippsland, Western Port, Geelong, Heidelberg and east to Diamond Creek and Dandenong. Three men from Mount Macedon lost their lives. Overall, the disaster resulted in the death of twelve people, one million sheep, and thousands of cattle over . The initial response to the calamity was a public meeting held on 11 February 1851 at Geelong. The community came together to discuss relief efforts for those affected, especially for citizens who lost everything. To assist the poor, many even cancelled outstanding debts. Ecology Burnt bases of Eucalyptus tenuiramis in dry sclerophyll forest Intense bushfires are not uncommon in southern Australia. The region is one of the three most fire-prone in the world. Within the last two hundred years, the area has experienced and documented at least twenty-five major fires, beginning with Black Thursday in 1851. The intensity of these fires is due in part to natural fuels, such as sclerophyll forests in the region. While adapting to cope with drought and predators, the trees' leaves turn into prime fuel for fires. They become tough as protection from dry conditions and to increase the efficiency of nutrient use. They also develop tough spikes and chemicals to protect themselves from small animals. The leaves' tough surface allows them to last longer and build up on the forest floor and the chemical makes them flammable.. The abundance of flammable fuel can cause an inferno with a single spark. The area's disturbance regime has shaped the landscape by causing the plant communities to evolve and develop mechanisms to aid in speedy recovery. The native species of the Australian bush, for example, have developed post fire seed release and smoke exposure germination. Other plants, such as acacia, eucalyptus, and Monotoca elliptica have adapted to survive in dry, nutrient poor soil. Acacia oncinocarpa and Eucalyptus miniata, for example, and perennial herbs all have adaptive mechanisms that enable them to live in fire-prone areas of Australia. Both the acacia (a small spreading shrub) and eucalyptus (an overstorey tree) can regenerate from seeds and vegetatively regenerate new shoots from buds that escape fire. Reproduction and seed fall occur during the eight dry months. Due to the area's frequent fires, the seeds are usually released onto a recently burnt seed bed. Perennial herbs survive fire by avoidance. They make up the understorey and grow during seasons with lower temperatures and more rainfall. By dying back in the summer they avoid most fires. During a fire, they have a bulb or root mass that lives underground, and only the dead stems and leaves burn, so the plant survives and begins to grow again the following year.

The school, with a five or sometimes six-year program, was continued in 1968 as VWO. The last HBS diplomas were given out in 1974. History The HBS is a mid-19th century creation by the liberal politician Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, and resulted from the law on secondary education enacted in May 1863. Along with the creation of burgerscholen in each city of more than 10,000 inhabitants, the HBS was intended as a practically oriented education for higher functions in industry and trade. It was explicitly not intended as a sufficient education to enter university. According to historian Hans Verhage the form \\"hogere-burgerschool\\" (the hyphen indicating that hogere, \\"higher\\", modifies burger, \\"citizen\\") is linguistically correct, since it was a schooling system geared toward higher- ranked citizens, and not a higher school for all citizens. The law called for at least fifteen such (non-denominational) schools; where those would be placed soon became a matter of contention. The most famous of controversies (the H.B.S. kwestie) concerned the province of Limburg, which had only been part of the Netherlands since 1839. Maastricht, Limburg's capital, was the only city with more than 10,000 citizens, but the city refused since it preferred having a municipal rather than a government-run school, which allowed it control over the hiring and firing of teachers. Thorbecke, however, wanted a HBS in Limburg, since that would also strengthen the bonds between the (new) province and the central government: the HBS was to train the new national elite, and could thus aid in nation building. When Maastricht turned the HBS down, Roermond was proposed, where the local clergy feared that a HBS would damage enrollment at the local Catholic college, and the city council hastened to adjudicate the intended buildings to that college. A private letter from Thorbecke demanding the buildings be offered to the HBS was made public, leading to public outcry: at its heart, the conflict touched the special status of denominational education, and an additional source of anger was the government's raising of taxes in the province to bring it in line with taxes in other provinces. The HBS was founded in Roermond in 1864; the year after, Jan Augustus Paredis, bishop of Roermond, published an edict condemning \\"mixed\\" schools. Part of the innovative character of the HBS was that it offered a higher level of education without training in the classical languages (Latin and Greek). Graduating from the HBS did not officially grant access to the university system until 1917, and universities still required a \\"gymnasium\\" preparatory training for the humanities; still, the HBS facilitated access to universities in sciences and technology, even if illegally‚Äîuniversities had in fact accepted HBS grads with additional examinations. It was an \\"illegitimate but tolerated type of pre-university education\\". HBS in the Dutch East Indies The Dutch East Indies had a number of HBS institutions. There was one in Batavia (founded in 1864, named for William III of the Netherlands), one in Semarang, and one Surabaya; the latter is where the later Indonesian president Sukarno received his education and his introduction to Marxism References External links Category:Dutch words and phrases Category:Education in the Netherlands Category:Secondary education ","title":"Hogere Burgerschool"},{"id":"21590836","text":"Redwick could refer to: *Redwick, Newport, a village in south east Wales *Redwick, South Gloucestershire, a village in England ","title":"Redwick"},{"id":"21590848","text":"Osice () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Suchy DƒÖb, within Gda≈Ñsk County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

Life Edwards was born in about 1628 in Llansilin, Denbighshire, north Wales. He was elected to a Bible clerkship at All Souls College, Oxford in 1644, but it is unknown where he went to school. After being removed from the clerkship in 1648 by the Puritan visitors (who had taken charge of the university during the English Commonwealth), he was given a scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford later the same year and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1649. In his memoirs, An Afflicted Man's Testimony Concerning his Troubles (1691), he said that he had been promised a Fellowship but that this was denied because of his views on the rule of Oliver Cromwell. He left Oxford and, whatever his views might have been, he then became a preacher in Wales under the auspices of the approvers of the Act for the Better Propagation of the Gospel, and was given the sinecure living of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant in 1653. In 1657, he became assistant to the Commissioners for ejection of ministers in north Wales. He lost his living in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant after the Restoration, even though he swore allegiance to Charles II. He separated from his wife in 1666 and moved firstly to Oxford and then to London, where he published the works that made him a major figure in the literary history of Welsh Puritanism. In 1672, he was licensed as a general preacher in Oswestry, Shropshire but returned to London in 1675, where he helped to print Welsh religious books, both reprints of earlier translations and new editions of more recent works by leading writers, and also the 1677-78 edition of the Welsh Bible. He returned to Wales and started farming, with his memoirs being published in 1691. Nothing further is recorded of him after 1 July 1691, the last date in the memoirs. His death date and place, and burial site, are unknown.

The shows concern a variety of popular science issues, including from the field of astronomy, natural science and ethnography. The shows are displayed on a spherical screen surrounding the audience on all sides. Thanks to this solution, the audience experiences a feeling of immersion in the displayed world, which is strengthened by the high-quality sound system deployed around the dome. The Experiment! exhibition and other activities of the Centre Experiment! is the first exhibition to be organized by the Copernicus Science Centre. It made its premiere appearance at the Warsaw Science Picnic in June 2006, where more than 10,000 individuals visited it in a single day. Since September 2006, it has been traveling around large cities and small towns to give their residents an opportunity to try out the hands-on experiments on their own. The Copernicus Science Centre also organizes Family Workshops, where children (5‚Äì8 years old) together with their parents or carers can carry out experiments to help them better understand everyday phenomena (e.g. where the current in electrical outlets comes from, how a TV works, or why does yeast make dough rise). The children can easily repeat the experiments themselves at home. The Centre takes part in various events popularizing science: the Summer and Winter in the City events, Science Festivals and the Summer with Radio event. For teachers, the Copernicus Science Centre organizes trainings and competitions.

The building at 59 Brick Lane, on the corner of Fournier Street, has been home to a succession of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities since its construction in the mid-eighteenth century, reflecting the waves of immigration in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields. The former Great Synagogue is a Grade II* listed building; the adjacent former school buildings (now used as an ancillary building to the mosque) is listed Grade II.

The mosque can hold up to 3,200 (including women) Muslim Directory and is most crowded during the jummah prayers on Friday. All sermons are delivered in English, Arabic and Bengali. In terms of beliefs and practices, the mosque follows the traditions of Sunni Islam.

The Brick Lane Mosque was once known as the London Great Mosque, but much larger places of worship for Muslims in the capital opened in Regent's Park (the London Central Mosque, 1978) and then nearby Whitechapel Road (the East London Mosque, 1985). History of the building Detail of the sundial. The Latin motto, ' (\\"We are shadow\\"), is derived from Horace's ' (\\"We are dust and shadow\\"). The building has served the religions of a succession of other communities in the area. Christian It was first established in 1743 as a Protestant chapel (\\"La Neuve Eglise\\", i.e. \\"the New Church\\") by London's Huguenot community.Richard Jones (2006). Frommer's Memorable Walks in London. John Wiley and Sons. p. 93. These were refugees who had left France after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, to escape persecution by the Catholics. Many Huguenots settled in Spitalfields, bringing with them their silk-weaving and textile skills. As they were Protestant Dissenters, not members of the Church of England, they built their own chapels. Christ Church, Spitalfields on Fournier Street, designed by the architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, was built during the reign of Queen Anne to demonstrate the power of the established church.Fiona Rule (2008) The Worst Street in London. Hersham, Ian Allan: 28 59 Brick Lane survived as a Huguenot chapel for more than six decades. In 1809 it became a Wesleyan chapel, bought by the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews, an organisation now known as the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People, but this phase of its history lasted only 10 years. From 1819, the building became a Methodist chapel.Rob Humphreys, Judith Bamber (2003). London. Rough Guides. p. 238. Jewish In the late 19th century, the building was adopted by yet another community: it became the Machzike Hadath, the Spitalfields Great Synagogue. During this time (see History of the Jews in England), the area was home to many Jewish refugees from Russia and Central Europe.John Eade, Dyab Abou Jahjah, Saskia Sassen (2004). Identities on the Move. Counterpoint. p. 16. From the 1880s through the early part of the 20th century, massive pogroms and the May Laws in Russia caused many Jews to flee the Pale of Settlement. Of the East European Jewish emigrants, 140 000 settled in Britain.Godley, Andrew (2001) Enterprise and Culture. New York: Palgrave. Ch. 1. . From 1916, the synagogue's leader was the notable Abraham Isaac Kook, later the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of the British Mandatory Palestine. Nearby was the purpose-built Great Synagogue of London and another church building that had become a Jewish place of worship, the Sandys Row Synagogue. The population of Jews decreased over the years, with many moving to other parts of East London, to North London and elsewhere. The synagogue eventually moved to new premises in Golders Green.http://machzikehadath.com/history/ Muslim During the 1970s, the area of Spitalfields and Brick Lane was populated mainly by Bangladeshis who had come to Britain from the Sylhet region looking for better work. Many found work in factories and the textile trade. That growing community required a place of worship, and the building at 59 Brick Lane was bought and refurbished. In 1976, it reopened as a mosque, the London Jamme Masjid. Today, although it has been renamed, it still serves the Bangladeshi community as a mosque.59 Brick Lane: a History Icons of England.

Facts Mr Addis was Gramophone‚Äôs manager in Calcutta. In October 1905, he was given six months' notice of dismissal as legally required and appointed a successor. However, Gramophone also immediately took steps during this 6-month period to prevent Addis acting as manager, resulting in Addis leaving his job 2 months later and returning to England. This was humiliating. The jury awarded Addis ¬£340 for loss of commissions and ¬£600 for wrongful dismissal. Could there be damages for the manner of dismissal? The Court of Appeal had allowed damages for the manner of the dismissal. Submissions ;Duke KC and Groser, for the appellant. ;Lush KC (Schiller with him), for the respondents.

He was originally a gunsmith, apprenticed to William Soper, and together they had success manufacturing complex and highly accurate but slightly unreliable rifles. Warrick himself was a member of the Berkshire Volunteers and was an excellent marksman, using his medals and competition victories to promote the company. After some years the market in guns declined and Warrick turned his attention to the growing trade of bicycle manufacturing. He used both the Warrick and Monarch brands in their factory on Caversham Road, Reading. The factory lasted until the 1970s, passing on to William Warrick, his son. They exported bicycles, including supplying Orville and Wilbur Wright's cycle business. The company specialised in delivery and later motorized tricycles, especially for ice-cream and for food delivery although they did supply organisations such as the Army Cycle Corps and several department stores. One of their bicycles can be found in Reading Museum. Many were used by ice cream vendors in the mid-twentieth century, and requisitioned in the Second World War to act as aircraft simulators, with radio equipment in the ice cream box and with vision restricted so that they could only be driven by instructions. The trade mark on Warrick bicycles was a metal triangle on the top of the rear mudguard of the cycle. They also constructed batteries for electric cars and vans, although their early attempts at producing electric cars themselves were less successful. Whilst their factory was located on Caversham Road by Northfield Road, they ran a shop in Reading at 24 St Mary's Butts and on Edgware Road in London. In later years they stopped making bicycles and moved on to enamelling, electroplating and other contract work, including making some parts for the prototype of the Concorde aircraft.

Over the years this program has evolved and changed as other departments adopted it. History Pre 1960 San Jose had no formal training system. In the early 1960s they participated in a P.O.S.T. (Police Officer's Standardized Training), brief academy, initially utilizing an informal checklist. Lt. Robert Allen proposed an 8-week program in 1972 using the first DOR. In 1973 the program was overhauled and a department psychologist established the one (1) to seven (7) rating scale from ten thousand (10,000) behavioral descriptions from thirty-five hundred (3,500) D.O.R.s (Daily Observation Reports). In 1974 a questionnaire from seventy (70) FTOs established the rating criteria of a one (1), four (4) and seven (7) which was the basis of the Standard Evaluation Guidelines. Since San Jose the program has been modified, most notably by the Houston Police Department in the early 1980s, the Travis County Sheriff's Office in 1992, and the Reno Police Department via a DOJ Grant in the early 2000s. The Travis County Model as developed by then Sgt. Richard Whitehead has been modified and simplified again and is now known as the Whitehead model and affectionately known by its users as the \\"Common Sense\\" model. In 2018 Whitehead introduced software for its program users. Program Orientation The most critical time of the FTO program is the first few days. The new job creates stress as a result of change. The FTP is another step in the overall process. The trainee is the FTP key figure. The FTO Sergeant should contact the FTO and trainee once per shift. The San Jose model is a score based model (trainee scored every day during the program) versus Houston and Travis County/Whitehead models which separate Training phases from Evaluation phases, i.e. scoring only occurs during Evaluation. The Programs The San Jose Program should be seventy (70) days and fifty-five (55) D.O.R.s. There are four progressive phases. The D.O.R. is completed each day and the scores are discussed between the FTO and trainee. * Phase I consists of five (5) working days and is recorded as limbo time for the trainee. Limbo time does not count against the trainee and allows him/her time to observe his Field Training Officer. * Phase II consists of five (5) working days that the trainee will be evaluated by the senior Field Training Officer. * Phase III consists of five (5) days of shadow time. * Phase IV is divided into three (3) segments consisting of seven working days of which five (5) days require a completed D.O.R. * Phase V is the balance of the 365-day probationary period. Only phases two (2) and three (3) can be extended and only for twenty and five days respectively. A D.O.R. with a rating of one (1) for two (2) consecutive training days will be forwarded immediately to the FTO Commander. The program described above is a base program modeled after the San Jose FTEP. It is important to note that many departments have longer and very restrictive FTE programs. The San Jose is only a base model and many departments develop similar programs with the differences ranging from minimal to the very extensive. The Houston Program has seven phases: Phase 1‚Äì4 are Training Phase 5 is Evaluation Phase 6 is Remedial Training in any Performance Categories FAILED in Phase 5. Phase 7 is Final Evaluation Training is documented separately from evaluation in 16 Performance Categories. Checklist of required training topics. With lesson plan to be completed per phase. A trainee works at his/her own pace and level upon entering the program and is allowed to complete the entire program minus being a safety hazard. Heavy documentation of actual training performed to include specific strengths and weaknesses. Documentation is completed and reviewed with the trainee daily. Trainers cannot evaluate a trainee they trained. Must go through at least two evaluators for two different opinions of ability. Mandates a Termination Review Committee. Scoring is done on a scale of 1 to 5. All scores are defined. Trainers are trained in two job classifications as either instructors or evaluators. The Travis County (Whitehead) model is similar to Houston's except scoring is Pass/Fail. Uses 14 performance categories. The documentation is sufficient yet thorough and extremely defendable. Since 1992 it has never had a court challenge. The Whitehead model ~ Easily implementable and flexible to size of dept. (Length of Program & Phases) ~ 14 Performance Categories. ~ Checklist of required training topics and a per-phase lesson plan. ~ Trainee encouraged to do as much as capable. ~ Training documented separate from Evaluation (Ghost). No scores during training, but mechanisms in place for removal if NRT. (Focus is on training not a score.) ~ When documentation contains specific deficient behavior it must also include the specific remedial training done and the trainee‚Äôs response to that training. (Highly acclaimed by program users.) ~ Documentation tracks types of incidents trainee has been exposed to so program managers can make adjustments to call exposure as program progresses. ~ During Evaluation (Ghost) Scoring is Pass / Fail. This critical decision takes at least 2 Evaluators (FTO‚Äôs) to determine. ~ Scores are clearly defined. ~ Training Review Committee mandated as part of a Checks and Balance system. The Whitehead model has been modified and used: New Supervisors, Corrections, Communications, Fire/EMS, SWAT, etc. Next we will discuss why FTEP programs are valuable. Value of the FTEP The FTEP / FTOP is a court tested and E.E.O.C. consistent program because it is part of the selection process. (Job related tasks) It is a test with the selection process. A good test is both credible and job related. Legal considerations The Commission On Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA), requires that any agencies seeking accreditation must conduct formal field training, as do many state accreditation processes. A good FTOP reduces civil litigation alleging negligent hiring and retention of trainees. It is a cost-effective way of eliminating non-effective, non-productive personnel. FTO (Field Training Officer) The FTO is usually a senior officer within the department that has been trained in the FTP. The FTO's duties consist of training and evaluating the trainee. He is responsible for explaining policy and procedure. He provides orientation to the trainee within their jurisdiction. He encourages self-initiated activity as well as good driving habits. The FTO is responsible for testing the trainee verbally and through written test. He is required to complete, document and discuss the scores from the DOR with the trainee. The FTO must provide remedial training for the trainee if it is necessary. On May 25, 2020 a video showing Minneapolis citizen George Floyd being choked to death by 19 year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department, Derek Chauvin went viral. The two officers who held down Floyd's arms and legs defended themselves from criticisms they should have stopped Chauvin from killing Floyd by pointing out this was their first week on the job, and Chauvin was their training officer. D.O.R. (Daily Observation Report) The San Jose DOR is a sheet that is completed by the FTO and then scored at the end of the shift. The report is scored on a sliding scale between the numbers of 1 and 7. A 1 is unacceptable and a 7 is exceptional. The DOR encompasses 29 grade-able task (performance categories) depending on the departments program. Some of the task include, Appearance, Attitude, Knowledge, Performance and Relationships. Each task category may have several sub-categories. The Houston DOR's are separated Training/Evaluation. Scoring on a 1‚Äì5 scale only occurs during Evaluation Phases. Documentation of the training that is occurring is documented on both. The Travis County/Whitehead models are similar to Houston and scoring is Pass/Fail. Houston and TCSO use 16 performance categories and Whitehead uses 14. FTO program use by other professions FTO programs (sometimes called FTEP, FTP, probationary program, or other names) are a relatively new concept in Emergency Medical Services (E.M.S.). Many EMS medical directors are mandating a formal orientation process that is more robust and comprehensive than the credentialing process typically seen in hospital organizations. This is particularly true of agencies that perform \\"High Risk/Low Frequency\\" skills that are subject to increased scrutiny. As a result, there are a number of EMS agencies who are adapting law enforcement FTO programs to new EMS providers. EMS programs are unique in that they have both public safety and medical concerns and parameters, and also work dramatically different schedules than normally seen in law enforcement. EMS agencies often struggle to integrate clinical parameters into the law enforcement model of evaluation. As a result, there are significantly more variation in programs than commonly seen in Law Enforcement. That said, agencies that have successfully integrated and developed and FTO program have better retention, performance, and accountability.

The refinery has two processing modules with a nominal capacity of 6.5 million tonnes/year. Now only one of the two modules is operating with a capacity of 3.5 million tonnes/year or . The facility is connected by pipeline to the oil fields in the Oltenia Region and to the Port of Constan≈£a. The refinery produces around 60% of all the bitumen used in Romania. History Arpechim was founded in 1964 in a strategic industrial zone located in Southern Romania near Pite≈üti. In the same year the refinery built its first plant specialised in the production of carbon black. In 1967 another two distinct units were established, the Pite≈üti Refinery and the Petrochemical Complex () and the Thermal Power Station (). In 1971 the refinery was integrated with the Petrochemical Complex. In 1997 the state established Petrom as the national oil company also including the Arpechim Refinery. In 1999 Arpechim becomes the first refinery in Europe to produce and export diesel with a reduced sulfur content. In 2005 the refinery concludes the building of a new gasoil hydrotreater and new hydrogen plant. In 2007, Petrom started negotiations with Oltchim (a major petrochemical company in Romania) for the sale of the petrochemical sector from the Arpechim Refinery. The two companies agreed on the transaction and Oltchim had to pay around US$ 150 million to close the deal. On February 17, 2009, Petrom decided to sell the petrochemical sector of the Arpechim Refinery to Oltchim for the price of 1 euro (US$ 1.25), but the buying company has to invest US$ 140 million in the sector due to contract clauses.

Pollens Aeroallergens include the pollens of specific seasonal plants is commonly known as \\"hay fever\\", because it is most prevalent during haying season, from late May to the end of June in the Northern Hemisphere; but it is possible to suffer from hay fever throughout the year. The pollen which causes hay fever varies from person to person and from region to region; generally speaking, the tiny, hardly visible pollens of wind-pollinated plants are the predominant cause. Pollens of insect-pollinated plants are too large to remain airborne and pose no risk. Examples of plant pollen commonly responsible for hay fever include: * Trees: such as birch (Betula), alder (Alnus), cedar (Cedrus), hazel (Corylus), hornbeam (Carpinus), horse chestnut (Aesculus), willow (Salix), poplar (Populus), plane (Platanus), linden/lime (Tilia) and olive (Olea). In northern latitudes birch is considered to be the most important allergenic tree pollen, with an estimated 15‚Äì20% of hay fever sufferers sensitive to birch pollen grains. Olive pollen is most predominant in Mediterranean regions. * Grasses (Family Poaceae): especially ryegrass (Lolium sp.) and timothy (Phleum pratense). An estimated 90% of hay fever sufferers are allergic to grass pollen. * Weeds: ragweed (Ambrosia), plantain (Plantago), nettles/parietaria (Urticaceae), mugwort (Artemisia), Fat hen (Chenopodium) and sorrel/dock (Rumex) The time of year at which hay fever symptoms manifest themselves varies greatly depending on the types of pollen to which an allergic reaction is produced. The pollen count, in general, is highest from mid-spring to early summer. As most pollens are produced at fixed periods in the year, a long-term hay fever sufferer may also be able to anticipate when the symptoms are most likely to begin and end, although this may be complicated by an allergy to dust particles. Spores Spores being ejected by fungi In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures, which travel through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as hydrophobins, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of osmolytes in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 g. Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by puffballs. Foodstuffs It is thought that peanuts and other allergic foodstuffs may become airborne, thus triggering allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, especially children.The Michael C.

However, one report notes: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a rare and heterogeneous condition characterized by patchy or diffuse eosinophilic infiltration of gastrointestinal (GI) tissue, first described by Kaijser in 1937.Kaijser R. Zur Kenntnis der allergischen Affektionen des Verdauugskanals vom Standpunkt des Chirurgen aus. Arch Klin Chir 1937; 188:36‚Äì64. Aeroallergens can cause EG. The stomach is the organ most commonly affected, followed by the small intestine and the colon. As a part of host defense mechanism, eosinophil is normally present in gastrointestinal mucosa, though finding in deeper tissue is almost always pathologic. What triggers such dense infiltration in EG is not clear. It is possible that different pathogenetic mechanisms of disease is involved in several subgroups of patients. Food allergy and variable IgE response to food substances has been observed in some patients which implies role of hypersensitive response in pathogenesis. Many patients indeed have history of other atopic conditions like eczema, asthma etc. Eosinophil recruitment into inflammatory tissue is a complex process, regulated by a number of inflammatory cytokines. In EG cytokines IL-3, IL-5 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may be behind the recruitment and activation. They have been observed immunohistochemically in diseased intestinal wall. In addition eotaxin has been shown to have an integral role in regulating the homing of eosinophils into the lamina propria of stomach and small intestine. In the allergic subtype of disease, it is thought that food allergens cross the intestinal mucosa and trigger an inflammatory response that includes mast cell degranulation and recruitment of eosinophils. EG is \\"managed\\" (treated) with corticosteroids, with a 90% response rate in some studies. Various steroid sparing agents e.g. sodium cromoglycate (a stabilizer of mast cell membranes), ketotifen (an antihistamine), and montelukast (a selective, competitive leukotriene receptor antagonist) have been proposed, centering on an allergic hypothesis, with mixed results. An elimination diet may be successful if a limited number of food allergies are identified.

It is an alternative to the hypothesis of dark matter in terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently understood laws of physics. Created in 1982 and first published in 1983 by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom,. . . the hypothesis' original motivation was to explain why the velocities of stars in galaxies were observed to be larger than expected based on Newtonian mechanics. Milgrom noted that this discrepancy could be resolved if the gravitational force experienced by a star in the outer regions of a galaxy was proportional to the square of its centripetal acceleration (as opposed to the centripetal acceleration itself, as in Newton's second law), or alternatively if gravitational force came to vary inversely with radius (as opposed to the inverse square of the radius, as in Newton's law of gravity). In MOND, violation of Newton's laws occurs at extremely small accelerations, characteristic of galaxies yet far below anything typically encountered in the Solar System or on Earth. MOND is an example of a class of theories known as modified gravity, and is an alternative to the hypothesis that the dynamics of galaxies are determined by massive, invisible dark matter halos. Since Milgrom's original proposal, proponents of MOND have claimed to successfully predict a variety of galactic phenomena that they state are difficult to understand as consequences of dark matter. However, MOND and its generalisations do not adequately account for observed properties of galaxy clusters, and no satisfactory cosmological model has been constructed from the hypothesis. The accurate measurement of the speed of gravitational waves compared to the speed of light in 2017 ruled out many theories which used modified gravity to rule out dark matter. However, both Milgrom's bi-metric formulation of MOND and nonlocal MOND are not ruled out according to the same study.  Overview  M33Data are from: Several independent observations point to the fact that the visible mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters is insufficient to account for their dynamics, when analysed using Newton's laws. This discrepancy ‚Äì known as the \\"missing mass problem\\" ‚Äì was first identified for clusters by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky in 1933 (who studied the Coma cluster), and subsequently extended to include spiral galaxies by the 1939 work of Horace Babcock on Andromeda. These early studies were augmented and brought to the attention of the astronomical community in the 1960s and 1970s by the work of Vera Rubin at the Carnegie Institute in Washington, who mapped in detail the rotation velocities of stars in a large sample of spirals. While Newton's Laws predict that stellar rotation velocities should decrease with distance from the galactic centre, Rubin and collaborators found instead that they remain almost constant ‚Äì the rotation curves are said to be \\"flat\\". This observation necessitates at least one of the following: :{- valign=\\"top\\" (1)  There exists in galaxies large quantities of unseen matter which boosts the stars' velocities beyond what would be expected on the basis of the visible mass alone, or - valign=\\"top\\" (2)  Newton's Laws do not apply to galaxies. } Option (1) leads to the dark matter hypothesis; option (2) leads to MOND. MOND was proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983 The basic premise of MOND is that while Newton's laws have been extensively tested in high- acceleration environments (in the Solar System and on Earth), they have not been verified for objects with extremely low acceleration, such as stars in the outer parts of galaxies. This led Milgrom to postulate a new effective gravitational force law (sometimes referred to as \\"Milgrom's law\\") that relates the true acceleration of an object to the acceleration that would be predicted for it on the basis of Newtonian mechanics. This law, the keystone of MOND, is chosen to reduce to the Newtonian result at high acceleration but leads to different (\\"deep-MOND\\") behaviour at low acceleration: Here is the Newtonian force, is the object's (gravitational) mass, is its acceleration, () is an as-yet unspecified function (called the interpolating function), and is a new fundamental constant which marks the transition between the Newtonian and deep-MOND regimes. Agreement with Newtonian mechanics requires :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mu(x) \\\\longrightarrow 1 && \\\\text{ for } x \\\\gg 1 \\\\end{align} ~, and consistency with astronomical observations requires :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mu(x) \\\\longrightarrow x && \\\\text{ for } x \\\\ll 1 \\\\end{align} ~. Beyond these limits, the interpolating function is not specified by the hypothesis, although it is possible to weakly constrain it empirically. Two common choices are the \\"simple interpolating function\\": : \\\\mu\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{\\\\, a_0 \\\\,} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\; 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\, a_0 \\\\,}{a} \\\\;} ~, and the \\"standard interpolating function\\": : \\\\mu\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{\\\\, a_0 \\\\,} \\\\right) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\; 1 + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\, a_0 \\\\,}{a} \\\\right)^2 \\\\;}~} ~. Thus, in the deep-MOND regime ( ‚â™ ): : F_\\\\text{N} = m \\\\frac{\\\\, a^2 \\\\,}{\\\\, a_0 \\\\,} ~. Applying this to an object of mass in circular orbit around a point mass (a crude approximation for a star in the outer regions of a galaxy), we find: that is, the star's rotation velocity is independent of , its distance from the centre of the galaxy ‚Äì the rotation curve is flat, as required. By fitting his law to rotation curve data, Milgrom found \\\\, a_0 \\\\approx 1.2 \\\\times 10^{-10} \\\\mathrm{ms}^{-2} \\\\, to be optimal. This simple law is sufficient to make predictions for a broad range of galactic phenomena. Milgrom's law can be interpreted in two different ways: * One possibility is to treat it as a modification to the classical law of inertia (Newton's second law), so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle's acceleration but rather to \\\\,\\\\mu\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{\\\\, a_0 \\\\,} \\\\right) a \\\\,. In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other forces, for example electromagnetism. * Alternatively, Milgrom's law can be viewed as leaving Newton's Second Law intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass due to another of mass is roughly of the form \\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\, G M m \\\\,}{\\\\mu\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{a_0} \\\\right) r^2} ~. In this interpretation, Milgrom's modification would apply exclusively to gravitational phenomena. By itself, Milgrom's law is not a complete and self-contained physical theory, but rather an ad-hoc empirically motivated variant of one of the several equations that constitute classical mechanics. Its status within a coherent non-relativistic hypothesis of MOND is akin to Kepler's Third Law within Newtonian mechanics; it provides a succinct description of observational facts, but must itself be explained by more fundamental concepts situated within the underlying hypothesis. Several complete classical hypotheses have been proposed (typically along \\"modified gravity\\" as opposed to \\"modified inertia\\" lines), which generally yield Milgrom's law exactly in situations of high symmetry and otherwise deviate from it slightly. A subset of these non-relativistic hypotheses have been further embedded within relativistic theories, which are capable of making contact with non-classical phenomena (e.g., gravitational lensing) and cosmology. Distinguishing both theoretically and observationally between these alternatives is a subject of current research. The majority of astronomers, astrophysicists, and cosmologists accept dark matter as the explanation for galactic rotation curves Kroupa asserts that the majority opinion is wrong, and that empirical evidence rules out the ŒõCDM model. (based on general relativity, and hence Newtonian mechanics), and are committed to a dark matter solution of the missing-mass problem. MOND, by contrast, is actively studied by only a handful of researchers. The primary difference between supporters of ŒõCDM and MOND is in the observations for which they demand a robust, quantitative explanation, and those for which they are satisfied with a qualitative account, or are prepared to leave for future work. Proponents of MOND emphasize predictions made on galaxy scales (where MOND enjoys its most notable successes) and believe that a cosmological model consistent with galaxy dynamics has yet to be discovered. Proponents of ŒõCDM require high levels of cosmological accuracy (which concordance cosmology provides) and argue that a resolution of galaxy-scale issues will follow from a better understanding of the complicated baryonic astrophysics underlying galaxy formation.  Observational evidence for MOND  Since MOND was specifically designed to produce flat rotation curves, these do not constitute evidence for the hypothesis, but every matching observation adds to support of the empirical law. Nevertheless, proponents claim that a broad range of astrophysical phenomena at the galactic scale are neatly accounted for within the MOND framework.M. Milgrom (2013), \\"MOND Laws of Galaxy Dynamics\\", Many of these came to light after the publication of Milgrom's original papers and are difficult to explain using the dark matter hypothesis. The most prominent are the following: * In addition to demonstrating that rotation curves in MOND are flat, equation 2 provides a concrete relation between a galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas) and its asymptotic rotation velocity. Observationally, this is known as the baryonic Tully‚ÄìFisher relation (BTFR),S. S. McGaugh, J. M. Schombert, G. D. Bothun,2 and W. J.

McGaugh (2011), \\"The Baryonic Tully- Fisher Relation of Gas-Rich Galaxies as a Test of ŒõCDM and MOND\\", ApJ, * Milgrom's law fully specifies the rotation curve of a galaxy given only the distribution of its baryonic mass. In particular, MOND predicts a far stronger correlation between features in the baryonic mass distribution and features in the rotation curve than does the dark matter hypothesis (since dark matter dominates the galaxy's mass budget and is conventionally assumed not to closely track the distribution of baryons). Such a tight correlation is claimed to be observed in several spiral galaxies, a fact which has been referred to as \\"Renzo's rule\\". * Since MOND modifies Newtonian dynamics in an acceleration-dependent way, it predicts a specific relationship between the acceleration of a star at any radius from the centre of a galaxy and the amount of unseen (dark matter) mass within that radius that would be inferred in a Newtonian analysis. This is known as the \\"mass discrepancy-acceleration relation\\", and has been measured observationally.R. Sanders, \\"Mass discrepancies in galaxies: dark matter and alternatives\\", The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review 1990, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp 1-28S. McGaugh (2004), \\"The Mass Discrepancy-Acceleration Relation: Disk Mass and the Dark Matter Distribution\\", ApJ, One aspect of the MOND prediction is that the mass of the inferred dark matter go to zero when the stellar centripetal acceleration becomes greater than a0, where MOND reverts to Newtonian mechanics. In dark matter hypothesis, it is a challenge to understand why this mass should correlate so closely with acceleration, and why there appears to be a critical acceleration above which dark matter is not required. * Both MOND and dark matter halos stabilise disk galaxies, helping them retain their rotation- supported structure and preventing their transformation into elliptical galaxies. In MOND, this added stability is only available for regions of galaxies within the deep-MOND regime (i.e., with a < a0), suggesting that spirals with a > a0 in their central regions should be prone to instabilities and hence less likely to survive to the present day.M. A. Jimenez and X. Hernandez (2014), \\"Local galactic disk stability under MONDian gravity\\", This may explain the \\"Freeman limit\\" to the observed central surface mass density of spiral galaxies, which is roughly a0/G. This scale must be put in by hand in dark matter-based galaxy formation models. * Particularly massive galaxies are within the Newtonian regime (a > a0) out to radii enclosing the vast majority of their baryonic mass. At these radii, MOND predicts that the rotation curve should fall as 1/r, in accordance with Kepler's Laws. In contrast, from a dark matter perspective one would expect the halo to significantly boost the rotation velocity and cause it to asymptote to a constant value, as in less massive galaxies. Observations of high-mass ellipticals bear out the MOND prediction. * In MOND, all gravitationally bound objects with a < a0 ‚Äì regardless of their origin ‚Äì should exhibit a mass discrepancy when analysed using Newtonian mechanics, and should lie on the BTFR. Under the dark matter hypothesis, objects formed from baryonic material ejected during the merger or tidal interaction of two galaxies (\\"tidal dwarf galaxies\\") are expected to be devoid of dark matter and hence show no mass discrepancy. Three objects unambiguously identified as Tidal Dwarf Galaxies appear to have mass discrepancies in close agreement with the MOND prediction.F. Bournaud, P.-A. Duc, E. Brinks, M. Boquien, P. Amram, U. Lisenfeld, B. S. Koribalski, F. Walter, V. Charmandaris (2007), \\"Missing Mass in Collisional Debris from Galaxies\\", G. Gentile, B. Famaey, F. Combes, P. Kroupa, H. S. Zhao, O. Tiret (2007), \\"Tidal dwarf galaxies as a test of fundamental physics\\" P. Kroupa (2012), \\"The dark matter crisis: falsification of the current standard model of cosmology\\", * Recent work has shown that many of the dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way and Andromeda are located preferentially in a single plane and have correlated motions. This suggests that they may have formed during a close encounter with another galaxy and hence be Tidal Dwarf Galaxies. If so, the presence of mass discrepancies in these systems constitutes further evidence for MOND. In addition, it has been claimed that a gravitational force stronger than Newton's (such as Milgrom's) is required for these galaxies to retain their orbits over time.P. Kroupa (2014), \\"Lessons from the Local Group (and beyond) on dark matter\\",  Complete MOND hypotheses  Milgrom's law requires incorporation into a complete hypotheses if it is to satisfy conservation laws and provide a unique solution for the time evolution of any physical system. Each of the theories described here reduce to Milgrom's law in situations of high symmetry (and thus enjoy the successes described above), but produce different behaviour in detail.  Nonrelativistic  The first hypothesis of MOND (dubbed AQUAL) was constructed in 1984 by Milgrom and Jacob Bekenstein. AQUAL generates MONDian behaviour by modifying the gravitational term in the classical Lagrangian from being quadratic in the gradient of the Newtonian potential to a more general function. (AQUAL is an acronym for AQUAdratic Lagrangian.) In formulae: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{Newton} &= - \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi G} \\\\cdot \\\\ abla \\\\phi\\\\^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ [6pt] \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{AQUAL} &= - \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi G} \\\\cdot a_0^2 F \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\ abla \\\\phi\\\\^2}{a_0^2} \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} where \\\\phi is the standard Newtonian gravitational potential and F is a new dimensionless function. Applying the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations in the standard way then leads to a non-linear generalisation of the Newton‚ÄìPoisson equation: : abla\\\\cdot\\\\left[ \\\\mu \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\ abla\\\\phi \\\\right\\\\}{a_0} \\\\right) abla\\\\phi\\\\right] = 4\\\\pi G \\\\rho This can be solved given suitable boundary conditions and choice of F to yield Milgrom's law (up to a curl field correction which vanishes in situations of high symmetry). An alternative way to modify the gravitational term in the lagrangian is to introduce a distinction between the true (MONDian) acceleration field a and the Newtonian acceleration field aN. The Lagrangian may be constructed so that aN satisfies the usual Newton-Poisson equation, and is then used to find a via an additional algebraic but non-linear step, which is chosen to satisfy Milgrom's law. This is called the \\"quasi-linear formulation of MOND\\", or QUMOND,M. Milgrom (2010), \\"Quasi-linear formulation of MOND\\", and is particularly useful for calculating the distribution of \\"phantom\\" dark matter that would be inferred from a Newtonian analysis of a given physical situation. Both AQUAL and QUMOND propose changes to the gravitational part of the classical matter action, and hence interpret Milgrom's law as a modification of Newtonian gravity as opposed to Newton's second law. The alternative is to turn the kinetic term of the action into a functional depending on the trajectory of the particle. Such \\"modified inertia\\" theories, however, are difficult to use because they are time-nonlocal, require energy and momentum to be non- trivially redefined to be conserved, and have predictions that depend on the entirety of a particle's orbit.  Relativistic  In 2004, Jacob Bekenstein formulated TeVeS, the first complete relativistic hypothesis using MONDian behaviour. TeVeS is constructed from a local Lagrangian (and hence respects conservation laws), and employs a unit vector field, a dynamical and non- dynamical scalar field, a free function and a non-Einsteinian metric in order to yield AQUAL in the non-relativistic limit (low speeds and weak gravity). TeVeS has enjoyed some success in making contact with gravitational lensing and structure formation observations,T. Clifton, P. G. Ferreira, A. Padilla, C. Skordis (2011), \\"Modified Gravity and Cosmology\\", but faces problems when confronted with data on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background,See Slosar, Melchiorri and Silk the lifetime of compact objects, and the relationship between the lensing and matter overdensity potentials. Several alternative relativistic generalisations of MOND exist, including BIMOND and generalised Einstein-Aether theories. There is also a relativistic generalisation of MOND that assumes a Lorentz-type invariance as the physical basis of MOND phenomenology.M. Alzain, \\"MOND as a modification of Newtonian inertia\\",  The external field effect  In Newtonian mechanics, an object's acceleration can be found as the vector sum of the acceleration due to each of the individual forces acting on it. This means that a subsystem can be decoupled from the larger system in which it is embedded simply by referring the motion of its constituent particles to their centre of mass; in other words, the influence of the larger system is irrelevant for the internal dynamics of the subsystem. Since Milgrom's law is non-linear in acceleration, MONDian subsystems cannot be decoupled from their environment in this way, and in certain situations this leads to behaviour with no Newtonian parallel. This is known as the \\"external field effect\\" (EFE). The external field effect is best described by classifying physical systems according to their relative values of ain (the characteristic acceleration of one object within a subsystem due to the influence of another), aex (the acceleration of the entire subsystem due to forces exerted by objects outside of it), and a0: * a_{\\\\mathrm{in}} > a_0 : Newtonian regime * a_{\\\\mathrm{ex}} < a_{\\\\mathrm{in}} < a_0 : Deep-MOND regime * a_{\\\\mathrm{in}} < a_0 < a_{\\\\mathrm{ex}} : The external field is dominant and the behaviour of the system is Newtonian. * a_{\\\\mathrm{in}} < a_{\\\\mathrm{ex}} < a_0 : The external field is larger than the internal acceleration of the system, but both are smaller than the critical value. In this case, dynamics is Newtonian but the effective value of G is enhanced by a factor of a0/aex.S. McGaugh, The EFE in MOND The external field effect implies a fundamental break with the strong equivalence principle (but not necessarily the weak equivalence principle). The effect was postulated by Milgrom in the first of his 1983 papers to explain why some open clusters were observed to have no mass discrepancy even though their internal accelerations were below a0. It has since come to be recognised as a crucial element of the MOND paradigm. The dependence in MOND of the internal dynamics of a system on its external environment (in principle, the rest of the universe) is strongly reminiscent of Mach's principle, and may hint towards a more fundamental structure underlying Milgrom's law. In this regard, Milgrom has commented:M. Milgrom (2008), \\"The MOND paradigm\\", > It has been long suspected that local dynamics is strongly influenced by the > universe at large, a-la Mach's principle, but MOND seems to be the first to > supply concrete evidence for such a connection. This may turn out to be the > most fundamental implication of MOND, beyond its implied modification of > Newtonian dynamics and general relativity, and beyond the elimination of > dark matter. Indeed, the potential link between MONDian dynamics and the universe as a whole (that is, cosmology) is augmented by the observation that the value of a0 (determined by fits to internal properties of galaxies) is within an order of magnitude of cH0, where c is the speed of light and H0 is the Hubble constant (a measure of the present-day expansion rate of the universe). It is also close to the acceleration rate of the universe, and hence the cosmological constant. However, as yet no full hypothesis has been constructed which manifests these connections in a natural way.  Responses and criticism   Attempts to explain MOND phenomenology using dark matter  While acknowledging that Milgrom's law provides a succinct and accurate description of a range of galactic phenomena, many physicists reject the idea that classical dynamics itself needs to be modified and attempt instead to explain the law's success by reference to the behaviour of dark matter. Some effort has gone towards establishing the presence of a characteristic acceleration scale as a natural consequence of the behaviour of cold dark matter halos,M. Kaplinghat and M. Turner (2002), \\"How Cold Dark Matter Theory Explains Milgrom's Law\\", M. H. Chan (2013), \\"Reconciliation of MOND and Dark Matter theory\\", although Milgrom has argued that such arguments explain only a small subset of MOND phenomena.M. Milgrom (2002), \\"Do Modified Newtonian Dynamics Follow from the Cold Dark Matter Paradigm?\\", An alternative proposal is to modify the properties of dark matter (e.g., to make it interact strongly with itself or baryons) in order to induce the tight coupling between the baryonic and dark matter mass that the observations point to.J. Bullock (2014), Self- Interacting Dark Matter Finally, some researchers suggest that explaining the empirical success of Milgrom's law requires a more radical break with conventional assumptions about the nature of dark matter. One idea (dubbed \\"dipolar dark matter\\") is to make dark matter gravitationally polarisable by ordinary matter and have this polarisation enhance the gravitational attraction between baryons.L. Blanchet, \\"Gravitational polarization and the phenomenology of MOND\\", Class. Quantum Grav., 24, 3529‚Äì3539, (2007),  Outstanding problems for MOND  The most serious problem facing Milgrom's law is that it cannot completely eliminate the need for dark matter in all astrophysical systems: galaxy clusters show a residual mass discrepancy even when analysed using MOND. The fact that some form of unseen mass must exist in these systems detracts from the elegance of MOND as a solution to the missing mass problem, although the amount of extra mass required is a fifth that of a Newtonian analysis, and there is no requirement that the missing mass be non- baryonic. It has been speculated that 2 eV neutrinos could account for the cluster observations in MOND while preserving the hypothesis's successes at the galaxy scale. Indeed, analysis of sharp lensing data for the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 shows that MOND only becomes distinctive at Mpc distance from the center, so that Zwicky's conundrum remains , and 1.8 eV neutrinos are needed in clusters. The 2006 observation of a pair of colliding galaxy clusters known as the \\"Bullet Cluster\\", poses a significant challenge for all theories proposing a modified gravity solution to the missing mass problem, including MOND. Astronomers measured the distribution of stellar and gas mass in the clusters using visible and X-ray light, respectively, and in addition mapped the inferred dark matter density using gravitational lensing. In MOND, one would expect the \\"missing mass\\" to be centred on regions of visible mass which experience accelerations lower than a0 (assuming the external field effect is negligible). In ŒõCDM, on the other hand, one would expect the dark matter to be significantly offset from the visible mass because the halos of the two colliding clusters would pass through each other (assuming, as is conventional, that dark matter is collisionless), whilst the cluster gas would interact and end up at the centre. An offset is clearly seen in the observations. It has been suggested, however, that MOND-based models may be able to generate such an offset in strongly non-spherically-symmetric systems, such as the Bullet Cluster. Several other studies have noted observational difficulties with MOND. For example, it has been claimed that MOND offers a poor fit to the velocity dispersion profile of globular clusters and the temperature profile of galaxy clusters, that different values of a0 are required for agreement with different galaxies' rotation curves,S. M. Kent, \\"Dark matter in spiral galaxies. II - Galaxies with H I rotation curves\\", 1987, AJ, 93, 816 and that MOND is naturally unsuited to forming the basis of a hypothesis of cosmology. Furthermore, many versions of MOND predict that the speed of light is different from the speed of gravity, but in 2017 the speed of gravitational waves was measured to be equal to the speed of light. Besides these observational issues, MOND and its relativistic generalisations are plagued by theoretical difficulties.C. R. Contaldi, T. Wiseman, B. Withers (2008), \\"TeVeS gets caught on caustics\\", Several ad-hoc and inelegant additions to general relativity are required to create a hypothesis with a non-Newtonian non-relativistic limit, the plethora of different versions of the hypothesis offer diverging predictions in simple physical situations and thus make it difficult to test the framework conclusively, and some formulations (most prominently those based on modified inertia) have long suffered from poor compatibility with cherished physical principles such as conservation laws.  Proposals for testing MOND  Several observational and experimental tests have been proposed to help distinguish between MOND and dark matter-based models: * The detection of particles suitable for constituting cosmological dark matter would strongly suggest that ŒõCDM is correct and no modification to Newton's laws is required. * MOND predicts the existence of anomalous accelerations on the Earth at particular places and times of the year. These could be detected in a precision experiment.A. Ignatiev (2014), \\"Testing MOND on Earth\\", V. A. De Lorenci, M. Faundez-Abans, J. P. Pereira (2010). \\"Testing the Newton second law in the regime of small accelerations\\" * It has been suggested that MOND could be tested in the Solar System using the LISA Pathfinder mission (launched in 2015). In particular, it may be possible to detect the anomalous tidal stresses predicted by MOND to exist at the Earth-Sun saddlepoint of the Newtonian gravitational potential.Christian Trenkel, Steve Kemble, Neil Bevis, Joao Magueijo (2010). \\"Testing MOND/TEVES with LISA Pathfinder\\" It may also be possible to measure MOND corrections to the perihelion precession of the planets in the Solar System,L. Blanchet (2011), \\"Testing MOND in the Solar System\\", or a purpose- built spacecraft.V. Sahni, Y. Shtanov (2006), \\"APSIS - an Artificial Planetary System in Space to probe extra-dimensional gravity and MOND\\", * One potential astrophysical test of MOND is to investigate whether isolated galaxies behave differently from otherwise-identical galaxies that are under the influence of a strong external field. Another is to search for non-Newtonian behaviour in the motion of binary star systems where the stars are sufficiently separated for their accelerations to be below a0.X. Hernandez, M. A. Jimenez, and C. Allen (2012), \\"Wide binaries as a critical test of Classical Gravity\\", * Testing modified gravity with black hole shadows John Moffat calculates that the black hole shadow should appear larger by a factor of about ten in MOG as compared to general relativity. * Testing MOND using the redshift-dependence of radial acceleration Sabine Hossenfelder and Tobias Mistele propose a parameter-free MOND model they call Covariant Emergent Gravity and suggest that as measurements of radial acceleration improve, various MOND models and particle dark matter might be distinguishable because MOND predicts a much smaller redshift-dependence.S.

It began shortly after the Norman Conquest of England and dragged on for many years. The main point of the dispute was over whether Canterbury would have jurisdiction, or primacy, over York. A number of archbishops of Canterbury attempted to secure professions of obedience from successive archbishops of York, but in the end they were unsuccessful. York fought the primacy by appealing to the kings of England as well as the papacy. In 1127, the dispute over the primacy was settled mainly in York's favour, for they did not have to submit to Canterbury. Later aspects of the dispute dealt with concerns over status and prestige. Nature of the dispute The main locus of the dispute was the attempt by post-Norman Conquest Archbishops of Canterbury to assert their primacy, or right to rule, over the province of York. Canterbury used texts to back up their claims, including Bede's major historical work the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, which sometimes had the Canterbury archbishops claiming primacy over not just York, but the entire ecclesiastical hierarchy of the British Isles.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 31Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 92 It began under Lanfranc, the first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, and ended up becoming a never ending dispute between the two sees over prestige and status. The historian David Carpenter says Lanfranc's actions \\"sucked his successors into a quagmire, and actually weakened rather than strengthened church discipline and the unity of the kingdom.\\"Carpenter Struggle for Mastery p. 99 Carpenter further argues that \\"it became impossible in later centuries, thanks to disputes over status, for the two archbishops to appear in each others presence.\\" Feeding into the dispute were the two cathedral chapters, who encouraged their respective archbishops to continue the struggle. An additional element was the fact that Canterbury had a monastic chapter, while York had secular clergy in the form of canons, interjecting a note of secular and monastic clerical rivalries into the dispute. Another problem that intertwined with the dispute was the Investiture controversy in England, which was concurrent with the dispute and involved most of the same protagonists. The kings of England, who might have forced a decision, were more concerned with other matters, and were ambivalent about Canterbury's claims, which removed a potential way to resolve the dispute. At times, kings supported Canterbury's claims in order to keep the north of England from revolting, but this was balanced by the times that the kings were in quarrels with Canterbury. The popes, who were often called upon to decide the issue, had their own concerns with granting a primacy, and did not wish to actually rule in Canterbury's favour. But the main driving forces behind the Canterbury position were Lanfranc and Anselm of Canterbury, both of whom enjoyed immense prestige in the church and thus it was not easy for the papacy to rule against them or their position. Once Anselm was out of office, however, the popes began to side more often with York, and generally strived to avoid making any final judgement. Under the Norman kings Under Lanfranc The bottom of the Accord of Winchester, showing Lanfranc's signature. The dispute began under Lanfranc, who demanded oaths of obedience from not just the traditional suffragan bishops of Canterbury but also from the archbishop of York.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 33 This happened shortly after Lanfranc's own consecration, when King William I of England then proposed that Lanfranc consecrate the new archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux. Lanfranc demanded that Thomas swear to obey Lanfranc as Thomas' primate before the consecration could take place, and Thomas refused, but he eventually gave way, and made a profession. However, the exact form that this oath took was disputed, with Canterbury claiming it was without conditions, and York claiming that it was only a personal submission to Lanfranc, and did not involve the actual offices of Canterbury and York. When both Thomas and Lanfranc visited Rome in 1071, Thomas brought up the primacy issue again, and for good measure tacked on a claim to three of Canterbury's suffragan dioceses, Lichfield, Dorchester, and Worcester. Pope Alexander II sent the issue back to England, to be settled at a council convened by the papal legate. This council took place at Winchester in April 1072, and Lanfranc was victorious on both the primacy issue as well as the dioceses.Blumenthal Investiture Controversy p. 151 The victory was drawn up in the Accord of Winchester, to which those present affixed their names.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England pp. 664‚Äì665 However, papal confirmation of the decision did not extend to Lanfranc's successors,Bates William the Conqueror pp. 169‚Äì170 and in fact was never a complete confirmation of the rulings of the council.Douglas William the Conqueror pp. 321‚Äì323 Lanfranc enjoyed the support of King William I at this council.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 61 Thomas was compensated with authority over the Scottish bishops, which was an attempt to give York enough suffragans to allow the archbishops of York to be consecrated without the help of Canterbury. An archiepiscopal consecration required three bishops, and after York's claims to Lichfield, Dorchester, and Worcester were denied, York only had one suffragan, the Diocese of Durham.Brett English Church p. 15 Why exactly Lanfranc decided to press forward claims to a judicial primacy over York is unclear. Some historians, including Frank Barlow have speculated that it was because Thomas was a disciple of Odo of Bayeux, one of Lanfranc's rivals in the English church. Another possibility was that Lanfranc desired to assert authority over the northern province of Britain in order to aid the reforming efforts Lanfranc was attempting. Lanfranc was surely influenced by his cathedral chapter at Canterbury, who may have desired to recover their honours after the problems encountered in Lanfranc's predecessor Stigand's archiepiscopate. York had never had a primacy, and based its arguments on the general principle that primacies were erroneous. While Canterbury in the Anglo-Saxon era had been more prestigious than York, it had never in fact had a judicial primacy. Another influence was probably Lanfranc's monastic background, with Lanfranc feeling that the ecclesiastical structure should mirror the monastic absolute obedience to a superior. However, a main influence was probably the so-called False Decretals, a collection of decrees and canons from the ninth century, which mentioned primates as the equivalent of patriarchs and placed them between the pope and the metropolitan bishops in the hierarchy.Delivr√© \\"Foundations of Primatial Claims\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History pp. 384‚Äì386 When Lanfranc attempted to find documentary proof to rebut York's refusal, it was discovered that no explicit statement of such a primacy existed. This involved the use of letters of Pope Gregory the Great, which were repeated in Bede's Historia, but a complication was that Gregory's plan for the Gregorian mission had specified that the southern province would be based at London, not Canterbury. There was documentary evidence from the papacy that stated that Canterbury had a primacy over the island, but these dated from before York had been raised to an archbishopric. During the council of Winchester in 1072, papal letters were produced which may or may not have been forgeries. A biographer of Lanfranc, Margaret Gibson, argues that they already existed before Lanfranc used them. Another historian, Richard Southern, holds that the statements relating to primacy were inserted into legitimate papal letters after Lanfranc's day. Most historians agree that Lanfranc did not have anything to do with the forgeries, however they came about. King William I supported Lanfranc in this dispute, probably because he felt that it was important that his kingdom be represented by one ecclesiastical province, and this would best be accomplished by supporting the primacy of Canterbury. Before conquering England, William had ruled the duchy of Normandy, which corresponded to the archdiocese of Rouen, and the simplicity of control which this allowed the dukes of Normandy probably was a strong factor in William's support of Canterbury's claims. Another concern was that in 1070‚Äì1072, the north of England, where York was located, was still imperfectly pacified, and allowing York independence might lead to York crowning another king. Thomas claimed that when Lanfranc died in 1089, Thomas' profession lapsed, and during the long vacancy at Canterbury that followed on Lanfranc's death, Thomas performed most of the archiepiscopal functions in England.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 pp. 39‚Äì42 Under Anselm When Anselm was appointed to Canterbury, after a long vacancy that lasted from 1089 to 1093, the only flareup of the dispute was a dispute at Anselm's consecration on 4 December 1093 over the exact title that would be employed in the ceremony. The dispute centered on the title that would be confirmed on Anselm, and although it was settled quickly, the exact title used is unknown, as the two main sources of information differ. Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, proclaims that the title agreed upon was \\"Primate of all Britain\\". Hugh the Chanter, a chronicler from York and a partisan of York, claims the title used was \\"Metropolitan of Canterbury\\".Vaughn Anselm of Bec p. 148 Until the ascension of King Henry I in 1100, Anselm was much more occupied with other disputes with King William II.Barlow William Rufus p. 308 It was during Anselm's archiepiscopate that the primacy dispute became central to Anselm's plans. Eadmer made the dispute central to his work, the Historia Novorum. Likewise, Hugh the Chanter, made the primacy dispute one of the central themes of his work History of the Church of York.Hollister Henry I pp. 13‚Äì14 In 1102, Pope Paschal II, in the midst of the Investiture controversy, tried to smooth over the problems about investiture by granting Anselm a primacy, but only to Anselm himself, not to his successors. Nor did the grant explicitly mention York as being subject to Canterbury.Vaughn Anselm of Bec p. 242 Anselm then held a council in September 1102 at Westminster, which was attended by Gerard, the new archbishop of York. According to Hugh the Chanter, when the seats for the bishops were arranged, Anselm's was set higher than Gerard's, which led Gerard to kick over chairs and refuse to be seated until his own chair was exactly as high as Anselm's.Vaughn Anselm of Bec pp. 246‚Äì247 Late in 1102, the pope wrote to Gerard, admonishing him and ordering him to make the oath to Anselm.Vaughn Anselm of Bec pp. 255‚Äì256 Gerard died in May 1108, and his successor was nominated within six days. Thomas, however, delayed going to Canterbury to be consecrated, under pressure from his cathedral chapter and knowing that since Anselm was in poor health, he might be able to outlast Anselm. Thomas told Anselm that his cathedral chapter had forbidden him to make any oath of obedience, and this was confirmed by the canons themselves, who wrote to Anselm confirming Thomas' account. Although Anselm died before Thomas' had submitted, one of the last letters Anselm wrote ordered Thomas not to seek consecration until he had made the required profession. After Anselm's death, the king then pressured Thomas to submit a written profession, which he eventually did. The actual document has disappeared, and as always, Eadmer and Hugh the Chanter disagree on the exact wording, with Eadmer claiming it was made to Canterbury and any successor archbishops, and Hugh claiming that Thomas qualified the oath by making it clear that it could not impede the rights of the Church of York.Vaughn Anselm of Bec pp. 334‚Äì349 Dispute under Thurstan During the archbishopric of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York between 1114 and 1140, the dispute flared up and Thurstan appealed to the papacy over the issue, with Canterbury under Ralph d'Escures countering with information from Bede as well as forged documents. The papacy did not necessarily believe the forgeries, but the dispute rumbled on for a number of years.Loyn English Church p. 110 Shortly after Thurstan's election in 1114, Ralph refused to consecrate Thurstan unless Ralph received a written, not just oral, profession of obedience.Hollister Henry I p. 235 Thurstan refused to do so, and assured his cathedral chapter that he would not submit to Canterbury. York based its claim on the fact that no metropolitan bishop or archbishop could swear allegiance to anyone but the pope, a position guaranteed to gain support from the papacy. King Henry, however, refused permission for Thurstan to appeal to the papacy, which left the dispute in limbo for two years. Henry does not seem to have cared about who won the dispute, and Henry may have delayed hoping that Ralph and Thurstan would reach a compromise which would keep Henry from having to alienate either of them. Pressure mounted, however, and Henry called a council in the spring of 1116, and Henry ordered that when Thurstan arrived at the council, he must swear to obey Canterbury. If Thurstan would not do so, Henry threatened to depose him from office. But, on his way to the council, Thurstan received a letter from the pope, ordering Thurstan's consecration without any profession. Although Thurstan did not reveal that the pope had ordered his consecration, he continued to refuse to make a profession, and resigned his see in the presence of the king and the council. But, the papacy, the York cathedral chapter, and even King Henry still considered Thurstan the archbishop-elect. In 1117, Ralph attempted to visit Pope Paschal II about the dispute, but was unable to actually meet the pope, and only secured a vague letter confirming Canterbury's past privileges, but since the exact privileges weren't specified, the letter was useless.Hollister Henry I pp. 241‚Äì244 Both Ralph and Thurstan attended the Council of Reims in 1119, convened by Pope Calixtus II in October. Although Canterbury sources state that Thurstan promised King Henry he would refuse consecration while at the council, Yorkish sources deny that any such promise was made. Calixtus promptly consecrated Thurstan at the start of the council, which angered Henry and led the king to exile Thurstan from England and Normandy. Although the pope and king met and negotiated Thurstan's status in November 1119, nothing came of this, and Calixtus in March 1120 gave Thurstan two papal bulls, one an exemption for York from Canterbury's claims, titled Caritatis Bonun,Cheney \\"Some Observations\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History p. 429 and the other a threat of interdict on England if Thurstan was not allowed to return to York. After some diplomatic efforts, Thurstan was allowed back into the king's favour and his office returned to him.Hollister Henry I pp. 269‚Äì273 Calixtus' bulls also allowed any future Archbishops of York to be consecrated by their suffragans if the Archbishop of Canterbury refused.Delivr√© \\"Foundations of Primatial Claims\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History pp. 387‚Äì388 In 1123, William of Corbeil, recently elected Archbishop of Canterbury, refused consecration by Thurstan unless Thurstan would incorporate into the ceremony an admission that Canterbury was primate of Britain. When Thurstan refused, William was consecrated by three of his own bishops.Hollister Henry I pp. 288‚Äì289 William then traveled to Rome to secure confirmation of his election, which was disputed. Thurstan also traveled to Rome, as both archbishops had been summoned to attend a papal council, which both arrived too late to attend. Thurstan arrived shortly before William. While there, William and his advisors presented documents to the papal curia which they insisted proved Canterbury's primacy. However, the cardinals and the curia found the documents to be forgeries.Robinson Papacy pp. 103‚Äì104 What persuaded the cardinals was the absence of papal bulls from the nine documents produced, which the Canterbury delegation tried to explain away by saying the bulls had \\"wasted away or were lost\\". Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler of York, stated that when the cardinals heard that explanation, they laughed and ridiculed the documents \\"saying how miraculous it was that lead should waste away or be lost and parchment should survive\\".Quoted in Robinson Papacy p. 189 Hugh goes on to record that the attempts by the Canterbury party to secure their objective by bribery likewise failed.Robinson Papacy p. 263 Pope Honorius II made a judgment in York's favour in 1126, having found the documents and case presented by Canterbury to be unconvincing.Duggan \\"From the Conquest to the Death of John\\" English Church and the Papacy pp. 98‚Äì99 In the winter of 1126‚Äì1127, an attempt at compromise was made, with Canterbury agreeing to give jurisdiction over the sees of Chester, Bangor and St Asaph to York in return for the submission of York to Canterbury. This foundered when William of Corbeil arrived at Rome and told the pope that he had not agreed to the surrender of St Asaph. This was the last attempt by William to secure an oath from Thurstan,Brett English Church pp. 46‚Äì47 for a compromise in the primacy dispute was made, with William of Corbeil receiving a papal legateship, which effectively gave him the powers of the primacy without the papacy actually having to concede a primacy to Canterbury.Barlow English Church 1066‚Äì1154 p. 44 This legateship covered not only England, but Scotland as well.Robinson Papacy pp. 173‚Äì174 A small flare-up in 1127 happened when William of Corbeil objected to Thurstan having his episcopal cross carried in processions in front of Thurstan while Thurstan was in Canterbury's province. William also objected to Thurstan participating in the ceremonial crownings of the king at the royal court. Thurstan appealed to Rome, and Honorius wrote a scathing letter to William declaring that if the reports from Thurstan were true, William would be punished for his actions. Thurstan then traveled to Rome, where he secured new rulings from the papacy. One gave the seniority between the two British archbishops to whichever had been consecrated first. Another ruling allowed the Archbishops of York to have their crosses carried in Canterbury's province.Bethell \\"William of Corbeil\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History pp. 156‚Äì157 Legacy of the first dispute The main import of the first dispute was the increase in appeals to the papacy to solve the problem. This was part of a general trend to seek support and resolution at the papacy instead of in the royal courts, a trend that grew through the reigns of William II and Henry I.Brett English Church p. 50 Also important was the impetus that the disputes gave to efforts by both York and Canterbury to assert their jurisdiction over Scotland, Wales and Ireland.Brett English Church p. 52 After the settlement of the profession issue, the dispute turned to other, lesser matters such as how the respective chairs of the two archbishops would be arranged when they were together and the right of either to carry their episcopal cross in the others' province. Under Stephen Under Stephen, the dispute arose briefly at the Council of Reims of 1148. Theobald of Bec, who was Archbishop of Canterbury for most of Stephen's reign, attended the council, and when Henry Murdac, just recently elected to York, did not arrive, Theobald claimed the primacy over York at one of the early council sessions. However, as Murdac was a Cistercian, as was Pope Eugene III, who had called the council, nothing further was done about Canterbury's claim. Eugene postponed any decision until Murdac was established in his see.Saltman Theobald pp. 141‚Äì142 Most of the time, however, Theobald was not concerned with reopening the dispute, as demonstrated when he consecrated Roger de Pont L'Ev√™que, newly elected to York in 1154. Theobald, at Roger's request, performed the consecration as papal legate, and not as archbishop, thus side- stepping the question of a profession of obedience.Saltman Theobald p. 123 Disputes under Henry II A medieval stained glass window depicting Thomas Becket. During Thomas Becket's archiepiscopate, the dispute flared up again, with the added complication of an attempt by Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, to have his see raised to an archbishopric, basing his case on the old Gregorian plan for London to be the seat of the southern province. Foliot was an opponent of Becket's, and this fed into the dispute, as well as Becket's legateships, which specifically excluded York. When Roger de Pont L'Ev√™que, the Archbishop of York, crowned Henry the Young King in 1170, this was a furthering of the dispute, as it was Canterbury's privilege to crown the kings of England. The first sign of the revival of the dispute was at the Council of Tours, called in 1163 by Pope Alexander III. While there, Roger and Becket disputed over the placement of their seats in the council. Roger argued, that based on Gregory the Great's plan that primacy should go to the archbishop who had been consecrated first, he had the right to the more honourable placement at the council. Eventually, Alexander placed them both on equal terms,Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 84‚Äì86 but not before the council spent three days listening to the claims and counter-claims, as well as Roger relating the whole history of the dispute.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 394 In 1164 Alexander gave Roger a papal legateship, but excluded Becket from its jurisdiction. The pope did, however, decline to declare that Canterbury had a primacy in England.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 106 Alexander on 8 April 1166 confirmed Canterbury's primacy, but this became less important than the grant of a legateship on 24 April to Becket. This grant, though, did not cover the diocese of York, which was specifically prohibited.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 145 During the reign of Henry II, the dispute took a new form, concerning the right of either archbishop to carry their archiepiscopal cross throughout the kingdom, not just in their own province. During the vacancy between the death of Theobald of Bec and the appointment of Becket, Roger had secured papal permission to carry his cross anywhere in England. As the Becket controversy grew, however, Alexander asked Roger to forbear from doing so, in order to stop the wrangling that had arisen from Roger's doing so. Later, Alexander revoked the privilege, claiming it had been given in error.Warren Henry II p. 503 The dispute continued between Hubert Walter and Geoffrey, respectively Archbishop of Canterbury and Archbishop of York, during King Richard I's reign, when both archbishops had their archiepiscopal crosses carried before themselves in the others diocese, prompting angry recriminations. Eventually, both prelates attempted to secure a settlement from Richard in their favour, but Richard declined, stating that this was an issue that needed to be settled by the papacy. However, no firm settlement was made until the 14th century.Young Hubert Walter pp. 88‚Äì89 The papacy, while continuing to grant legateships to the archbishops of Canterbury, began after 1162 to specifically exclude the legateships from covering the province of York. The only exception from the later half of the 12th century was the legateship of Hubert Walter in 1195, which covered all of England. This exception, however, was more due to Pope Celestine III's dislike of Geoffrey, the archbishop of York at the time.

The dance has experienced a reappropriation in the late 1950s, with the development of the Celtic Circles (cultural groups) and Fest Noz (night festival). Overview Two Breton dancers in traditional costume \\"Breton Girls Dancing\\"; Paul Gauguin Fest-noz at Langon, Ille-et-Vilaine In the agricultural society of the 19th century, the most common occasion on which dancing took place was a wedding. Other opportunities for dancing were: * beating the earth floor of a new house or repairing a damaged beaten earth floor * preparing a threshing floor * celebrations following agricultural work (such as a harvest festival) * secular celebrations accompanying a religious festival (such as a pardon) More recently, throughout the second half of the 20th Century, a revival of traditional Breton dancing has taken place, to such an extent that it can now be considered to be at the forefront of contemporary Breton cultural expression, along with the music which accompanies it. Two main opportunities exist to experience Breton dance: fest-noz (night festival) and fest-deiz (day festival). The former reunites both young and old in a celebration of their cultural heritage, whereas the latter tends to be frequented by a somewhat older collection of people. Moreover, the range of dances found at a fest-noz is likely to be smaller; at a fest-deiz the full variety of Breton dance can often be seen, including dances in fours and eights which rarely get an outing at a fest-noz. Breton dance is accompanied by musicians and singers playing and singing in duos, trios, quartets and, sometimes, even larger groups. Traditional acoustic instruments are often the mainstay of these occasions, though some groups have also taken up electric instruments as well. The most ubiquitous instruments are the accordion and two characteristically Breton wind instruments: the biniou (a kind of bagpipe) and the bombarde (a reed instrument similar to the oboe). The circular form, the typical pattern of the most dominant dance in the western Brittany repertoire, is very representative of the social structure. The circle is the representation of a community which can express itself only if each dancer is at the right place. The individual is both a minor and a vital element in the working order of the dancing and singing. In Brittany, music and dancing have always been an expression of identity for the folk society. They were a particular moment favouring the expression of individuals who fused together through a happy time. They followed the different stages of life and structured its organisation. Yet the practice of dancing and music was not restricted to a pure entertainment. It was the manifestation of the folk social order which expressed through a collective activity the status of each individual within the community. Dancing and singing convey the expression of an identity. This is the fundamental character which has permitted to Breton culture to develop through ages by adapting to the continuous cultural evolution. It also explains the current extraordinary enthusiasm of thousands of Bretons who today keep practicing music an dancing, thus perpetuating a centuries-old tradition.  Dances  Lower Brittany Jean-Michel GuilcherLa Tradition populaire de danse en Basse-Bretagne, Mouton- La Haye, Paris. 1st edition EHSS, Paris, 1963. Reprinted Coop Breizh/Chasse- mar√©e/ArMen, 1995 distinguishes between five fundamental dances in the region of Lower Brittany. These are described as the \\"mother-forms\\" from whose ancient roots numerous variants have been developed, to such an extent sometimes that the original can hardly be recognised. These five forms are: * the Gavotte * the En Dro * the Da√±s Treger * the Da√±s Leon * the Da√±s tro Plinn The Gavotte (also known as da√±s tro) is a dance in four time. It is the dance with the most variants and can be considered to include kost ar c'hoad and suite fisel. It is associated with a large geographical region, which includes Cornouaille and the north-west of the Pays de L√©on. The gavotte is the most widespread of all Breton dances. Originally, the dancers formed a closed circle, and this is still largely true today. Alternatively, particularly at festo√π-noz, it is also danced in long, circling lines throughout the hall. The En Dro (or An Dro) was originally a dance of the area around the city of Vannes, in the south of Lower Brittany. It is a dance in four time. To it can be added its sister dance - the Hanter Dro. These two dances are sometimes combined to form a third, known as Da√±s tricot. The Da√±s Treger is a dance from the Tr√©gor region and fell into disuse at the end of the 19th Century. Research into the dance has nevertheless enabled a reconstruction of its main features, which are similar to those of dances found in the Pays Gallo (Penthi√®vre, Men√©, Loud√©ac). The Da√±s Leon is a dance from the North of Finist√®re which features two lines of men and women, face to face, progressing in parallel. The Da√±s tro plinn is a dance whose origin is uncertain. Like the gavotte, it is a dance where the participants are linked in circles or lines, each dancer connected to his or her neighbour by the characteristic hold of bras dessus, bras dessous (arm over, arm under). Upper Brittany The study of the dances of Upper Brittany was not made until more recent times and there is thus no fundamental study of these dances comparable to that of Guilcher's research into Lower Brittany. There is consequently little certitude about the practice of these dances before the start of the 20th Century. =Dances in the fashion of the En Dro= These can be found to the south-west of Lower Brittany in the elongation of the Pays Vannetais. They include: * rond * tour * pil√©-menu The structure of these dances suggests a similarity with the en dro of Lower Brittany, with variations in movements or arm holds. =The ronds or rondes= Different pays in the region have given birth to different dances: * the ronds du Penthi√®vre, de l'Oust, du Li√©, du Men√© * the ronds du type Gu√©randais * the rond de Saint-Vincent * the ronds \\"isol√©s\\" The Ronds du Penthi√®vre, de l'Oust, du Li√©, du Men√©: one of the most well-known dances from this group is the rond de Loud√©ac. Strictly speaking, the rond de Loud√©ac is a suite, usually of four dances: rond-bal-rond-riquegn√©e. The fourth of these is a kind of passepied. The Ronds du type Gu√©randais are to be found in the districts situated between the estuary of the river Vilaine and the Loire. They often feature two distinct parts, one more sedate and the other more vigorous, within the same dance. The Rond de Saint-Vincent is a popular dance comprising only one part. The Ronds isol√©s: a category which includes dances such as the \\"rond de Sautron\\", \\"rond d'Erquy\\", \\"ronds de Ch√¢teaubriant\\"... =The passepieds= These dances were common throughout a large geographical area, in particular the west of the Tr√©gor. A form of the passepied (pach pi) is found in Upper Brittany.

Description Larva The wings are gray with some red towards the base. The thorax is black and is crossed with a red band. The wingspan is about . The caterpillar can retract its head into its prothorax. A yellow band with black spots runs along the caterpillar's dorsum. The pupation usually starts in early June as an elongated cocoon that is whitish or light brown. The pupa is pink or yellowish and is long. The larvae feed upon Prunus spinosa, Crataegus sp., Cotoneaster sp., and other species in the family Rosaceae. The species is a pest on foliage and young fruit. The species shows a very low level of genetic heterogeneity for a lepidopteran species, but it does not affect the species' viability. In the Ice Age, differentiation into two genetic lineages occurred. Mating The external male sex organs are subject to sexual selection by the female. The male may rub the female's abdomen with its valva during mating. Successful sperm transfer depends upon whether the male spermatophore will fit into the opening of the female ductus seminalis. In a study of sex pheromones, Aglaope infausta was one of the species attracted by tortricids pheromones and caught in the traps. Habitat A. infausta is found in Portugal, Spain, France and north-western Italy reaching its north-eastern distribution limit in western Germany. The habitat has to be hot and dry. The species lives in bushy, warm, steppe regions and in forests. The species sometimes shares the habitat of Heterogynis penella.

The cemetery is at the confluence of the Etowah River and Oostanaula River and to the south of downtown Rome across the South Broad Street bridge. Geography Three of Rome's seven hills were chosen as burial grounds - Lumpkin Hill, Myrtle Hill, and Mount Aventine because of the flooding of Rome's three rivers - Etowah, Oostanaula and Coosa. Myrtle Hill was named for its Vinca minor (trailing myrtle) on the hill. The cemetery covers on 6 terraces and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Myrtle Hill cemetery is the final resting place of more than 20,000 people including doctors, politicians, football heroes, soldiers including America's Known Soldier, a First Lady of the United States, and Rome's founders. \\"Where Romans Rest\\" is an annual tour of Myrtle Hill Cemetery, given by the Greater Rome Convention & Visitors Bureau. History Battle of Hightower Before becoming a cemetery, the hill gained notability as an 18th-century battle site. In September 1793, General John Sevier, in command of 800 men, came to the area on an unauthorized mission. Sevier was pursuing 1,000 Cherokees who had scalped and killed thirteen settlers at Cavett's Station, near Knoxville. The pursuit ended in Georgia, when Sevier caught up with the Cherokee at the village of what he called Hightower (Etowah, or Itawayi), which is near the present-day site of Cartersville, Georgia. The Cherokee created a defensive position on Myrtle Hill and used a guard to try to prevent Sevier from fording the rivers. Sevier left a written account of the battle, in which he described an attempt to cross the Etowah River about a mile south of Myrtle Hill, drawing the Cherokee defenders out of their prepared positions, then galloping back to Myrtle Hill to cross there. The Cherokee rushed back to contest the crossing of the Etowah, but failed. When the Cherokee leader, Kingfisher, was killed, the remaining warriors fled, and Sevier burned the village. Sevier Monument for Battle of Hightower Evidence of the battle was found in the form of Cherokee bones and relics in the crevasses of the hill.Battey, George MacGruder, Jr., A History of Rome and Floyd County (1922, Reprinted 1994), Cherokee Publishing Co. In 1901, the Xavier chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a stone monument to Sevier which describes the battle to honor Sevier and the battle. The monument is located between Myrtle Hill Cemetery and the Etowah River by the South Broad Street bridge.NGeorgia's Battle of Hightower Cemetery Named Myrtle Hill After the Battle of Hightower, the hill was largely undisturbed until white settlers came to western Georgia in search of gold. The Dahlonega, Georgia gold discovery (gold rush) of 1829 brought prospectors and settlers into the area of present-day Rome. The Indian Removal, or Trail of Tears, which took place between 1830 and 1838, forced the Cherokee to abandon their holdings in the area. The former Cherokee territory was then allotted to white settlers. The city of Rome, founded in 1834 by Colonel Daniel R. Mitchell, Colonel Zachariah Hargrove, Major Phillip Hemphill, Colonel William Smith, and John Lumpkin, established Oak Hill (opened in 1837) as Rome's first cemetery. Thirteen years later, when Oak Hill Cemetery was nearly out of lots, the need for a second cemetery became apparent. In 1850, after considering several properties, Colonel Thomas A. Alexander and Daniel S. Printup chose a hill near the rivers. The hill was originally owned by Colonel Alfred Shorter and Cunningham Pennington, a civil engineer. Rome Female College was later renamed Shorter University in honor of the Colonel and his wife Martha. Pennington designed the plan for the interments on six levels of the steep terrain as a 19th-century picturesque rural cemetery. Roads circle the hill and combine with the necessary terracing to create a layered, \\"wedding cake\\" look. The new cemetery was opened in 1857 as Myrtle Hill Cemetery. \\"Myrtle\\" was chosen because of the myrtle (vinca minor) or \\"Flower of Death\\" that grew wild over the hill. The original Cemetery of was at the top of the hill. One of the first graves was of John Billups who died in 1857.Roadside Georgia - Myrtle Cemetery Fort Stovall On July 14, 1863, the citizens of Rome allocated $3,000 to construct three earthen forts to defend Rome from the Union Army during the American Civil War. The forts were completed in October 1863, as Confederate soldiers began to take up duties in the new fortifications. As anticipated, Union raiders made forays into the area. Their focus was to cripple the Confederate war machine by destroying the Noble Foundry, located in the city on the Etowah River across from the cemetery. One of the forts, constructed on the crest of Myrtle Hill, was named Fort Stovall in honor of fallen Confederate soldier, George Stovall. Other forts, Fort Attaway (named for Thomas Attaway) and Fort Norton (named for Charles Norton), were opposite the location of Fort Stovall. It was described as a bracket-shaped linear earthwork near the top of Myrtle Hill as shown on the map. Its line faced northwest, defending the western approach to Rome as well as the Coosa River. It was made with several faces, which provided maximum coverage along its front. The zigzag shape permitted defenders to direct enfilading (from the side) fire on any men who approached the line. The map of Fort Stovall The exact location of the earthworks of Fort Stovall is impossible to determine from a Civil War era \\"map\\", and no evidence of it can be seen in the cemetery. Defensive lines constructed on a hill were typically built below the very top of the hill to prevent the occupants of the line from being silhouetted against the sky and giving the enemy a better target. It also gave the soldiers a clearer line of sight down the slope of the hill. The extensive terracing necessary for burials at Myrtle Hill has eliminated any evidence of Fort Stovall on the surface. It is possible, although unlikely, that remnants of the earthworks survive as subsurface features. While it is clear that subsequent earth-moving activities at Myrtle Hill affected the Civil War earthworks, it is also likely the Civil War action resulted in damage to the cemetery. The top of the monument on Billups' grave, which dates to 1857, is believed to have been shot off by a musket ball during the war, but no other specific mention is made of damage to the graves. However, because of the excellent vantage point provided by the hill, there was likely considerable activity at the fort, as a point of origin for Confederate scouting and raiding parties. While the exact location of Fort Stovall is unclear, three sites are considered likely; the crest of the hill, where a Confederate soldier statue now stands, the Axson family homesite, or the hillside nearest the Etowah river.Sons of Confederate Veterans: History of Myrtle Cemetery article On May 17, 1864, Confederate units defended Rome, including Fort Stovall, when Union General Jefferson C. Davis, in command of the 2nd Division of Palmer's 14th Army Corps, Army of the Cumberland, approached down the west side of the Oostanaula and took up a position opposite Rome and engaged with the Confederate pickets. On reaching this position, Davis received an order to return to the 14th Corps, but as he was already engaged with Confederates and suspected a weak defense, he determined to stay on and capture Rome. Davis' considerable force was held at bay overnight by a small garrison assisted by three brigades of Polk's Corps on their way from Mississippi to reinforce General Albert Sidney Johnston. Fort Stovall was occupied during this brief standoff, but the main point of Confederate artillery was on Shorter Hill on the west side of the Oostanaula. The next day, when the Union forces moved to capture Rome, the Confederates had retreated. After the Confederates retreated and left Rome, Union forces likely used the fort during their occupation of Rome.Sesquicentennial Committee of the City of Rome, Rome and Floyd County: An Illustrated History,(1986), The Delmar Co. Postbellum Myrtle Hill Cemetery The cemetery was used for fallen soldiers from several Civil War battles. A number of antebellum burials have been noted, and numerous interments had been made in the Confederate Cemetery section by 1863. Other graves were added during the Atlanta Campaign following the death of soldiers in Rome's hospitals. After 1872, more graves were added as some important people with roles in the founding of Rome were buried there. Daniel R. Mitchell (died 1876), one of the founders of Rome, Daniel S. Printup (died 1887), one of the men who selected this site of the cemetery, John H. Underwood (died 1888), a United States Representative before the Civil War, a two-term superior court judge, and lawyer in Rome, Colonel Alfred Shorter (died 1882), the former owner of the cemetery and namesake of Shorter University, Nathan Henry Bass, Sr. (died 1890), Civil War Confederate Congressman, Augustus Romaldus Wright (died 1891) who served in U.S. Congress with Abraham Lincoln, Dr. Robert Battey (died 1895), who performed the first ovarian operation, Homer V. M. Miller (died 1896), 1886 U.S. Senate in 1886, first Democrat from Georgia, Richard Vonalbade Gammon (died 1897), the University of Georgia football player who died of the injuries he received in the Georgia-Virginia football game, and Rosalind Gammon (died 1904), Gammon's mother who saved a football from being illegal in the state of Georgia. The Confederate Soldier statue on top of Myrtle Hill is known as \\"The Monument to the Confederate Dead of Rome and Floyd County in the Civil War\\" and was placed by the local chapter of the Ladies' Memorial Association in 1869. The Ladies Memorial Association raised the $6,000 for the statue to be made. This was difficult during Reconstruction and the 1870 financial panics caused a delay in the placing of the statue; however, the statue's plan was complete in 1887 as the statue was dedicated. The statue still stands on top of the hill, \\"Crown Point\\". In 1874, Hines M. Smith made a new survey of the cemetery which defined what is called the Old Original cemetery. New numbers were assigned to the lots at that time. Some deeds after 1874 make reference to the old number as well as the new one. Boundaries of the Old Original cemetery are based on a copy of the Smith survey updated to 1901. Some of the lots on this map, especially in the western part of the cemetery, may have been added between 1874 and 1901. The 1901 survey indicates that the original road pattern within the cemetery was nearly identical to its configuration today. A short section of road in the south western part of the Old Original section was closed by 1901. Also, it is evident that in the western part of the Old Original cemetery, some of the original walkways between the lots were being filled in by that date. By the end of the 19th century, the popularity of lots had been sold out to people who purchased the additions for their plans. The additions had been created and completed by Branham about 1899 on the steep bluff facing the rivers on the north side of the Old Original cemetery, Terraces A-D were added from 1908 to 1928 to near Branham's, the New Front in around 1909, The triangle \\"Memorial Addition\\" at the corner of streets and the south boundary of the Old Original cemetery in 1923 for Charles Graves, \\"America's Known Soldier\\" \\"the designated representative of all the Known Dead of the Great War 1917-1918\\" by President Warren Harding and the Congressional Record, Glover Vault, the New Front Terrace, and the Greystone in 1938. The lots also contains the Freedman (African-American) section set aside when the cemetery was segregated. One of the African Americans buried at Myrtle Hill in 1915 was Tom McClintock, who had worked as a Myrtle Hill Cemetery gravedigger for 42 years.Desmond, Jerry, Georgia's Rome: A Brief History (1998), The History Press  2017 Confederate Monument Vandalism  In December of 2017, the Confederate monument atop Myrtle Hill was vandalized. The monument was initially an urn and was erected 1887 by the \\"Women of Rome\\" to honor the Confederate veterans of Rome. The urn was replaced by a statue of a soldier in 1909. In 2017, a vandal or vandals knocked off its hands and the rifle, along with bashing in its face. The vandal or vandals responsible were never apprehended. Confederate Cemetery Confederate Cemetery This section contains over 377 Confederate and Union soldiers including 85 Unknown Union and/or Confederate Soldiers [Ref: A History of Rome and Floyd County, Battey, pp. 622 and see also Rome and Floyd County: An Illustrated History, Sesquicentennial Edition, 1985, pp 39. The first reference states that the Unknown graves are Confederate, while the second source states that the unknown graves are Union. More definitive information is needed for clarification]. They lost their lives in the battles of the American Civil War from Rome and other places. Dr. Samuel H. Stout, the physician in charge of all the hospitals that served the Army of Tennessee, ordered that all permanently disabled patients be sent to Rome. Many are buried in this section. The buildings and churches that were used as hospitals for the fallen soldiers were spared from General William Sherman's November 1864 order of burning buildings on Broad Street. Most are still standing and are on the National Register of Historic Places. The section's graves were marked with painted wooden markers between 1863 and 1900. Sometime after 1900, their wooden markers were replaced with the present stone markers that still exist. The section is called the Confederate Section of the Cemetery, but is not limited to just soldiers from the Civil War. A few graves are those of soldiers from subsequent wars; and one woman, buried at the feet of her husband.City of Rome, Georgia Myrtle Hill Cemetery Education Handbook 2007 Veteran's Plaza Veteran's Plaza (Confederate Park on the front) Veteran's Plaza is a bricked site located at the corner of South Broad Street and Myrtle Street. The centerpiece of the plaza is the grave of America's Known Soldier, Charles Graves, 1904 water-cooled automatic machine guns around Graves' grave, and bronze replica of a World War doughboy enhances this site. Before Veteran's Plaza was a bricked site, it was just a grassy field with Graves' grave, the three maxim guns that were in the different positions, and shrines as memorials from the 1930s to the present to fallen soldiers who were involved with other wars. In the beginning of the year 2000, Many of the bricks were placed by a brick mason named Leroy Minter. The plaza has more than 3,000 bricks engraved with the names and branch of service, to honor and memorialize military veterans and civilians for their services to America in war or peace throughout all of American history. E.Rome, Georgia website Confederate Monuments Two notable Confederate monuments stand at the side corners of Veterans Plaza. They are the General Nathan Forrest Monument and the Women of the Confederacy Monument. These monuments were moved in 1952 from their original places on Broad Street at Second Avenue because they had become a traffic hazard. General Forrest's Monument was dedicated to honor him for saving Rome from Colonel Abel Streight and his mule-equipped cavalry on their mission to capture Rome. Colonel Streight who was coming from Alabama on May 3, 1863 was defeated by General Forrest with a small group of confederates serving with him. General Forrest had 425 men and Colonel Streight had 1,000 but Streight surrendered as his raid was caught. His monument was erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1909. Forrest's monument was rededicated by the Emma Sansom Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in a ceremony on Saturday, April 18, 2009 for the 100th anniversary of the first dedication of his monument. The Women of the Confederacy Monument honors Confederate women who served as nurses in Rome to care for Confederate and Union soldiers during the Civil War and mothers/wives who waited while their men fought. The Confederate Women's Monument was erected by President Theodore Roosevelt on October 8, 1910. Woodrow Wilson wrote the inscription on the monument. This monument is believed to be the first monument in the world to honor the role of women in war.Georgia's Rome Rome's Historic Myrtle Hill Cemetery Greater Rome Convention and Visitors Bureau (brochure) Tomb of the Known Soldier Pvt. Charles Graves' grave is in the middle of the plaza with maxim guns in back The Tomb of the Known Soldier is the grave of Private Charles W. Graves (1893‚Äì1918). Private Graves was an infantryman in the American Expeditionary Force who fought in World War I. On October 5, 1918, Private Graves was killed by German artillery shrapnel on the Hindenburg Line. His mother received the telegram from the War Department that informed her about Private Graves' death; however, his body was not returned to America until March 29, 1922 when they brought American soldiers' remains from France and Belgium aboard the troopship Cambria to New York City. The U.S. Government had the idea of creating Unknown Soldier and Known Soldier in Arlington Cemetery to honor World War I soldiers. Private Graves was chosen for America's Known Soldier by a blindfolded sailor who picked Graves' name from American soldier remains list, but his mother objected to his burial at Arlington. The War Department wanted to give his body flag-draped coffin a parade on Fifth Avenue, in New York with generals, admirals, and politicians before his mother buried Graves in the cemetery near Antioch Church on April 6, 1922. On September 22, 1923, Romans decided to relocate Private Graves' body from Antioch Cemetery to Myrtle Hill Cemetery as America's Known Soldier after his mother's death and his brother's agreement. Private Graves was buried a third and final time. On November 11, 1923, Armistice Day, Private Graves and the other 33 young men from Floyd County who died in World War I were honored with three Maxim guns and 34 magnolia trees.McDougald, Mike, Rome Cemeteries - Myrtle Hill, (May 2002), Rome News- Tribune. Ellen Axson Wilson Ellen Axson Wilson's grave The only U.S. First Lady buried in Georgia is buried in Myrtle Hill Cemetery. Ellen Axson Wilson, was the first wife of President Woodrow Wilson. Ellen Louise Axson Wilson was the daughter of Reverend S. E. Axson, who was a Presbyterian minister and Margaret Hoyt Axson. She was born in Savannah, Georgia but grew up in Rome. She graduated from the Rome Female College and later studied Art at the Students' Art League in New York. In the Spring of 1883, she met Woodrow Wilson, a young lawyer from Atlanta, Georgia. They were married in 1885 and moved to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania where Mr. Wilson taught at the newly formed Bryn Mawr College. After Wilson became the president of Princeton University in 1902 and the governor of New Jersey in 1910, he became the U.S. President in 1912. Ellen was the First Lady who had a studio with a skylight installed at the White House in 1913, and found time for painting and the duties of hostess for the nation. With her health failing slowly from Bright's disease (chronic nephritis), she died August 6, 1914. After her death, her body was taken to Rome by a train with five private cars for President Wilson. The procession, a two-horse drawn funeral carriage, from First Presbyterian Church to Myrtle Hill Cemetery passed down Broad Street, which was lined with Romans. As the graveside service began, rain began to fall as if the sky were weeping. Mrs. Wilson was buried with her father, her mother, and her brother. Stockton Axson.Dubovoj, Sina, Ellen A.

It was organized by the Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan organization, which was led by prominent Winnipeg businessman J. D. Perrin. The event was the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point. If Day included a staged firefight between Canadian troops and volunteers dressed as German soldiers, the internment of prominent politicians, the imposition of Nazi rule, and a parade. The event was a fundraiser for the war effort: over $3 million was collected in Winnipeg on that day. Organizers believed that the fear induced by the event would help increase fundraising objectives. It was the subject of a 2006 documentary, and was included in Guy Maddin's film My Winnipeg. Background A. J. Casson's Canadian Victory Bonds poster Give Us The Tools 1941 If Day was an elaborate campaign to promote the purchase of Victory Bonds. These bonds, which were loans to the government to allow for increased war spending, were sold to individuals and corporations throughout Canada. If Day was the second Victory Loan campaign of the Second World War. The campaign began on 16 February 1942, and continued until 9 March. Manitoba's fundraising target was $45 million ($620 million in 2011 dollars), including $24.5 million from Winnipeg. The Greater Winnipeg Victory Loan committee, a regional branch of the National War Finance Committee, organized If Day under chairman John Draper Perrin. The organizers believed that bringing the war (or, rather, a simulation thereof) to people's homes would result in a change of attitude among those not directly affected by the war. The committee drew up a map of Manitoba, which was divided into 45 sections, each representing $1 million of their fundraising target. As money came in from those selling Victory Bonds, the sections were \\"reclaimed\\" from the Nazi invaders. The map was posted at the corner of Portage and Main, the city's central intersection. The campaign was publicized in local newspapers for a few days before the event, although the \\"invasion\\" took many citizens by surprise. To prevent a rush to emergency shelters, residents of neighbouring northern Minnesota were also warned because radio broadcasts dramatizing the event could be received in that area. Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft painted to look like German fighter planes flew over the city on 18 February 1942. Selkirk, a small town northeast of Winnipeg, held its own fundraising simulation, a one-hour blackout and mock bombing, on 18 February 1942 in preparation for the main If Day event.  Events  The simulation included 3,500 Canadian Army members, representing all of Winnipeg's units, making it the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point. The defending forces were commanded by Colonels E. A. Pridham and D. S. McKay. Troops were drawn from the 18th (Manitoba) Armoured Car Regiment, No. 10 District Engineers and Signals, the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, the Winnipeg Grenadiers, the Winnipeg Light Infantry, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, Veteran's Guard of Canada (including over 300 veterans of the First World War), and a number of reserve and civilian groups. The 'Nazi' troops were volunteers from the Young Men's Board of Trade, using uniforms rented from Hollywood and with painted sabre scars on their faces. They were commanded by Erich von Neurenberg.It is unclear whether this was a real name or a pseudonym. Approximately $3,000 was spent on the event. 'Nazi' patrols in the city began before 5:30 am on 19 February. A radio announcer was detained and his microphone commandeered for radio broadcasts, beginning at 5:45 am. 'Nazi' troops assembled on the west side of the city half an hour after the first patrols. Canadian troops were massed at Fort Osborne barracks and the Minto and Macgregor armouries at 6:30 am, and at 7:00 am air-raid sirens were sounded and a blackout ordered in preparation for the invasion. The aerial blitzkrieg began before 7 am with mock bombings. Beginning at 7:03 am, troops started their simulated attack on the city, which was defended by a small group of active and reserve troops assisted by local community groups. The defenders formed a perimeter around the industrial and downtown areas of the city, approximately from City Hall, retreating to a perimeter at 7:45. The firefight included large-scale troop movements and the simulated destruction of major bridges ‚Äì coal dust and dynamite were used to create explosions. Nine troop formations held three positions each during the tightly scripted invasion sequence; they were directed via telephone (one line per formation) and flash-lamp signals from the headquarters established at the Chamber of Commerce building. The defensive pattern employed was similar to that used during the First World War in Paris to conduct soldiers to the front. Light tanks were stationed at road and rail junctions as fighting intensified. Thirty anti-aircraft vehicles fired blanks at fighter planes overhead, assisted by anti-aircraft gunners on buildings downtown. The first mock casualty was reported at 8:00 am. Dressing stations were set up at strategic points to treat the mock casualties; they also treated the two real casualties of the event ‚Äì a soldier who sprained his ankle, and a woman who cut her thumb preparing toast during the early-morning blackout. City officials being arrested and taken to the internment camp At 9:30 am, the defenders surrendered to the 'Nazis' and withdrew to the downtown muster point, and the city was occupied. The fake Nazis began a widespread harassment campaign, sending armed troops throughout the city. A tank was driven down Portage Avenue, one of the main streets of the downtown area. Some people were taken to an internment camp at Lower Fort Garry; those interned included prominent local politicians like Premier John Bracken (arrested with several members of his cabinet at a caucus meeting), Mayor John Queen, Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba Roland Fairbairn McWilliams, and visiting Norwegian ambassador to the United States . One council member, Dan McClean, escaped but was recaptured after an intensive search. Chief of Police George Smith avoided capture because he was dining out when soldiers arrived at his office. The Union Flag at Lower Fort Garry was replaced with the swastika. The city was renamed \\"Himmlerstadt\\", and Main Street was termed \\"Hitlerstrasse\\". Erich von Neurenberg was installed as gauleiter (provincial leader); he was assisted by George Waight, who acted as the local Gestapo chief. Their stated purpose was to assist Hitler in his plans to take advantage of Canada's relatively low population density by colonizing the country. Von Neurenberg issued the following decree, which was posted throughout the city: > # This territory is now a part of the Greater Reich and under the > jurisdiction of Col. Erich Von Neuremburg, Gauleiter of the Fuehrer. # No > civilians will be permitted on the streets between 9:30 pm and daybreak. # > All public places are out of bounds to civilians, and not more than 8 > persons can gather at one time in any place. # Every householder must > provide billeting for 5 soldiers. # All organizations of a military, semi- > military or fraternal nature are hereby disbanded and banned. Girl Guide, > Boy Scout and similar youth organizations will remain in existence but under > direction of the Gauleiter and Storm troops. # All owners of motor cars, > trucks and buses must register same at Occupation Headquarters where they > will be taken over by the Army of Occupation. # Each farmer must immediately > report all stocks of grain and livestock and no farm produce may be sold > except through the office of the Kommandant of supplies in Winnipeg. He may > not keep any for his own consumption but must buy it back through the > Central Authority in Winnipeg. # All national emblems excluding the Swastika > must be immediately destroyed. # Each inhabitant will be furnished with a > ration card, and food and clothing may only be purchased on presentation of > this card. # The following offences will result in death without trial ## > Attempting to organize resistance against the Army of Occupation ## Entering > or leaving the province without permission. ## Failure to report all goods > possessed when ordered to do so. ## Possession of firearms. NO ONE WILL ACT, > SPEAK OR THINK CONTRARY TO OUR DECREES. The masthead of the Winnipeg Tribune, 19 February 1942 Notices were posted on churches forbidding worship services, and priests who objected were arrested. Buses were stopped and their passengers searched by armed troops. The Winnipeg Tribune was renamed Das Winnipeger L√ºgenblatt (\\"The Winnipeg Lies-sheet\\"), a 'Nazi' publication featuring heavily censored columns and a front page written almost entirely in German. One satirical story noted that \\"this is a great day for Manitoba ...The Nazis, like Der Fuehrer, are patient, kind and tolerant, but THEIR PATIENCE IS RAPIDLY EXHAUSTED BECOMING\\", while another included an \\"official joke\\", approved by the German authorities, at which all readers were ordered to laugh or be imprisoned. Henry Weppler, a newspaper seller for the Winnipeg Free Press, was attacked and his papers ripped up. The Winnipeg Free Press featured a front-page story about the \\"invasion\\", describing in great detail the devastation caused by the Nazis in Winnipeg. Books were burned in front of the main Carnegie branch of the Winnipeg Public Library (the books had been pre-selected for incineration as damaged or outdated). Soldiers entered the cafeteria at Great West Life and stole lunches from workers. They seized buffalo coats from the police station and wore them throughout the day, as the temperature was below . At one local elementary school, the principal was arrested and replaced with a 'Nazi' educator dedicated to teaching the \\"Nazi Truth\\"; special lessons were prepared for high-school students throughout the city. Some stores and homes were looted by the fake troops. Canadian currency was replaced with fake German Reichsmarks, the only propaganda notes that Canada created during the war. Fake German Reichsmarks; the reverse features an advertisement for Victory Loans. The day ended at 5:30 pm with a ceremonial release of prisoners, a parade, and speeches from the released dignitaries. Members of the organizing committee and local businesspeople marched down Portage Avenue with banners reading \\"It MUST Not Happen Here!\\" and \\"Buy Victory Bonds\\". Following the parade, a banquet was held at the Hudson's Bay Company building. Ambassador de Morgenstierne spoke about his experiences with If Day and in Norway, suggesting that the \\"make- believe Nazi occupation of [Winnipeg] was an authentic glimpse of German behavior in German-ridden Europe\\". Surrounding towns were also affected by the invasion: for example, in Neepawa 'Nazi' soldiers confronted citizens in the streets. Virden was renamed \\"Virdenberg\\". A mock attack was planned for strategic targets in Brandon. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a program called \\"Swastika over Canada\\" on the radio throughout the province, along with military music and extracts of Hitler's speeches. Effects Map showing the sale of Victory Bonds in Manitoba The If Day event not only resulted in Victory Bond sales well over Greater Winnipeg's goal, but brought Winnipeg's innovative efforts to the attention of people throughout North America. Life Magazine ran a pictorial spread of the If Day activities in Winnipeg and in smaller centres across Manitoba, photographed by William Shrout. Reporters from several American publications, including Newsweek, The New York Times and The Christian Science Monitor, were also present for the event; cameraman Lucien Roy shot newsreel footage for BBC News. Newspapers as far away as New Zealand included stories about the event. An estimated 40 million people worldwide saw coverage of If Day. The money raised for the Victory Loan campaign on If Day was $3.2 million, which was the city's largest single-day total. Winnipeg passed its $24 million Victory Loan quota on 24 February, largely because of the effects of If Day. The provincial total for the entire campaign was $60 million, well above its target quota of $45 million. The campaign raised approximately $2 billion nationwide for the war effort, and If Day was considered one of the most successful fundraising events of the nationwide drive. Officials had expected a significant increase in army recruits as a result of the event, but it failed to end the long-term decline in recruitment numbers: 23 people enlisted at the Winnipeg recruitment office on If Day, compared to an average of 36 per day for the first half of February. If Day was successful enough to spark imitations in other communities. The US government contacted the organizing committee for details of the event. A smaller-scale invasion was staged in Vancouver, using promotional materials from the Winnipeg campaign. In 2006, a television documentary of the events was made by Aaron Floresco for CTV's local series Manitoba Moments. The work incorporates newsreel footage from the event, as well as interviews with historians and participants. Filmmaker Guy Maddin included a brief newsreel clip of If Day in his film My Winnipeg.

The eastern section of the A5058 connects Breeze Hill in Bootle at the intersection with the A59, with Aigburth Vale in Aigburth at the other end. The road has been described as being the first ring road to be built in the country and was designed around the idea that future growth would require a substantial road, despite no development reaching the area around the road until many years later. The road played a crucial role in offering development opportunities during the early 20th century, at a time when slum housing was being cleared in Liverpool City Centre and land was sought for new housing. History Planning Often described as the first ring road in Britain, planning had been in discussion since the 19th century, with a circular boulevard plan proposed in 1853 although ultimately it did not materialise. Construction of the road began in the early 20th century and was designed by civil engineer John Alexander Brodie. Initially conceived with tram tracks running along the centre of the road, it was ultimately decided that a dual-carriageway formation was necessary in order to handle the anticipated increased traffic volumes. Construction Queens Drive, Walton, Liverpool, pictured in 1909 The first section of road to be constructed was just to the east of the junction with the A59 road. Several existing roads, such as Black Horse Lane and Priory Road were incorporated into the new carriageway, some of which were realigned to fit with the plans, whilst new sections of road filled in the gaps. Extensive parts of the carriageway were planted with uniformly spaced out trees along lengthy sections, long before any planned built development in the surrounding area. The road played a significant role during the 1920s and 1930s, when new areas for housing development were required to rehouse people from slum clearances in the city centre.

This fragment contained portions of six verses from the first chapter of the Gospel of Mark, and was designated \\\\mathfrak{P}137 in the standard classification of New Testament papyri. Obbink and Colomo dated it to the later 2nd or earlier 3rd century, but rumours of its content, provenance and date had been widely discussed since 2012, fuelled by an ill- advised claim by Daniel B. Wallace in 2012 that a fragmentary papyrus of Mark had been authoritatively dated to the late first century by one of the world's leading paleographers, and might consequently be the earliest surviving Christian text. Following publication in 2018, the Egypt Exploration Society, the owners of the papyrus fragment, released a statement clarifying both the provenance of the fragment and the role of Dirk Obbink in the circumstances of misleading information subsequently emerging on social media. The EES stated that the text in the fragment had only been recognised as being from the Gospel of Mark in 2011. In an earlier cataloguing in the 1980s by Revel Coles the fragment had been described as 'I/II', which appeared to be the origin of the much discussed assertions of a very early date. In 2011/2012 the papyrus was in the keeping of Dirk Obbink, who had showed it to Scott Carroll and Jerry Pattengale, representing the Green Collection and its programs respectively. It was not until the spring of 2016 that the EES realised that the rumoured \\"First Century Mark\\" papyrus that had become the subject of so much speculation was one and the same as their own fragment P.Oxy. 5345; whereupon Dirk Obbink and Daniela Colomo were requested to prepare it for publication. In the July/August 2019 issue of Christianity Today, Jerry Pattengale wrote an article in which he published for the first time his own perpectives on the 'First Century Mark' Saga. Pattengale states that he had been present with Scott Carroll in Dirk Obbink's rooms in Christ Church, Oxford in late 2011, when the Papyrus 137 fragment was offered for sale to the Museum of the Bible, which Pattengale then represented. Also offered for sale were fragments of the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John, all of which Dirk Obbink had then proposed as likely to be of a 2nd century date; but the Mark fragment was presented as more likely 1st century. According to Pattengale, he had undertaken due diligence in showing images of the four fragments to selected New Testament textual scholars, including Daniel B. Wallace - subject to their signing non-disclosure agreements in accordance with Dirk Obbink's stipulations; and purchase was eventually finalised, with the fragments agreed to remain in Professor Obbink's possession for research prior to publication. It was not until a gala dinner in November 2017, celebrating the opening of the Museum of the Bible, that Pattengale realised that the First Century Mark fragment had been the property of the Egypt Exploration Society all along, and consequently had never legitimately been offered for sale. He reported this immediately, from the gala. The key backstory and personality profiles in this case are profiled in The Atlantic (May 2020) by celebrated writer, Ariel Sabar.

It revolved around the afterlife of Elvis Presley, the singer who, as Walken himself turned 15, became his first idol. The play, Walken's first venture into playwriting,Simon, p. 72. adopts a surreal tone, and is replete with references to aspects of Presley's life, as well as to other pieces of theatre, including Hamlet and those of Tennessee Williams. While it enjoyed some positive comments, it was largely panned by the critics. Cast * Christopher Walken - Him/Her * Rob Campbell - Rob * Larry Block - Doc/Borden/Taxman/Stylagi * Barton Heyman - Joe/Mel * Peter Appel - Al/Disappointed Fan/Stylagi * Ellen McElduff - Nurse/Dolores/Journalist Synopsis Presley grows exasperated with his brother in the afterlife, and returns to earth to alter his life by fleeing his fame and hiding in Morocco. Taking place in an \\"unspecified present\\", Him depicts Presley (Walken), now deceased and in the afterlife (specifically, limbo, which is filled with Elvis look-a-likes), growing discontented with the antics of his twin brother, Rob (Campbell), who was stillborn many years previously. Rob is responsible for the numerous Elvis sightings taking place, often showing up as a ghost on Earth to fool people into believing that Presley was still alive. Presley relives his death, expressing annoyance at the decision of doctors to terminate life support. He continues to commentate through several surreal scenes, including a segment where a foam-likeness of Presley is tossed around the stage, and when four men dressed in underwear mourn at Presley's graveside. The plot continues, re-telling Presley's death as a disappearing act which enabled Presley to flee to Morocco for a sex change operation to become \\"her\\". A truck driver (Heyman) who recognises Presley, now a waitress at a \\"truckstop\\",Plasketes, p. 103. as the aged rock-star, narrates this segment while wrestling with feelings of sympathy and sexual desire. Music Walken does not utilize many impressions of Presley other than clothing and hair style, instead singing in his own voice, with an occasional \\"Tennessee Williams-style\\" accent. Musical Direction and Sound Design was done by Mike Nolan, who led the band, \\"Organ Donor.\\" The band played the show live every night in the stage right orchestra pit. The original music, written by Mike Nolan and Scott Williams, was contemporary to the audience rather than to Presley. Artistry The main poster for the play consisted of the idiosyncratic Presley hair-style set against a yellow background, with 'HIM' in large, pink lettering in the center. Walken requested such imagery, as it was his main physical impression of Presley.Bucher, p. 178. Walken himself spends a large amount of time during the play in a green velvet jumpsuit and a cape as he plays Presley, aside from the end scenes as the waitress where he dresses in \\"female garb\\". Performances The play was deemed as a \\"workshop\\" and ran for three weeks of previews followed by thirteen performances.Hischak and Bordman, p. 369. It ran for 75 minutes at each showing, with no intermissions. Reception A review by Michael Feingold stated that \\"You [Walken] write good strong sentences - not true of every actor who takes up playwriting - and your reflections on the strange state we call celebrity in America aren't foolish. But you haven't written a play yet. Disjointed as modern art has been, loose remarks, anecdotes, and routines around a theme still don't add up to a dramatic form.\\" Other critics agreed on Walken's performance as \\"strange and rambling\\"Tantich, p. 50. or a \\"farrago of nonsense\\" while critics Thomas Hischak and Gerald Bordman identified it as the oddest play in New York that year. The New York Times, however, gave a more positive review of \\"Christopher Walken's woozily conceived, fantastical new play... In the sharpness and wit of the writing and in the performances by Mr. Walken and Mr. Heyman, this sequence gives you some idea of what the rest of \\"Him\\" might have been.\\" The New York Times does not, however, give a totally positive review, as it also states that the play \\"begins with a certain amount of dizzy promise and ends, approximately 75 minutes later, with the only sequence in the play that comes close to realizing it. In between, \\"Him\\" is cluttered with murky thoughts expressed in windy speeches, illustrated by anecdotes that have no point, though the general idea seems not to be a foolish one.\\" The New Yorker writes that \\"When he [Walken] dons Elvis's cape, he seems ready to take flight.\\" However the New York Magazine theatre critic, John Simon, referred to it as \\"garbage\\" and \\"maudlin masturbation\\". He describes Walken's performance as self-indulgent and scornful. Notes References * Bucher, S. G.

Mack,European Art in the Columbia Museum of Art including the Samuel H. Kress Collection. Volume I, the Thirteenth through the Sixteenth Century, University of South Carolina Press, Columbia 2009, 116-20 He is thought to have been responsible for a group of stylistically related sculptures that is based mainly on their related compositions and drapery forms. Products of the Master's workshop include a large number of reliefs of the Virgin and Child; busts and reliefs depicting the suffering of Christ were also popular, as were busts of children. Various mannerisms can be seen in this group, as well; among these has been what is described as \\"a peculiar feline smile from heavy-lidded eyes and a taut jaw, at its best radiating inward joy but often acerbic or bordering on the manicAnswers.com\\" The name \\"Master of the Marble Madonnas\\" was coined by Wilhelm von Bode in 1886, who noted several points of similarity linking these sculptures to the production of well-known Florentine masters such as Mino da Fiesole, Antonio Rossellino, Desiderio da Settignano, and Benedetto da Maiano but which are generally inferior in quality and execution. Under whom this \\"Master of the Marble Madonnas\\" might have received his training is unknown but it surely would have been in the workshop of one of these masters. Previous attempts to identify van Bode's Master of the Marble Madonnas with either Giovanni Ricci, Domenico Rosselli, or Tommaso Fiamberti did not gain wide acceptance.La Vierge et l'Enfant entre deux anges. (in French) Fiamberti's name did receive the most critical support.Giacomo de Nicola, \\"Tommaso Fiamberti: il Maestro delle Madonne di Marmo, Rassegna 'Arte, 9,73,78 In 2001, Alfredo Bellandi presented evidence connecting the Master of the Marble Madonnas and the sculptures associated with that name to a rather obscure Florentine sculptor named Gregorio di Lorenzo.Alfredo Belandi, \\"Master of the Marble Madonnas,\\" in Masterpieces of Renaissance Ar: Eight Rediscoveries, edited by A. Butterfield and A. Radcliffe, New York: Salander O'Reilly Gallery, 2001,34-40 Gregorio was trained in the workshop of Desiderio da Settignano, absorbing through him characteristics common to the Rossellino brothers. As an independent master, Gregorio di Lorenzo is documented in Florence from 1455 to 1495.Silvia Blasio (a cura di), Marche e Toscana, terre di grandi maestri tra Quattro e Seicento, Pacini Editore per Banca Toscana, Firenze 2007. Gregorio di Lorenzo is known also to have worked in the ducal courts of Urbino and Ferrara, also making trips to Hungary to serve Mattia Corvino and to Italian outposts along the eastern Adriatic. His significance to the Italian Renaissance lies not so much in any particular work but in the overall contribution he rendered in spreading the Florentine approach to sculpture to a wider audience. Works by the Master can be found in various museum collections, including those of the Pinacoteca Civica, in Forl√¨ (Italy); Columbia Museum of Art in Columbia, SC;Charles R.

Strafford is also co-founder of NetStart. He was also co-founder and CEO of successful UK ISP PlusNet. Strafford became chairman of Sheffield Wednesday on 7 January 2009 and quickly made significant changes to the club including signing a charitable sponsorship deal with Sheffield Children's Hospital. However, it was announced on 17 May 2010 that Strafford had resigned, having failed to ensure that the club stayed in the Football League Championship caused by apparent major disruption within the boardroom. Following his resignation Strafford engaged in a corporate whistle-blowing process, exposing various issues which directly contributed to the club's plight, a plight which almost resulted in the club being placed into administration. The club was bought by Milan Mandaric on 14 December 2010. Mandaric's bid was supported by the club's bankers and major creditor, the Co-Operative Bank, in favour of an alternative bid by members of the incumbent board. Strafford made his name with Sheffield-based Internet provider PlusNet. He took PlusNet from 7 to 200+ employees and from ¬£0 to ¬£100 million market cap, with the company eventually being sold to British Telecom for only ¬£67 million. During his time as CEO, the business went through three sale processes, 6 years as a reporting segment of Insight Enterprises Inc, a (NASDAQ listed Fortune 500 business), one AIM IPO, two and a half years as a plc and was eventually sold to BT Group in January 2007. Two months after acquiring Plusnet, BT sacked Strafford. Strafford has spent much of the time since the sale of PlusNet working with Sheffield City Council and the two Sheffield Universities with a view to helping to create more technology start-ups in the region and establishing better support for existing technology businesses. In December 2010 Strafford became a founding private sector board member of the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership (http://www.sheffieldcityregion.org.uk/), working with a specific focus on the Creative and Digital industries agenda for the city region, while also working with the rest of the board on driving economic growth as a whole in the city region. In June 2012 Strafford co-founded Dotforge, a pre-Seed Tech accelerator. Dotforge supports digital start-ups drawn from around the world and supports them through its programmes which are run primarily in Sheffield.

Sometimes also known as Shineway Group in English-speaking countries, the company's businesses include hog raising, consumer meat products, flavoring products, and logistics. It is the largest pork producer in the world, and the largest meat producer in China. Name In January 2014, Shanghui International changed its name to WH Group, though one of its subsidiaries, Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Company, retained the Shanghui brand. The new name is derived from the initials of \\"Wanzhou Holdings,\\" where the Chinese characters \\"wan\\" and \\"zhou\\" connote eternity and continents, respectively. Leadership Wan Long, nicknamed China's \\"number one butcher\\" because of the large number of pigs the company slaughters, is the chairman and chief executive officer of WH Group. Kenneth M. Sullivan, the president and chief executive officer of Smithfield Foods, became an executive director of WH Group in January 2016.\\"Kenneth Marc Sullivan\\". Bloomberg. Operations Shuanghui has 13 facilities that produce more than 2.7 million tons of meat per year. It slaughters more than 15 million pigs a year, but only raises about 400,000; the rest are purchased from suppliers. The company holds more than 500 patents and produces 1,000 products. As of May 2013, Zhijun Yang is the managing director. The company employs approximately 101,000 employees as of 2019, and is 30% employee-owned. History Shuanghui was founded by the Luohe municipal government in 1958 with a single processing plant. Wan Long joined the plant in 1968, and became the plant's general manager by 1984. Under Wan, the company has expanded aggressively. In his first year, he turned around a struggling company, bringing it from a net loss to a net profit of 5 million yuan ($1.7 million). The company introduced its first branded meat product to the market in February 1992. Later that year, Shuanghui formed a joint venture with 16 institutional investors from six countries. In 1994, the venture was consolidated as Shuanghui Group. Shuanghui subsidiary Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Company Limited () was established and listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 1998. In 2000, Shuanghui started a post-secondary educational-work research division. In 1992, sausage sales fueled the expansion of the company which in turn resulted in investors from six countries founding Shuanghui International. By 2006, Shuanghui was the largest food processor in China by corporate valuation, and 131st largest company overall. The company was valued at $1.3 billion, and controlled more than 50% of China's high-temperature processed meat market at that time. That year, Luohe government sold its share of Shuanghui to a joint venture of Goldman Sachs and private equity firm CDH Investments. Goldman Sachs later sold most of its share, reportedly for a large profit, but owned 5.2% of the company as of May 2013. Wan Long was appointed chairman of the company on October 16, 2007. In 2011, the firm set up a sales operation in Japan. Acquisition of Smithfield Foods In May 2013, Shuanghui announced its intention to buy Smithfield Foods for $34 per share, or about US$4.72 billion total. Including assumed debt, the total value of the deal was about $7.1 billion. The agreed purchase price represented a 31% premium over Smithfield's market price at the time when the deal was announced. The two sides negotiated for four years prior to their agreement. Before it was finalized, the deal had to be approved by Smithfield shareholders and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. It was ultimately approved by Smithfield shareholders on September 24, 2013, and the merger was to be completed two days later. Smithfield CEO Larry Pope stated the deal would \\"[preserve] the same old Smithfield, only with more opportunities and new markets and new frontiers.\\" No Chinese pork would be imported to the United States, he stated, but rather Shuanghui desired to export American pork. There is a growing demand for foreign food products in China due to recent food scandals. Smithfield's existing management team would remain intact and no major changes to its workforce would occur. Analyst Derek Scissors said companies such as Shuanghui are \\"not looking to cause any trouble in the American market ...They want to gain from what the U.S. is able to do.\\" China has been a net importer of pork since 2008. The deal was the largest ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese company, roughly doubling the number of US jobs tied to direct investment by China. Smithfield ceased to be publicly traded at the deal's completion. In July 2013, Shuanghui announced its plan to list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover. The IPO was expected to see the firm valued at around $4 billion. However, the IPO plan was ultimately scrapped in 2014. In 2016, WH Group's profits increased by more than 17 percent. This increase in profitability was primarily driven by expansion of Smithfield Foods. In 2016, Smithfield Foods acquired California-based Clougherty Packing from Hormel Foods for $145 million. Numerous brands were included in the acquisition such as Farmer John and Saag's Specialty Meats. Clougherty had a large selection of pork products and a large sales network in the southwestern United States. Smithfield also acquired hog farms in Arizona, California, and Wyoming as part of the deal. In 2017, Smithfield Foods acquired the remaining 66.5% of the equity in Pini Polonia. After the acquisition, it became wholly owned by Smithfield Foods. Pini Polonia has a slaughterhouse in Poland. The firm also has facilities in Italy and Hungary. The deal included the acquisition of Pini Polska, Hamburger Pini, and Royal Chicken. The price paid was not disclosed. In late March 2020, WH Group announced that the spread of COVID-19 had a very limited impact on its operations and sales in the US and China. The company said 95% of its operations were back to normal.

He worked for RT√â from 1992 to 2009. He was appointed Economics Editor in 1996. During his time in RT√â News and Current Affairs he was named Irish Journalist of the Year for uncovering a major tax evasion and overcharging scandal at National Irish Bank. He has also presented many documentary programmes for RT√â. Lee became a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin South constituency in June 2009, winning a by-election with a 53.4% majority and was referred to as a \\"celebrity TD\\". On 8 February 2010 Lee announced his resignation both from Fine Gael and from D√°il √âireann, having spent nine months in politics. His reasoning was that he had \\"virtually no influence or input\\". He returned to RT√â in May 2010, and presented Mind Your Business, followed by The Business on RT√â Radio 1 from 2010. Early and personal life Lee's father was a motor mechanic and his mother was a hairdresser. Lee was the seventh in a family of eight children and grew up in Templeogue, Dublin. He attended Col√°iste √âanna, a Christian Brothers' School in the Dublin suburb of Ballyroan. Lee is a graduate of University College Dublin and holds an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics where his specialist area was labour economics and unemployment. He is married to Mary Lee (n√©e Kitson), they have two children, Alison and Harry, and lives in Cabinteely. Lee famously travelled to work in RT√â using a Segway, once giving it a test ride live on Tubridy Tonight. Career Lee joined the civil service as an executive officer in the Central Statistics Office. Two years later he started at University College Dublin where he studied economics under academics such as Brendan Walsh and Peter Neary. Prior to his move into broadcasting, he lectured in NUI, Galway and then worked as a journalist with The Sunday Business Post. Lee was also a Senior Economist at Riada Stockbrokers. He also worked as Treasury Economist with FTI and as a research economist with the Central Bank of Ireland. From 1992 to 2009 he worked in RT√â, the public broadcasting service of Ireland. He was appointed Economics Editor with RT√â in 1996. Lee was named Irish Journalist of the Year, along with Charlie Bird, in 1998 after they uncovered a major tax evasion and overcharging scandal at National Irish Bank. He has devised, researched and presented several television series, including Moneybox, More To Do, Winds of Change, and Beyond the Berlin Wall. He is thought of as an \\"economics guru\\". He left RT√â \\"in the late 1990s\\" to work for BCP Stockbrokers. He left the job and returned to his RT√â post the next day. Before embarking on his political career, he filmed a four-part series based on the fall of the Berlin Wall in 2008. It was aired on RT√â One in November 2009. George Lee was parodied in the 1990s comedy Bull Island, where he was seen \\"menacingly staring down the lens of a camera\\", and has also been featured on RT√â 2fm's Nob Nation. Political career Lee (right) with Eamon Ryan (left) and D√©irdre de B√∫rca (centre) at the second Lisbon Treaty referendum. On 5 May 2009 on the News at One on RT√â Radio 1, Lee announced that he was resigning as Economic Editor with RT√â and announced his intention to seek the Fine Gael nomination for the Dublin South by-election in 2009. Lee took a year's unpaid leave from RT√â in May 2009. On 6 May 2009 Lee was chosen as the Fine Gael candidate for the by-election. He was the only candidate for the nomination. He was elected on the first count to represent Dublin South on 6 June 2009. He received over 53% of the 1st preference vote. In total he received 27,768 1st preference votes. His RT√â position was filled by Europe editor Sean Whelan, but only as correspondent. Instead, David Murphy was promoted to Business Editor. When elected, Lee was referred to as a \\"Celebrity TD\\". In an opinion poll concerning support for possible candidates in the 2011 presidential election conducted by the Sunday Independent in October 2009, Lee came third, receiving 12% support, in front of former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern among other high-profile politicians. Lee highlighted the failure of EMPG, the holding company for US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and the potential impact on the Irish taxpayers of the loans given by Anglo Irish Bank to the investors in EMPG on 13 January 2010. Lee saw this as another example for the urgent need of an investigation into the Irish banking crisis. Resignation from politics On 8 February 2010 he announced his resignation from Fine Gael and from D√°il √âireann, due to having \\"virtually no influence or input\\" into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies at a time of economic upheaval. It emerged that on 2 February, Lee met with the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and told him of his intention to resign. Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: \\"I had absolutely no input for nine months. I think I had to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend.\\" Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were \\"certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position\\". He said he had \\"minimal involvement\\" with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton. \\"I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don‚Äôt know how my relationship is with [him]\\" Lee said. Kenny noted Lee had been appointed chair of the party's committee on economic policy and also its forum. \\"I had anticipated a very important role for [George Lee] in the coming period with Fine Gael.\\" Kenny's spokesman later dismissed the proposition that the resignation had implications for his leadership. He cited the public endorsement of Kenny by 20 D√°il deputies over the course of the weekend. Former Fine Gael leader Michael Noonan said he was surprised at the decision: \\"I thought that George Lee was fitting in well\\", adding that he believed he would have been a cabinet member in a Fine Gael-led government. George Lee was criticised after his resignation by Senator Eoghan Harris, who was speaking on the Lunchtime programme of Newstalk Radio. Harris suggested financial considerations and long working hours of politicians were the reasons why Lee resigned. Fine Gael TD Brian Hayes, who was Lee's campaign manager in the Dublin South by- election, said that in discussions with Lee, the latter had complained about \\"a major reduction in his income\\" since leaving RT√â to become a D√°il backbencher. Lee denied that financial considerations had anything to do with his decision to quit politics. Return to RT√â RT√â received a letter from Lee confirming his intentions to return after his leave of absence. The Sunday Tribune said on 14 February 2010 that he would have to wait for three months before returning to RT√â. Exactly a year after leaving RT√â, he returned to the broadcaster on 5 May 2010. He worked as an advisor on the RT√â business desk. He presented Mind Your Business on RT√â Radio 1 on Saturday Mornings as a summer replacement for The Business. When John Murray moved to present his own programme, Lee took over The Business slot on 4 September 2010 on Saturday mornings on RT√â Radio 1. In addition to the radio edition, Lee has presented a televised version on RT√â One, also titled The Business.

Hardware PC's A newspaper can be read on a PC, laptop, netbook or tablet PC in an offline version, such as PDF, or as an online edition, using a web browser. Many newspapers have websites while some even have online archives such as The New York Times. =PC= Although PCs are suitable to read longer texts, the main disadvantage is that a PC is not portable, such as a newspaper. =Netbook= A netbook is a laptop of limited size with limited performance. The number of netbooks exploded in 2008. The Asus EEE with a 7 inch screen and a Linux operating system was one of the first commercial models. Netbook specifications are varied, but most have either Linux or Windows XP as their operating system. It seems only a matter of time before the netbooks also be equipped with a touchscreen. The device will then be much more suitable as a newspaper reader. Many of the current netbooks which use Linux or Windows XP are not optimized for use with touchscreens. The successor of Windows Vista, Windows 7, will have touchscreen functionality. Microsoft will provide a special edition of Windows 7 for netbooks.blogs.wsj.com =Tablet PCs= A tablet PC is a laptop without a keyboard. The orientation of the screen is both horizontal and vertical. For reading purposes, the use of a tablet PC in a vertical position is preferable. At the CES in Las Vegas in January 2009 Asus presented two netbooks with turnable screens. These products combine the advantages of a compact size with the advantage of a tablet PC and would be very suitable as mobile reader.www.engadget.com =Criticism= Most modern computer screens are LCDs. To provide an image on a screen, LCD technology emits light from the screen towards the reader. This makes reading this screen harder than reading a printed sheet of paper where a reader will see the image because it reflects light. For this reason some people argue that a computer screen is not suitable to read long articles. Mobile phones Newspapers can be read on mobile phones either as a webpage, made suitable for the limited size of the screen of a mobile phone, in a web browser, or with the use of a specially designed application. The possibilities to run an applications on a mobile phone depend on the operating system of the phone. Most phones run on Symbian.www.gartner.com Other operating systems are Windows Mobile, iPhone, Android, RIM and Palm OS. Some of these platforms are open to external developers, others are semi-open or closed. PressDisplay.com created an application to read newspapers on the iPhone.www.crunchgear.com The New York Times has also a special application fit for the iPhone and iPod Touch.www.nytimes.com The main disadvantage of the mobile phone is it limited screen size which makes reading longer texts more difficult. The development of beamers, specially designed to work with mobile phones, could provide a solution for this problem. E-readers An e-reader is a device with a screen that is optimised for reading text.www.nytimes.com Most e-readers use epaper technology for display.www.iht.comnews.bbc.co.uk It is argued that issuing a newspaper using epaper has many cost advantages. The market for these devices is heavily in development.www.economist.comwww.newsweek.com Although Apple Inc. has succeeded to be successfully market a product with only one function ‚Äì the iPod for playing music ‚Äì the question is whether consumers will be prepared to buy a device with which only text can be read. =iLiad= The iLiad is an electronic handheld device, or e-book device, which can be used for document reading and editing. The iLiad is capable of displaying document files in a number of formats, including PDF, Mobipocket, XHTML and plain text. It can also display JPEG, BMP and PNG images, but not in color. The distributor of the iLiad is iRex Technologies, a Philips spin-off company. The most advanced e-reader range of iRex is the 1000 series. This series has a display of 10.2 inches (almost the size of an A4) and a resolution of 1024 x 1280 pixels. The device has a mini USB port for communication with the PC and the possibility of SD cards in the stabbing. The 1000 series supports PDG, TXT and HTML and graphics formats JPEG, PNG, POISON, TIFF and BMP. The most advanced version supports Bluetooth and WiFi. It is possible to (limited) to surf with this device. =Kindle= Amazon Kindlewww.amazon.com is an e-book reader, an embedded system for reading electronic books (e-books), launched in the United States by online bookseller Amazon.com in November 2007. It uses an electronic paper display and downloads content over Amazon Whispernet using the Sprint EVDO network. The Kindle can be used without a computer, and Whispernet is accessible without any fee.amazon.com The Kindle 2 will be available in February 2009.www.amazon.com One of the new features of this product is the use of text-to-speech technology to read books out loud. Several authors have objected to this feature, claiming it violates their copyright.www.telegraph.co.uk =Sony Reader= The Sony Reader is an e-book reader. It uses an electronic paper display developed by E Ink Corporation that has 166 dpi resolution and four levels of grayscale. The reader uses an iTunes Store-like interface to purchase books from Sony Connect eBook store. It also can display Adobe PDFs, ePub format, personal documents, blogs, RSS newsfeeds, JPEGs, and Sony's proprietary BBeB (\\"BroadBand eBook\\") format. =Hanlin eReader= The Hanlin eReader v3 is an e-book reader, an electronic book (e-book) reading device by Tianjin Jinke Electronics Co. Ltd. The device, much like others on the market, features a 6\\" (15 cm), 4-level grayscale electrophoretic display (E Ink material) with a resolution of 600√ó800 pixels (167 ppi). The Hanlin eReader V3 is sold under various names, such as lBook V3 (Ukraine), Walkbook (Turkey), BEBOOK (Netherlands), and Papyre 6.1 (Spain). It is also supported by the OpenInkpot firmware. =Cybook= Cybook Gen3 is a 6 inch e-Reader, specially designed for reading e-Books and e-News, or listening to MP3 music or audio-books.

It is noy clear when the product is expected to hit the market. =Plastic Logic= The company Plastic Logic is working on an e-reader. It should be larger, thinner and more flexible compared to the products of Amazon and iRex. The product will be available in 2010. The name of the e-reader is \\"QUE proReader\\"!. Screen technologies =OLED= An Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), also Light Emitting Polymer (LEP) and Organic Electro Luminescence (OEL), is any Light Emitting Diode (LED) whose emissive electroluminescent layer is composed of a film of organic compounds. The layer usually contains a polymer substance that allows suitable organic compounds to be deposited. They are deposited in rows and columns onto a flat carrier by a simple \\"printing\\" process. The resulting matrix of pixels can emit light of different colors. A significant benefit of OLED displays over traditional liquid crystal displays (LCDs) is that OLEDs do not require a backlight to function. Thus they draw far less power and, when powered from a battery, can operate longer on the same charge. Because there is no need for a backlight, an OLED display can be much thinner than an LCD panel. OLED is not yet widely used to display digital newspapers because of the high cost of technology. Most likely the technology will be used for television screens. =LCD= A liquid crystal display (LCD) is an electronically-modulated optical device shaped into a thin, flat panel made up of any number of color or monochrome pixels filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source (backlight) or reflector. Many computer screens use LCD technology. The main disadvantage for using the technology for a reading device is the fact that a reader looks into the light to read from the screen. This makes reading for longer periods not comfortable for the eyes. =Plasma= A plasma display panel (PDP) is a type of flat panel display common to large TV displays (37in. [940 mm]). Many tiny cells between two panels of glass hold an inert mixture of noble gases. The gas in the cells is electrically turned into a plasma which then excites phosphors to emit light. Plasma does not seem very suitable as a display technique for a digital newspaper to read. =Electrowetting= Electrowetting is the modification of the wetting properties of a hydrophobic surface with an applied electric field. Electrowetting is now used in a wide range of applications from modulab to adjustable lenses, electronic displays and switches for optical fibers. =E Ink= E Ink is a type of electronic paper manufactured by E Ink Corporation. It is a proprietary material that is processed into a film for integration into electronic displays, particularly for E-book devices such as the Sony Reader, the iLiad, the Cybook Gen3, the Amazon Kindle, the Readius device from Polymer Vision and Plastic Logic's Reader. The October 2008 issue of the North American edition of Esquire was the first magazine cover to integrate E Ink.www.engadget.com Software Many organisations that publish a printed newspaper also publish an online edition.www.onlinenewspapers.comwww.ipl.org Newspapers can decide to publish the same information as in the printed version online, or choose to provide different articles compared to the printed newspaper.

According to the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Blackburn \\"has claims to be considered one of the greatest engineers of his period in Australia, and his architectural achievements established him as Tasmania's most advanced and original architect.\\"Harley Preston, 'Blackburn, James (1803 - 1854)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, Melbourne University Press, 1966, pp 109-110\\\\. Hosted online at Blackburn, James (1803-1854), by the Australian Dictionary of Biography Online. He was key to the formation of the Department of Public Works in 1839, serving as one of its core members under Alexander Cheyne. On 3 May 1841 he was pardoned, whereupon he entered private practice with James Thomson, another a former convict. Among the notable constructions of the firm was the swing Bridgewater Bridge completed in 1849. After that project, Blackburn and his family moved to Melbourne, where in addition to resuming his architect career and pursuing other business interests, he became city surveyor. His most notable effort in this role was the conception and design of a water supply system for Melbourne which drew from the Yan Yean Reservoir. Three years later, on 3 March 1854, Blackburn died of typhoid, with five of his ten children, eight of which had been born in Australia, surviving him. Life Blackburn was born on 10 August 1803 in Upton, West Ham, Essex, England. He was the third son born in a family of five children, four boys and one girl. His father and all of his brothers were scalemakers. At the age of 23, he was employed by the Commissioners of Sewers for Holborn and Finsbury and later on became an inspector of sewers. In 1833, suffering economic hardship, he forged a cheque and was penalized and transported to Van Diemen‚Äôs Land (Tasmania). Blackburn was listed as a civil engineer and surveyor on the journey to Tasmania and was assigned to the Roads Department under Roderic O‚ÄôConnor, a wealthy Irishman who was the Inspector of Roads and Bridges at the time. In April 1843 Blackburn was assigned as an Engineer to the Roads Department according to an entry in the \\"Blue Book\\" in 1839. In August 1834 he handed in a report to the Government dealing with the water crisis which had been affecting the town of Launceston, Tasmania, for at least 10 years. In October of that year, Blackburn completed plans and sections which were proposed solutions to solve the crisis. In March 1835, the government still did not make up a decision. It was until half a year later when most people agreed on Blackburn‚Äôs proposal and in March 1836, constructions were finally put to work. Alexander Cheyne, who became the Inspector of Roads and Bridges after the resignation of O‚ÄôConnor in December 1835, expressed his confidence in Blackburn. > \\"He is the only person I can depend upon to do many of the duties, and > without his assistance I must necessarily have done them myself‚Ä¶ He is the > only person in the Department beside myself who can survey and level‚Ä¶ I > place more confidence in him than I could in the greater proportion of those > who call themselves free‚Ä¶ If Blackburn from being a convict is incapacitated > from making enquiries, no time must be lost in supplying his place with a > free person qualified to do the duties, if such can be found, which I doubt, > in the colony.\\" James Blackburn 1803-1854 SURVEYOR, ENGINEER & ARCHITECT, > p.5 In August 1836, Blackburn‚Äôs detailed work had been examined by sixteen senior government officials and he was permitted a free pardon in January 1840 which became effective in May 1841. Between 1839 and 1841, Blackburn was involved in the designs of Government buildings and churches. In 1841, he was involved with the completion of Bridgewater Causeway. In August he submitted a proposal with James Thomson but further changes and delays were made. The project was finally begun in March 1847 and the bridge were opened in April 1849. In April 1849, Blackburn sailed from Tasmania with his wife and ten children to start a new life in Melbourne. In May Blackburn was aware of the polluted water pumped from Yarra River for sale directly causing a death rate of 20 per week. He proposed a red gum pipe could be introduced at the corner of Flinders and Elizabeth Streets as an allotment. The water would be directed to a tank and filtered to remove the pollutant before being sold to the public. In July 1853, the construction of St Mark‚Äôs Church, began to designs by Blackburn and his son, also called James. Due to the pollution of the Yarra River, Blackburn submitted a report to the Council in August 1851 suggesting to bring water to Melbourne using gravity from the upper reaches of Plenty River. However, this proposal was declined and another scheme was chosen. Clement Hodgkinson, who had also suggested a scheme, studied Blackburn‚Äôs proposal and said: \\"After visiting the ground I have much pleasure in giving my humble testimony as to the care, industry and engineering talent displayed by Mr Blackburn.\\" The Government accepted the recommendation and the work was carried out. At the age of 51, James Blackburn died from typhoid, the same sickness which killed four of his sons and a daughter.

The memorandum provides a measure of the detailed planning that Frank and other Nazis put into the carrying out of the Holocaust. It includes instructions as to the disposition of postage stamp collections and underwear of the murdered Jews. It is clear that the Nazis were intent in removing everything of value from their victims. The memorandum contains an instruction that the yellow stars that the Nazis forced Jews to wear on their clothing were to be removed before the clothing was redistributed to ethnic Germans whom the Nazis were resettling into occupied Poland. This memorandum, when it came to light after the war, played a key role in refuting Frank's claims that he had no knowledge that Jews were being murdered en masse in the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard.

A fluted quartzite spear point found near the Boaz mastodon suggests that humans hunted mastodons in southwestern Wisconsin. It is currently on display at the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum. Although the mastodon on display at the Geology Museum has long been presented as a complete individual, it was uncovered in 2015 that two bones from the Boaz mastodon were combined with many bones from a different individual, the Anderson Mills mastodon, to form a composite skeleton. History Following a heavy rainfall on July 10, 1897, the sons (Harry, Chris, Verne, Clyde) of farmer John Dosch were checking for flood damage along the eastern branch of Mill Creek near the village of Boaz when they discovered some unusual bones sticking out of the creek bank where it had been partially washed away. The boys excavated the bones and displayed them by a hitching post near the road. The local mailman spread the word about the find and the following week stories about it appeared in the Republican Observer, the Richland Democrat, and the Viola Observer. What was described as an arrowhead was found in clay near a rib. The bones were moved to the basement of the Dosch farmhouse. Later, Frank Burnham, a Richland Center, Wisconsin, attorney and member of the state legislature, negotiated the sale of the bones to the State of Wisconsin for fifty dollars. The skeleton, which is about two-thirds complete and missing its tusks, was reconstructed in 1915 by M. G. Mehl and G. M. Schwartz and is housed in the Geology Museum of the University of Wisconsin. It is estimated that the Boaz mastodon was eighteen feet long, stood nine and a quarter feet high, and weighed six to eight tons.Hopkins, Steve \\"Ancient Creatures Still Speak\\" Wisconsin State Journal June 25, 1989.Palmer, Harris A. and Stoltman, James B.\\"The Boaz Mastodon: A Possible Association of Man and Mastodon in Wisconsin\\" Mid-Continental Journal of Archaeology Vol.1 No.2, 1976.Pease, Harry S. \\"In Search of the Ancients\\" The Milwaukee Journal July 30, 1978. The arrowhead did not accompany the bones when they were sent to the University of Wisconsin. In the 1940s the University received an envelope containing a quartzite spear point. The return address on the envelope was D. C. L. Dosch, Maysville, Missouri, and scribbled on the envelope was \\"allegidly found with U.W. elephant\\". In 1962, the two surviving Dosch brothers identified the point as like the one they had found 66 years previously. The fluted spear point is made of quartzite from the Silver Mound Archeological District which is about 80 miles north of Boaz. Age of skeletons Accelerator mass spectrometry yielded radiocarbon dates for both skeletons. It found the Anderson Mills mastodon dated to 12,910 ¬± 150 calendar years BP. Meanwhile, the Boaz mastodon is one of the most recent ever found, and dated to 12,220 ¬± 190 calendar years BP.

Main idea for the students of Dunya was to think critically, manage resources responsibly, communicate effectively and incorporate a multicultural and international perspective. Dunya School is an IB World School. It is accredited by the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan and the International Baccalaureate Organization. Dunya School has facilities including a library, a computer lab with internet access, classrooms, an art studio, a beautiful theatre with lighting and sound systems, sports facilities, a lunchroom, and buses for student transportation to and from school. Dunya is a day school, where students stay from 9 a.m. till 5 p.m. Extracurricular activities (drama, dance and music, arts and sport, trips to interesting places, etc.) help children develop a wide worldview, work with the community and grow confident.  IB Diploma Programme  Dunya School has offered the IB Diploma Programme for students ages 4 to 18 since January 2009. The Diploma Programme is a challenging two-year programme of international education which leads to a qualification that is widely recognized by the world's leading universities. At Dunya School the language of instruction in the IB Diploma Programme is English. As an IB World School, Dunya promotes \\"international mindedness\\" and supports students to become inquirers, thinkers, communicators, risk-takers, knowledgeable, principled, caring, open- minded, well-balanced and reflective. Students are treated well.  Education policy The learning style at the school is cooperative, friendly and student-oriented. The basic element of the learning process is formed by the students' self-evaluation -- by discovering their own potential, taking on responsibilities, possessing self-confidence and, therefore, using their creativity and imagination in every aspect of life. At Dunya School, in the beginning, the medium of instruction was Azerbaijani (Azeri) with English as a second language. Use of English as a language of instruction prepares children to find links between their community and the world. The students learn and use English in an interactive way, connecting their knowledge with real-life situations, using demonstration techniques. Conversational Club is held for students of all classes to motivate them to interact in English. This makes the students feel at home in an English-speaking environment. Now Dunya School is three lingual, that is English? Azerbaijani and Russian, depending on students\` and their parent's interests. Students learn Italian, Russian, German, Arabic and other languages as well. Art, music, drama, dance, and chess round out the educational program. Qualified professionals conduct classes in these fields that are equally important in developing a balanced character. It is Dunya's aim to educate not just the mind of the students, but to affect their behaviour, attitudes and perceptions effectively, enhancing their self-awareness and self-reliance. The classes aren't limited to the classroom walls. Art exhibitions of Dunya students are often organized at the school as well as nationally, which stimulate their creative activity. Extracurricular activities help children develop confidence in themselves and work with others. There are trips to museums, historical places, national parks, art galleries, theatres, nature, colleges and, of course, to Khazar University.  Organization  The school is divided into four departments related to stages of school education: Preschool (3‚Äì5 years old), Primary (1st - 5th grades), Basic or Middle or Lower Secondary (6th - 9th grades), and Secondary or Upper Secondary (10th - 11th grades). Parent and Teacher Association organizes and supports events and programs and serves as an important link between parents and the school. The school has an internal quality evaluation (self-evaluation) system controlled by Khazar University. The responsibility for developing in-service teacher training has also been entrusted to Khazar University School of Education. Instructors are selected for their knowledge, moral qualities, enthusiasm and care for children.  Preschool  The curriculum is attuned to the cognitive, physical, social and emotional development of each child. To reach the goals of the education program the following activities are performed: * Azerbaijani language practice * Preparatory studies for reading and writing * Art * Music * Games * Computers * English through games * Free time activity The program is improved by songs, poems, and storytelling, which encourage children's creativity and imagination.  Primary school  Dunya Primary School offers its students the academic environment, active student involvement, a balanced combination of established tradition and modern ideas and facilities. Beginning from the 3rd grade, students are taught by teachers specialized in subjects, providing them with greater exposure to different approaches to the learning experience. There are classrooms purposefully designed for each subject. There is no place for memorizing conceptual knowledge, neither is there any homework that doesn't serve a meaningful purpose. The intention is to teach students literacy, basic mathematics and to help them love their school through activities. Slow learners are given extra lessons.  Middle and Secondary School  According to Dunya School's approach, high school education should prepare students for an independent life and the university entrance exam. Qualified teachers support their students to help them become good citizens with critical thinking ability, who will be able to cope with modern science and technology, humanities and social studies.

He was a staunch opponent of Methodism and was regarded as having a \\"troublesome litigious temper\\", bringing Methodist supporters in front of the ecclesiastical courts and having some excommunicated. Life Owen was born in Llanidloes, Wales in 1698 and studied at Jesus College, Oxford from 1719. It is unclear whether he obtained a degree from the University of Oxford, but he is thought to have incorporated at the University of Cambridge (Trinity Hall) in 1741, obtaining LLB and LLD degrees in 1742 and 1751 respectively. After ordination, he became vicar of Llannor with Deneio (near Pwllheli, Gwynedd) in 1723, becoming canon of Bangor Cathedral in 1742 and Chancellor of the cathedral in 1743. In 1745, he was additionally appointed rector of Llantrisant, Anglesey; whilst his date of death is unknown, his successor was installed \\"because of the death of J. Owen\\" on 8 November 1755. During his clerical career, Owen was known to be strongly opposed to Methodism, complaining about the Methodist nature of circulating schools in the area and taking proceedings in the ecclesiastical courts against those who supported Methodists, often leading to excommunication. On one action, he prosecuted a priest who had allowed a circulating school to function in his parish; the case took three years to resolve and, whilst the priest was acquitted, he still had to leave his farm. One contemporary of Owen, the priest John Lewis, said that Owen was \\"famous for a troublesome litigious temper\\" and thought it strange that the Bishop of Bangor would want to appoint him Chancellor.

Common names include prostrate ceanothus, pinemat, and mahala mat. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States where it grows in coniferous forests and open plateaus. Description Ceanothus prostratus in Siskiyou County, CaliforniaCeanothus prostratus is a decumbent (or \\"mat-forming\\") shrub, generally less than 0.3 meters tall and spreading laterally to up to 3 meters. Its evergreen leaves are oppositely arranged and generally oval in shape with 3-9 sharp teeth along the margins. The inflorescence is umbel-like, with flowers of blue, purple, or lavender that bloom between April and June. Its fruit is small and rounded with horned lobes. Ceanothus prostratus in Siskiyou County, California Habitat Ceanothus prostratus grows in the understory of mixed conifer forests, from foothills to subalpine areas. It also inhabits open flats and ridges in areas of low chaparral as well as dry interior forest ecosystems. It can be found from elevations ranging between 270‚Äì2700 meters above sea level. Distribution Ceanothus prostratus is found throughout the Pacific Northwest, ranging through Washington, Oregon, western Idaho, western Nevada, and south into northern California. The southern extent of its natural range is the central Sierra Nevada mountains. Given its elevational range, this plant is also native to many of the other mountain ranges of the Pacific Northwest, including the Klamaths, Siskiyous, Cascades, and Warner Mountains. Ecology Ceanothus prostratus is part of the subgenus Cerastes, a clade of Ceanothus that is generally characterized by traits like opposite leaves, persistent corky stipules, and horned fruits (hence the name \\"Cerastes\\" which comes from the Greek for \\"having horns\\"). This subgenus likely began diversifying at the beginning of the Pliocene roughly 6 million years ago, when cool, dry conditions combined with the uplift of the Coast Ranges to create new and diverse habitats. The closest relatives of C. prostratus within the subgenus Cerastes are Ceanothus pinetorum and Ceanothus purpureus, based on a phylogeny produced in a 2011 paper. Ceanothus prostratus is a common nitrogen-fixing shrub, often found with Purshia tridentata. Together, their combined nitrogen additions to the soil of their habitats may account for 10-60% of annual nitrogen input in those ecosystems. It is also one of only two plants (along with Ceanothus diversifolius) known to be a host for the parasitic plant Cuscuta jepsonii, a dodder which until recently was thought to be extinct but could still be surviving and parasitizing C. prostratus in northern California. Ceanothus prostratus is one of many plants in the region that colonize logged areas, forming brushfields in the wake of timber harvests when more light reaches the ground. Ceanothus prostratus is present in plant communities alongside species such as Abies magnifica, Arctostaphylos patula, Arctostaphylos nevadensis, Pinus albicaulis, Pinus contorta, Pinus Jeffreyi, Pinus ponderosa, Quercus vaccinifolia, and Tsuga mertensiana. Varieties There are two varieties of Ceanothus prostratus. C. prostratus var. occidentalis (McMinn) occurs in the Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains of northern California, ranging in elevation from 270‚Äì1400 m. It forms as more of a low mound than a mat, exhibits a leaf blade folded lengthwise, and has fruit with spreading horns. C. prostratus var. prostratus is the more widespread of the two subspecies, covering the majority of the range of C. prostratus. It ranges in elevation from 800‚Äì2700 m throughout the Klamath Mountains, Coast Ranges, High Cascades, High Sierra Nevada, and the Modoc Plateau. C. prostratus var. prostratus forms as a mat, has a generally unfolded leaf, and produces fruit with erect horns.

It is about northeast of Chipping Norton. Swerford has two main neighbourhoods: Church End and East End. The area between them contains very few houses and is called Between Towns. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 132. Manor Swerford motte The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Swerford was part of the royal manor of Hook Norton, which was held by Robert D'Oyly. The village has a motte-and- bailey castle which is believed to have been built early in the 12th century during the civil war between Empress Matilda and King Stephen. In 1783 Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch commissioned the building of the country house of Swerford Park as a hunting lodge. In 1820 General Sir R. Bolton bought the house. Bolton commissioned the artist and architect Joseph Gandy, who remodelled the house between 1824 and 1829 in the style of Sir John Soane. Church and chapel The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is believed to have been founded by Osney Abbey early in the 13th century. The earliest part of St. Mary's present building is the tower and spire, which were built around 1300. The Decorated Gothic nave may have been built between 1250 and 1350. Perpendicular Gothic additions were made early in the 15th century: the chancel, and the clerestory of the nave. In 1846 the Gothic Revival architect H.J. Underwood added the north aisle. St. Mary's is now part of the Benefice of Hook Norton with Great Rollright, Swerford and Wigginton. The church tower has a ring of six bells. William Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire cast the tenor bell in 1695. Richard Sanders, who had a bellfoundry at Bromsgrove, Worcestershire and was also an itinerant bellfounder, cast the fourth bell in 1723. Matthew III Bagley of Chacombe cast the third bell in 1756 and the fifth bell in 1766. W. and J. Taylor of Loughborough cast the second bell in 1823, presumably at the foundry they ran in Oxford at that time. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the present treble bell in 1998, completing the current ring of six. The vicarage was built in the 18th century. A Methodist chapel was opened in Swerford in 1938. It was closed in 1992 and is now a private house. Social and economic history Old Clock Cottage was built in the 18th century. By 1881 a railway tunnel long had been built through South Hill just west of Swerford Park for the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway. The railway company usually called it Hook Norton Tunnel but sometimes it is called Swerford Park Tunnel. The line's nearest railway station to Swerford was about away at . British Railways closed Hook Norton station in 1951 and closed the Banbury and Cheltenham railway completely in 1964. The tunnel is now bricked up at both ends to prevent access, both for people's safety and to protect any bats that may roost inside. (See Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) Amenities Swerford has a village hall. The hall hosts regular village activities including a monthly market and monthly meetings of Swerford and Wigginton Women's Institute.

Its main production plants are located in Sarroch, on the island of Sardinia, Italy. History The company was founded in 1962 by Angelo Moratti. In 1965 giant Sarroch refinery begun operations. In the mid 1990s Saras begun to operate in the oil wholesale market with its subsidiaries in Spain (Saras Energia) and Italy (Arcola Petrolifera). In the early 2000s the company entered the power generation business, producing electricity from natural gas and, later, from wind farms. Operations View of Saras refinery in Sarroch, Sardinia, Italy. The Sarroch refinery has the highest production capacity of any Mediterranean refinery and a refining capacity of about 15 million tons per year, the equivalent of 15% of the total capacity of Italian refineries. The group sells and distributes oil products directly, and through its subsidiaries, such as diesel, gasoline, diesel fuel for heating, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), virgin naphtha and aviation fuel, mainly on the Italian and Spanish markets. In 2018 approximately 2.12 million tonnes of petroleum products were sold in Italy on the wholesale market, and a further 1.56 million tonnes were sold on the Spanish market through its subsidiary Saras Energia SAU. From the early 2000s, the Saras Group operates an IGCC plant (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle), which has an installed power of 575 MW (managed by the subsidiary Sarlux Srl). The feedstock used by the IGCC plant is the heavy products of the refinery, and the plant generates over 4 billion kWh of electricity per year, which corresponds to more than 45% of Sardinia's electricity requirement. In addition, since 2005 Saras operates a large wind farm in Ulassai, Sardinia (managed by the subsidiary Sardeolica Srl), with an installed capacity of 96 MW. The company is listed on the Borsa Italiana (Code ISIN: IT0000433307, Code: SRS, Segment: MTA).  Controversies and investigations  In January 2007 Milan prosecutors launched an investigation on the listing of Saras for inflated prices. On 12 May 2011 the case was officially dismissed. In January 2009 Oil, a documentary-film on the Sarroch refinery by Massimiliano Mazzotta, was released; the film investigates on the death of a worker on the job and the alleged widespread pollution caused by the refinery. The Moratti family tried, without success, to block the distribution of the film by presenting a lawsuit. In May 2009 three workers died on the job at Sarroch refinery. On 7 March 2014 the Court of Appeals of Cagliari condemned Dario Scaffardi, manager of Saras, and Guido Grosso, ex manager, with a suspended sentence of 20 months (versus the previous sentence of 24 months), in addition to granting an award of damages to the plaintiffs.

Polaroid Eyewear was a part of the StyleMark group and sold to the Safilo Group in November 2011. Polaroid headquarters is located in Padua (Italy).  Corporate history  Edwin Land, born in 1909 in Connecticut, invented Polaroid, the world's first polarizing material for commercial use, in 1929. He founded the Polaroid Corporation in 1937 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company initially produced Polaroid Day Glasses, the first sunglasses with a polarizing filter. In 1935 Land negotiated with American Optical Company to produce polarized sunglasses. Such glasses could screen out glare rather than simply darken the landscape. Land and Wheelwright contracted to begin production of Polaroid Day Glasses, a longtime source of revenue for Polaroid. With venture capital from railroad tycoon W. Averell Harriman and merchant banker and part-time songwriter James P. Warburg, Edwin Land, George Wheelwright, and Julius Silver incorporated Polaroid Corporation on September 13, 1937. Polaroid began the manufacturing of polarizing sheet for windows in railroad observation cars. In 1939 Day Glasses were the source of most of Polaroid's $35,000 profit. Although sales rose to $1 million in 1941, the company's 1940 losses had reached $100,000, and it was only World War II military contracts that saved Land and his 240 employees. By 1942 the wartime economy has tripled Polaroid's size. A $7 million navy contract to work on the Dove heat-seeking missile project is the largest contract Polaroid has ever had, though the bomb is not used during World War II. Polaroid produced a number of other products for the Armed Forces, including a device that determined an aircraft's elevation above the horizon, an infrared night viewing device, goggles, lenses, color filters for periscopes, and range finders. At the beginning of its history Polaroid produced polarized sheets to be used for the elimination of automobile headlight glare. For the same reason sunglasses and filters were used by the American Army, especially for aviation, indeed Polaroid glasses were thought to protect aviator from sun light but also atomic bomb explosions. Cool-Ray was a division of American Optical for the sunglasses. It was the originator of the polarized sunglass as it is known today. It manufactured the lenses using a process that was licensed from Polaroid Corporation. Cool-Ray paid Polaroid a royalty in the early 1940s. In 1965 Polaroid moved its production in Vale of Leven in Scotland, a few years later in 1972 the production of sunglasses was added. It promotes a number of programs in the community on the health theme. Polaroid is the major sponsor of a series of 10K road races, which take place each June over various courses in west Dunbartonshire. In the next decades other plants were opened in Europe, South America and Far East. In the 1960s the designer Oleg Cassini collaborated with Cool Ray and his influence is clear in many Polaroid models. In the 1980s Polaroid launched aviator styles with interchangeable lenses in collaboration with tennis star Boris Becker. Kenneth Grange, renowned designer from Pentagram Design Partner, designed the unique IMAGE style in the 1980s. The original Polaroid Corporation filed for federal bankruptcy protection on October 11, 2001. The outcome was that within ten months, most of the business (including the \\"Polaroid\\" name itself and non-bankrupt foreign subsidiaries) had been sold to Bank One's One Equity Partners (OEP). OEP Imaging Corporation then changed its name to Polaroid Holding Company (PHC). However, this new company operated using the name of its bankrupt predecessor, Polaroid Corporation. Petters Group Worldwide, the owner of the Polaroid brand at the time, sold Polaroid Eyewear to specialist eyewear company StyleMark in March 2007. StyleMark is a global distributor of fashion, sport, and children's sunglasses. In 2011, it was acquired by the Italian group Safilo. In 2018, Polaroid launched Heritage, a unique project that brings together capsule collections from different eras, starring original pieces revisited in line with the latest trends and retraces the brand's history, from the 1930s to today. Each collection features timeless silhouettes reinterpreted with a contemporary twist, embodying an aesthetic that goes beyond fashion trends. The Heritage collection is not just a jump into the past, it is a tribute to the amazing innovation capacity that has always characterized the brand, since its origins. A complete historical collection of Polaroid glasses can be found at Safilo Private Collection, other historical glasses are collected by MIT and MOMA.  Polarization and eyes  Visible light waves from the sun travel in all directions. When this scattered light meets a horizontal surface, like a road or water, a large portion of the light is reflected with horizontal polarization. This horizontally-polarized light is seen as white glare, and masks light that is useful to the human eye, reducing visibility. Horizontal light, however, simply creates glare. Glare reduces visibility and can cause discomfort. Polarized sunglasses reduce glare. By using a sheet of vertical polarizing material, the horizontally-polarized component can be significantly attenuated, reducing the overall light level reaching the eye. This improves contrast, and thus perception of the scene. The core element is the polarizing light filter. UV light absorbers are bonded to both sides of it. These block harmful UVA, UVB, and UVC light rays. Shock-absorbing layers are then fused to both sides of the UV absorbers, making the lens light, flexible and impact resistant. A scratch-resistant layer on both the outer surfaces completes the lens structure.

It first flew in 1934, but no contracts were issued and only one aircraft was completed. Development Air Ministry specification G.4/31 called386 for an aircraft to replace the Westland Wapiti and Fairey Gordon. The task list was long: day and night light bombing, dive bombing, reconnaissance and army cooperation. The specification attracted interest across the British aircraft industry and eight manufacturers were immediately involved in preparing prototypes, three receiving contracts and the others going forward as private ventures. Blackburn became involved only when the Air Ministry extended the role list to include coastal defence and torpedo bombing, Blackburn's speciality. Their contender became known as the B-7 after the Class B marking it carried and lacking an old-style Blackburn-type number. It was built on the Shark production line and had much in common with it.Flight 2 May 1935 The Shark had introduced a new wing construction to Blackburn, each wing having two outward slanting (at about 45¬∞, rather than vertical), slightly distorted N-type struts linked by a single strut from the lower front to upper rear spars. As a result of this Warren girder structure, few bracing wires compared to past practice were needed. The wings were slightly staggered and swept and had the same span and much smaller lower wing as the Shark. Unlike the Shark the wings did not fold; another significant difference was that wing area was increased to enhance the load carrying performance by increasing the chord. The B-7 shared with the Shark the semi- monocoque aluminium-clad watertight fuselage first seen on the M.1/30A and the divided main undercarriage necessitated by the torpedo-dropping role. Accommodation, equipment and armament was similar to that of the Shark. They also shared the 700 hp (520 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IV engine. The B-7 first flew on 28 November 1934. Operational history The B-7 was flown to Martlesham Heath for competitive trials in May 1935 and completed in October that year. By now, the specification was four years old, requirements had changed and there was little official interest in the results and none of the nine manufacturers was awarded a contract. Shortly afterwards, the B-7 was scrapped.

It was an affiliate of the Stanford Financial Group and failed when its parent was seized by United States authorities in early 2009 as part of the investigation into Allen Stanford. Prior to its demise, Stanford International Bank Limited (SIBL) offered certificate of deposit (CDs) at rates consistently higher than those available from banks in the United States. History Founding The bank was started by Allen Stanford in 1986 in Montserrat where it was called Guardian International Bank. Allen Stanford's move into banking utilised funds he had made in real estate in Houston, Texas, in the early 1980s. There was no direct connection between Stanford's insurance business in Texas and the banking business. Stanford relocated its operations to Antigua. The bank's portfolio was overseen by an investment committee consisting of Allen Stanford; his father; Laura Pendergest-Holt, Stanford Financial Groups' Chief Investment Officer; James M. Davis (Allen Stanford's college roommate), CFO of Stanford International Bank; and a resident of Mexia, Texas (where Stanford's US interests were based) with cattle ranching and car sales experience. Regulatory investigation in the United States In February 2009, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the US operations of the Stanford Financial Group, including the bank. On 13 February Stanford was quoted saying \\"the bank remains a strong institution\\". On 17 February 2009, the SEC charged Allen Stanford, Pendergest-Holt and Davis with fraud in connection with the bank's US$8 billion certificate of deposit (CD) investment scheme that offered \\"improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates\\". This led the federal government to freeze the assets of the bank and other Stanford entities. In addition, the bank placed a 60-day moratorium on early redemptions of its CDs. On 27 February 2009, Pendergest-Holt was arrested by federal agents in connection with the alleged fraud. On that day the SEC said that Stanford and his accomplices operated a \\"massive Ponzi scheme\\", misappropriated billions of investors' money and falsified the Stanford International Bank's records to hide their fraud. \\"Stanford International Bank's financial statements, including its investment income, are fictional,\\" the SEC said.New SEC Complaint Says Stanford Ran Ponzi Scheme, Wall Street Journal, February 27, 2009  Subsidiaries in Venezuela and Mexico  In 2007 the bank formed a subsidiary in Venezuela, which rapidly developed a network of branches throughout the country.Simon Romero, New York Times, 18 February 2009, As Others Fled Venezuela, Stanford Saw a Chance There was a run on the bank in February 2009 following the SEC's investigation into Stanford's affairs in the US, and this forced the Venezuelan authorities to seize the bank.Reuters, 18 February 2009, Venezuela seizes Stanford bank after online run It was sold to Banco Nacional de Cr√©dito in May 2009.

The liquidators emphasized that there was a huge shortfall between the available assets and the claims. The claims are around US$7 billion. The assets available are estimated to range from US$73 million to US$1.5 billion. Some of the assets are harder to liquidate, such as property. Therefore, patience will be required to obtain the highest values in the long-term. Another goal of the liquidators is to avoid litigation that could be costly. The liquidators reported that they had met with a number of representatives of various national governments. These governments each have taken their own independent legal actions under their regulatory and/or court systems. The USA is also contemplating a tax lien against the assets that could deprive the creditors of a sizable sum. US$5 million has already been spent by the liquidators. The liquidators established a multinational creditors committee composed of six larger individual large claimants and one attorney representing a number of individuals. This committee does not have legal status in the liquidation, but it is administratively convenient for the liquidator to have a body to work with. The liquidators reported that an interim distribution may be made in the first quarter of 2012.  References  External links * Stanford International Bank Ltd.

Crolius served as the team's fourth outfielder, playing mostly right field, where he backed up Jimmy Slagle. In 1901, his rookie year, he held a batting average of .240 with 1 home run and 13 RBIs. On July 22, 1901 Crolius had four hits which led to three runs scored in a 16‚Äì3 win over the Chicago Cubs. In his second year in the majors, Crolius played for the Pittsburgh Pirates for nine games in 1902, before ending his baseball career. In 1906 he was made ineligible to play with any National club by the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues due to a contract dispute with a minor league club from Toronto. Football In 1898 Fred Crolius was the captain of the Dartmouth football team. He was considered one of the best halfbacks in the game, but received little notice from the media, since Dartmouth was historically seen as having a weak football program. In 1901 as a member of the Homestead Library & Athletic Club, located near Pittsburgh, Crolius served as the team's halfback. That year, he scored the tying touchdown against the Blondy Wallace's Philadelphia Athletic Club. Homestead won the game 6‚Äì5; touchdowns were worth five points in 1901. In 1902, Crolius served as a halfback on the Pittsburgh Stars, a member of first National Football League that was suspected of being financed by baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. During the 1902 season, the Stars won the league championship. Coaching career Baseball After his playing career, Crolius served as the coach the Villanova Wildcats baseball team from 1905 until 1911. While with Villanova, acquired a 116‚Äì45‚Äì5 record. He also served as the manager of the Lancaster Red Roses, where he guided the team to a 70‚Äì58 record in 1906. Football In 1899, he also served as the head coach for the Bowdoin College football team. He guided Bowdoin to a 2‚Äì6 record. In 1902, Crolius was the head coach of the Pittsburgh Panthers football team. That year the team racked up a 5‚Äì6‚Äì1 record. Crolius then coached the Villanova Wildcats to an 18‚Äì38‚Äì5 record between 1904 and 1911.

Produced by Meghraj Shahjirao Rajebhosle and directed by Abhay Kirti. The movie is based on the life of a protagonist who is fed up of corruption everywhere and decides to teach everyone a lesson. The movie is based on the story Phulwa Ka Pul by Sanjeev and Sumitra Motilal Halawai's short story Baavi Kaledide which went on to be adapted into 2017 Kannada movie Sarkari Kelasa Devara Kelasa. The movie was remade in Hindi as Well Done Abba. Synopsis Corruption is everywhere and rules the very fibre of the country. It is a problem that has and will continue to affect all. Especially for Mukunda and his friends for whom there is no respite. Despite holding various degrees, Mukunda and his friends remain unemployed. However, he doesn‚Äôt give up easily; hence he decides to teach the corrupt officials a lesson and hits upon a plan. He gets a well sanctioned from the Govt. The Well is dug and ready when one fine day, the well is stolen. All hell breaks loose as the police are shocked and rattled, the ministers and the bureaucrats are left shaken. Mukund (Makarand Anaspure) is hard working and intelligent young man, who is unable to find a job. He faces a lot of issues in his day-to-day life for the things which he has to depend on. Every public officer he meets like at electricity board, pension office etc. ask him for bribe to carry out the work. Enraged by this behavior and the corrupt political system he decides to fight against the system. He is helped by his girlfriend Lekha (Deepali Sayyad) and few friends. Based upon this help he applies for a government scheme in which the person is entitled for loan approval on getting a well dug. By bribing all the officers in the loop, he manages to get the loan approved without even digging the well. At the climax he files a case in the police station and court about his well getting stolen. At first he is held as a mad man, because a well, a solid structure can't be stolen. But then Mukund presents the proofs on the paper about the well being dug. The court has to accept the proof and declare that the well was indeed stolen. Mukund wins the Lawsuit. However Mukund rejects the decision by himself and explain the people the real situation and warns them about the current state of corruption in the country. The film ends on the note that \\"Today a well is proven to be stolen, Don't let the country to be proved stolen\\" as addressed by Mukund to the people.

He is best known for his controversial restoration of Gripsholm Castle and as the architect of the new building for the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.Andersson & Bedoire, p. 158. Life in summary Lilljekvist was born in Klara parish in Stockholm, son of a photographer. He studied architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology, where he graduated in 1884, and at the Royal Academy of Arts 1884-1887. He worked as an architect in Stockholm from 1888, and was appointed castle architect at Gripsholm in 1895. During the latter part of his life he was active as an urban planner; he was employed in the √ñverintendent√§mbetet, later the National Board of Public Building (Byggnadsstyrelsen, now Statens fastighetsverk), where he served as a byggnadsr√•d (building councillor) and department head from 1918 until 1930.Andersson & Bedoire, p. 158. The restoration of Gripsholm During his time at the Academy, Lilljekvist worked with the art historian Gustaf Upmark in documenting Gripsholm Castle. On his own initiative, he made a restoration plan for the Castle that was shown at the spring exhibition of the Academy in 1888. He continued to work on the plans the following years and when he was appointed head of the restoration work at Gripsholm, these plans were used in a modified form. His plans were influenced by the restoration ideology of Viollet-le-Duc, according to which a building should be restored to its original style and to the state in which its originators would have wanted to see it. The main representative of this school in Sweden was Helgo Zettervall. In this case the ideal was the Renaissance architecture of the early Vasa period (1523-1611). An opposing ideology that would eventually come to dominance in Sweden in the early 20th century was to restore buildings in a way that showed respect for its entire history. Lilljekvist's work was severely criticized in an article in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter by the writer Verner von Heidenstam, who suggested that a sign should be put at the Castle saying in mock-archaic Swedish, that \\"AnÃÑo Domini 1893 gjordes detta gambla hus √¶ndnu gamblare\\" (\\"AnÃÑo Domini 1893 this old House was made even older\\"). Lilljekvist later worked on the less radical restoration of Str√§ngn√§s Cathedral together with Sigurd Curman, a representative of the new ideals.Andersson & Bedoire, p. 158-159. New buildings in the 1890s Many of his new buildings during the 1890s and the years around the turn of the century were designed in a style influenced by renaissance or baroque architecture. He was one of the architects of the new affluent suburb of Djursholm, where he built a chapel and several private villas, including one for himself. For the General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1897), Lilljekvist collaborated with Ferdinand Boberg in the construction of the large \\"industry hall\\" with its cupola.Andersson & Bedoire, p. 159. The cupola was probably influenced by the one built by Martin Nyrop over the main hall of the Copenhagen Exhibition of 1888, but Boberg and Lilljekvist added four high minaret-like towers connected to the cupola by bridges.Linn, p. 59-60. The Royal Dramatic Theatre The Royal Dramatic Theatre He became involved in the project for the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1901. He started with a classical design, which eventually developed a more Baroque character. In the end a he produced a design that took some of the volumes from Neo- Baroque architecture but with ornamental and sculptural forms borrowed from Swedish nature but influenced by continental Art Nouveau, which, by the time the building was completed in 1908, had already started to go out of fashion.Andersson & Bedoire, p. 160. The architect Carl Westman, whose ideal was more austere, criticized the building for its flamboyant decoration. In Westman's view the decoration of the building should be like the ornaments of a knight's armour rather than like the bands and flowers of his lady's dress. Lilljekvist replied that a dramatic theatre need not look grim, like a knight in armour. Thalia, as a woman, could be allowed her bands and flowers. Rather than dressing her in sackcloth and ashes, she \\"may meet us friendly and smiling, as long as the smile is chaste and the dress is white\\".The exchange is described with quotes from the original articles in Linn, p. 110-111. Additional criticism was directed at the theatre building and its architect because of its huge and uncalculated expenses. Lilljekvist was not given any similarly large projects again. In the following years, he worked on several projects for Swedish embassy buildings abroad, and the last decade-and-a-half of his life was entirely dedicated to urban planning. From 1918 until 1930, he served as head of the urban planning bureau of the National Board of Public Building.Andersson & Bedoire, p. 160.

It was founded in 1997 as the Southern Conference League with two Divisions: East and Central. Over time, it expanded and added more and more divisions. It was replaced in 2012 with a series of regional leagues. The trophies The Harry Jepson Trophy was competed for by all the Conference sides until 2005 and the advent of Premier Divisions. Until 2004 it was possible for a team to finish runners-up in their division, qualify for the play-offs and still win the Harry Jepson trophy, hence some champions did not pick up a regional title in the same year. From 2005, the Harry Jepson trophy was solely for the winners of the RLC Premier divisions. Conference sides that remained in the regional divisions competed for a new trophy - the RLC Regional. The Harry Jepson trophy is still contested by teams from RLC successor leagues. The RLC Challenge was a knock-out competition designed to give clubs meaningful pre-season games. The RLC Shield was an optional secondary competition for RLC Regional sides not making their divisions' play-offs. It was first contested in 2002 and continued until 2005. National League Three was absorbed into the Rugby League Conference as the Rugby League Conference National Division in 2007. The Welsh Shield was a secondary Welsh competition for teams which did not make the play-offs for the Welsh Division. It was played for in 2004 and 2005. The Welsh premier division was split into two divisions: East and West in 2006, though this was reversed for the following season.

Construction  The reservoir was constructed in 1869 after the Sheffield Water Committee made the decision in the late 1850s to build four reservoirs in Bradfield Dale to impound water from the surrounding moorland to provide for the growing town of Sheffield. Sheffield had previously received its water supply from the Crookesmoor dams close to the town centre but by the mid-19th century these were becoming inadequate. In addition to Strines, three other reservoirs were built: Damflask, Agden and Dale Dike. Strines was meant to be the final of the four reservoirs constructed; however, Dale Dike was not completed until 1875, having to be rebuilt after the failure of its dam wall caused the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864. Strines Reservoir was constructed with a dam wall of approximately 330 metres (1083 feet) in length and 29 metres (95 feet) in height which flooded an area of 22 hectares. It holds 452,900,000 gallons of water.Yorkshire Water website. Gives details of reservoir.  Etymology  The name Strines dates from as early as the 13th century, when it was mentioned in the Sheffield Court records as the Water of the Strynd or Strynds, referring to the stream that rose on the moors at the top end of Bradfield Dale and flowed down the valley to join the River Loxley at Low Bradfield. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word strynds or strinds as a rivulet or a stream.\\"A Look at Life in Bradfield Dale and the Surrounding Area\\", Joe Castle, Page 19 Gives details of meaning of name. The overflow spillway in spate The dam wall with the valve house at the near end and Brogging House at the far  The reservoir and its environment  The reservoir's main source of water comes off the Derwent Moors, 2 km to the west with the Strines Dike and Foulstone Dike rising at a height of around 500 metres above sea level and converging before flowing down to the reservoir which stands at a height of 250 metres. There are several smaller tributaries to the reservoir that flow off Ughill Moors to the south. There is only one habitation in the immediate vicinity of the reservoir, Brogging House, a dwelling which pre-dates the reservoir by some time, being recorded as being leased by George Woodhead in 1715 and probably significantly older than that. The house stands at the north end of the dam wall and at one time served as the reservoir-keeper's house when one was needed. Today the reservoir is attended by Yorkshire Water staff who can gain vehicular access to the valve house through a locked gate and gravel track that runs along the top of the dam wall. The reservoir's overflow is located at the south end of the dam wall and takes the form of a concrete spillway which is crossed by a steel footbridge. The overflow water goes down Bradfield Dale to the Dale Dike Reservoir which is just 400 metres downstream. Water drawn off for consumer use is piped 7 km to the water treatment works in the Loxley Valley.\\"A Look at Life in Bradfield Dale and the Surrounding Area\\", Joe Castle, Page 33 Gives details of Brogging House. At the southern arm of the reservoir is Pear House Clough, down which flows one of the small southern tributaries. The clough is surrounded by Pear House Wood, an ancient broad- leaved wood with an area of 16 hectares. The wood is part of the New Native Wood Challenge Scheme funded by the Forestry Commission Challenge Fund which aims to manage, enhance and extend native woodland. The wood has been fenced off to exclude livestock to allow new planting and natural regeneration of trees. New species planted are Sessile Oak, Hazel and Holly while much of the regeneration is Birch, Alder and Rowan. The northern arm of the reservoir formed by Strines Dike is surrounded by a coniferous plantation.\\"Information board at Pear House Wood\\" Gives details of Pear House Wood.  Access  Access to the reservoir for walkers is quite good, with a bridleway approaching from the minor public road to the north known as Mortimer Road. From the south walkers may gain access by using part of the Sheffield Country Walk which approaches from Sugworth Road. It is also possible to walk up Bradfield Dale from Low Bradfield using various footpaths which also pass by Dale Dike Reservoir.\\"Ordnance Survey Map ‚Äì Sheet OL1 The Peak District\\", Gives details of access footpaths and bridleway.  Boot's Folly  Boot's Folly. At , high on the south flanks of the reservoir at a height of , stands Boot's Folly, also known occasionally as Strines Tower or Sugworth Tower. This is a folly constructed in 1927 by Charles Boot who resided at nearby Sugworth Hall. The square tower with castellated top and flagpole was built from leftover stone when the nearby Bents House was constructed. The stone for Bents House had come from the disused Bents Farm, Pears House Farm and Nether Holes Farm, which had been demolished because they were suspected of polluting the waters in the dale. It is thought that Boot's Folly was constructed to provide work for Sugworth Hall's workmen during The Depression. There is also a theory, however, that Boot built the tower so he could see High Bradfield churchyard where his wife, who had died in 1926, aged 56, was buried. Today the interior is bare but it originally had wood panelling and a large furnished room at the top where the Boot family could enjoy the view. There was a spiral staircase to the top, but this was removed some years ago after a cow climbed the stairs and became stuck. The Folly is Grade II listed and gives fine views of the reservoir and Bradfield Dale.Follies and Monuments.

The ambush took place near Balamorghab in Badghis Province, in northwestern Afghanistan, and resulted in heavy casualties for the government forces. It was described as \\"one of the most humiliating attacks the Afghan security forces had ever suffered\\". Background Badghis province had seen a marked increase in insurgent activity, In 2007 the number of Taliban militants was estimated at 200, by 2008 it had grown to over 2,000. In March 2008, an Afghan intelligence operation succeeded in arresting Mawlawi Ghulam Dastagir, one of the principal Taliban commanders in Badghis. In September a delegation of elders from Badghis met Afghan President Hamid Karzai, and persuaded him to release Dastagir, claiming that \\"he wasn't an enemy of the state\\". Ambush On 26 November a supply convoy guarded by 200 men of the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan National Police (ANP) left Qala i Naw, the capital of Badghis province, for the village of Balamorghab. Their objective was to supply a police force position in the village, which was considered a Taliban stronghold. On 27 November the convoy was travelling down a narrow gorge near Balamorghab, when it was hit by small-arms and rocket-propelled grenade fire. An oil tanker was set on fire, which blocked the road, and the different sections of the convoy became separated. The insurgent attack lasted several hours, ending only after the arrival of Afghan commandos in helicopters. During the engagement, five policemen and nine soldiers were killed, 20 members of the security forces were injured and 20 captured. In addition 19 vehicles were destroyed and 5 captured by the insurgents. A Spanish military unit was called for help, but the Spanish troops were heavily constrained by restrictive rules of engagement and so were only able to provide covering fire from a distance to support the convoy as it retreated. The incident was described as \\"one of the most humiliating attacks the Afghan security forces had ever suffered\\". When interviewed after the attack Dastagir enthusiastically confirmed that he had led the attack. Aftermath Karzais decision to release Dastagir was criticised, especially after some officials claimed the elders who secured his release were acting under orders from the Taliban. The command of the ANA 207 Corps was also criticised, as the unit had previously suffered losses in other provinces. Over the preceding three years, insurgent forces in Badghis have grown from almost nothing to a strength estimated at several hundred. On 16 February 2009 Afghan officials claimed that Dastagir and his deputy had been killed in an airstrike in Balamorghab. The Taliban later confirmed their deaths.

Background Hinamatsuri, known as the Japanese Doll Festival and celebrated as Girls' Day, is a traditional cultural observance in Japan, held on March 3, the third day of the third month. In 2005, the new city of Yurihonj≈ç was created as a result of a merger of seven towns and one city. Many households had fine Hinamatsuri doll sets, and so in 2008 the new city organized this Yurihonj≈ç Hinakaid≈ç event. The Sh≈çnai area across the border from Yurihonj≈ç in Yamagata Prefecture used to be an important port of call and trading centre for the Kitamae trading ships (). These ships often brought the latest trends and crafts from the imperial capital in Kyoto, among them the traditional Hina dolls, and for over 100 years Sh≈çnai had organised tours with information and maps to enable people to see the beautiful craftwork of the Hina dolls at various places around Sakata, Tsuruoka and the other towns which make up the Sh≈çnai area. The first Yurihonj≈ç Hinakaid≈ç event, in 2008, was largely based around the Yashima area, which already had its own small-scale Hina doll display custom. In 2009, the Hina Doll tour of Yurihonj≈ç tried to encompass the different areas of the newly merged city with over 50 different locations divided into four main areas: Iwaki in the north; Ouchi and Honj≈ç in the centre; and Yashima in the south. There were various other 'side' events including a special train service taking visitors to the Yashima hina doll exhibition sites on the . The event in 2010 was extended further with additional displays at new locations and houses. Tour companies in Sendai offer package tours, such as the national train operator JR East. It has also received coverage in the media such as a feature article in the Sakigake newspaper. A dedicated blog was also set up by Akita Prefecture to promote the event.

It was inspired in part by the exploits of the Black Brunswickers, a German volunteer corps of the Napoleonic Wars, during the Waterloo campaign and in part by the contrasts of black broadcloth and pearl-white satin in a moment of tender conflict. Subject The painting depicts a Brunswicker about to depart for battle. His sweetheart, wearing a ballgown, restrains him, trying to push the door closed, while he pulls it open. This suggests that the scene is inspired by the Duchess of Richmond's ball on 15 June 1815, from which the officers departed to join troops at the Battle of Quatre Bras.Mary Bennett, Artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Circle: The First Generation, Catalogue of Works at the Walker Art Gallery, Lady Lever Gallery and Sudley Art Gallery, National Museums and Galleries, Merseyside, Lund Humphries, pp.144‚Äì149. The woman's dog, wearing a red ribbon like its mistress, looks on attentively. In a letter to his wife, Effie Gray, Millais described his inspiration for the work, referring to a conversation with William Howard Russell, the war correspondent of The Times: The same letter states that he intends it to be \\"a perfect pendant to The Huguenot\\", Millais's first major success, which portrays a similar scene featuring two lovers gazing at each other longingly. Originally Millais intended the two paintings to be even more similar than they are by repeating the motif of the armband used in the earlier painting. He wanted the soldier to be wearing a black crepe mourning armband, with \\"the sweetheart of the young soldier sewing it around his arm\\". The armband idea was quickly dropped as it does not appear in any extant preparatory drawings. Millais reduced the presence of Napoleon to an engraving after Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps, which is framed on the damask-hung wall, and which \\"perplexed the critics with the possible intricacies of cross purposes and rival jealousies\\" according to the reviewer from Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. This refers to the fact that some critics took the print to imply that the female character was an admirer of Napoleon, and so she was trying to prevent her lover from joining the army for both personal and political reasons. As the critic of The Times surmised, \\"her reluctance is due in part to a romantic admiration for this great .\\" Other critics suggest the print was intended to allude to both the Waterloo campaign and to more recent events, particularly Napoleon III's repetition of his predecessor's crossing of the Alps by his attack on Austrian-controlled Lombardy in 1859. Creation and reception The artwork took an estimated three months to paint. Millais is reported to have paid particularly close attention to the correctness of the Brunswicker's uniform. Kate Perugini, the daughter of Charles Dickens, was used as a model for the woman seen in the picture. The male model was an anonymous soldier who died shortly afterwards. The two models never actually met. Millais' son says that they both posed with wooden props. He \\"clasped a lay-figure to his breast, while the fair lady leant on the bosom of a man of wood.\\"J.G. Millais, The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, Methuen, vol 1, p.353-4; 495 It was also bought for the highest price Millais had ever received from dealer and publisher Ernest Gambart‚Äî100 guineas (¬£105). He sold it on to the well-known Pre-Raphaelite collector Thomas Plint.Russell Ash, Victorian Masters and Their Art, Pavilion, p. 340. Later, in 1898, William Hesketh Lever purchased the work for his private collection. The painting followed a period of relative lack of success for Millais, and its similarity to A Huguenot is widely interpreted as an attempt to repeat his earlier success. It was engraved in mezzotint by T.L. Atkinson in 1864. Millais also painted two watercolour copies of the composition.

In his later years his wife committed him unjustly to the Asylum of Charenton under a lettre de cachet, an incident which because it illustrated the despotic and arbitrary nature of the legal system of the ancien r√©gime became a cause c√©l√®bre known as the Affaire Sanois on the eve of the Revolution, in the course of which the count also became increasingly well known for his many political pamphlets. Biography The Comte de Sanois was born in 1723 near Vitr√© in Brittany into an old aristocratic family, whose properties included the fief of Sanois in Annet- sur-Marne, and Pantin. In 1745, he joined the prestigious regiment of the Gardes Fran√ßaises and shortly afterwards was present at the Battle of Fontenoy. Soon after his marriage in 1761, he left military service and withdrew to his estates. His wife, however, the only daughter of a rich counsellor of the Parlement de Paris, was not happy at the prospect of a quiet country life. Despite some legacies which made the couple relatively wealthy, they nevertheless fell into debt, which caused many domestic disputes and eventually a public drama. In 1785, in despair at his financial position and crippled by illness, de Sanois fled to Lausanne. Under the mistaken impression that he had taken with him what remained of their fortune, his wife obtained a lettre de cachet from Lenoir, lieutenant-general of police, under which a police inspector was authorised to follow him and force him to return, whereupon he was imprisoned in the Asylum of Charenton. Ceaselessly protesting his innocence, he was finally released after nine months and immediately began proceedings against his wife to compel her to abandon her request for separation and to clear his good name and reputation. The Sanois Affair  Memoir of Lacretelle In 1786 the Sanois Affair (Affaire Sanois) erupted into an extremely tense social climate which transformed what would otherwise have been a banal private case into a headline-grabbing lawsuit. There was huge public indignation over the principle of the lettre de cachet, a symbol of despotism, and there was sympathy for the unfortunate old man whom his unnatural wife had had thrown into Charenton. The business thus lent itself to media exploitation by ambitious and talented lawyers like Pierre Louis de Lacretelle, the new champion of individual freedoms. De Lacretelle dashed off his Memoir for the Comte de Sanois which denounces in passing the abusive use of the lettre de cachet. Exempt from censorship, the legal memoir (m√©moire judiciaire or factum) had become a fashionable literary genre. Initially a straightforward working document written by lawyers for the judges, it had now become a means of communication of frightening power which circulated among the salons and the coffee houses. Thanks to this currency of the legal memoir, readers could easily become engaged in famous cases such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace or the Kornmann case. The press also played a decisive part in provoking the curiosity of the public. Among the publications which revealed the background and details of topical affairs, one of the most reliable is certainly the \\"M√©moires secrets\\", an anonymous serial published over many years Various authors have been credited with contributing to it, among them a certain Mouffle d‚ÄôAngerville, to whom are attributed no less than thirty-four articles favourable to the Comte de Sanois. In 1788, the count assembled these articles and amplified them with his own comments in a work entitled Mon honneur finalement justifi√© (\\"My honour finally justified\\"). Although he rectifies some errors, generally his tone is highly enthusiastic before the authenticity of these chronicles: \\"Sirs, you have reproduced this scene with such exactitude that there is not a comma to remove here, nor a point to be added there.\\" The defence of the countess was undertaken by the lawyer Tronson du Coudray. In 1787, the lawsuit concluded in a compromise: Mme de Sanois was to keep the totality of the couple's goods but agreed to pay an income to her husband and acknowledged that her charges against him were unfounded. De Sanois then went into exile again, this time at Neuch√¢tel, where he hoped to publish the full account of his misfortunes with the Soci√©t√© Typographique de Neuch√¢tel. But apparently he encountered some difficulties. It was with joy that he learnt the news of the convocation of the Estates-General in 1789 and returned to Paris to make his voice heard against the lettres de cachets and ministerial despotism. He was initially closely aligned to the patriots who were demanding reforms, and full of enthusiasm published booklet after booklet in support of the Revolution. Although he was the feudal lord of Pantin (near Paris), he even had printed the cahiers de dol√©ances (\\"lists of grievances\\") of his own parish, accompanied by his own annotations. As Lacretelle observed, \\"He initially turned to the ideas of freedom: but soon, the abuses that were made of it turned him against them\\". Faithful to the king and religion, he was then imprisoned as a counter-revolutionary. Although arrested twice, he escaped the guillotine and died in Paris on the 24 pluvi√¥se in year VII, or 12 February 1799. Works The Comte de Sanois was an original personality, unrepentant, as a litigant confident of his own right and good faith, but became inebriated by the notoriety he acquired in 1786. He took advantage of the contemporary wind of reform to present his ideas and by the time of his death had produced about fifty political booklets strewn with many autobiographical testimonies.

Biography First years Marcel Rajman was born on 1 May 1923 in Warsaw. He came to France with his parents at the age of eight. At ten, he joined the Pionniers and the working men's sports club Yask. Making up for lost time, he studied with ease and passed his brevet √©l√©mentaire aged 15. He started working with his parents, as a textile worker. Second World War  Commemorative plaque for Marcel Rajman at No. 1, rue des Immeubles-Industriels After the first groups of the Jeunesses communistes were formed, Rajman readily joined them and fought actively until the beginning of 1942, participating in illegal demonstrations, putting up posters, leafleting and other activity. He became in charge of the Jeunesses communistes in the 11th arrondissement. At the beginning of 1942, Rajman asked to join the 2nd Jewish division of the Francs-tireurs et partisans. He was accepted, distinguishing himself by bravery and intelligence. He was named to train new fighters, which role he gladly accepted. When the Czech grouping of the FTP was formed, he was sent to teach them the partisans military skills. He was completely successful, and the first operation against the Germans at the Pont des Arts caused a big stir. When the Armenian detachment was formed, Rajman was sent as an inspector. Notably, the first operation of Missak Manouchian, at Levallois, took place under Rajman's leadership. On 15 June 1943, in front of the address 17 rue Mirabeau in the 16th arrondissement, Rajman and Ernest Blankopf threw a volley of grenades at a coach belonging to the Kriegsmarine. The Germans returned fire. Rajman, sought by all the police forces, managed to escape, while Blankopf was gravely wounded, and, not to be taken alive, shot himself in the head. During summer 1943, the FTP-MOI decided to assassinate the commandant of Greater Paris, General von Schaumburg, who was responsible for signing the posters displayed in Paris announcing the execution of resistance members. The FTP-MOI informants spotted him, a well groomed officer who rode on horseback to the Bois de Boulogne every day escorted by two guards. After his excursion, he went up the avenue Rapha√´l and into the courtyard of a luxurious hotel, before taking his official car which drove him to the h√¥tel Meurice. His journey being predictable, Rajman, Raymond Kojiski and L√©o Kneller decided to act. On 28 July 1943, the three men attacked the car, throwing a grenade, and succeeded in getting away. However, they missed their target; furthermore, it was not von Schaumburg who was in the car on that day, but lieutenant colonel Moritz von Maliber, a high-ranking member of von Schaumburgs staff. Thenceforth, Rajman became a major target, and his hideaway at rue de Belleville, Paris, was soon known to the Renseignements g√©n√©raux. However, the RG preferred to prolong their surveillance in the hope that it would lead to more arrests. In July and August 1943, the Brigades Sp√©ciales n¬∞ 2 of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux concentrated their efforts on the \\"terrorists\\" of the MOI. Rajman, in charge of the train derailing group and of execution, Missak Manouchian, the military commander, and L√©o Kneller, a veteran fighter, were the most wanted men. At the beginning of 1943, Lejb Goldberg ‚Äì a fierce partisan since his parents were arrested and killed in the July 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du V√©lodrome d'Hiver) ‚Äì was identified and followed to a particular address, 9b passage de Stinville. He left accompanied by Rajman, and they were followed by Inspector Constant of the RG. By the end of the summer, almost all the MOI fighters has been spotted. In enemy hands Rajman was arrested by the Brigades Sp√©ciales on 16 November 1943 at a rendezvous with Olga Bancic. He was indicted in the trial of the FTP-MOI members which took place on 17‚Äì18 February 1944. He was one of the ten fighters depicted on the Affiche rouge propaganda poster which was displayed throughout Paris. The German military tribunal sentenced him to death. He was shot at the fort Mont Val√©rien on 21 February 1944 along with 21 other members of the Manouchian group. Legacy He is portrayed by actor Robinson St√©venin in the 2009 French film The Army of Crime directed by Robert Gu√©diguian. Portrait Rajman's profile among the BS2 police read as follows: \\"Facult√©: 19 ans, corpulence trapue, visage rond, cheveux ch√¢tain fonc√©, fris√©s et abondants, chandail bleu marine √† col roul√©, pardessus bleu √† martingale, souliers noirs, porte une serviette sous le bras.\\" (Facult√©: 19 years old, stocky build, round face, thick curly dark brown hair, navy blue sweater with turtleneck, blue martingale overcoat, black shoes, carries a satchel under his arm.)

It is a selection of what were judged to be the best poetic and prose pieces from the late Warring States period (c. 300 BC) to the early Liang dynasty (c. AD 500), excluding the Chinese Classics and philosophical texts. The Wen Xuan preserves most of the greatest fu rhapsody and shi poetry pieces from the Qin and Han dynasties, and for much of pre-modern history was one of the primary sources of literary knowledge for educated Chinese.Knechtges (1982): 1. The Wen Xuan was compiled between AD 520 and 530 in the city of Jiankang (modern Nanjing) during the Liang dynasty by Xiao Tong, the eldest son of Emperor Wu of Liang, and a group of scholars he had assembled. The Liang dynasty, though short- lived, was a period of intense literary activity, and the ruling Xiao family ensured that eminent writers and scholars were frequently invited to the imperial and provincial courts.Knechtges (1982): 4. As Crown Prince, Xiao Tong received the best classical Chinese education available and began selecting pieces for his new anthology in his early twenties. The Wen Xuan contains 761 separate pieces organized into 37 literary categories, the largest and most well known being \\"Rhapsodies\\" (fu) and \\"Lyric Poetry\\" (shi). Study of the Wen Xuan enjoyed immense popularity during the Tang dynasty (618907), and its study rivalled that of the Five Classics during that period. The Wen Xuan was required reading for any aspiring scholar and official even into the Song dynasty. Throughout the Yuan and Ming dynasties study of the Wen Xuan lapsed out of popularity, though the great philologists of the Qing dynasty revived its study to some extent. Three volumes of the first full English translation of the Wen Xuan have been published by the American sinologist David R. Knechtges, professor emeritus of Chinese at the University of Washington, who aims to eventually complete the translation in five additional volumes. History Compilation The Wen Xuan was compiled during the 520s by Xiao Tongthe son and heir apparent of Emperor Wu of Liangat the Liang capital Jiankang (modern Nanjing) with the assistance of his closest friends and associates. Xiao was a precocious child and received an excellent classical Chinese education. His two official biographies both state that by age four he had memorized the Five Classics and at age eight gave a relatively competent lecture on the Classic of Filial Piety to a group of assembled scholars.Knechtges (1982): 5. As Xiao matured, he developed a love of scholarship and books, and by his early teenage years the library of the Eastern Palace - the Crown Prince's official residence - contained over 30,000 volumes. Xiao spent much of his leisure time in the company of the leading Chinese scholars of his day, and their serious discussions of literature impelled the creation of the Wen Xuan. His main purpose in creating the Wen Xuan was the creation of a suitable anthology of the best individual works of belles-lettres available, and he ignored philosophical works in favor of aesthetically beautiful poetry and other writings.Knechtges (1982): 19. In the Wen Xuans preface, Xiao explains that four major types of Chinese writing were deliberately excluded from it: 1) the traditional \\"Classics\\" that were anciently attributed to the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, such as the Classic of Changes (I Ching) and the Classic of Poetry (Shi jing); 2) writings of philosophical \\"masters\\", such as the Laozi (Dao De Jing), the Zhuangzi, and the Mencius; 3) collections of rhetorical speeches, such as the Intrigues of the Warring States (Zhan guo ce); and 4) historical narratives and chronicles such as the Zuo Tradition (Zuo zhuan). After Xiao Tong's death in 531 he was given the posthumous name Zhaoming Êò≠Êòé (\\"Resplendent Brilliance\\"), and so the collection came to be known as the \\"Zhaoming Wen xuan\\".Idema and Haft (1997): 112. Despite its massive influence on Chinese literature, Xiao's categories and editorial choices have occasionally been criticized throughout Chinese history for a number of odd or illogical choices.Knechtges (1982): 32. Manuscripts A large number of manuscripts and fragments of the Wen Xuan have survived to modern times. Many were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts and are held in various museums around the world, particularly at the British Library and Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, as well as in Japan, where the Wen Xuan was well known from at least the 7th century. One Japanese manuscript, held in the Eisei Bunko Museum, is a rare fragment of a Wen Xuan commentary that may predate Li Shan's authoritative commentary from the mid-6th century. Contents The Wen Xuan contains 761 works organized into 37 separate categories: Rhapsodies (fu Ë≥¶), Lyric Poetry (shƒ´ Ë©©), Chu-style Elegies (sƒÅo È®∑), Sevens (qƒ´ ‰∏É), Edicts (zh√†o Ë©î), Patents of Enfeoffment (c√® ÂÜå), Commands (l√¨ng ‰ª§), Instructions (ji√†o Êïô), Examination Prompts (c√®w√©n Á≠ñÊñá), Memorials (bi«éo Ë°®), Letters of Submission (sh√†ngsh≈´ ‰∏äÊõ∏), Communications (q«ê Âïì), Memorials of Impeachment (t√°nsh√¨ ÂΩà‰∫ã), Memoranda (jiƒÅn Áâã), Notes of Presentation (z√≤uj√¨ Â•èË®ò), Letters (sh≈´ Êõ∏), Proclamations of War (x√≠ Ê™Ñ), Responses to Questions (du√¨w√®n Â∞çÂïè), Hypothetical Discourses (sh√® l√πn Ë®≠Ë´ñ), Mixed song/rhapsody (c√≠ Ëæ≠), Prefaces (x√π Â∫è), Praise Poems (s√≤ng È†å), Encomia for Famous Men (z√†n Ë¥ä), Prophetic Signs (f√∫ m√¨ng Á¨¶ÂëΩ), Historical Treatises (sh«ê l√πn Âè≤Ë´ñ), Historical Evaluations and Judgments (sh«ê sh√π z√†n Âè≤Ëø∞Ë¥ä), Treatises (l√πn Ë´ñ), \\"Linked Pearls\\" (li√°nzh≈´ ÈÄ£Áè†), Admonitions (zhƒìn ÁÆ¥), Inscriptions (m√≠ng Èäò), Dirges (lƒõi Ë™Ñ), Laments (aƒ´ ÂìÄ), Epitaphs (b√©i Á¢ë), Grave Memoirs (m√πzh√¨ Â¢ìË™å), Conduct Descriptions (x√≠ngzhu√†ng Ë°åÁãÄ), Condolences (di√†ow√©n ÂºîÊñá), and Offerings (j√¨ Á•≠).Knechtges (1982): 21-22; some translations given as updated in Knechtges (1995): 42. The first group of categories - the \\"Rhapsodies\\" (fu) and \\"Lyric Poetry\\" (shi), and to a lesser extent the \\"Chu- style Elegies\\" and \\"Sevens\\" - are the largest and most important of the Wen Xuan.Knechtges (1982): 28. Its 55 fu, in particular, are a \\"remarkably representative selection of major works\\", and includes most of the greatest fu masterpieces, such as Sima Xiangru's \\"Fu on the Excursion Hunt of the Emperor\\" (TiƒÅnz«ê y√≥uli√® f√π Â§©Â≠êÈÅäÁçµË≥¶), Yang Xiong's \\"Fu on the Sweet Springs Palace\\" (GƒÅn Qu√°n f√π ÁîòÊ≥âË≥¶), Ban Gu's \\"Fu on the Two Capitals\\" (Li«éng d≈´ f√π ÂÖ©ÈÉΩË≥¶), and Zhang Heng's \\"Fu on the Two Metropolises\\" (√àr jƒ´ng f√π ‰∫å‰∫¨Ë≥¶). Annotations The first annotations to the Wen Xuan appeared sixty to seventy years after its publication and were produced by Xiao Tong's cousin Xiao Gai. , Xu Yan, , Gongsun Luo, and other scholars of the late Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty helped promote the Wen Xuan until it became the focus of an entire branch of literature study: an early 7th century scholar from Yangzhou named Cao Xian (ÊõπÊÜ≤) produced a work entitled Pronunciation and Meaning in the Wen Xuan () and the others - who were his students - each produced their own annotations to the collection. Li Shan commentary Li Shan (ÊùéÂñÑ, d. 689) was a student of Cao Xian and a minor official who served on the staff of Li Hong, a Crown Prince of the early Tang dynasty.Knechtges (1982): 52. Li had an encyclopedic knowledge of early Chinese language and literature which he used to create a detailed commentary to the Wen Xuan that he submitted to the imperial court of Emperor Gaozong of Tang in 658, though he may have later expanded and revised it with the assistance of his son Li Yong (ÊùéÈÇï).Knechtges (1982): 52-53. Li's annotations, which have been termed \\"models of philological rigor\\", are some of the most exemplary in all of Chinese literature, giving accurate glosses of rare and difficult words and characters, as well as giving source information and loci classici for notable passages.Knechtges (1982): 53. His commentary is still the recognized as the most useful and important tool for reading and studying the Wen Xuan in the original Chinese. \\"Five Officials\\" commentary In 718, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, a new Wen Xuan commentary by court officials L√º Yanji, Liu Liang, Zhang Xian, L√º Xiang, and Li Zhouhan entitled Collected Commentaries of the Five Officials () was submitted to the imperial court. This \\"Five Officials\\" commentary is longer and contains more paraphrases of difficult lines than Li Shan's annotations, but is also full of erroneous and far-fetched glosses and interpretations. Later editions Besides the Li Shan and \\"Five Officials\\" commentaries, a number of other Wen Xuan editions seem to have circulated during the Tang dynasty. Almost none of these other editions have survived to modern times, though a number of manuscripts have been preserved in Japan. A number of fragments of the Wen Xuan or commentaries to it were rediscovered in Japan in the 1950s, including one from Dunhuang discovered in the Eisei Bunko Museum and a complete manuscript of a shorter Kuj≈ç (‰πùÊ¢ù, Mandarin: Ji«îti√°o) edition printed as early as 1099.Knechtges (1982): 64. The best known of these other editions is Collected Commentaries of the Wen Xuan (W√©nxu«én j√≠zh√π ÊñáÈÅ∏ÈõÜÊ≥®, Japanese: Monzen sh≈´ch≈´), an edition of unknown authorship that contains some old Tang dynasty commentaries that were lost in China. Published during the reign of Emperor Zhezong of Song, in the second lunar month of 1094, the Youzhou Prefecture Study Book contained the first compilation of the annotations of both the Five Officials and Li Shan. The later Annotations of the Six Scholars edition (i.e. the Five Officials and Li Shan), such as Guang Dupei's woodblock printing and the Mingzhou printing was the most well-known edition of the Youzhou book. Another edition, called the Annotations of the Six Officials, which had Ganzhou and Jianzhou versions, was based on the Six Scholars edition but altered the ordering of certain sections. In the early 19th century, scholar Hu Kejia produced a collated and textually critical edition entitled Kao Yi (). This edition became the basis for most modern printings of the Wen Xuan, such as the Zhonghua Book Company's 1977 edition and the Shanghai Guji 1986 edition. Influence By the early 8th century the Wen Xuan had become an important text that all young men were expected to master in preparation for literary examinations.Knechtges (1982): 54. Famed poet Du Fu advised his son Du Zongwu to \\"master thoroughly the principles of the Wen Xuan.\\" Copies of the Wen Xuan were obtained by nearly all families that could afford them in order to help their sons study the literary styles of the works it contained. This practice continued into the Song dynasty until the imperial examination reforms of the late 11th century. In the mid-16th century, during the Ming dynasty, an abridged version of the Wen Xuan was created to help aspiring officials study composition for the eight-legged essays on Ming-era imperial exams.Knechtges (1982): 57. Influence in Japan The Wen Xuan (Japanese: Mon-zen) was transmitted to Japan sometime after its initial publication and had become required reading for the Japanese aristocracy by the Heian period. Admired for its beauty, many terms from the Wen Xuan made their way into Japanese as loanwords and are still used.

Russian Empire  A postcard from Azerbaijan to Germany during the Russian Empire era, 1896 The modern postal service in Azerbaijan began in the early 19th century, when Azerbaijan became a part of the Russian Empire. The first post office was opened in 1818 in Yelizavetpol (now Ganja). The first mail forwarding service was established in 1826 in Baku, followed by the second mail forwarding service which was established in 1828 in Nakhichevan. Post offices were opened Quba, Shusha, Shamakhi, Lankaran, Nukha (now Shaki) and Salyan. Russian Empire postmarks and postage stamps were in used in the territory of Azerbaijan from 1858. The early postmarks were composed of dots in different shapes. Dated postmarks with city names soon followed.  Azerbaijan Democratic Republic  Azerbaijan Democratic Republic stamp, 1919 The first stamps of Azerbaijan were issued in 1919 by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and consisted of a set of ten pictorial designs to 50r. There are two distinct printings, a 1919 printing on white paper with whitish gum and a 1920 printing on buff paper with yellow gum or no gum. The first printing is scarcer and forgeries of it exist.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue Part 10 Russia. 6th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2008, pp.353-376.  Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic  Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic stamp, 1921 On 27 April 1920 the Soviet army entered the capital Baku and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was created, which became a part of the Soviet Union (USSR). The first stamps of the ASSR were issued in 1921 and consisted of a set of 15 stamps showing local and political scenes including an oil well and a mosque. Further stamps were issued in 1921 for famine relief and overprints with local control inscriptions in 1922. However the 1923 famine relief stamps of Azerbaijan are bogus, and these were subsequently forged.L. N. and M. Williams, Cinderella Stamps, London, Heinemann, 1970, p. 81. The republic was periodically recognized in sets of stamps honoring the different parts of the USSR. During the entire Soviet period about 60 stamps with Azerbaijani nationalistic and ethnic topics were issued by the central USSR government itself, featuring prominent figures, buildings, flora, fauna, and other subjects related to Azerbaijan.  Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic  Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic stamp, 1923 On 12 March 1922, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia were federated as the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (TSFSR). Azerbaijani stamps were overprinted first in Azeri currency, then Transcaucasian rubles. Overprinted country-wide Soviet stamps were issued in 1923. From 1 October 1923 ASSR stamps were replaced completely by stamps of the TSFSR which were used until the dissolution of the TSFSR and the second refounding of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) in 1936. The stamps of the ASSR were issued again along with the country-wide Soviet stamps which were used until the dissolution of the ASSR and the Soviet Union in 1991.  Republic of Azerbaijan  First stamp of the Republic of Azerbaijan, 1992 On 19 November 1990, the ASSR was renamed the Republic of Azerbaijan. It became an independent country on 18 August 1991 and its first stamp was issued on 26 March 1992 to mark its independence. Unlike most other ex-Soviet republics, Azerbaijan did not overprint Soviet stamps to meet their postal needs after independence. The national postal service Az…ôrpo√ßt was founded in 1992, which was restructured in 1999 and which became the national postal operator in 2004. The national postage stamp company Azermarka began functioning in 1992 and is responsible for the production and sale of all Azerbaijani postage stamps. On 1 April 1993, Azerbaijan became a member of the Universal Postal Union. A variety of definitive and commemorative stamps have been produced depicting topical and local subjects. First day covers and postal stationery have also been issued. The first stamps depicting people were issued in 1993. The first person to be featured on a postage stamp after the dissolution of the Soviet Union was Heydar Aliyev, the third President of Azerbaijan. The first stamps to be issued in the new Azerbaijani currency, the manat, that was introduced to replace the Soviet ruble used for the previous issues since independence, appeared in October 1992, after the introduction of the new currency on 15 August 1992. The currency value of the stamps (in manats or in its monetary unit the qapiks) varies depending on the year of issue. In 1998, 19 sets of illegal postage stamps, were allegedly issued in Nakhchivan, which depict among others, Diana, Princess of Wales and the British pop group Spice Girls. Consequently, Azerbaijani officials have issued notices to the Universal Postal Union, notifying them about counterfeit stamps on popular thematic subjects issued in their name.

Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Bulgaria provides a link in the trade corridor between Uzbekistan and the European Union, with important Black Sea ports. The two countries are interested in expanding trade by this route. However, despite repeated discussions on the subject, Uzbekistan has so far declined to supply natural gas to the Nabucco pipeline, which, if built, would feed gas to Europe via Bulgaria. Background During the Cold War, both countries were previously communist states in the Eastern Bloc as members of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. At that time, Bulgaria, officially the People's Republic of Bulgaria was a satellite state of the Soviet Union and Uzbekistan, officially the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic was one of the Soviet Union's constituent republics.

Following the establishment of the Bulgarian embassy in April 1999, the next ten years saw 21 intergovernmental and 9 interdepartmental agreements signed during the period ending April 2009. Uzbekistan hopes to make use of their increasingly close ties with Bulgaria to take advantage of opportunities available due to Bulgaria's full European Union membership, while Bulgaria is particularly interested in energy security. There have been continued senior-level contacts between the two countries. In May 1998 the Uzbek foreign minister visited Sofia and met the Bulgarian president. During his visit, the Bulgarian and Uzbek foreign ministers discussed economic and transport links. In June 1998 the Uzbek president visited Bulgaria. In May 1999 the Bulgarian president visited Uzbekistan. In November 2003 the Uzbek president met with the Bulgarian prime minister. In May 2004 the Bulgarian and Uzbek foreign ministers discussed diplomatic and economic ties. In January 2005, Uzbekistan and Bulgaria set up consular offices. In March 2006, the Bulgarian envoy in Uzbekistan stated that he was happy with cooperation between the two countries. In April 2007, a Bulgarian minister visited Uzbekistan for cooperation talks. In November 2008 Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov made an official visit to Uzbekistan where he met with Uzbek leader Islam Karimov. The two men discussed all aspects of the bilateral relationship. They agreed to make efforts to increase and diversify trade, making better use of untapped potential. There was considerable controversy when the Bulgarian president hunted for protected animals in Uzbekistan. In February 2009, Bulgaria expressed confidence that the relationship would continue to develop, including a significant expansion of ties relating to tourism as well as further developments concerning trade and cultural exchange Economic relationship and agreements Nabucco Pipeline In June 1998 Bulgaria and Uzbekistan signed seven treaty and cooperation accords. In May 1999 they signed transport and crime agreements. In July 1999, Uzbek Prime Minister Erkin Khalilov said that the Bulgarian Black Sea ports of Varna and Burgas may become Uzbekistan's doors to Europe. Talking to the Burgas mayor in November 2003, Uzbek president Islam Karimov suggested that a formal customs agreement should be implemented to facilitate transport of Uzbek goods through Bulgaria. In October 2004, the two countries finalized three legal accords. In April 2007, Bulgaria and Uzbekistan signed an economic cooperation agreement.

He was a Senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, from 1995 to 2020, and, before that, had served as a federal judge since 1980. Before his appointment to the bench, he was a trial attorney, and a career Democratic politician, serving as a legislator and in two of the state's constitutional offices, as Treasurer and Attorney General. Early life and education Redden was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, the third child of James A. Redden Sr., a dentist, and his wife, Alma. He spent his early childhood in their home on Bronson Terrace at the eastern edge of Forest Park, where for a time his father also maintained his dental office.United States of America, Bureau of the Census.

He was assigned as a hospital medic and witnessed the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima firsthand. He married Joan Johnson in 1951 and took several low-end jobs, including working coding survey sheets for the Gillette Razor Company, and managed not only to earn a belated high school diploma, but went on to Boston College and Boston College Law School, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1954, and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar the same year. Career  Law  After engaging in the private practice of law in Massachusetts for only a year, Redden moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1955 to take the Oregon State Bar exam and a position with a title insurance company. His work as a title examiner lasted only one year, followed by an equally brief tenure as a claims adjuster for Allstate Insurance Company. Neither position satisfied what he would later describe as a growing passion for the law, particularly as it plays out in the courtroom. Redden lived for the next seventeen years in Medford, Oregon, where he built a law practice. He became immersed in politics, quickly becoming regarded as one of the Democratic Party's \\"rising stars\\".  Politics  It was as a favor to a friend seeking a challenger to the incumbent Republican for the 19th District in the Oregon House of Representatives that Redden entered his first political race in 1962. He won the race and served for six years in the House, becoming the party Minority Leader in 1967. As a legislator, Redden was a key figure in some of Oregon's most groundbreaking legislative initiatives, including brokering the deal which brought the passage of the state's 1967 public beach access law. In 1969 Redden moved to the executive branch, becoming chairman of the Public Employee Relations Board until 1972. From 1973 to 1976 he was the state treasurer, and from 1977 to 1980, he was the Oregon Attorney General.  Jurist  Redden was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on December 3, 1979, to a new seat on the United States District Court for the District of Oregon created by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the United States Senate and received his commission on February 20, 1980. He served as Chief Judge from 1990 to 1995, and then assumed senior status on March 13, 1995. He assumed inactive senior status on March 31, 2017. Notable cases In 1983, Redden dismissed weapons charges, from 1975, against American Indian Movement leader Dennis Banks. After 2003, Redden emerged as a central figure in the tension between industry and environmental concerns about the hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River, rejecting two management plans advanced by the federal government of the United States, on the grounds that they failed to protect various species of salmon, as required by the Endangered Species Act, and suggested that if the Bush administration failed to adequately address the salmon issue, management of the dams could fall to the courts. In November 2011, he announced that he would remove himself from the case prior to a new plan that the government presented in 2014. Personal life Redden married Joan Johnson in 1951; she predeceased him in 2018. They had two sons, William and James; James is a journalist at the Portland Tribune. Redden died on March 31, 2020, eighteen days after his 91st birthday, shortly after being treated for congestive heart failure. He had been living in an adult foster care home.

In the special, Brown purports to use the cover of a motivational seminar and documentary to see if he can persuade four members of a group of thirteen businessmen and businesswomen to steal ¬£100,000 in what they believe is a genuine \\"armed robbery\\" of a bank's security guard (using a realistic- looking toy gun). The special was filmed over two weeks, during which Brown tells the viewer he has used various psychological tools, including conditioning, anchoring and suggestion, to get the group into a mental state in which they would willingly try to rob a security guard, without ever directly being told to do so. The anchoring supposedly involved creating an emotional state that combined feelings of invulnerability, euphoria and aggression, that was then tied to various stimuli, such as the colour green, the song \\"Can You Feel It\\" by The Jacksons, and the sight of a security guard uniform; which could then all be presented to the participants when it came time to perform \\"the heist\\". The participants were also asked to perform various deviant acts, such as stealing sweets from a store, which served both to condition participants to enjoy the feeling of criminality, and to identify the four members who would be most likely to perform the heist. Brown said that the show was inspired in part by \\"a vague distaste for the cult of selfishness apotheosised through self-help seminars\\".Derren Brown The Heist Interview, 18 November 2008, Channel 4 The Heist first aired on Channel 4 on 4 January 2006 at 9pm. It was Brown's fifth Channel 4 special. Plot Motivational seminar Thirteen delegates are invited to an intimate seminar in a hotel in Hertfordshire apparently to learn some of Brown‚Äôs skills, after responding to adverts in the press. They had to be open responsive types who would respond well to his techniques; have no criminal record; fall into a typical middle-management income bracket or above; and be deemed psychologically robust enough by an independent psychologist to take part in the show. Initially, Brown sets up tests to see how each of them react to different situations such as an irritating security guard hassling them on the way to dinner to see how they react to authority, and a ma√Ætre d‚Äôh√¥tel presenting them with an unexpected bill after dinner and drinks. During the actual seminar, he starts to focus them unconsciously on the idea of stealing while convincing them that they are learning real skills to keep them responsive and hungry. He triggers motivational states and attaches this to the trigger of rubbing their leg. Brown also uses suggestive language, such as describing the participants as \\"thought criminals\\", titling a slide in the presentation \\"Things to take away\\", and using the acronym \\"K.A.S.H.\\" in another slide. The participants are given realistic toy guns, to encourage the feeling of criminality; they are also given a CD, which Brown says contains subliminal messages that they should listen to every day. The CDs are in fact blank, but they are meant to show the belief that Brown can influence them without them being aware of it. The seminar ends with a group visualisation shifting the focus towards motivation and an attitude of \\"just do it\\" while Brown reiterates the language of criminality. He also transfers a rubbing leg trigger across to a piece of music, \\"Can You Feel It\\" by The Jackson 5 all under the backdrop of flashing green lights. Practicing this a few times means that just playing that piece of music will trigger a very emotional state in the subjects. Stealing sweets The subjects are then persuaded to go across to a shop in Codicote High Street, Hertfordshire, and steal sweets, to reclaim a childhood attitude which is at the heart of the message. The aim is to make them cross the line into criminal and deviant behaviour but in a way that can be framed to sound fun and harmless. Purely because an authority figure has told them to, all but two of the delegates make the decision to walk into a shop, steal goods, and frame it as a positive experience for themselves. (Brown had arranged the experiment with the shop owner, although the shop floor staff had not been informed.) Following this exercise, four people are eliminated from Brown‚Äôs plans. Milgram experiment A week after the seminar, the nine remaining subjects are tested on the limits of their responsiveness to authority. They are organised to take part in what they think is a piece of unfilmed academic research at a university, supposedly looking into the effects of punishment on learning. In fact it was a re-enactment of the well-known Milgram Experiment, undertaken by Stanley Milgram in 1963 to look at how people can commit atrocious acts simply because they‚Äôre following orders. An actor pretending to be another participant joins each subject and the subjects are tricked into thinking they have chosen their roles as \\"teachers\\" in the experiment. The subjects observe the \\"learner\\" being instructed by the scientist (another actor) and having an electrode connected to their arm which is linked to a generator in the second room. The teacher is shown the generator in the other room, which ranges from 15V all the way up to a lethal 450V and then are shocked at a moderate 45V, to show the effects of this reasonably low voltage. The teacher asks a series of memory questions and incorrect answers from the learner receive an electric shock. The teacher is told to increase the voltage each time the learner gets a question wrong. However, responses were played by a pre-recorded CD which the teacher could hear coming from the other room, apparently showing the learner to be in agonising pain and pleading for the experiment to stop. The point is to see whether the teachers (subjects) will call a stop to the experiment or continue to the point where they are administering seemingly lethal electric shocks to the victim simply because the scientist is telling them to. After the experiment, each participant is told the true nature of the test, and that it was filmed for the show. The results of Brown‚Äôs experiment were almost identical to those of the original - over 50% of participants continued up to 450V. Only one of the participants, Victoria, had heard of the experiment previously; she had refused to go on. After the end of this experiment, Brown chooses the four participants who will take part in the heist, based on their behaviour in the experiment and in previous tests. Two of the four participants he chose, Danny and Victoria, in fact refused to complete the experiment; Brown chose Danny anyway because his vocal refusal to go on indicated to Brown a \\"strength of character\\" that he felt would be helpful; and Victoria was chosen because Brown wanted at least one woman in the final group, and he felt that she was the best choice. Final conditioning Meeting with the final four participants, Brown creates a feeling of aggression in them and attaches it to the trigger of a squeezed fist at a meeting in a caf√©. Meanwhile, a green security van drives past the window. The last stage before the heist is making the subjects believe that they have it within themselves to overpower a security guard and to know what to say and how to say it without thinking about it. Brown teaches them what he calls an esoteric martial arts exercise, where they are able to make one another fall using the mental power of \\"chi\\". (In reality the person made to fall does so due to the power of suggestion from Brown.) However, the people apparently pushing come to believe that they have a powerful and invincible state to tap into. The Heist On the morning of \\"the heist\\", the four subjects are individually told to travel into London for a final motivational session. They are each picked up in a car, and while in the car, each one individually gets a phone call from Brown, who delivers the following message, full of suggestion phrases: \\"Make that decision to steal yourself. And grab that opportunity to make all this work really pay off. It's just about standing in the way of security and life and making it do what you want it to do. You're the one with the weapon of absolute unquestioning power.\\"Last night's TV, Sam Wollaston, The Guardian, 5 January 2006 They are then dropped off at the end of Gresham Street and told to walk up the street to the meeting place. They had been told to bring their toy guns with them. The whole area had actually been cordoned off to the public and was supervised by the police. On the street a half-painted green fence can be seen, as well as a large advert for tights (featuring the rubbing of a leg, to try and trigger the extremely motivated state, that Derren had taught them to induced by leg rubbing) with the slogan \\"Do it...go on ‚Äì steal yourself\\". As each subject walks up the street, a car drives past blaring out the loud trigger music (\\"Can You Feel It\\"). They approach a parked green security van and the security guard (an actor) is given the cue to cross the road from the Bank of England holding two boxes containing ¬£50,000 each. The subjects react as follows: * Victoria, press officer / P.A. ‚Äì performs a hold-up * Phil M, security operations manager ‚Äì \\"Excuse me sir, er, sorry to interrupt proceedings, but this is a hold-up, get down on the floor, get down on the floor!\\" * Danny, IT consultant ‚Äì performs a hold-up. * Ally, business development manager ‚Äì walks past the security van (whilst repeatedly glancing at the guard for a considerable amount of time). A large group of helpers and camera crew, hidden around various street corners, rushes in to intercept each subject after their respective experience, regardless of whether a hold-up occurred or not. After filming, all four subjects were de-programmed of any temporary criminal inclinations, spending time with both Brown and an independent psychologist. The three participants who performed a hold-up are shown stating positive things about their experience, although it is unclear whether these were taped before or after the heist itself. To end the show, Ally says: \\"Stealing sweets is one thing, but stealing boxes of money from the Bank of England is a completely different kettle of fish.\\" Reaction The Heist faced some controversy during its airing. John Beyer, chairman of media watchdog Mediawatch-uk, called the show \\"a waste of public money and a valuable waste of police officers' time\\". He also accused it of \\"glamourising crime\\".Channel 4 Slammed for 'Robbery' Show, The Daily Record, 29 December 2005 In a later interview, Brown stated of the experience, \\"It was shocking, actually, how easy it was.\\"Derren Brown interview, David Jenkins, 8 June 2009, The Daily Telegraph Brown stated that the four final participants were all pleased with a screening they saw after the show had been entirely taped; and that he and Danny afterwards \\"became good friends\\".Derren Brown Interview, Ken Plume, Quick Stop Entertainment, 8 August 2007 In a Channel 4 viewer poll for \\"Derren Brown night\\" on 8 January 2011, The Heist was revealed to be the viewers' (as well as Brown's) favourite Derren Brown special.

It was restored - with a plain, modern interior - in 1987 and now serves as a cultural center, theater and museum.Survey of Historic Jewish Monuments in Poland, Samuel Gruber and Phyllis Myers, Report to the Presidents Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad, Jewish Heritage Council World Monuments Fund, Nov. 1995, p. 46 Called the Borderland Foundation (Fundacja Pogranicze), the foundation and its cultural center are dedicated to the cultures of the region: Polish, Lithuanian, Belarussian, Jewish, Ukrainian and Russian. A Klezmer band is based at the cultural center. The nineteenth century yeshiva building also survives, and is also used by the Borderland Foundation.

The M7 was a tube-shaped device, with one end slotting over the muzzle of the rifle and attaching to the bayonet mount, and the other end holding the grenade in place. Blank cartridges were loaded into the rifle prior to firing. When fired, the expanding gases generated by the cartridges propelled the grenade forward with considerable force. The M7 could fire grenades up to , compared with the maximum of achieved by a hand-thrown grenade. Anti-armor (M9), Fragmentation (M17), and smoke grenades (M22) were available for the M7. Development When the United States entered World War II at the end of 1941, all infantry were issued with the Mk 2 fragmentation hand grenade. Owing to its hand-thrown nature, it had a range of only about and could not be used against armored targets. To keep its weight down, it had to have a small charge, with a fatality radius of just . For longer ranges, rifle grenade attachments were available for the M1903 Springfield (M1 grenade launcher) and M1917 Enfield (M2 grenade launcher). These rifles were limited standard, however, and had been all but replaced in frontline service by the new service rifle, the M1 Garand, by 1943. To rectify this, U.S. Army Ordnance designed a new launcher attachment for the M1 Garand, designated the M7, which could fire much heavier grenades up to 250 yards. M7-compatible fragmentation grenades had a fatality radius of . It entered production and service in 1943. Design details and employment An American soldier demonstrating the use of the M7 grenade launcher to fire a practice grenade with a wire or rope attached using his M1 Garand. The M7 grenade launcher was a tube-shaped device with an overall length (including the mounting bracket) of 7.5 inches. One end fitted onto the barrel of the M1 Garand rifle enclosing the muzzle, and was held in place with the rifle's bayonet lug. The other end was cylindrical with a small clip that held the grenade in place by friction. To launch a grenade, a special high- powered blank cartridge made specifically for the purpose (the .30-06 Springfield M3 grenade cartridge) was chambered in the rifle. Using markings engraved onto the device to determine the desired range, the rifle grenade was slipped over the launcher. When fired, the resulting expanding gases propelled the grenade a considerable distance depending on the grenade type, the vertical angle that the rifle was held, and how far the grenade was positioned onto the launcher. Since the device disabled the semi-automatic function of the rifle to prevent damage to the gun from firing grenades, the rifle could not be fired normally when the M7 launcher was in place; the gun could be fired in an emergency by cycling the action by hand. Fragmentation, anti-tank, and smoke grenades and pyrotechnic signals were available along with an adapter to enable the use of hand grenades. One to three M7 grenade launchers were issued to each rifle squad depending on period. It was also issued to support and headquarters elements. M15 auxiliary sight on the left side an M1 Garand. The M7 series grenade launcher came with accessories. The M15 auxiliary sight was mounted on the left-hand side of the stock accompanied by a template to allow it to be properly positioned on the stock. A spirit level allowed the user to figure out the arc of the weapon to aid in aiming the grenade. A rubber recoil boot (part No. B200968) could be slipped on the butt of the Garand's stock to reduce recoil when it was fired. The M7 Auxiliary Grenade Cartridge booster charge, or \\"Vitamin Pill\\", could be inserted into the M7 grenade launcher's muzzle to increase its range by an additional 100 to 150 yards.WAR DEPARTMENT, INFANTRY FIELD MANUAL ¬ß WEAPON AND AMMUNITION TECHNICAL MANUAL, INFANTRY REGIMENT, PARACHUTE, June 1944, Page 41 & 42 These booster charges were made from cut-down .45 Long Colt revolver cartridges, with a small hole in the base and a red cardboard disc inside the case over the charge. The charge was loaded into the launcher's muzzle like a shotgun shell (with the rim keeping it in place) and the rifle grenade was slid into place over it. When the blank cartridge was fired, its flame would travel up the rifle's barrel, ignite the booster charge, and propel the booster cartridge into the base of the rifle grenade. The booster cartridge would fall out of the rifle grenades tail fin assembly in flight. The M8 grenade launcher was similar except it was designed to be mounted on the M1 carbine and used the .30 Carbine M6 grenade cartridge. Users of the M8 needed to be careful to fire it with the M1 Carbine's stock braced sideways, as the recoil could crack or break the stock. Improved models *M7A1 (Springfield Armory T95) [July, 1945 - 1951]: The major problem with the M7 grenade launcher is that it left the gas cylinder lock closed when attached, venting the cylinder. This meant the operator would have to cock the weapon to extract the spent cartridge and load a fresh one from the en-bloc clip. The M7A1 incorporated a spring-loaded piston designed to keep the gas cylinder closed when loaded until the grenade was fired, but then opened to allow normal semi-automatic function. The spring-loaded launcher also recoiled when fired, preventing damage to the rifle. The M1 Garand design was modified to use a hardened gas cylinder lock (marked with an 'H', for \\"hardened\\") dubbed the \\"flat-edged lock\\" (ordnance part No. 7265959). This allowed prolonged use of the new launcher system. *M7A2 [July, 1951 - 1952]: The only problem with the M7A1 was that sometimes the launcher would get stuck when fired or the gas cylinder lock would break. This rendered the rifle and launcher useless and required repair by an armorer with special tools. The jamming problem was solved by using a heavier spring- loaded piston on the launcher and introduced a redesigned grenade retaining spring. The M1 Garand was then modified with a distinctive dual gas cylinder lock (marked with a 'M', for \\"modified\\") dubbed the \\"high hump lock\\" (ordnance part No. 7265871). The launcher had a mount machined into it to take a proposed leaf-sight that was never adopted. *M7A3 (ordnance part No. 7266167) [September, 1952 - 1961]: During the Korean War, it was found that World War II-era anti-tank grenades were useless against the Soviet T-34 tanks fielded by the North Korean Army. A new high-velocity anti-tank rifle grenade called the Mecar ENERGA (dubbed the M28 in US Army service) was soon issued. However, its grenade launcher (dubbed the T119) had the same problems as the original M7 launcher and the M28 was inaccurate when launched from the M7A2. The M7A2 launcher was simply redesigned with a longer tube to fire the improved grenades and could be used with either the \\"flat edge\\" or \\"high hump\\" lock. After the war (from early 1956 to late 1959) it could be fitted with a leaf- sight that was calibrated for use with the M28. The M7A3 kit (ordnance part No. 5750089) consisted of a M7A3 launcher packed with a \\"high hump\\" gas lock to allow the grenadier to upgrade an earlier model M1 Garand to the new specification.

Crisis in the Population Question () was a 1934 book by Alva and Gunnar Myrdal, who discussed the declining birthrate in Sweden and proposed possible solutions. The book was influential in the debate that created the Swedish welfare model. Work on the book In the spring of 1931, Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal and Alva Myrdal wrote an article on Social Policy and Demography. The article was supposed to be published in the Swedish Social Democratic magazine Tiden, but it was never completed. The article, instead, became the cornerstone of the book Crisis in the Population Question which was to be published three years later (1934). The manuscript of the article as well as of the latter book is missing.Stellan Andersson (1999:1): \\"On the value of personal archives: Some examples from the archives of Alva and Gunnar Myrdal ‚Äì with a main focus on Gunnar\\". At: NORDEUROPAforum, p. 15‚Äì32, http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/1999-1/andersson-stellan-15/XML/ In early spring 1934, Alva and Gunnar Myrdal decided to return to this manuscript, to revise, update and expand it into book form. For this purpose, they rented a cottage in the Norwegian mountains. They worked out their theoretical differences and produced a manuscript originally titled Demography and Social Policy. Gunnar was responsible for the historical, theoretical, economic and statistical sections, while Alva drafted chapters on families, children, and specific programmatic proposals.Stellan Andersson (1999:1): \\"On the value of personal archives: Some examples from the archives of Alva and Gunnar Myrdal ‚Äì with a main focus on Gunnar\\". At: NORDEUROPAforum, p. 15‚Äì32, http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/1999-1/andersson-stellan-15/XML/ Content The book deals with the consequences of continued low fertility in Sweden. Sweden was threatened by population decline and thus reduced productivity and standard of living. The authors advocated a series of social reforms in order to overcome this problem. A large chapter is devoted to Malthusianism and neo-Malthusianism as they attack and criticize. They argued that less population growth was not needed but an increase of birth rate was and pointed out that if the fertility rate further decreased, \\"we would at the end of the 1970s have almost twice as many elderly people in relation to individuals in the working ages now\\", leading to serious supply problems. In this context, \\"a positive population policy should not focus on getting a few poor families to give birth to a very large number of children, but to persuade the majority to give birth to, say, for example, three children\\". The occasion of the book was the birth of fewer children, economically and in terms of unsustainable housing for families. The authors proposed intelligent natalism in which families with children should be supported by various reforms such as free medical care, free school lunches, child benefit, more and better housing, affordable housing and subsidized rent. The idea was that both parents could work outside the home and that the prevailing patriarchal family system (professionals father, homeworking mother) must be revised substantially through a program of social engineering. If children were placed in some kind of institution with trained staff while parents work, that would have a positive economic impact as well as educational benefits to each individual child. A very serious housing issue resulted in overcrowding and low-quality housing, particularly to poor children growing up in environments that could lead to \\"physical and psychological harm\\". Sterilization was also discussed in the context of nurture versus nature, the Myrdals sided with Boasian environmentalism. Influence Among the most prominent intellectuals in 1930s Sweden belonged to the couple Alva Myrdal (Nobel Peace Prize, 1982) and Gunnar Myrdal (Nobel Prize in Economics, 1974). Their political ideas and research efforts played a major role in the design of welfare policy in the welfare state time. In the book was formulated the radical reform demands for a community-oriented family policy an issue that caused a lively debate. Background The economic situation in the early 1930s was serious. A recession had hit the Western world, and one million people were jobless. In the winter of 1932-1933, 200,000 people were unemployed in Sweden, and working families were especially hard hit, with one-third of children estimated to have been malnourished at the time. Birth rates fell sharply and were the lowest in the Western world. In inner-city apartments were 1930 instance, only 34% had a bath.

Early life Koba was born on April 22, 1936, in Kumamoto city in Japan. Because baseball was popular in the city, he started playing it when he was in a primary school. Soon he dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player. In 1952, he went on to Seseiko high school, which had a good baseball team. The next year, he participated in the Koshien tournament, which is the national tournament of the high school baseball. After he graduated from high school, he went on to Senshu University but soon after his entering university, his father died. In order to make up for the deficit in the living expenses of his family, he left the university and obtained a job. At the same time, his dream took on a financial overtone as well since baseball players' salaries were very high. In 1958, three years after he started working, with the help of the manager of his team, he became a professional baseball player of the Hiroshima Carp. Career as player In 1958, he became a professional baseball player of the Hiroshima Carp, a Japanese professional baseball team belonging to the Central League, with the uniform number 29. In 1959, his second year as a professional baseball player, his uniform number was changed from 29 to 1 and he secured a regular position at shortstop. He continued to be a regular player until 1968. In 1963, he participated in the all-star game for the first time and in the regular season he was a leading contestant for the leading hitter, together with Shigeo Nagashima, who was the main batter of the Yomiuri Giants, another Japanese professional baseball team. However, in the final phase of the baseball season, he was hit by a pitch in the face and was sent to a hospital. As a result, he ended in the second place with a batting average with .339, which was his best record. After the year, he came to be afraid of inside pitches and therefore he remained in a long slump in batting.Âè§Ëëâ Á´πË≠ò, \\"ËÄê„Åà„Å¶Âãù„Å§\\", Ë¨õË´áÁ§æ, 1975 Instead, he found a means of survival in his ability for base running, especially steals. In 1964 and 1968, he led in the number of steals in the Central League, which the Carp belongs to. The focus on base running later had a great influence on his own strategy as manager.Âè§Ëëâ Á´πË≠ò, \\"Ê±∫Êñ≠„Å´ÊÇî„ÅÑ„Å™„Åó\\", ÁÜäÊú¨Êó•Êó•Êñ∞ËÅûÁ§æ, 1996 In 1970, he was traded to the Nankai Hawks, which was also one of the Japanese teams but belonged to the other league, the Pacific League. In 1971, he retired and was appointed as a coach. Career as manager After working for two years as the Hawks' coach and for one year as the Carp's coach, he was assigned in 1975 to the manager post of the Carp because Joe Lutz, who was the manager at the time, left the team in April, during the baseball season. That year, he led the Carp to become the league champion for the first time in the team's 26-year-long history. He has said that during the year there were mysterious events around him. For example, blue birds, which are considered the symbol of happiness in Japan, came to his birdcage. In 1979, 1980 and 1984 he led the team to win the league championship again and moreover to win the Japan championship. As of 2009, he is the only manager who has led the Carp to win the Japan championship. At the end of the season of 1985, he left the team. As a manager, he put special emphasis on base running. For the 11 years he was the manager, the number of the steals made by the team in one season exceeded 100 11 times. Also, he trained \\"utility players\\", players who can serve as both an infielder and an outfielder, in order to make the best use of a limited number of players. In addition, he requested that the owner of the team build indoor training rooms, which did not exist in the world of Japanese baseball in those days. With them, players can train even on rainy days. As a result of these policies, during the 11 years he led the Carp, the Carp became the top-class, which means the first place, second place or third place, nine times, the league champion four times, the Japan champion three times. In 1987, he assumed the manager of the Taiyo Whales, which was another Japanese professional baseball team, on a five-year contract because he was thought highly of as a result of his work with the Carp. However, he retired from the post at the end of the season of 1989 because he could not bring the team to the top-class. The 873 wins as a manager put him into the 14th place of the ranking table for all the managers of Japanese professional baseball teams. After retirement from professional baseball After he retired from the manager post of the Whales, he became a baseball commentator, and also the chairman of the International Boys Baseball Association Japan, which has been working to popularize baseball in countries in which baseball is not so popular as Japan. In 1999, he was selected as a member of the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, which admits people who have rendered distinguished service to the world of Japanese baseball. Since February 2008, he has been the manager of the baseball team of Tokyo International University. As there had been no ex-professional manager serving as the manager of the baseball team of a university for 61 years, his adoption of the manager role at the university was reported in not only sports newspapers but also some general newspapers.ÊúùÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû, 2007/1/14Ë™≠Â£≤Êñ∞ËÅû, 2008/1/31ÂõõÂõΩÊñ∞ËÅû, 2008/2/4 References Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kumamoto Category:Senshu University alumni Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Hiroshima Carp players Category:Hiroshima Toyo Carp players Category:Nankai Hawks players Category:Managers of baseball teams in Japan Category:Yokohama DeNA BayStars managers Category:Hiroshima Toyo Carp managers Category:College baseball coaches ","title":"Takeshi Koba"},{"id":"21593365","text":"Ervil, Joel, Verlan, Alma, Floren (left to right) Alma Dayer LeBaron Sr. (March 15, 1886 ‚Äì 1951) was a Mormon fundamentalist who was the father of a number of leaders and church founders in Mormon fundamentalism.

Dick. The story contains some common Dick themes such as a questionable reality and drug use. It was first published in Worlds of Tomorrow Science Fiction and was later reprinted the collections The Preserving Machine (1969), The Preserving Machine and Other Stories (1977), We Can Remember It For You Wholesale (2000) and The Eye of the Sibyl and Other Stories (2004).  Plot summary The story follows John Cupertino, a man seemingly under medical care, and his quest to find the truth behind the memory of him killing his wife. It begins as Cupertino is caught speeding by police officers who suspect he may be on the drug 'Frohedadrine' and suggest that he probably believes he is not on Earth but is in the midst of a drug-induced guilt-fantasy and is actually at home on Ganymede. Cupertino disputes this and states he knows he is on Earth but is concerned that something strange is happening to him. To prove this he reaches out with his hand towards the dashboard. His hand disappears within the heavily-padded dashboard. The officers see this and contact Cupertino's full- time doctor, Dr. Hagopian. Cupertino tells the officers he believes this is happening because of the death of his wife, Carol. Cupertino then has a conversation with Dr. Hagopian in which he tells the doctor that the reason he killed his wife was to stop her from telling the media that there was to be an uprising to free Ganymede. Dr. Hagopian gives Cupertino an address where he says Carol is currently living. Cupertino says this cannot be, as she was unmistakably dead after he left her, shot between the eyes with a laser beam. The doctor tells Cupertino he knows this is his detailed memory, but convinces him to go anyway, saying that Carol was there the night he killed her and therefore may be able to tell him how he obtained his false memory. Cupertino arrives at Carol's address in Los Angeles at 6 in the morning. She invites him in and gives him coffee. He says she doesn't look a day older, even though the last time he saw her was three years ago. She tells him that the night he tried to kill her he received no false memory but was aware he failed in killing her. He apparently was offered by the district attorney a choice of mandatory psychiatric help or formal charges for attempted murder. She tells him the false memory was implanted after he visited Dr. Edgar Green, the psychologist at his employer, Six-Planet Educational Enterprises, just before he left Ganymede, and they did this because they knew he had told her of the planned uprising and he was supposed to commit suicide from remorse and grief but instead booked passage to Terra (Earth). Cupertino speaks to Dr. Hagopian while at Carol's and tells him he believes he is actually a prisoner on Ganymede and what he is experiencing at Carol's is an illusion. Hagopian tells him this is not true, he is actually on Terra but is not a free man for the fact that he must remain a patient of his as part of the District Attorney's orders. Cupertino tells Hagopian that he has learned Carol is employed by the parent company of Six-Planet Educational Enterprises, Falling Star Associates. He believes she was sent down to earth as a watchdog to see that he remained loyal and would not tell of the proposed uprising on Ganymede. Hagopian tells Cupertino that this cannot be the case as the uprising happened three years ago and is a matter of historical fact. Ganymede and two other moons overthrew Terra and became self-governing in the Tri-Lunar war of 2014. Cupertino returns to his apartment and contacts Dr. Edgar Green of Six-Planet Educational Enterprises. He requests his case history be sent to him. He comes to the conclusion that they could easily tamper with the file in order to hide any procedure of memory implant. He receives the file and finds that it contains no reference to the implant. He sends the file off for analysis and requests a blood fraction test from Dr. Hagopian for traces of Frohedadrine. The doctor tells him this would not matter; if he still believes the theory that he is a prisoner on Ganymede, then all these things would be illusory too. Hagopian tells Cupertino that Carol is actually a prisoner on Ganymede and that is where he visited her. She is imprisoned because she told Terra of the planned revolt. The doctor tells him that the guilt of him telling Carol and causing the Terra to be alerted of the revolt by Ganymede caused him to retreat into a fantasy world. He tells the doctor that to test his memory of killing Carol, he will return to Los Angeles and try and kill her again. If she is already dead then it will prove impossible. The story continues in Hagopian's office, with Cupertino looking through the Los Angeles Times, searching for the story of the recent murder of his wife. His search is in vain, as Hagopian tells him that he was not permitted to go to Los Angeles because the authorities knew he planned violence. Cupertino tells him he is sure he killed her, walking into her office and shooting her with a laser while her co-workers watched. Hagopian says he now has a delusional memory of killing her twice now. The doctor calls Carol to prove this on a video phone. When Cupertino sees Carol on the display and she acknowledges him, he asks to return to his apartment. On the way home he admits to himself there are gaps in his logic but realizes he could try once more to kill her. He directs his car to Los Angeles to where he believes his wife will be sleeping.

It is a five-story masonry structure, built with load-bearing brick and stone. The Main Street facade has a single storefront on the ground floor, with display windows flanking a recessed entrance, and the main building entrance to its right, also recessed. The upper floors are separated from each other by projecting cornices, and are four bays wide, with each bay occupied by large sash windows. The facade is composed of granite blocks that are structural (i.e. not just a facing in front of brick or other material), while the Austin Street facade is secondary in nature, composed of pressed brick studded with star-shaped metal tie rod plates. Most windows on this facade are set in segmented-arch openings; those nearest Main Street are shallower, and are set in rounded-arch openings. Chester Babcock, its first recorded owner, was a mover of buildings. It was built in the 1860s, probably about the same time as Colton's Block, just to its north.

His Ad n√≤ta (1995) won the Premio Bagutta.  Biography  In the immediate postwar period, the young poets from Santarcangelo gathered at the Caffe Trieste, the bar owned by Baldini's parents. These students rechristened the bar \\"the Circle of Wisdom\\". This gave Baldini the opportunity of getting to know Tonino Guerra, Nino Pedretti, Gianni Fucci, Flavio Nicolini, Rina Macrelli and other artists from the neighbouring countryside. He graduated in philosophy from the University of Bologna then spent some years teaching. In 1955 he moved to Milan to work as a writer, and then as a journalist on Panorama (a magazine that started in 1962). In 1967 he published Autotem with Bompiani, a short opera satirising how cars are seen as a fetish. He self-published a collection of dialectical poetry √â solit√®ri in 1976 in Imola. He published La n√†iva (the snow) in 1982. He won the Viareggio Prize in 1988 with Furist√≠r and the Bagutta Prize in 1995 with Ad n√≤ta. He also wrote for theatre. He wrote a monologue Zitti tutti!, published by Ubulibri in 1993.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It was demolished in 1981; its site is now a parking lot. Description and history The Emory Bannister House was located near the southern end of Harvard Street, a through street running parallel to and just west of Main Street, but up a steep rise. It was a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, exterior chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its front facade was four bays wide, with paneled pilasters at the sides and a fully pedimented gable above. The first floor was sheltered by a full-width porch supported by Doric columns. An ell was added to the north side in 1905. The house was built in 1847, and was one of the first to be built after Harvard Street was laid out. It was built for Emory Bannister, a local politician and businessman who served as postmaster, city assessor, city alderman, and state representative. It was designed by Elbridge Boyden, then early in his distinguished career, and was built by the Partridge brothers of Barre.

It has a surveyed length of 31,490 ft and reaches a depth of 235 ft. The cave is accessible via a path from a gravel parking area on the side of Rocky Lane. Out of the 242 listed, it is 119th longest cave in the United States as declared by the Georgia Speleological Survey. Pettyjohn Cave is a very popular cave for local students and spelunkers. It is a horizontal cave, but a 50 ft handline is the recommended kit when visiting the cave. Pettyjohn Cave is a wild cave, not a commercial cave, and one should only enter with the proper equipment and training, e.g. three sources of light, water, a helmet, boots, and appropriate clothing. Many would-be explorers are injured here each year. Those interested in exploring this cave and others should contact a local caving club, or grotto. Some of the best grottoes in the country are located very near Pettyjohn Cave. Grotto members are involved in conservation, cave rescue, and exploration. Passageways It starts with an easy climb down into a large breakdown passage. A handline is recommended for the climb down to the stream level. One of the most popular and most challenging of passages in the cave is the Worm Tube. The Worm Tube is a long 150 ft crawl. It is a very tight passageway and unavoidable if venturing to the Echo Room and beyond. Other intriguing passageways include the Mason-Dixon Passage and the Pancake squeeze. When going to the waterfall or Raccoon Room, the stream canyon passages and the Z bends can be an alternate route to the Pancake Squeeze. Do not use or trust any ropes or lines left in the cave. Please also help this much abused cave by not damaging formations and packing out trash. Destinations The Bridge Room is a good place to take a rest. You can hang your legs over the edge and listen to the stream that is 80 ft below. The Worm Tube leads to the Echo Room, which is the biggest room of the cave. The Volcano Room is shaped like a large funnel and it leads to the stream passage and the sump. The Over-Under Room and the Signature room are also other popular destinations of the cave. Formations Close-up of rocks inside Pettyjohn Cave (2009) Formations in Pettyjohn Cave include: * Stalagmites that are a type of speleothem that rises from the floor of a limestone cave due to the dripping of mineralized solutions and the deposition of calcium carbonate. * Stalactites are also found in the cave. These formations hang from the ceiling or wall of the cave. * There are also pillars, soda straws, cave pearls, flowstones, and cave popcorn are other formations in the cave. * Waterfalls can be found in the stream passage section. Wildlife This cave hosts tricolored bats and little brown bats during their winter hibernation because temperatures are low but remain above freezing. Their food consists entirely of insects such as small beetles, moths, and gnats.

The Lindale Mill is located in the small community of Lindale, Georgia, just outside the larger town of Rome, Floyd County, Georgia.  History  In 1896, Massachusetts Mills opened a new mill in Lindale, Georgia. The mill produced 1/7 of all textiles in Georgia. 1,393 people were employed by the mill in 1903. In 1926, the mill was sold to Pepperell Manufacturing Company, giving the community and school the name Pepperell. At the time, the country was in the middle of a debate on child labor. Children as young as twelve (some say nine) were working with the same weaving and spinning machines as adults and under the same conditions. Many people disagreed with child labor, bringing laws which regulated the age of employees. http://www.romenewswire.com/index.php/2007/05/13/lindales-lost-legacy/ In 1931 during the Great Depression a few mill employees built a wooden star as a sign of HOPE, lined with lights to hang between the two smoke stacks at Christmas, starting an annual tradition in Lindale. The star has been hung between the two smoke stacks almost every year during the Christmas Holidays.http://lindalestar.blogspot.com/ Boston Red Sox pitcher and Taylorsville native Willard Nixon worked at the mill in the winter months during his 9-year major league career (1950 - 1958). 1953 Topps baseball card #30  Closing of the mill  After 105 years of manufacturing, the mill closed on September 24, 2001. It couldn't compete as the textiles moved overseas. The closure dealt a huge blow to the economy of Floyd County, and to the community of Lindale. In 2004 a 70-year-old tradition of hanging a Christmas star between the smoke stacks also briefly ended. As the Mill gave way to demolition and reclaiming of the heart pine lumber and antique bricks, the community of Lindale sat in quiet darkness for the next 9 years. In 2010, the Lindale Mill was purchased by the Silva family out of Seattle. In 2013, the new owners began working with the Lindale community trying to clean up the Mill area and surrounding Silver Creek, bringing pride to Lindale. In 2013, working with the new owners restored the Christmas Star hanging tradition, bringing thousands of families and past employees back to Lindale for an annual Star Lighting ceremony. The ceremony is held in November. The Lindale Mill is currently being used for small to large movie production filming, photography location and a wedding and events venue. The site offers 23 acres existing old brick buildings, large open spaces with bridges, dams, a running creek, large metal industrial windows, and the existing boiler building, which dates back to 1896. The old mill has a new honor of being considered by Movie Locators who have expressed their opinion there are few similar authentic locations still existing in Georgia. It has become a highly sought after location for the filming production industry within Georgia, once again bringing pride and service to the hometown it honors.

Development Triumph Bonneville T100 (2008) Triumph launched the first new Bonneville for 15 years, the Bonneville 790, at the Munich Motorcycle Show in September 2000, with a 360¬∞ crankshaft parallel-twin engine. The T100 Bonneville, styled by John Mockett and David Stride, was launched as an uprated version initially with the 790 cc engine, and from 2005 with the 865 cc engine introduced on the 2004 Thruxton, and fitted to all Bonnevilles from 2007. The designation comes from the T100 models produced by Triumph between 1939 and the mid 1970s and it is sold as part of Triumph's \\"Modern classics\\" range. The engine features double electrically heated carburettors. Triumph added an air injection unit near the spark plug to achieve emission regulations introduced in 2007. For 2008 the T100 (like all Bonneville based models) was further updated with fuel injection to meet new Euro 3 emissions legislation. As well as cleaner running than a carburettor engine, the fuel injected system is also easier to start from cold. To retain the 'retro' styling the fuel injectors are hidden behind throttle bodies designed to resemble carburetors. For 2017 a host of updates have been made for the T100 model, a displacement increase to 900cc, and the addition of liquid cooling, traction control, and the change from a 360¬∞ to 270¬∞ crank. Triumph 100th Anniversary Limited Edition 2002 was the 100th anniversary of Triumph motorcycles (1902 was first year for Triumph) and for this special event Triumph planned to produce a limited number of centennial Bonneville T100s in a \\"Lucifer orange\\" and silver paint scheme. But on 15 March 2002, while in the midst of preparing for its anniversary, its main factory was destroyed by fire, crippling most of its manufacturing capacity. Only a handful of centennial edition T100s were produced in March 2002 before the fire, making them very rare. The remaining production run of centennial edition T100s were actually 2003 models that were built after the factory was repaired from the fire damage; these remaining T100s had to be 2003 year models as it was after September 2002 (into the 2003 model production year) before production started again. Even combining the 2002 and 2003 bikes produced, there were only a few of these first-year modern T100 bikes manufactured. Although exact numbers were not disclosed, the factory had promoted a limited run of 500 total units. Paul Smith signature series In 2006, designer Paul Smith personally designed a signature series. Nine Triumph Bonneville T100's were customised with one off paint schemes and used for display and promotion in Paul Smith designer shops. Although these were for sale through Paul Smith shops only, two of the original designs, the \\"Multi- Union\\" and \\"Live Fast\\" were put into limited production with fifty of each design produced. Each motorcycle was individually numbered and authenticated with a certificate, signed by Paul Smith and John Bloor. Triumph Bonneville SE Launched at the Triumph dealer conference in July 2008, the 'SE' (for Special Edition) featuring matching speedo and tachometer, special polished alloy covers on a black engine, chrome Triumph tank badge, cast wheels, upswept silencers, shortened mudguards and a lower and narrower seat.

It is too faint to be visible to the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 8.08. The distance to this system is 112 light years based on parallax. It is drifting further away from the Sun with a radial velocity of +16.4 km/s, having come within some 1.5 million years ago. This object is an ordinary G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G8V, which indicates it is generating energy through core hydrogen fusion. It is around 3.4 billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 1.7 km/s. The star has 88% of the mass of the Sun and 82% of the Sun's radius. It is radiating 56% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,540 K. As of August 2008 there are two confirmed extrasolar planets (or exoplanets) orbiting around it.  Planetary system  HD 45364 is one of only a relative few systems that have had more than one exoplanet discovered in its orbit. The two planets, HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c respectively, were both discovered in August 2008 using the radial velocity method. The pair are orbiting the host star with a 3:2 mean motion resonance, which means the inner planet is completing three orbits for every two orbits of the outer planet.  Formation scenario Hydrodynamic formation scenario of HD45364 A detailed analysis of the formation scenario revealed that the previously reported orbital configuration might not be correct. The eccentricities are a factor of 4-5 too large to be consistent with standard planet formation theories.

The MJCF is organised independently of the French communist party, deciding its laws, structure and leaders as well as its stances, while continuously engaging with the party about the actions and stances to take in keeping with a transformational vision of society. Jeunesse communiste demonstrators, May 2007 The MJCF was founded in 1920 as the \\"F√©d√©ration nationale des jeunesses socialistes-communistes de France\\", a split of the Youg socialists, under the auspices of the Tours Congress. Its secretary general is L√©on Deffontaines, elected at the time of the national council of 27 January 2019. According to its own statistics, the movement counts 15,000 members in France. The MJCF publishes a quarterly journal, Avant-garde. It is part of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and was part of the European Network of Democratic Young Left (ENDYL) until its dissolution.https://de-de.facebook.com/Endyl-European- Network-of-Democratic-Young-Left-143775598983791/ post of March 22nd 2016 The MJCF contains the Union des √©tudiants communistes student grouping, which directs its own institutions to meet the specific demands of militancy in higher education.  Campaigns and current stances  The MJCF, being an autonomous organization, leads its own campaigns as well as aiding in those of the PCF. Campaigns of the 2000s include: * Paix et solidarit√© (Peace and solidarity) ** Contre la guerre, on ne d√©pose pas nos armes (Against war ‚Äì we won't put down our weapons): Launched at the beginning of 2003 at the time of the movement against the Iraq War, this campaign sought to fight against the war and the occupation, and to promote pacifist ideas amongst young people. ** Lib√©rez Marwan Barghouti (Free Marwan Barghouti): campaign for the liberation of the Palestinian ex deputy leader Marwan Barghouti, imprisoned in Israel since 2002. The MJCF, who consider Barhouti a political prisoner, strongly criticized what they saw as an unjust trial, as well as the conditions in which he has been detained. ** Free Mumia!: Campaign for the liberation of Mumia Abu-Jamal, an American sentenced to death, whom the MJCF also considers a victim of a rigged trial. Beyond this campaign, the MJCF intends to lead a broader fight against the death penalty throughout the world. * Lutte contre les discriminations (Struggle against discrimination) ** Lutte anti-fasciste et contre l'extr√™me droite (Struggle against fascism and the extreme right): the MJCF regularly publishes tracts and leaflets analysing the policies of the extreme right, particularly the French Front national movement. * Emploi, formation et lutte contre la pr√©carit√© (Employment, training and the struggle against job insecurity) ** Un emploi ou une formation pour tous ? Je crois que √ßa va pas √™tre possible (A job a training for everyone? I believe that's ~~im~~ possible), the slogan around which the MJCF based their campaign for the establishment of job and training security, a broad project of social transformation seeking to eliminate unemployment and to guarantee a real and lifelong right to training. ** Campagne contre la loi Fillon (Campaign against Fillon's law): the MJCF, particularly its schools network has actively participated in the spring 2005 movement against Fillon's law to reform secondary school teaching. ** √âtats g√©n√©raux des lyc√©es (general states of schools): an initiative launched by the MJCF seeking to organize in as many schools so that they may become involved in the campaign against Fillon's law, and so that they can express their grievances with the current system and their hopes for a better school. ** Loi pour la R√©ussite dans l'Enseignement Sup√©rieur (Law for success in higher education): initiative launched by the UCE with the goal of establishing a law which puts forward a real alternative to the liberal project for higher education (which the UCE considers as having been served by the recent reforms). MJCF was particularly involved in the campaign of the left to vote \\"no\\" in the French referendum on a treaty for a European constitution. In 2006, the MJCF was also involved in the movement against the Contrat premi√®re embauche and was an active member of the collectif jeune (young collective) against the CPE. The MJCF also participated in the collective Unis contre l'immigration jetable where it fought against the projet de loi relatif √† l'immigration et √† l'int√©gration of Nicolas Sarkozy. At the MJCF congress which took place on 14‚Äì17 December 2006 at Ivry- sur-Seine the MJCF decided to direct its struggles along four essential lines, called Quatre chantiers pour changer nos vies et la soci√©t√© (four projects to change our lives and society) * Pr√©carit√©s (insecurity) * Vivre ensemble (living together) * Monde (world) * Savoirs/√©ducation (knowledge/education) The content of these projects directed the MJCF, at the national council of January 2007, to campaign for Marie-George Buffet in the French presidential election of 2007, as a candidate for the popular anti-liberal left.

The current pope, Pope Francis, was the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires.  History  Apostolic Nunciature in Buenos Aires Argentina, which was a Spanish colony as part of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, lost its relation with the Holy See during the Argentine War of Independence. Both countries reestablished diplomatic relations on 17 April 1840, during the administration of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Argentina has an embassy to the Holy See, and the Holy See has an embassy in Buenos Aires. Pope John Paul II made two pastoral visits. The first was in June 1982 where he called for an end to the Falklands War. The second was in April 1987 where he lectured on morality. Vatican officials, including Pope John Paul II and Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli acted as mediators to help resolve Argentina's dispute with Chile over the Beagle Channel. After the two countries almost went to war over the area in 1978, John Paul II became interested in resolving the dispute, which led to discussions between Chile and Argentina being mediated by the Vatican, and Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and Chilean Foreign Minister Jaime Del Valle issuing a joint statement of peace and friendship with the intent of developing a final treaty to resolve sovereignty in the channel. In early 2008, Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner appointed Alberto Iribarne to be Argentina's ambassador to the Holy See. The Vatican refused to accept him as an ambassador because he was divorced. After ten months of poor relations between the two countries, during which Argentina refused to appoint a new candidate and the Vatican refused to accept Iribarne, Argentina conceded and appointed Juan Pablo Cafiero to the post, which the Vatican quickly ratified. In March 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires was elected Pope.

In 1567, he published the first translation of New Testament in Welsh from the original Greek, translated by his close friend William Salesbury. Along with the Bible, Toy published the first translation of the Book of Common Prayer in Welsh, also translated by Salesbury. Early life Toy was born around 1537, the son of Robert Toy, a bookseller, and his wife who died in 1546. The Toy family was of Welsh origin. In 1551, Toy entered Queens' College, Cambridge as a sizar, but he left Cambridge before earning a degree. After Robert Toy died in 1556, most of his property passed to Toy's stepmother Elizabeth Toy with the provision that it would pass to Humphrey after her death. Until her death around 1558, Toy assisted his stepmother in running his father's shop and publishing interests. At some point during this period, Toy married Margaret Revell. Publishing career Toy entered work with the Stationer's Company in August 1560, and served as the company's renter warden from 1561 to 1563. Toy later rose through the ranks of the company, and served twice as its underwarden in 1571 and 1573. While working at the Stationer's Company, Toy took control of the bookshop that he inherited from his father and stepmother. Toy's shop was known as the Helmet, because of the helmet depicted on its sign, and Toy was granted a seventy-year lease on the location of the shop. While at the Stationer's Company, Toy became an active printer and publisher, and became particularly interested in religious works. He worked closely with Christopher Plantin of Antwerp, who helped Toy acquire a large collection of European protestant works. Toy also entered into a dispute, along with three other printers, with Richard Jugge, over the right to print Bibles in English. Work with William Salesbury Possibly because of his Welsh background, Toy formed a friendship with the Welsh scholar William Salesbury, and worked with him professionally on several occasions. In 1567, Toy financed and published Salesbury's translation of New Testament in Welsh, the first translation made into Welsh from the original Greek. That same year, Toy financed and published Salesbury's translation of the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh, the first such translation. Both the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer were printed by Henry Bynneman, with financing and oversight from Toy. Toy was recognized on the first page of Book of Common Prayer for providing \\"the costes and charges\\" of the publication. After the Book of Common Prayer and New Testament, Toy also published a guide to Welsh pronunciation, and several smaller works for Salesbury. Death Toy died on 16 October 1577 and was buried at All Saints' Church, Bristol. After his death, his widow Margaret and his apprentice Thomas Chard took control of his estate, and continued his work in both publishing and bookselling. Chard operated the Helmet until 1585, and it subsequently changed hands several times before disappearing in 1607. Approximately thirty works printed by Toy are still in existence; among these, an edition of Richard Grafton's Chronicle that he printed is the most notable.

It usually consists of questions that cover the content of the course. The surveys evaluate student learning and content mastery at all levels: from basic knowledge and comprehension through higher levels of thinking. Knowledge surveys can serve as both formative and summative assessment tools. They are effective in helping:What are knowledge surveys * students learn * students develop metacognitive self-assessment skills required for self-efficacy * instructors improve course organization * promote clarity and disclosure * departments align curricula and pedagogies to promote intellectual development. Structure of the survey A standard knowledge survey consists of questions that cover the content of a course addressing all levels of Bloom's scale of thinking. A survey may include as many as 200 questions. The key feature of knowledge surveys is that students do NOT answer the questions. Instead, they say whether they COULD answer the question and with what degree of confidence. So students complete the surveys quickly. For easy assessment, the questions might follow the multiple choice format with choices that address the level of knowledge and confidence in a certain topic. For example, a typical multiple choice self-assessment of an item expressing a challenge could take the following form: * (A) I can address the item quite well with my present knowledge and skills. * (B) I know at least 50% of the topic partially, and I know where I can find more information about it. Within 20 minutes, I am confident I can find the required resources to enable a complete answer. * (C) I am not confident that I can answer the question at this time for graded test purposes.

He was styled Duke of Anjou from birth.  Biography  Philippe was born at the Palace of Versailles on 30 August 1730, the second son and fifth child of Louis XV of France and Marie Leszczy≈Ñska. As a son of the king, he held the rank of a fils de France (\\"son of France\\"), which also entitled him to the style of Royal Highness. In his short lifetime, he was the third most important male at court, after his father Louis XV and his elder brother Louis, Dauphin of France. Philippe was styled Duke of Anjou from birth; this title had last been bestowed on his father, from his own birth in 1710 until his accession to the throne in 1715. Philippe grew up at Versailles with his brother, the Dauphin, and their twin sisters Louise √âlisabeth (Madame Royale, later Duchess of Parma) and Henriette (Madame Seconde). In his short lifetime, Philippe saw the birth of his younger sister Madame Ad√©la√Øde, in March 1732, and the death of his older sister Marie Louise de France (Madame Troisi√®me) from the common cold, in February 1733. Always a sickly child, Philippe was cared for by a group of female attendants, as royal children were cared for by women until the age of five. As part of their intensely superstitious beliefs, the women mixed in earth from the grave of Saint Medard with his food; the child was given so much earth that his organs failed. As a result, Philippe died at Versailles on 7 April 1733, at the age of two. He was buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis outside Paris.

It became strong during the declaration of Independence of Brazil, in the 19th century. History Brazilian military dictatorship Brazil was initially a colony of Portugal, established during the Portuguese colonization of the Americas. Historians are not sure on the precise moment when Brazilians developed a local nationalism, distinct from the Portuguese one. In some cases it is pointed to the discovery itself, in others it is attributed to the explorations of the bandeirantes or the South American theater of the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War in the 17th century.Barbosa, p. 5 Still, the first cases of a strong nationalist sentiment emerged in the 19th century. The white Brazilian-born colonial oligarchy developed sentiments against the colonial system, and manifested hostility to the Portuguese authorities. There were local conspiracies to secede from Portugal as early as in 1789, but the Independence of Brazil took place in the 1820s, after the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil during the Napoleonic Wars. Brazilians had a desire for self-governance and resented that wealth of the nation was taken to Portugal.Barbosa, p. 6 After independence, Brazilian nationalism maintained its anti-Portuguese sentiment, expanding to anti-British and anti-Spanish American sentiments (specially against the countries of the R√≠o de la Plata Basin, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), shaping an anti-foreign nationalism. The anti-Portuguese sentiment was in fact a common sentiment across all of Brazil, and helped to keep the country unified during the late colonial periods and the first chaotic years after independence. The Brazilian monarchy was also a unifying factor, as the majority of the elite accepted the authority of the kings and feared the consequences of a potential revolution of their slaves.Barbosa, pp. 6-7 The elite envisioned a country of white peoples, but the slaves, mulattoes, and mestizos composed almost the two-thirds of the Brazilian population.Barbosa, p. 8 For this end, they encouraged European immigration, to increase the number of white people.Barbosa, p. 9 The anti-Portuguese sentiment also led to an increased use of the French language, in detriment of the Portuguese language. France was seen at the time as a model of civilization and progress.Barbosa, p. 19 The literary nationalism began in the 1840s with the works of Jos√© de Alencar, who used French literary models to describe the regions and social milieus of Brazil.Nava, p. 18 Nationalist literary works became more complex in the second half of the 19th century.Nava, p. 19 Nationalist political parties Active *Alliance for Brazil *Social Liberal Party *Patriota *Brazilian Labour Renewal Party *Liberal Party *Avante *Democratic Labour Party *Party of National Mobilization *Progressives Defunct *National Renewal Alliance *Party of Popular Representation *Brazilian Integralist Action *Brazilian Labour Party See also * Brazilian Integralism References Bibliography * * ","title":"Brazilian nationalism"},{"id":"21593964","title":"Twice exceptional"},{"id":"21593972","text":"Anthony Frank Scrivener QC (31 July 1935 ‚Äì 27 March 2015) was a British barrister.

Travis was the Herolds' constant companion and would often accompany them to work and on their shopping excursions in town. The Herolds owned a towing company, and Travis would pose for photos at the shop and ride with the tow truck, his seatbelt buckled as he wore a baseball shirt. Travis became well known in the town and had been known to greet police officers they would encounter when towing cars. Having grown up among people, Travis had been socialized to humans since birth.

The incident began after a pedestrian threw something at the car that went through a partially open window and struck Travis while they were stopped at a traffic light. Startled, Travis unbuckled his seat belt, opened the car door and chased the man, but did not catch him. When police arrived, they lured the chimpanzee into the car several times only to have Travis let himself out of another door and occasionally chase the officers around the car. The 2003 incident led to the passing of a Connecticut law prohibiting people from keeping primates weighing more than as pets and requiring owners of exotic pets to apply for permits. The new law took effect in 2009, and as of Travis's death in the same year, no one in the state had applied to adopt a chimpanzee.

Herold, then 70 years old, attempted to stop Travis by hitting him with a shovel and stabbing him with a butcher knife. \\"For me to do something like that‚Äîput a knife in him‚Äîwas like putting one in myself,\\" Herold later said. The chimp turned around, she said, as if to say, \\"'Mom, what did you do?'\\" The animal grew angrier. Herold then called 9-1-1 and pleaded for help. Travis' screams can be heard in the background of the tape as Sandra pleaded for police, who initially believed the call to be a hoax, until she started screaming, \\"He's eating her!\\"Residents Shocked By Brutal Chimp Attack, Eyewitness News 3, updated: March 4, 2009, Accessed September 19, 2010.Chimp Attack 911 Call, CBS's official channel on YouTube, February 17, 2009, Accessed February 18, 2009. Emergency medical services waited for police before approaching the house. Travis headed towards the police car when it arrived, tried to open a locked passenger door, and smashed a side-view mirror. Then he went calmly around to the driver's-side door and opened it, at which point Officer Frank Chiafari shot him several times. Travis retreated to the house, where he was found dead next to his cage.  Aftermath  The emergency crew described Nash's injuries as \\"horrendous.\\" Within the following 72 hours, Nash underwent more than seven hours of surgery on her face and hands by four teams of surgeons.

The incident became an international news story. Shortly after the attack, a woman who had lived in the same area as Herold came forward with information that back in 1996 the chimpanzee had bitten her hand and tried to pull her into a vehicle as she greeted him. She claimed to have complained to the Herolds and to police, who stated they had no record of any such complaint. In June 2011, Nash underwent transplant surgery performed by a team led by Dr. Bohdan Pomahaƒç at the Harvard teaching affiliate, Brigham and Women's Hospital, receiving a donated face and hands. The hands transplant was initially successful, but because Nash developed pneumonia shortly thereafter, doctors were forced to remove her newly transplanted hands due to the infection and resulting poor circulation. In accordance with standard procedure, Travis' head was taken to the state laboratory for a rabies test, and the body was taken to the University of Connecticut for a necropsy. The head tested negative for rabies,John Christofferen, Woman says Connecticut chimpanzee bit her in '96, Associated Press, February 19, 2009, Accessed February 19, 2009. but there was Xanax (Alprazolam) remaining in his system.

Stamford, CT: The Advocate Posted: 04/10/2009 Retrieved: 6/02/20 On May 24, 2010, 15 months after the attack, Sandra Herold died suddenly of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 72. Her attorney, Robert Golger, released the following statement: \\"Ms. Herold had suffered a series of heartbreaking losses over the last several years, beginning with the death of her daughter who was killed in a car accident, then her husband, then her beloved chimp Travis, as well as the tragic maiming of friend and employee Charla Nash. In the end, her heart, which had been broken so many times before, could take no more.\\" In November 2012, Nash reached a settlement with Herold's estate and received approximately $4 million. Nash attempted to sue the state of Connecticut in 2013 but her claim was denied. She had asserted that officials knew the animal was dangerous but did nothing about it. Nash's petition to sue was denied on the basis that at the time of the attack, no statute existed that prohibited the private ownership of a chimpanzee. In July 2013, Nash's attorneys began efforts to appeal the court's decision. =In media= Travis' escape and subsequent attack of Charla Nash were used as part of the \\"Chimps\\" episode of the Animal Planet 2010-2011 documentary series: Fatal Attractions.

Frank Chiafari‚Äîthe police officer who fatally shot Travis‚Äîwas initially unable to get his therapy for depression and anxiety covered after the incident. This led to legislation proposed in 2010 that would cover a police officer's compensation for mental or emotional impairment after he used justifiable deadly force to kill an animal.Wilson, Michael (February 24, 2010). \\"After Shooting Chimp, a Police Officer‚Äôs Descent\\" New York Times =Influence on legislation= Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal noted that a defect in the existing 2004 Connecticut law prohibiting chimpanzees of Travis' size, itself a result of the 2003 incident, allowed the attack to occur. A Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) spokesman clarified that Travis was exempt because he did not appear to present a public health risk and was owned before the registration requirement began. Blumenthal subsequently sent letters to legislative leaders and the DEP Commissioner, asking them to support a proposed law that would ban all potentially dangerous exotic animals, such as chimpanzees, crocodiles, and venomous snakes, from being kept in a residential setting in Connecticut. The DEP was seeking a similar law banning large primates and, after the incident, announced that it sought the help of the public, police officers, and animal control officers to report such pets to the agency.John Christofferen, Slain chimp's owner now says it wasn't on Xanax, Associated Press, February 18, 2009, Accessed February 18, 2009.

Although most cars come equipped with rear view mirrors which are adequate for detecting vehicles behind a car, they are inadequate on many vehicles for detecting small children or objects close to the ground, which fall in the car's blind spot, particularly directly aft. That area has been called a \\"killing zone.\\" Large trucks have much larger blind spots that can hide entire vehicles and large adults. Statistics According to research by the advocacy web site kidsandcars.org, back up collisions were the leading cause (34%) for U.S. non- traffic fatalities of children under 15 from 2006‚Äì2010. The U.S. Center for Disease Control reported that from 2001‚Äì2003, an estimated 7,475 children (CI = 4,453--10,497) (2,492 per year) under the age of 15 were treated for automobile back-over incidents. About 300 fatalities per year result from backup collisions. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that back-up collisions most often: * occur in residential driveways and parking lots * involve sport utility vehicles (SUVs) or small trucks * occur when a parent, relative or someone known to the family is driving * particularly affect children less than five years old The driver of the car backing up and hitting an object, a person, another car, or property is usually considered to be at fault. Prevention and regulation Prevention organizations suggest that parents use common sense, and also take safety measures such as installing cross view mirrors, audible collision detectors, backup camera, or some type of reverse backup sensors. Furthermore, safer backing up is done when the driver turns completely around and looks out of the rear window of the car, rather than relying on mirrors. This provides a wider field of vision and better control of the vehicle. In the United States, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007 required the federal Secretary of Transportation to issue backup collision safety regulations within 3 years and require full compliance within 4 years after final rulemaking. As of 2012, regulations are still under study. About half of model year 2012 automobiles already have backup cameras installed. Blind spot monitors and other technology Blind spot monitors are an option that may include more than monitoring the sides of the vehicle.

He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Illinois. Fulton has also been a member of the Indianapolis Colts, San Francisco 49ers, and Washington Redskins. He was the starting left tackle, converted from a defensive end, for the Illinois Fighting Illini football team for which he also played in the 2008 Rose Bowl. Early life Fulton played football at Homewood-Flossmoor High School from 2000‚Äì2004 for coach Tom Bailey. As a senior, he recorded 98 tackles, 58 solo stops, and 7.5 sacks, as well as, 17 quarterback hurries, three blocked field goals, three fumble recoveries, and five PBUs. Fulton was named to All-State teams by the Chicago Sun-Times, Champaign News-Gazette, and Illinois High School Coaches Association. He was also named an All-Area performer by Chicago Sun-Times, Daily Southtown, and Star Newspapers. Fulton was ranked as a Top-25 Illinois recruit by Rivals.com, ESPN, and The Insiders. He was also named SuperPrep All-Region. While at H-F, he lettered in football and wrestling. He is the son of Alma and Glen Fulton. As one of the top defensive line recruits in the country, Fulton chose Illinois over Wisconsin, Purdue, Michigan, Michigan State, Northwestern University, Indiana, and more than 20 other top schools. He was recruited by Ron Turner and his staff. College career As a true freshman Fulton played as a defensive end in eight games and started three, collecting six tackles, two quarterback hurries and one PBU. He recorded one solo tackle, two QBH and one PBU vs. Michigan. He also recorded tackles vs. Minnesota, Indiana, and Northwestern. As a sophomore, Fulton played and started in the first seven games of the season before suffering a season-ending knee injury at Penn State. Before his injury he registered 13 total tackles, two tackles-for-loss, a sack, and three quarterback hurries. He had a career game at Indiana, recording three solo stops, 1.5 tackles for loss, and a blocked extra point attempt. He also recorded three quarterback hurries in the season opener against Rutgers and posted a sack against San Jose State. For his junior year, he took a medical redshirt year to rehab his injured knee from the previous season. In his redshirt junior year, during spring practices in 2007, Fulton moved from defensive line to offensive line, specifically, from defensive end to offensive tackle. Fulton impressed the coaches so much that in his first time playing offensive tackle at the college level, he started at left tackle for all 13 games and was in on 997 offensive snaps. He recorded a team-leading 109 knockdowns, and helped pave the way for 260 rushing yards at No. 1 Ohio State, quadrupling the Buckeyes' average rushing yards allowed. At Minnesota, he led the way for 655 total yards, the third-best single-game total in school history. At Syracuse, he led the way for 508 total yards and 378 rushing yards, Illinois' most rushing yards since 1998. At Missouri, he protected for 316 passing yards, the best Illini aerial performance since September 20, 2003, against Cal. Fulton finished the season with second-team All-Big Ten honors by both coaches and media, as well as, Rivals.com. Fulton stayed for a fifth year and was part of an offensive line that has helped the Illini rank first in the Big Ten in total offense (448.3) and pass offense (274.5) and second in scoring offense (30.4) through 11 games. At Mizzou, he protected for 451 passing yards, the third-best passing total in Illinois history. Again, Fulton finished the season with second-team All-Big Ten honors by both coaches and media, as well as, Rivals.com. At Fulton's senior banquet, he was honored with the Bruce Capel Award for displaying the most courage, dedication and accomplishment throughout the season. Immediately following his senior year, he was invited to the 2009 Under Amour Senior Bowl and played for the North team. In December 2008, Fulton graduated from the University of Illinois with a bachelor's degree in sociology. Professional career 2009 NFL Draft Fulton signed with agent Rick Smith from Priority Sports in Chicago. He trained at D1 Sports Training in Franklin, Tennessee, a facility owned by Peyton Manning. Fulton was one of only 300 top college football players to be invited to the 2009 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Fulton posted phenomenal results at the 2009 Combine. He finished in the top 10 (OL) in 5 out of the 6 workouts: 40-yard dash, vertical jump, broad jump, 3-cone drill, & 20-yard shuttle. His only workout that he did not finish in the top 10 was the bench press which is most likely due to his shoulder injury that he was having surgery on the week following the combine. He still posted an impressive 27 reps, only 3 away from a top 10 finish. Fulton was the top rated offensive tackle from the Big Ten Conference. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Fulton was the 19th pick in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, picked by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

It is situated in the townland of Aghnacarra in the civil parish of Derrybrusk and the historic barony of Magherastephana. The hamlet is named from a bridge connecting the island of Inishmore in Upper Lough Erne with the mainland. The bridge is named from the townland of Carry on the island, which name translates as 'causeway' or 'rocky ford', perhaps referring to a feature replaced by the bridge. It serves as a marina and boat hire centre. The area contains Derryharney Church of Ireland and the Carrybridge Hotel, as well as the bridge over the narrows at the outflow from Upper Lough Erne. History On 11/12 December 1956, the bridge was badly damaged by a thirty-five pound mine which had been planted there by the Irish Republican Army during their 1956 campaign. Two unarmed civilians Eddie McGoldrick and Terrence Baxter died here in 1974. RNLI In 2002 the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) based a lifeboat on Upper Lough Erne at Carrybridge, to work in conjunction with the original lifeboat station on Lower Lough Erne at Killadeas.

He also wrote and directed two silent films himself, and he was a capable artist and musician. He had a close association with the director Marcel L'Herbier. (He was born as Jacques Gu√©rin- Castelain;Dictionnaire du cin√©ma fran√ßais, sous la direction de Jean-Loup Passek. (Paris: Larousse, 1987) p.245. other variations of his name used at different times were Jaque-Catelain, Jacques Catelain, Jacques Catelin, and Jacque Cathelain.) Early life Jaque Catelain was born in Saint-Germain-en- Laye in the Pavillon Henri IV (he was said to have been born in the same room as Louis XIV). His father was then the mayor of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and also moved in literary and theatrical circles, which allowed the young Jacques to encounter many famous names in his childhood, including Catulle Mend√®s, Anatole France, Sarah Bernhardt, and Gabrielle R√©jane.Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950) p.7. He showed early enthusiasm for the arts and music, and at the age of 16 he entered the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris to study fine arts. With the outbreak of war in the following year, he changed direction and chose to study acting at the Conservatoire, enrolling in the class of Paul Mounet, before being mobilised into the artillery.Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950) pp.24‚Äì26. Career In 1914 Catelain met Marcel L'Herbier, then a writer and critic, who became a major influence on his life and career, and with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. When L'Herbier began directing films in 1917, Catelain became his leading man of choice and starred in twelve of his silent films, starting with Le Torrent. The first major role to attract attention was that of the dissolute son of a Breton fisherman in L'Homme du large (1920). This was followed by El Dorado, Don Juan et Faust, L'Inhumaine, and Le Vertige, and they made Catelain into a leading star who was in demand to appear in foreign films as well as in productions of other French directors such as L√©once Perret (in K≈ìnigsmark). In 1922 he was working in Munich under contract to a German film companyJaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950) p.72. and he returned there in 1925 to appear in Robert Wiene's (silent) production of Der Rosenkavalier. Also in 1925 he was offered a seven-year contract by MGM to work in America, but he turned this down.Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950) p.84. Jaque Catelain's activities in this period extended beyond acting. He had already worked as an editor on L'Homme du large, and when Marcel L'Herbier set up his own production company Cin√©graphic in 1922, its first project became Le Marchand de plaisirs which Catelain directed as well as acting a double role in it.Richard Abel, French cinema: the First Wave, 1915-1929. (Princeton University Press, 1984). p.142. In the following year he wrote and directed a second film, La Galerie des monstres (1923/24). Both films were successful enough to cover their costs.Dimitri Vezyroglou, \\"De Gaumont √† Cin√©graphic (1919-1929)\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, [ed. by] Laurent V√©ray. (Paris: Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma, 2007.) p.75. He devised controversial make-up for some of the actors in L'Inhumaine,Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979) p.103. and his artistic skills were put to further use in two set designs for L'ArgentJaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950) pp.102‚Äì104. As a pianist he would sometimes step in to provide improvised accompaniment for previews of L'Herbier's films.Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979) p.59. Catelain successfully made the transition from silent to sound films, starring in L'Herbier's L'Enfant de l'amour (1929), but during the 1930s he took fewer leading film roles and started to act in the theatre. In February 1933 Catelain married Suzanne Vial,Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979) p.210. a friend since childhood who had become a production assistant to L'Herbier in the 1920s and continued working with him until 1944. Soon afterwards in 1933/1934 Catelain was employed by the daily newspaper Le Journal to go to Hollywood to carry out a series of interviews with leading personalities such as Chaplin, Stroheim and Sternberg.Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950) p.6, p.114.) In May 1940, Catelain left France for a four-month theatrical tour of South America, but within a month France was occupied by the Germans and his absence lasted for six years. In Buenos Aires he became so ill with pneumonia that he was given the last rites, but he recovered and went to Canada for the next three years for work in the theatre and propaganda broadcasts. In 1943 he was invited to Hollywood and remained there for a further three years taking bits parts and film dubbing jobs. He returned to Paris in 1946, and resumed an occasional career in films, appearing in minor roles in three of Jean Renoir's films in the 1950s. In 1950, he published a biography and appreciation of the work of Marcel L'Herbier.Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950). Catelain died in Paris in 1965, and he was buried in Passy Cemetery. Reputation Jaque Catelain won considerable popularity in the early 1920s through his film roles as romantic lead or jeune premier. His good looks were of a rather bland and pretty kind which did not commend him so much to later audiences, and he was often criticised for wooden and inexpressive performances.E.g. by No√´l Burch, \\"Ambivalences d'un r√©alisateur 'bisexuel': quatre films de Marcel L'Herbier\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, [ed. by] Laurent V√©ray. (Paris: Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma, 2007.) p.204. Some contemporary critics however, notably Louis Delluc, saw his restrained and economical technique as a significant development away from the exaggerated theatrical acting which was still common in films, and praised the sincerity and natural quality of his performances.Louis Delluc, Paris-Midi, 9 juillet 1921; quoted by Laurent Guido, \\"Vers l'expression du mouvement int√©rieur: Jaque Catelain, th√©oricien du jeu et acteur chez Marcel L'Herbier\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, [ed. by] Laurent V√©ray. (Paris: Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma, 2007.) p.122. Catelain himself was sufficiently thoughtful on the subject of acting to develop his views about the differences between 'interior' and 'exterior' performance in a journal article published in 1925.Jaque Catelain, \\"L'Acteur\\", in Les Cahiers du mois, n.16-17, 1925; pp.17‚Äì21. His own performance in L'Homme du large illustrates his understanding of the importance of movement and posture in relation to the camera frame at a time when a more 'expressionist' style of acting was common.Laurent Guido, \\"Vers l'expression du mouvement int√©rieur: Jaque Catelain, th√©oricien du jeu et acteur chez Marcel L'Herbier\\", in Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma, [ed. by] Laurent V√©ray.

Most are typically about 10 mm in size at presentation. This neoplasm is thought to arise from sebaceous glands in the skin and, therefore, may originate anywhere in the body where these glands are found. Sebaceous carcinoma can be divided into 2 types: ocular and extraocular. Because the periocular region is rich in this type of gland, this region is a common site of origin. The cause of these lesions are, in the vast majority of cases, unknown. Occasional cases may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. Due to the rarity of this tumor and variability in clinical and histological presentation, SGc is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition or a more common type of tumor. Currently the ocular SGc is commonly treated with wide surgical resection or Moh's micrographic surgery. This type of cancer usually has a poor prognosis because of a high rate of metastasis.  Presentation  Sebaceous carcinoma is a skin cancer of the sebum producing glands. It is predominantly seen in the head and neck region, representing 25% of all reported lesions in this area. The periocular region, which includes the meibomian gland, caruncle, gland of Zeis and eyebrow, is one of the most common sites in which SC is observed. The meibomian gland is a type of sebaceous gland that lines the upper and lower eyelids, and does not contain a follicle. The glands of Zeis contain the individual eyelash.Morgan M.B. (2010) Sebaceous Tumors. In: Morgan M., Hamill J., Spencer J. (eds) Atlas of Mohs and Frozen Section Cutaneous Pathology. Springer, New York, NY. The upper eyelid contains more meibomian glands than the lower eyelid and consequently, SGc is 2-3 times more common in the upper eyelid. Patients diagnosed with SGc most commonly present with a painless subcutaneous nodule. Other presentations include an irregular mass, pedunculated lesion or diffuse skin thickening. SGc in the periocular region presents as a heterogeneous rapidly growing, pink or yellow colored painless papule.  Pathophysiology  The cell of origin is usually unknown. Sebaceous gland carcinoma clearly resembles normal sebaceous glands and is thought to arise from them. Ultraviolet and ionizing radiation are believed to play some role in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. There is a strong association between Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome. There has been an association between the development of sebaceous carcinoma with the following: history of irradiation, immunosuppression, and genetic factors. One possible hypothesis states that stem cells in the hair follicle bulge and suprabasilar layer respond to different environmental stimuli, such as radiation, that may lead to the development of cutaneous tumors. Immunosuppressed individuals and those undergoing radiotherapy are at an increased risk for SGc. There has been some association between SGc and HIV, HPV (human papillomavirus) and mutations in tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb. Rb mutations are responsible for retinoblastoma. Reports have also shown the onset of SGc within the field of irradiation for patients undergoing radiotherapy for retinoblastoma, eczema or cosmetic epilation. In addition to external factors, genes also appear to play some role in the pathogenesis of this tumor. Extraocular SGc is closely associated with Muir Torre syndrome (MTS), with sebaceous tumors presenting in nearly 1/3 of patients with MTS. MTS is an autosomal genodermatosis, described as a condition with 2 types of malignancies: one being a sebaceous gland tumor and the other an internal malignancy, a majority of which are colorectal and genitourinary. In 41% of patients with MTS skin lesions appeared either before or during the time of diagnosis of the primary malignancy. Studies have shown that cancerous lesions in MTS develop as a result of mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR), which lead to a buildup of unstable microsatellite sequences and replications errors, predisposing one to different malignancies. Given that this is an autosomal dominant condition with multiorgan involvement, diagnosis requires a thorough medical history and physical in suspected cases of SGc in order to rule out potential visceral tumors. A number of SGc associated mutated proteins (B-catenin, p 53, p21, Shh, Androgen receptor, E-cadherin) have been shown to cause dysregulation in cell signaling. This dysregulation is responsible for the invasive growth and metastasis of SGc and identification of specific mutations could help determine patient prognosis and clinical outcomes.  Diagnosis  Due to the variable clinical and histological appearance of SGc, this condition is often misdiagnosed. The average delay in diagnosis has been reported to be 1 ‚Äì 2.9 years from expected onset of the lesion. Patients with ocular sebaceous carcinomas present with nonhealing eyelid tumors that are often misdiagnosed for more common benign conditions such as chalazion or blepharoconjunctivitis. Extraocular SGc appears similarly to skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and benign lesions such a molluscum contagiosum and pyogenic granuloma. Many tumors also share a histological presentation similar to SGC, such as sebaceous adenomas, basal cell carcinomas (BCC), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and clear cell tumors. A high level of suspicion is extremely important to prevent treatment delay and increased mortality. Given the aggressive growth and pagetoid spread of SGC, full thickness biopsy with microscopic examination is required for definitive diagnosis of sebaceous carcinomas. A full thickness biopsy of the eyelid (in suspected periocular SGC) includes the skin, tarsus, and palpebral conjunctiva. Map biopsies, taken from distinct areas of the conjunctiva, are recommended in cases exhibiting pagetoid spread in order to determine extent of disease. Different markers and stains help differentiate sebaceous carcinomas from other cancers. These markers include lipid stains such as oil red O stain and Sudan IV, and immunohistochemical stains.  Morphology  SGc is classified based on histopathological presentation, including cytoarchitecture, cytology, and pattern of growth. The lobular variant is the most common histological pattern followed by papillary, comedocarcinoma and mixed. Tumors may be also classified by differentiation, from poor to well differentiated. Well- and moderately differentiated sebaceous carcinoma tend to exhibit vacuolization within the cytoplasm of the tumor cells.Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N. Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease. Seventh Edition. Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders, 2005, p. 1425. This is known as sebocytic differentiation, where the vacuolization is caused by lipid containing cytoplasmic vacuoles that present as round clear areas in the cell. Periocular sebaceous gland carcinoma exhibits pagetoid (intraepithelial) spread, an upward growth of abnormal cells invading the epidermis, it is most often seen in the lid margin and/or conjunctiva. Periorbital SGC also presents with multicentric origins, in the upper and lower eyelids, increasing the risk of local recurrence.  Immunohistochemistry  Immunohistochemical stains are also used when there are inadequate tissue samples or after microscopic examination, and are extremely useful in dermatopathology. Specific antigens such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin -7 (CK-7), Ber-EP4 and androgen receptor (AR) can be targeted in order to differentiate SGc from BCC or SCC. Tissue immunohistochemistry is also used is used to diagnose MTS. Expression of 4 DNA mismatch repair proteins (MSH2, MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2) along with medical history, followed by genetic evaluation for microsatellite instability and germline mutation testing is used to screen for MTS in patients diagnosed with sebaceous neoplasms.  Sentinel lymph node biopsy  Despite the risk of metastatic spread, there has been little research on the utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Since periocular tumor have a higher rate of regional metastasis, SLNB is suggested for all ocular SGc tumors greater than 10mm in diameter. Treatment for nodal metastasis confirmed via SLNB involves advanced imaging studies [CT with or without PET scan], followed by removal of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, with adjuvant radiotherapy. However, it is important to note there has been no evidence of decreased mortality in those who had SLNB identified lymph node involvement. In addition, subsequent risks associated with surgical and radiotherapy may increase morbidity.  Staging  Sebaceous carcinomas are staged according to The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) guidelines for nonmelanoma skin cancers. This classification system has different stages for ocular and extraocular tumors, given that periocular tumors have a higher risk for metastasis and recurrence. Treatment This type of carcinoma is commonly managed by local resection, cryotherapy, topical chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Multimodal therapy has been shown to improve both visual prognosis and survival.  Surgical resection  Wide local excision, which has been replaced by Mohs micrographic surgery had been the primary treatment for both ocular and extraocular sebaceous carcinoma. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) has become the gold standard of treatment for SGc. MMS allows for precise and accurate removal of the tumor and complete assessment of margins. Furthermore, MMS is associated with significantly lower local and distant recurrence rates in both periocular and extraocular SC, when compared to wide local excision. MMS also limits morbidity and is useful in cosmetically sensitive areas such as the face.  Chemotherapy  There is a limited amount of information on the effectiveness of chemotherapy or chemoradiation, and is not indicated for local tumors. Chemotherapy may be used in advanced tumors, to allow for local resection and in order to avoid exenteration [total removal of the eyeball and contents of the eye socket]. These treatments typically use 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin, also used in head and neck cancers. Few studies have shown that topical adjuvant chemotherapy is also effective in treating periocular SGC.  Radiation therapy  Radiotherapy is associated with higher recurrence rates and mortality when compared to surgical excision. It is not recommended as a primary therapy and is only for patients who cannot undergo surgical excision. Potential adverse effects from radiation include keratitis, conjunctivitis, dry eyes, keratitis and loss of vision.  Cryotherapy  Although uncommon, conjunctival cryotherapy used during surgical excision has also been reported, but the associated risks to one's vision and potential damage to the eye appear to outweigh its benefits. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) has become the treatment of choice for this form of cancer. Mohs surgery allows for precise and accurate removal of the complete tumor and surrounding margins via frozen section. When used as the primary treatment modality for sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid, Mohs surgery is associated with significantly lower local and distant recurrence rates.  Prognosis  The 5-year relative survival rate for SGc is 92.72% and 86.98% for 10 years. SGc is believed to spread through the blood and lymphatic system via three mechanisms: tumor growth, multifocal tumor proliferation and shedding of atypical epithelial cells that subsequently transplant in a distant site. Common sites of metastasis for periorbital SGc are regional lymph nodes and rarely in the lung, liver, brain or bone. Due to the difficulty associated with promptly diagnosing SGc tumor, the rate of metastasis and recurrence is relatively high. Approximately 10% of patients with poorly or undifferentiated SGc presented with regional lymph node involvement. At the time of diagnosis nearly 25% of tumors will metastasize, in those with metastasizing cancer survival rate decreases to 50% within 5 years. Recurrence rates are higher in ocular vs extraocular tumors, 4-37% and 4-29% respectively. Over time there has been a notable improvement in prognosis in those with SGc, which is most likely attributable to earlier detection and improved treatment modalities.  Epidemiology  Notable risk factors include age, gender, and race. In the United States sebaceous is relatively rare, contributing to only 0.7% of all skin cancers. SGc is more prevalent in the Eastern versus Western Hemisphere, contributing to 33% of eyelid malignancies in China vs 1‚Äì5.5% in Caucasians. However, it is believed the higher incidence of SGc in Asian populations may be due to the lower incidence of other eyelid tumors. Additionally, a higher incidence has been reported in Caucasians, Asians, and Indians. This skin cancer typically occurs in the elderly, with a reported average age of onset in the 60 to early 70s. Different sources have also reported that SGc may be more common within females versus males, but other resources report no difference in incidence.

Estimates of the number involved range between 70 and 120, including Erik Calonius, Gene Daniels, Ken Hayman, Anne LaBastille, Danny Lyon, Boyd Norton, Yoichi Okamoto, Charles O'Rear, Tomas Sennett, Bill Strode, Suzanne Szasz, and John H. White. They were organized geographically, with each photographer working in a particular area in which they were already active. For example, Michael Philip Manheim worked in Boston; Jack Corn focused on West Virginia and Tennessee; Bill Gillette documented miners in Colorado; and Marc St. Gil focused primarily on Leakey, Houston and San Antonio, Texas. Subjects photographed include urban cityscapes, small towns, rural areas, beaches and mountains. They show people going about their everyday lives as well as working in farms; waterfronts; mining and logging, industry and heavy industry. Images document junk yards, highways, Amtrak trains, air and water pollution; and environmental protection and pollution control measures. The earliest assignments were closely aligned to the EPA's proposed areas of concern: air and water pollution, management of solid waste, radiation and pesticides, and noise abatement. However, photographers had considerable creative freedom about what they shot. As has been discussed by Gisela Parak, photographers working with Documerica were involved in the creation of a new pictorial language to articulate environmental issues. Among the areas depicted are national parks and forests, including environmentally sensitive areas that were under development or considered for government protection, such as the planned route of the Alaska Pipeline, Hawaii and Washington, D.C. Photographers used differing approaches: Boyd Norton's photographs often emphasize the natural beauty of an area, while Alexander Hope's photographs of the Middletown, Rhode Island dump and salt marsh reveal complex inter-relationships of man and nature. Details pot, Texas, 1973, Marc St. Gil oil crisis, Portland, OR, 1973, David Falconer Photographers working for the Documerica project received $150 a day along with film and expenses. More than 80,000 photographs were submitted to Gifford D. Hampshire. A selection were kept to become part of the collection, while copies and the unselected images were returned to the photographers. Because the images were part of a federal government project, photographers were required to waive their copyright, placing the images in the public domain. Like the photographers of the Federal photographic project of the Farm Security Administration during the Great Depression, some of the Documerica photographers interpreted their mission rather broadly, and sometimes artistically. Many of the photographs preserve a distinct visual record of time and place. Public access Perhaps a quarter of the images were publicly shown during the 1970s. A group of 155 photographs was shown in an exhibition Documerica 1 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. for six weeks in the summer of 1972. A number of small traveling exhibits were sent to cities such as New Orleans, Cincinnati, Dallas, and Philadelphia, and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) created the exhibit Our Only World for display at the EPA's Visitors Center and as a traveling exhibit. Digital scans of over 15,000 of the original 35 mm color slides and black-and-white negatives and prints are available through the National Archives and Records Administration's Archival Research Catalog.In \\"Scope & Contents\\" page for series DOCUMERICA: The Environmental Protection Agency's Program to Photographically Document Subjects of Environmental Concern, compiled 1972 - 1977, National Archives Identifier 542493 / Local Identifier 412-DA; Series from Record Group 412: Records of the Environmental Protection Agency, 1944 - 2000. Record of holdings available from the National Archives Catalog of the National Archives and Records Administration under the National Archives Identifier 542493. Accessed February 18, 2009. The quality of the images varies. Older copies made from the original color transparency films tend to be inferior to the quality of the originals. In 2013, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., displayed a curated exhibition, \\"Searching for the Seventies: The Documerica Photography Project\\". Curator Bruce Bustard selected a set of images from the Documerica collection and arranged to reprint them from the original slides. The quality of the resulting color images was much higher than that of older color reprints, which had degraded. One hundred reprinted images from the Documerica project were reprinted in the exhibition book Searching for the Seventies: The Documerica Photography Project (2013), edited by Bruce I. Bustard. In 2013 the string quartet Ethel created a multimedia show called Ethel's Documerica which incorporated images from the DOCUMERICA archives. The show premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and went on a national tour managed by Baylin Artists Management.

The grid runs as a synchronous electrical grid and in terms of interconnections has undersea DC-only connection to the UK National Grid, alongside plans in the advanced stage for a higher power, planned Celtic Interconnector to France. Island system Moneypoint power station Turlough Hill Power Station The electricity sector in Ireland previously operated as two separate markets: Northern Ireland operated as part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland operated its own separate market. On 1 November 2007 the two Transmission System Operators (System Operator Northern Ireland and EirGrid) established the Single Electricity Market (SEM) for the island of Ireland. The SEM has created \\"a gross mandatory pool market, into which all electricity generated on or imported onto the island of Ireland must be sold, and from which all wholesale electricity for consumption on or export from the island of Ireland must be purchased\\". According to the Electricity Association of Ireland, in 2013 the Single Electricity Market had approximately 2.5 million customers; 1.8 million in the Republic and 0.7 million in Northern Ireland. The effect of Brexit on the SEM has yet to be defined. Ireland and Northern Ireland form a regional group of the Europe-wide ENTSO-E organisation. The networks are not yet interconnected with the Continental Europe grid, but have interconnection with the British network through the Moyle Interconnector and the East‚ÄìWest Interconnector. In 2014, the island had an electricity interconnection level (international transmission capacity relative to production capacity) of 9%, below the recommended 10% level.

Archive Mirror Electricity in the Republic of Ireland Electricity generators in the Republic of Ireland are ESB, Airtricity, Synergen (70% ESB), Edenderry Power, Endesa-Ireland and Huntstown (Viridian). ESB owns the transmission and distribution networks. The Transmission System Operator (TSO) is EirGrid plc, which assumed the role from ESB Networks on 1 July 2006. EirGrid ensures the safe, secure and economic operation of the high voltage electricity grid. EirGrid is owned by the Irish State and is established as a result of a government decision to create an independent organisation to carry out the TSO function, in order to assist the liberalisation of Ireland's electricity industry and the development of a competitive market. The electricity industry is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which also regulates the natural gas market. The functions and duties of the CRU have been altered and expanded significantly by legislation transposing EU directives into Irish law.  Renewable energy  = Wind energy = Electricity in Northern Ireland Ballylumford power station provides over half of Northern Ireland's total generating capacity, and 17% of all-Ireland capacity. There are three power stations in the province: Ballylumford power station, Coolkeeragh power station and Kilroot power station. Northern Ireland Electricity (a subsidiary of ESB Group) owns the transmission and distribution networks. The Single Electricity Market means that Northern Ireland Electricity carries electricity on its network in exchange for a regulated charge to the electricity supply company. As of September 2011 domestic customers in Northern Ireland are able to buy electricity from Electric Ireland, Power NI, Airtricity, Click Energy or Budget Energy. Industrial and commercial customers are able to choose from several other electricity suppliers. The Transmission System Operator (TSO) is System Operator Northern Ireland (SONI Ltd). SONI ensures the safe, secure and economic operation of the high voltage electricity grid in Northern Ireland. SONI's counterpart in the Republic of Ireland is EirGrid. Both of these are owned by EirGrid plc which also (through a partnership of SONI and EirGrid) acts as the Single Energy Market Operator (SEMO), i.e. runs the new all-island wholesale market for electricity.http://www.allislandproject.org/  Electricity Regulation  The electricity industry in Northern Ireland is regulated by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR). The Authority is an independent public body established to oversee and regulate the electricity, gas, water and sewerage industries in Northern Ireland. The Authority is a non-ministerial government department responsible for promoting the short and long term interests of consumers. It does not make policy, but ensures that the energy and water utility industries are regulated and developed within ministerial policies. It is governed by a Board of Directors and is accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly. = History = The Office of Director General of Electricity Supply for Northern Ireland was established in 1992 in association with the privatisation of electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The Director General was appointed by the Department of Economic Development to regulate the electricity industry.The Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992, Article 5 Statutory duties included ensuring that all reasonable demands for electricity were satisfied; that licence holders were able to finance their activities; to promote competition in the generation and supply of electricity; to protect the interests of consumers of electricity in terms of price and continuity of supply; to promote efficiency and economy; to promote research and development; to protect the public from danger; and to secure the health and safety of persons employed in the generation, transmission or supply of electricity.The Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 Article 4 The regulatory system was reformed in 2003 to combine the regulation of electricity and natural gas into a single energy regulator. The Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation was established and the offices of Director General of Gas for Northern Ireland and Director General of Electricity Supply for Northern Ireland were abolished. The posts of Chief Executive and Chair of the Energy Regulator were split in 2006. In April 2007 the regulatory system for utilities was further reformed to encompass the water supply and sewage industries. The Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation became the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation. The Board of Directors is responsible for the overall strategic direction of the organisation. The Board comprises a non-executive Chairman, four non-executive members and the Chief Executive.

The courthouse was built between 1869 and 1870 and designed by local architect James W. Drum. It was the second courthouse to serve the county, with the first demolished in 1868. The final cost of the project was $150,000.Busovicki, pg. 19 A dedication ceremony took place on December 19, 1870. Former Governor of Pennsylvania William F. Johnston spoke at the ceremony. The architecture, done in the Second Empire Italianate style, is primarily red brick and stone. The roof was designed in the Mansard style. The courthouse features a gold leaf cupola clocktower with four faces. The main courtroom, located on the second floor measured by , with a ceiling. The large clock in the cupola was the largest in the county at the time. It was manufactured by Howard Clock Company of Boston and Springfield, Ohio. The four faces were each in diameter. The clock required winding once a week, a 15-minute process. Today the clock runs on a new digital style, that turns the hands on the faces of the clock. A jail and sheriff's residence was constructed next door in 1879, with a bridge that connected it to the courthouse to transport prisoners. At least six individuals were hung in the court's jailyard, between 1882 and 1913. 1903 county centennial celebration at the courthouse On September 24, 1945, a picture of Indiana-native Jimmy Stewart in front of the courthouse was featured on the cover of Life magazine.

As to whether this was from JFK himself is unknown. The courthouse held its final session on November 11, 1970. After being replaced by the newer building, the now \\"old\\" Courthouse fell into disuse and was scheduled for demolition. The county commissioners offered a restoration-lease agreement to interested parties. On January 3, 1972, the commissioners approved an agreement with the National Bank of the Commonwealth, who planned to renovate the building for administrative use. NBOC was required to spend $100,000 in restoration over the initial three-year lease period in order to be eligible for a 47-year extension. The bank agreed to pay $12,000 total in taxes and rent for use of the courthouse, including the jail next door when it was vacated. Today, the entire bell tower is supported by scaffolding set up in the main court room of the building, due to the age of the building's supports. This area is not seen by visitors very often. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1974. Currently the building serves as administrative offices for First Commonwealth Financial.

It is commonly known as the dock bug as it feeds on the leaves and seeds of docks and sorrels. It is a medium-sized speckled brown insect, between 13 and 15 mm long as an adult, with a broad abdomen. It occurs throughout Europe, Asia and northern Africa. It is often found in dense vegetation, such as hedgerows and wasteland. Taxonomy This species was among the first Hemiptera formally described in the scientific literature by the Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, under the name Cimex marginatus. It was transferred to the genus Coreus by the Danish zoologist Johan Fabricius in 1794. It has numerous synonyms and was historically placed in the genus Syromastus. The specific epithet marginatus refers to the prominent margins of the abdomen. Description The head, pronotum and abdomen of an adult dock bug are speckled reddish brown. The antennae are composed of four segments, red-orange in colour except for the final fourth segment which is black. Between the antennae are two small projections, known as antenniferous tubercles, which can be used to distinguish this species from other superficially similar species.Southwood, T. R. E. and D. Leston, (1959) Land and Water Bugs of the British Isles Frederick Warne & co. The pronotum has angular upward facing projections and the scutellum is clearly visible. The rounded edge of the abdomen has lighter coloured markings. Adults are between 13 and 15 mm long and males are typically smaller than females but have longer antennae. A young (instar II) nymph showing its spiny abdomen and disproportionately large antennae An older nymph with distinct abdominal scent glands and visible wingbuds (developing wings) Young nymphs look different in appearance to the adults. They are heavily spined, less uniform in colouration and have disproportionately large antennae compared to their body size. Older nymphs looks more similar to adults with a more uniform speckled brown colouration but lacking developed wings. Like other Coreidae, Coreus marginatus has scent glands with small pores in the middle of its thorax which can release strong-smelling, irritating, volatile defensive chemicals when disturbed. The pores have an ultrastructure composed of mushroom-like structures that are connected to each other via ridges and trabecules. The chemical composition of the scent gland secretions is similar between males and females, although the relative proportions are different. In females the most prevalent chemical compound is hexanoic acid while in males it is stearic acid. Distribution Linnaeus originally described the species from Europe with only one of his specimens having a specific locality of England. Other early specimens collected by Goeze are from France . The current distribution is extensive and covers: Europe, from Portugal to Finland; Asia, from Russia to China; and Africa, known only from Algeria. Life cycle Adult male and nymph shown from dorsal and ventral views Like other Coreidae the dock bug has an annual life cycle consisting of an egg followed by five successive nymphal instars before becoming an adult. It overwinters as an adult and copulates in the typical heteropteran back-to-back position, laying large brown eggs between late May and early July. The eggs take around 3 to 4 weeks to hatch. The young nymphs will feed on leaves and stems while the older nymphs, like the adults, feed on seeds. The nymphs mature to adults from August onwards. Diet The dock bug is herbivorous and feeds on a wide variety of plants from different families. While the common name in English refers to its preferred diet of docks and sorrels and other plants in the family Polygonaceae, they also readily feed on certain species of Asteraceae and Rosaceae. Adults are known to feed on raspberry, gooseberry and sometimes blackcurrant.

Career Moll spent his entire ten-year professional career with Eintracht Braunschweig, including six seasons in the Bundesliga, starting with the league's foundation in 1963. He joined the club for the 1957‚Äì58 season from Leu Braunschweig, at the time the city's second best team.

It runs from 1st Street at the East River to the World's Fair Marina on Flushing Bay, where it merges with Northern Boulevard. Just before the junction of the two boulevards, there is a large two lane ramp leading to the Whitestone Expressway. Most of the traffic on Astoria Boulevard heads toward this ramp, and then onto the Expressway. Astoria Boulevard is the southern border of Astoria Heights, and the northern border of North Corona. Background In East Elmhurst, Astoria Boulevard is a wide six lane, median divided street. However, traffic is usually light on the boulevard, presumably because the boulevard runs parallel to the busier Northern Boulevard and Grand Central Parkway. During rush hours, though, this road becomes a major artery, serving as an alternate route to the Grand Central Parkway to access the Whitestone Expressway, and as a result, it frequently becomes congested. The efficient synchronization of the traffic lights minimize heavy delays, making this a popular alternate route to take instead of the Grand Central. The portion of Astoria Boulevard between roughly 31st and 78th Streets in Astoria serves as a frontage road, or service road for the Grand Central Parkway. Between First and 31st Streets, it is a busy two lane road, with bidirectional traffic. Here most of the traffic is bound for either the Whitestone Expressway or the Grand Central Parkway. Astoria Boulevard is served by the New York City Subway's BMT Astoria Line at the Astoria Boulevard station (), as well as the Q19, Q49 and M60 SBS bus routes.

He then reaches over and turns on a stereo, starting the song. The song plays, showing scenes of the band dressed in Oshare Kei costumes playing their instruments and singing apparently outside of the factory at night, surrounded by fog, dead plants, dirt, and litter with paper cut-outs of animals and colored balls suspended in the air around them. Scattered images of a ventilation fan spinning, and close-ups of Takeru on a chair surrounded by subwoofers and singing into a large lollipop are shown as well. At the climax of the song, Takeru throws the fake money into the air and continues to sing as it falls on the band like rain. After the song ends, the video cuts back to the room with the paper cutter, this time with all the band members in it counting the fake money. Their speech replaced with English subtitles, the band exclaims that they will now be able to buy anything and throw handfuls of the counterfeit bills into the air.

Radio-Active-Music is currently distributed by Super D One Stop, and COP International.New Signings for Radio-Active-Music from Grave Concerns Magazine  History  Radio-Active-Music.com was founded by Laura Hofford in 2004. While her start in the entertainment business came through theatre technology and design (BA, Theatre Arts - Virginia Tech, 2004), she has broadened her range to include a wide variety of artist support, including, of course, music promotion. As fate would have it, Hofford landed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity during college in becoming an intern for D1 Music Network, an independent record company founded by Jay Gordon of Orgy. During her time there, she gained experience in online DJing, band webdesign, A&R;, and eventually went on to be the editor for the journalism staff. But her interest in band promotion didn't end there. The excitement she had gained in working for D1 had expanded to a point where she felt the need to take indie band promotion to the next level for electro/industrial bands. And so Radio-Active-Music.com was born in 2004 as a way to help bands in these genres of music get ahead. Over the next few years, Radio-Active-Music expanded to include supporting several other music-related businesses. For several years, Hofford served as the online promotions coordinator for Electricult Records - an indie label in Australia (with distribution through MGM) founded by Manek of Dead Inside The Chrysalis. Hofford also worked as the head of promotions for Strangeland Records - an indie record store in the Washington, DC metro that specifically catered to electronic, industrial, metal, and punk music - for most of its 2-year run. And from July 2006 through December 2008, she was the associate promoter / booking agent for Midnight - DC's largest and longest running goth/industrial night currently in operation. As Radio-Active- Music.com has grown, the site has evolved to include several other staff members and freelancers to help with the increasing needs of the bands and the community. All of the staff members of the site have extensive backgrounds in promotion in these genres, and are joined by an ever-growing street team who is promoting Radio-Active-Music.com and its artists all over the world. Radio- Active-Music.com was initially located in southwestern Virginia, but relocated to Washington DC in 2005. Radio-Active-Music.com has sponsored and produces countless shows at venues all over the area, from small instores to large festivals (including the company's own yearly festival, NuclearfestNuclearfest), working with brand new bands to national artists. Finally, in the fall of 2008, Hofford announced that the company would be evolving to focus specifically on the growing record label and distribution aspects of the business.Radio-Active-Music.com  Official Releases  RAM001 - Various Artists - Radio-Active-Music.com v1.0 RAM002 - Cynergy 67 - New Machine RAM003 - XUBERX - Rogue State RAM004 - dharmata 101 - Protest Songs for the Content RAM005 - XUBERX - Intelligent Demise RAM006 - 23RAINYDAYS - Wonderful Disaster RAM007 - 23RAINYDAYS - From Today Until Forever RAM008 - Die With Me Tonight - Die With Me Tonight RAM009 - Hopeful Machines - ::Skinless:: RAM010 - Turbulent Soundscape - Wake the Fkuc Up RAM011 - XUBERX - Intelligence, Revised RAM012 - Reaver - Eternal Psychonaut RAM013 - Espermachine - Espermachine RAM014 - hERETICS iN tHE lAB - tERRIBLE tHINGS RAM015 - Third Realm - Love is the Devil RAM016 - dharmata 101 - transcendental hygiene EP RAM017 - Gravity Euphonic - Gravity Euphonic RAM018 - Delica-m - Hyperstimulus  External links  * Radio-Active-Music Official Site  References  Category:American record labels ","title":"Radio-Active-Music"},{"id":"21594993","text":"Two museums in France are called Mus√©e Matisse. *Matisse Museum (Le Cateau) *Mus√©e Matisse (Nice) ","title":"Mus√©e Matisse"},{"id":"21594994","text":"Konrad Birger Knutsen (21 September 1925 ‚Äì 2 October 2012) was a Norwegian civil servant.

In the episode, Brown travels to the United States to try to convince five influential figures that he has special abilities in their particular field of expertise: psychic powers, Christian evangelism, New Age theories, alien abduction and contacting the dead, with the objective of getting them to endorse him as a practitioner in their field. The concept of the show is to highlight the power of suggestion with regard to beliefs and people's abilities, and failure to question them. Brown makes it quite clear that if any of the subjects accused him of trickery he would immediately come clean about the whole thing, a rule similar to one of the self-imposed rules of the perpetrators of the Project Alpha hoax. Using a false name each time, he succeeds in convincing four \\"experts\\" that he has powers, who openly endorsed him as a true practitioner. The fifth expert, the Christian evangelist Curt Nordheilm, is reserved in his response; whilst impressed by Brown's performance, he does not agree to a public endorsement without at least meeting him again. Brown concludes with his impressions of the experience and summary of how belief systems work. Psychic Powers Derren Brown asked a leading figure at a psychic training school in Sedona, Arizona to go into another room and draw a number of simple pictures on any topic she wished. After each picture had been completed, Brown would have his prediction of what the picture was of written down by the other members of the training school in the room with him. He was mostly correct, the one slight error being a cross instead of a Star of David (though he did state it was some kind of religious imagery - maybe a cross?). On one occasion when Brown was telling the participant to draw the next picture, he instructed the lady to \\"let some ideas sail into your mind\\" and not to go \\"overboard on detail\\". She drew a boat on water. UFO Abductee Derren Brown contacted a leading proponent of UFO abductions, claiming, under his pseudonym, to have been abducted. He further claimed that, since his abduction, he was able to sense a person's medical history and current medical state by touch alone. He invited the lady, and her husband, to decide between them which one he should 'read'. Turning his back and closing his eyes, he waited while one of them made physical contact with him. At this point he stated that the person touching him had or was having trouble sleeping, and had some problem with their heart or throat. Turning around, he further informed the lady that she had had something serious with her throat but that it had been 'decades' ago. He asked if he was close, to which she replied he was exactly correct. She further characterised his reading as 100% accurate. She very sincerely endorsed him to camera, and invited him to speak at a meeting of her group. He declined the invitation. New-Age Theories Derren Brown instructed a leading new-age theorist to sleep with a machine attached to her pillow for five days. She was told that this machine used crystal technology to record her dreams. In fact it was simply a box with a switch which turned a LED on and off. Brown recalled the dreams correctly, including the fact that some were in black-and-white instead of colour. (Twelve percent of people dream only in black and white). The participant was so impressed that she invited Brown to appear on her radio show the next day, which he declined. Evangelism Brown performed seemingly 'instant conversions' on a group consisting of members of the public, almost all of whom were atheists and non-believers. After the first 'instant conversion' many of the group reportedly chose to leave, concerned by what they had just witnessed. Brown then attempted to 'convert' another individual and then the remainder of the group at once. After this, participants were questioned and most declared a belief in, or openness to the idea of, God or \\"something\\". At the end of the segment, a notice on screen announced that the participants had all been \\"de-converted\\" before they left. In conclusion, the pastor neither endorsed Brown's abilities as genuine nor denied them, but noted this was an unfamiliar form of conversion experience to him. Instead, he asked for another meeting with Brown before any public endorsement could be considered, which Brown turned down. Contacting the Dead Brown explained that many mediums use a technique called cold reading. To illustrate this he arranged a clairvoyant demonstration with \\"fairly sceptical New Yorkers\\". During the s√©ance Brown convinced three women into believing that he was in contact with deceased loved ones and during the performance many tears were shed. Afterwards it was explained to the participants that it was a trick, and those appearing agreed to broadcasting the event. Conclusion Derren Brown ends the episode with a monologue, describing his impressions of the experience. His conclusion is that belief systems work in similar ways: that people tend to hear only things that support their own ideas and ignore contradictory evidence; this principle is known in psychology as confirmation bias. More subtly Brown leaves viewers questioning whether, by not achieving his stated objective, he is cleverly demonstrating this principle himself: Brown admits his own scepticism is also subject to this principle and claims success because none of his subjects asked him if the experience was real, however he makes no further reference to his goal of convincing all his subjects to agree to a public endorsement.

Members of the genus belong to the class Agaricomycetes, order Russulales, and family Peniophoraceae. The genus is widespread, and contains 62 species. The species of Peniophora are resupinate, or crust-like, and are described as corticioid. A number of its members are parasitised by other fungi. For example, Tremella mesenterica is a parasite to several species of Peniophora.  Taxonomy and classification  The genus was first described by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in 1879. The type species is Peniophora quercina, initially named Thelephora quercina by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801 before being transferred to Peniophora by Cooke in 1879. However, this species was also chosen as the type species for the genus Corticium as defined by Persoon in 1794. Until 1981 the starting point for the nomenclature of the corticioid fungi was the publication of Fries' first volume of the Systema mycologicum, which was set at January 1, 1821. Corticium Persoon (1794) was therefore a devalidated name because it was published before the starting point. Mycologists of the later 19th and 20th centuries, including Patouillard (1900), Burt (1914‚Äì26), and Bourdot and Galzin (1928) distinguished species of Peniophora Cooke by their hymenial cystidia from species of Corticium Persoon, which lacked them. Despite being synonyms under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN), Corticium and Peniophore were used in this encompassing sense well into the 20th century. Changes made to the ICBN in 1981 included moving the starting point date for fungi back to May 1, 1753, the publication date of Linnaeus' Species plantarum. Names published between 1753 and 1821 (including Corticium) are now considered valid. When Cooke described Peniophora, he incorporated many crustlike species whose fruit bodies possess in the hymenium sterile, hair-like structures termed cystidia. Subsequent investigators, such as Bresadola and Burt accepted and expanded upon Cooke's concept of the genus, placing in it nearly all corticiaceous species that produced cystidia. Often, other taxonomically significant characters were not fully considered, and as a result, Peniophora soon became a heterogeneous assemblage of species. A number of morphological studies were carried out in the 20th century to better characterize the genus. Bourdot and Galzin (1912, 1928) were among the first investigators to recognize that certain species within the genus had more distinct affinities with each other than with other members of the genus. This prompted them to divide the genus into sections and groups of seemingly morphologically related species, such as the sections Coloratae and Membranaceae. Later, several species of the section Membranaceae would be transferred into the genus Phanerochaete. Later attempts to refine the infrageneric classification of Peniophora included morphology, physiology, development, cytogenetics, cytology and biochemistry.

Seven Nights () is a 1960 French drama film directed by Peter Brook. It was entered into the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, where Jeanne Moreau won the award for Best Actress. It is based on the 1958 novel Moderato cantabile by Marguerite Duras. Plot Anne Desbar√®des is a young woman who is married to a wealthy businessman and is living a monotonous existence in the town of Blaye, a small commune. After being an indirect witness to a murder which happened in a caf√©, she goes back to it the next day, where she meets Chauvin, who informs her in more detail about the crime scene events. Anna due to her unstable mental balance starts to think that he intends to kill her. Cast * Jeanne Moreau as Anne Desbar√®des * Jean-Paul Belmondo as Chauvin * Pascale de Boysson as Bar's owner * Jean Deschamps as M. Desbar√®des * Didier Haudepin as Pierre * Colette R√©gis as Miss Giraud * Valeric Dobuzinsky as Assassin (as Val√©ric) Production Duras' novella was published in 1958. It was read by Peter Brook, who wanted to turn it into a film. He secured the rights from Duras and wanted to give the lead role to Jeanne Moreau, whom he had directed in a Paris production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. However Brook's only other film, The Beggar's Opera, had been a box office flop and raising money was difficult. According to a newspaper report \\"after almost a year of financial, artistic and emotional blackmail and diplomacy, Raoul Levy undertook to produce the film for love.\\" Levy described the film as \\"a romantic suspense story that only uses two principals. I guess that you could say that, through the basis of a passive love story, we learn how a crime of passion was committed.\\" Levy said he wanted Simone Signoret to play the female lead. However Brook wanted Moreau and under the contract Brook had with Levy, Brook, Moreau and Duras had complete artistic control. The director admits this was \\"very unusual\\" but the film needed \\"assured and delicate\\" handling to succeed. Brook says Levy did not understand the script but \\"was convinced that if Brook, Moreau and Duras saw something in it, something must be there.\\" Levy decided not to show the script to potential financiers. Instead he went to them and said, \\"Look here, you turned down The 400 Blows because you couldn't understand the script, you turned down Hiroshima Mon Amour; well, I can't make head nor tail of this script and what's more I'm not even going to show it to you - but I want 30 million francs.\\" The money was raised. The male lead was given to Richard Burton, who was going to play the part in French. \\"This one is for art, not money,\\" said Burton. \\"For a classical actor, the key thing is variation - unusual kinds of things in different media. It's all a matter of expanding one's acting range.\\" However Burton's casting fell through shortly before filming was to begin. The actor later claimed this was because \\"French unions objected at the last minute to a British actor appearing in an all-French production, even though England's Peter Brook was the director.\\" Jean Paul Belmondo replaced him, deciding to appear in the movie instead of taking a theatre role. He would not appear on stage for over twenty five years. During filming, Belmondo was in a car accident while driving in which Moreau's son was injured. Reception The film performed well at the box office in Paris but struggled outside. Duras later said she felt that Brook had \\"made the film beautifully.\\" However Belmondo, who preferred making adventure movies, disliked the film. In a 1964 interview he said: > It was very boring. Like Antonioni's films, Marguerite Duras' script was > full of sous-entendus (hidden meanings). Everyone was looking something > significant in every expression. You didn't just drink a glass of wine. You > asked yourself, 'Why does she want me to drink it?' The film was released in the US in 1964. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"perfection\\". Awards The film was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Jeanne Moreau won the award for Best Actress. The critic from the New York Times who attended the festival called the movie \\"dull and empty\\". References External links * *Seven Days...

PVT collectors combine photovoltaic solar cells, which convert sunlight into electricity, with a solar thermal collector, which transfers the otherwise unused waste heat from the PV module to a heat transfer fluid. By combining electricity and heat generation within the same component, these technologies can reach a higher overall efficiency than solar photovoltaic (PV) or solar thermal (T) alone. Significant research has gone into developing a diverse range of PVT technologies since the 1970s. The different PVT collector technologies differ substantially in their collector design and heat transfer fluid and address different applications ranging from low temperature heat below ambient up to high temperature heat above 100 ¬∞C.  PVT markets  PVT collectors generate solar heat and electricity basically free of direct CO2 emissions and are therefore regarded as a promising green technology to supply renewable electricity and heat to buildings and industrial processes. Heat is the largest energy end-use. In 2015, the provision of heating for use in buildings, industrial purposes and other applications accounted for around 52 % (205 EJ) of the total energy consumed. Of this, over half was used in the industry and around 46 % in the building sector. While 72 % of the heat was provided by the direct combustion of fossil fuels, only 7 % was from modern renewables such as solar thermal, biofuel or geothermal energy. The low-grade heat market up to 150 ¬∞C is estimated to be 26.8 % of the worldwide final energy demand, which is currently serviced by fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal), electricity and renewable heat. This is the sum of industry demand 7.1 % (25.5 EJ) and building demand 19.7 % (49.0 EJ residential and 13.6 EJ commercial). The electricity demand in buildings and industry is expected to grow further due to ongoing electrification and sector coupling. For a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is essential that the major share of electricity is sourced from renewable energy sources, such as wind power, solar energy, biomass and water power. The market for renewable heat and electricity is therefore vast, illustrating the market potential of PVT collectors. The report \\"Solar Heat Worldwide\\" assessed the global market of PVT collectors in 2019. According to the authors, the total area of installed collectors amounted to 1.16 million square meters. Uncovered water collectors had the largest market share (55 %), followed by air collectors (43 %) and covered water collectors (2 %). The country with the largest installed capacity was France (42 %), followed by South Korea (24 %), China (11 %) and Germany (10 %).  PVT collector technology  PVT collectors combine the generation of solar electricity and heat in a single component, and thus achieve a higher overall efficiency and better utilization of the solar spectrum than conventional PV modules. Utilization of solar spectrum of a PVT collector Photovoltaic cells typically reach an electrical efficiency between 15 % and 20 %, while the largest share of the solar spectrum (65 % - 70 %) is converted into heat, increasing the temperature of PV modules. PVT collectors, on the contrary, are engineered to transfer heat from the PV cells to a fluid, thereby cooling the cells and thus improving their efficiency. In this way, this excess heat is made useful and can be utilized to heat water or as a low temperature source for heat pumps, for example. Thus, PVT collectors make better use of the solar spectrum. Most photovoltaic cells (e.g. silicon based) suffer from a drop in efficiency with increased cell temperatures. Each Kelvin of increased cell temperature reduces the efficiency by 0.2 ‚Äì 0.5 %. Therefore, heat removal from the PV cells can lower their temperature and thus increase the cells' efficiency. Improved PV cell lifetimes are another benefit of lower operation temperatures. This is an effective method to maximize total system efficiency and reliability, but causes the thermal component to under- perform as compared to that achievable with a pure solar thermal collector. That is to say, the maximum operating temperatures for most PVT system are limited to less than the maximum cell temperature (typically below 100¬∞C). Nevertheless, two or more units of heat energy are still generated for each unit of electrical energy, depending on cell efficiency and system design. Types of PVT collectors There are a multitude of technical possibilities to combine PV cells and solar thermal collectors. A number of PVT collectors are available as commercial products, which can be divided into the following categories according to their basic design and heat transfer fluid: * PVT liquid collector * PVT air collector In addition to the classification by heat transfer fluid, PVT collectors can also be categorized according to the presence of a secondary glazing to reduce heat losses and the presence of a device to concentrate solar irradiation: * Uncovered PVT collector (WISC PVT) * Covered PVT collector * Concentrating PVT collector (CPVT) Moreover, PVT collectors can be classified according to their design, such as cell technology, type of fluid, heat exchanger material and geometry, type of contact between fluid and PV module, fixation of heat exchanger, or level of building integration (building integrated PVT (BIPVT) collectors). The design and type of PVT collectors always implies a certain adaption to operating temperatures, applications, and giving priority to either heat or electricity generation. For instance, operating the PVT collector at low temperatures leads to a cooling effect of PV cells compared to PV modules and therefore results in an increase of electric power. However, the heat also has to be utilized at low temperatures. The maximum operating temperatures for most PV modules are limited to less than the maximum certified operation temperatures (typically 85 ¬∞C). Nevertheless, two or more units of thermal energy are generated for each unit of electrical energy, depending on cell efficiency and system design. PVT liquid collector The basic water-cooled design uses channels to direct fluid flow using piping attached directly or indirectly to the back of a PV module. In a standard fluid-based system, a working fluid, typically water, glycol or mineral oil circulates in the heat exchanger behind the PV cells. The heat from the PV cells is conducted through the metal and absorbed by the working fluid (presuming that the working fluid is cooler than the operating temperature of the cells). PVT air collector The basic air-cooled design uses either a hollow, conductive housing to mount the photovoltaic panels or a controlled flow of air to the rear face of the PV panel. PVT air collectors either draw in fresh outside air or use air as a circulating heat transfer medium in a closed loop. Heat is radiated from the panels into the enclosed space, where the air is either circulated into a building HVAC system to recapture heat energy, or rises and is vented from the top of the structure. The heat transfer capability of air is lower than that of typically used liquids and therefore requires a proportionally higher mass flow rate than an equivalent PVT liquid collector. The advantage is that the infrastructure required has lower cost and complexity. The heated air is circulated into a building HVAC system to deliver thermal energy. Excess heat generated can be simply vented to the atmosphere. Some versions of the PVT air collector can be operated in a way to cool the PV panels to generate more electricity and assist with reducing thermal effects on lifetime performance degradation. A number of different configurations of PVT air collectors exist, which vary in engineering sophistication. PVT air collector configurations range from a basic enclosed shallow metal box with an intake and exhaust up to optimized heat transfer surfaces that achieve uniform panel heat transfer across a wide range of process and ambient conditions. PVT air collectors can be carried out as uncovered or covered designs.  Uncovered PVT concentrator (WISC)  Uncovered PVT collectors, also denoted as unglazed or wind and/or infrared sensitive PVT collectors (WISC), typically consist of a PV module with a heat exchanger structure attached to the back of the PV module. While most PVT collectors are prefabricated units, some products are offered as heat exchangers to be retrofitted to off-the-shelf PV modules. In both cases, a good and longtime durable thermal contact with a high heat transfer coefficient between the PV cells and the fluid is essential. The rear side of the uncovered PVT collector can be equipped with thermal insulation (e.g. mineral wool or foam) to reduce heat losses of the heated fluid. Uninsulated PVT collectors are beneficial for operation near and below ambient temperatures. Particularly uncovered PVT collectors with increased heat transfer to ambient air are a suitable heat source for heat pump systems. When the temperature in the heat pump‚Äôs source is lower than the ambient, the fluid can be heated up to ambient temperature even in periods without sunshine. Accordingly, uncovered PVT collectors can be categorized into: * Uncovered PVT collector with increased heat transfer to ambient air * Uncovered PVT collector without rear insulation * Uncovered PVT collector with rear insulation Uncovered PVT collectors are also used to provide renewable cooling by dissipating heat via the PVT collector to the ambient air or by utilizing the radiative cooling effect. In doing so, cold air or water is harnessed, which can be utilized for HVAC applications.  Covered PVT collector  Covered, or glazed PVT collectors, feature an additional glazing, which encloses an insulating air layer between the PV module and the secondary glazing. This reduces heat losses and increases the thermal efficiency. Moreover, covered PVT collectors can reach significantly higher temperatures than PV modules or uncovered PVT collectors. The operating temperatures mostly depend on the temperature of the working fluid. The average fluid temperature can be between 25¬∞C in swimming pool applications to 90¬∞C in solar cooling systems. Covered PVT collectors resemble the form and design of conventional flat plate collectors or evacuated vacuum tubes. Yet, PV cells instead of spectrally-selective absorber coatings absorb the incident solar irradiance and generate an electrical current in addition to solar heat. The insulating characteristics of the front cover increase the thermal efficiency and allow for higher operating temperatures. However, the additional optical interfaces increase optical reflections and thus reduce the generated electrical power. Anti-reflective coatings on the front glazing can reduce the additional optical losses.  PVT concentrator (CPVT)  A concentrator system has the advantage to reduce the amount of PV cells needed. Therefore it is possible to use more expensive and efficient PV cells, e.g. multi-junction photovoltaic cell. The concentration of sunlight also reduces the amount of hot PV-absorber area and therefore reduces heat losses to the ambient, which improves significantly the efficiency for higher application temperatures. Concentrator systems also often require reliable control systems to accurately track the sun and to protect the PV cells from damaging over-temperature conditions. However, there are also stationery PVT collector types that use nonimaging reflectors, such as the Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC), and do not have to track the sun. Under ideal conditions, about 75% of the sun's power directly incident upon such systems can be gathered as electricity and heat at temperatures up to 160¬∞C. For more details, see the discussion of CPVT within the article for concentrated photovoltaics. A limitation of high-concentrator (i.e. HCPV and HCPVT) systems is that they maintain their long-term advantages over conventional c-Si/mc-Si collectors only in regions that remain consistently free of atmospheric aerosol contaminants (e.g. light clouds, smog, etc.). Power production is rapidly degraded because 1) radiation is reflected and scattered outside of the small (often less than 1¬∞-2¬∞) acceptance angle of the collection optics, and 2) absorption of specific components of the solar spectrum causes one or more series junctions within the multi-junction cells to under-perform. The short-term impacts of such power generation irregularities can be reduced to some degree with inclusion of electrical and thermal storage in the system.  PVT applications  The range of applications of PVT collectors, and in general solar thermal collectors, can be divided according to their temperature levels: Map of PVT collector technologies and PVT applications per operating temperature * low temperature applications up to 50 ¬∞C * medium temperature applications up to 80 ¬∞C * high temperature applications above 80 ¬∞C Accordingly, PVT collector technologies can be clustered with respect to their temperature levels: the suitability per temperature range depends on the PVT collector design and technology. Therefore, each PVT collector technology features different optimal temperature ranges. The operating temperature ultimately defines which type of PVT collector is suitable for which application. Low temperature applications include heat pump systems and heating swimming pools or spas up to 50 ¬∞C. PVT collectors in heat pump systems act either as low temperature source for the heat pump evaporator or on the load side to supply medium temperature heat to a storage tank. Moreover, regeneration of boreholes and ground source heat exchangers is possible. Uncovered PVT collectors with enhanced air-to-water heat exchange can even be the only source of a heat pump system. In combination with a system architecture allowing to store cold produced with WISC or air collectors also air conditioning is possible. Low and medium temperature applications for space heating and water heating are found in buildings, with temperatures from 20 ¬∞C to 80 ¬∞C. The temperatures of the specific system depend on the requirements of the heat supply system for domestic hot water (e.g. freshwater station, temperature requirements for legionella prevention) and for space heating (e.g. underfloor heating, radiators). Moreover, the PVT collector array can be dimensioned to cover only smaller fractions of the heat demand (e.g. hot water pre-heating), thus reducing operating temperatures of the PVT collector. Solar process heat includes a diverse range of industrial applications with low to high temperature requirements (e.g. solar water desalination, solar cooling, or power generation with concentrating PVT collectors). Depending on the type of heat transfer fluid, PVT collector technologies are suited for several applications: * PVT air collector: space heating systems, agricultural processes (e.g. drying crops); * PVT liquid collector: Space heating (domestic, industrial), water heating systems, water desalination, space cooling, food processing systems. PVT technologies can bring a valuable contribution to the world‚Äôs energy mix and can be considered as an option for applications delivering renewable electricity, heat or cold.

Coaching career In the early 1930s Enright was an assistant football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. From 1931 to 1938, he was the head basketball coach at the University of Georgia and assistant football coach. In 1938, he was hired as head football coach and athletic director at the University of South Carolina. After the 1942 season, he joined the United States Navy serving as a lieutenant and working mostly in their athletic program in the United States. He completed his service in the navy in 1946, and returned to the Gamecocks as head football coach succeeding John D. McMillan, and remained until 1955 when he resigned for health reasons. He hired Warren Giese as his successor, and continued as athletic director until 1960. The Rex Enright Athletic Center on the South Carolina campus was named for him and the Rex Enright Award (also known as the Captain's Cup) given to the football captains of the previous season. He was considered one of the \\"ring leaders\\" in the formation of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. He is a member of the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame. He died in 1960 of peptic ulcers and a rheumatic heart. In 2009, the University of South Carolina recognized Enright as the winningest football coach in school history. His record 64 wins was highlighted during the halftime show of South Carolina's football game versus Florida Atlantic on September 19, where Enright's daughter, Jean Smith, and great-grandson, Brian Garrett, accepted the presentation in his memory.

Eisenhower in order to survey and evaluate the government‚Äôs information and related policies and activities with particular reference to international relations and the national security. In his announcement on January 26 President Eisenhower said, \\"It has long been my conviction that a unified and dynamic effort in this field is essential to the security of the United States and of the peoples in the community of free nations.\\"Government Printing Office (1960). Public Papers of the President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953. Washington, DC: GPO. p. 8. The Jackson Committee first met on January 30, 1953 and, during its existence, interviewed over 250 witnesses, including many representatives of government departments and agencies. It also consulted with members of Congress, studied much highly classified material furnished by various agencies, and received a large volume of correspondence both from government officials and from members of the public and private organizations.  Committee findings  The Committee presented a security classified report to the President on June 30, 1953, with its conclusions and recommendations being turned over to the United States National Security Council for study. A White House press release issued on July 8 summarized the Committee‚Äôs unclassified findings and recommendations. The Committee‚Äôs pessimistic assessment of the Soviet Union‚Äôs intentions reflects the pervasive cold war atmosphere of the 1950s. The Committee stressed that \\"there is no reliable evidence that the recent changes in the Soviet regime and in Soviet tactics involve any change in the basic Soviet objective of a communist world controlled by the Kremlin,\\" and went on to state that \\"in the struggle between the imposed coalition dominated by the Kremlin and the free coalition led by the United States, the latter must base its policies on the assumption that the purpose of the Soviet rulers is world domination and that this purpose will constitute the fundamental motivation of all their actions.\\" The United States and its allies had to, therefore, \\"continue to strengthen their military capabilities until it is possible to perceive with clarity that the Soviet Union is unwilling to risk general war, has abandoned its goal of world domination, and will live up to its obligations under the charter of the United Nations.\\"  Operations Coordinating Board  One of the Committee‚Äôs recommendations called for the establishment within the National Security Council structure of an Operations Coordinating Board, whose chief function would be to coordinate the formulation by government agencies of detailed operational plans to carry out national security policies. At the same time the Committee recommended that the Psychological Strategy Board, created in 1951, be abolished because that Board had apparently been founded on the notion that psychological activities and strategy existed apart from official policies and actions, a concept repudiated by the Committee. Instead, it assumed that every diplomatic, economic and military action of the United States Government had a psychological aspect or implication. The Committee also idealistically urged that the terms \\"cold war\\" and \\"psychological warfare\\" be discarded in favor of others which better described the United States‚Äô true goals.  U.S. Information Agency  The Committee‚Äôs July 8 release discussed the goals and techniques of the United States' overseas information programs and called for the consolidation of these programs into one service. The result was the establishment of the United States Information Agency in August 1953.\\"USIA Factsheet\\" , University of Illinois at Chicago The Committee also pointed out the need for improved guidance and technical controls of programs in individual countries and urged the development of a better understanding of U.S. information programs by the American public.

Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclop√©die Ann√©e (1990) Volume 8 Num√©ro 8 p. 106-107 Biography After trying his hand at painting and sculpture, Naigeon became a friend and associate of Denis Diderot, whom he helped to work on the Encyclop√©die. He soon became involved with the Coterie Holbachique, a group of radical French Enlightenment thinkers centered on the Paris salon of Baron d'Holbach. Naigeon quickly adopted the Baron's atheist principles and collaborated with him on his works, overseeing their clandestine printing in Amsterdam and editing d'Holbach's Morale Universelle and his Essai sur les pr√©jug√©s. Priding himself on a thorough knowledge of the classics, Naigeon would also edit a French translation of the works of Seneca begun by Nicolas La Grange, publishing it along with Diderot's Essai sur les r√©gnes de Claude et de N√©ron (Paris, 1778). Other editorial work included the Essays of Montaigne, and a translation of Toland‚Äôs philosophical letters Naigeon is best known for editing the works of the famous encyclop√©diste Denis Diderot Naigeon became the editor, compiler, and commentator of Diderot's works after the latter made him his literary executor. He published an incomplete edition of Diderot's works in 1798 after writing M√©moires historiques et philosophiques sur la vie et les ouvrages de Diderot, an unfinished commentary on his life and works. Naigeon's only original stand- alone work was Le militaire philosophe, ou Difficult√©s sur la religion, propos√©es au P√©re Malebranche (London and Amsterdam, 1768) which was based on an earlier anonymous manuscript, and whose final chapter was written by d'Holbach. This work mostly repeated the atheist, anti-Christian, determinist materialist arguments found in the radical literature of the second half of the 18th century. Naigeon continued his attacks on religion in his Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Philosophy in the Encyclop√©die m√©thodique (1791‚Äì1794). In his address to the National Assembly in 1790 (') he called for absolute freedom of the press, asking the Assembly to withhold the name of God and religion from their declaration of the rights of man.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on 20 February 2009. The game was published by Aspyr Media in the United States, on May 25, 2009, and Canada on August 10, 2009. A prequel entitled NecroVisioN: Lost Company was released in February 2010. Synopsis Setting NecroVisioN is set in 1916 during World War I. The player takes the role of Simon Bukner, a young American soldier recently recruited into the British Army. In addition to German soldiers, Simon soon finds himself fighting supernatural forces, including vampires, demons, and zombies found in locations varying from the battlefields of World War I to secret laboratories and caverns. The main setting is the Battle of the Somme, during which a rumor of a mysterious infection has appeared, which causes all people to turn into zombie-like state. Later, the game takes the player into two new settings; the underground realm of Vampires, and the demonic realm, Hell. Plot The game begins with the protagonist Simon Bukner being awakened by a British soldier within a bunker. It is apparently time for a counterattack against German lines. After a rallying speech by the commanding officer, Simon is to follow his squad of soldiers towards the assault point. But as soon as they arrive, they are ambushed by heavy German machine gun fire and mustard gas. Many of the soldiers die and Simon is seen running aimlessly, searching for cover from both bullets and gas. Soon, Simon collapses. When Simon reawakens, he is in another bunker with several corpses and a surviving British soldier. The soldier claims he has barricaded the bunker from the inside to prevent anything from coming in. That includes members of Simon's squad escaping the gas. Simon is visibly upset and angry at the soldier's cowardice. The soldier continues rambling due to battlefield stress about having German passwords and other intel, including some on patrol routes. Thus he plans to evade and escape the trenches with the information he has. Simon then threatens him and soon, a fight ensues. Simon kills him and takes his rifle. Simon is disturbed by the fact that he has to kill a friendly soldier. By blowing up the barricade, Simon fights his way through the trenches and meets several soldiers who Simon initially believes are in a bad mental state (shell shock) because of the horrors they have seen. However, soon the zombies, hell hounds, and other netherworld creatures begin to manifest. Nearing a trench, a demonic looking face manifests itself and starts rambling about a savior, and that Simon can be that savior. This is one of the last vampires, a mystic race that stood against demons. Simon begins to wonder what is going on here and suspects that there is something much much more sinister happening at the trenches. Along the way, Simon begins to unravel and discover bits and pieces of information about what is going on. This leads him to Jonas Zimmerman, the person behind the monstrosity that has been going on. Eventually, the player travels through trenches, old ruins (where he first encounters Zimmerman, but is tricked) and finally the stronghold where Zimmerman was last located. At the basement lab of the stronghold, the player discovers a mechanical walking tank created by the Vampires. Using it, Simon proceeds to a showdown with Zimmerman who commandeers a Scorpion-shaped walking tank ten times the size of Simon's tank. After getting rid of Zimmerman, Simon is chosen as the owner of the new Shadow Hand with Menthor inside - the spirit of an old Vampiric champion, bound within the glove. This glove was the source of Zimmerman's power over the undead, and now it is to be used against the demons deep underground. Menthor will act as the companion of the player, guides him all the way, and provides instructions about the spell system in the game. The goal of the game from now on is to conquer the great demon - Mephisto. Simon descends deep into steampunk-styled underground Vampire realm, which has been corrupted by demons. After a long journey, Simon mounts an ancient dragon and makes his way to Hell itself, where he battles Mephisto's second-in-command, the fallen angel Azazel (who rides three-headed Cerberus). Later, Simon encounters Mephisto himself, and clashes with him in final battle. The game has three endings, which are chosen based on the difficulty level: *EASY: Simon wakes up in the Somme trenches directly when the war ends in 1918 with the attack by Mephisto's forces having never taken place. He is taken back to his army by a German soldier, medics tell him he contracted shell shock resulting in him being unable to remember the last two years. They also discover strange multiple scars on his arms whose origins they cannot explain. *NORMAL: Unable to escape from Hell, Simon makes a deal with Mephisto giving the human and vampire races 100 years of peace before his next attempted invasion of Earth. In return, Simon becomes General of the Army of Hell and wonders if humanity and the vampires will be ready for the next demonic invasion. *HARD: Mephisto dies and Simon becomes the new King of Hell who starts preparing to lead another attack on the humans and vampires. Gameplay NecroVisioN is a first-person shooter which also has a close- combat system and an ability to use both arms with different weapons. The health system is based on limited regeneration, with an ability to use a health pack or a red shard to restore it. Slain enemies may drop health or mana, which is used for spells. The gameplay is varied, and includes combo system, challenge mode, and storyline sections where player pilots a Vampire- made robotic exosuit and rides a dragon. Multiplayer There are no demonic spells, weapons or powers. The player can choose either to be a Human, Undead or a Vampire. The modes are Free for All, in which players fight each other in a classic deathmatch mode; Capture the Artifact in which teams attempt to capture a vampiric artifact and bring it to their base; Team Deathmatch in which players are grouped into teams to fight each other in a classic deathmatch mode; and Last Man Standing in which players start the game with additional health and fight each other. The last player left alive wins the match. Soundtrack Preliator by Immediate Music was featured as the final boss music. Orchard of Mines by Globus was featured as the ending credits song in the game. Reception NecrovisioN received average to mixed reviews. Where IGN award with 6.9/10 while GameSpot rated it with 7/10. Martyn Clayden of IT Reviews had said that the game is a mix of H. P. Lovecraft and Medal of Honor set in World War I. Prequel NecroVisioN: Lost Company is a prequel to the story of the first game. It features Jonas Zimmerman as the protagonist, and shows him fighting against demonic invaders during the war, slowly discovering the vampire tech. He eventually fights against a powerful golem, who guarded the Shadow Hand, but is corrupted by the demonic powers.

The eighth entry in the Mr. Driller series, gameplay revolves around clearing each level by destroying, or \\"drilling\\", large formations of colorful blocks. Players have an oxygen meter that acts as a time limit, and constantly depletes; air is replenished by collecting air capsules, and is depleted further by destroying brown \\"X\\" blocks. Mr. Driller W was part of Namco Bandai's effort in bringing their classic franchises to digital distribution platforms, due to the concept seeing success with services such as Xbox Live Arcade. The game re-uses many assets from previous games in the series, such as Mr. Driller Drill Land and Mr. Driller Drill Spirits. It was the company's first game for the WiiWare service. W received mixed reviews, being praised for its adidctive gameplay and visuals and criticized for its lack of content compared to earlier entries and a lack of an online multiplayer mode. Gameplay In-game screenshot. Mr. Driller W is a puzzle video game. It features gameplay reminiscent of the Dig Dug series, being presented in a colorful, 2D style. Players control one of seven characters as they must make their way to the bottom of each level, all of which take place in real-world locations such as Japan, Egypt, and even the moon. The seven characters include Susumu Hori, the main protagonist of the series; Anna Hottenmeyer, a German driller and rival of Susumu; Ataru Hori, Susumu's outcast older brother; Taizo Hori, the protagonist of Dig Dug and the father of Susumu and Ataru; Puchi, Susumu's pet dog; Holinger-Z, a drilling robot; and Usagi, Atari's pet rabbit-like alien who is locked from the start. Each character possesses their own unique abilities; for instance, Holinger-Z can sustain an extra hit, essentially doubling the player's life count. The gameplay revolves around destroying, or \\"drilling\\", colorful formations of blocks that litter the playfield. The player has a constantly-depleting oxygen meter, which acts as a time limit; oxygen can be replenished by collecting air capsules found throughout the level, while oxygen is lost by destroying brown- colored \\"X\\" blocks. Development and release With digital distribution services for home video game consoles becoming increasingly popular with players towards the late 2000s, Namco Bandai Games sought to begin production of games exclusive to these services for the purpose of feeding into the demand. After seeing success with games such as Pac-Man Championship Edition and their various arcade game conversions for the Xbox 360, the company looked to other digital services to bring their back catalog of games to. Namco Bandai chose to bring over many of their more popular and well-known franchises to these platforms, due to their large brand recognition worldwide. The popularity and success of the Mr. Driller series prompted the creation of a new game in the series for these services, leading to what later became Mr. Driller W. It was in production alongside the DSiWare sequel Mr. Driller: Drill Till You Drop. The game reuses many assets from previous games in the series, such as Mr. Driller Drill Land and Mr. Driller Drill Spirits. Namco Bandai teased the game in the January 2009 issue of their magazine Side-BN, alongside Xevious Resurrection and Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy. It was further shown off by Famitsu, presented in conjunction with Drill Till You Drop. It was the company's first game announced for the WiiWare service. It was released in Japan on February 25, 2009. The game was later released in North America on August 24, and in PAL territories on August 28. The game features support for the GameCube controller and the Wii Classic Controller, and is backwards-compatible with the Wii U. Reception According to the review aggregator website Metacritic, Mr. Driller W received \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Reviewers focused primarily on the game's lack of content compared to its predecessors, such as the lack of a multiplayer mode. Nintendo Life described the game as \\"a truly unique and rewarding action-puzzler\\". IGN criticized the game for its lack of gamemodes, specifically the omission of a multiplayer, which they expressed confusion towards due to it being a mainstay in the series. A similar response was made by Official Nintendo Magazine, who said the lack of additional game modes ultimately \\"crippled\\" the main game. GamePro and Inside Games, by contrast, were content with the package overall, but argued that the $8 price point might turn off those looking for more content. Most publications agreed that the gameplay was still fun to play and had an addictive quality to it. Nintendo Life labeled it as \\"urgently addictivey\\", saying it made for an easy recommendation to puzzle game fans. The simplicity of its gameplay was praised by Inside Games, who felt it made the game unique and was its strongest point. IGN commented on the game's fast- paced action and addictive nature, writing: \\"It's a fast-paced experience that requires you to simultaneously look ahead and behind your character. Many a gamer has been addicted to the hypnotic downward spiral that is Mr. Driller.\\" GamePro compared the game's simplicity and addictive gameplay to that of Dig Dug, particularly for its arcade-esc feel to it. Critics praised the game's \\"Japanese\\"-like art style and character designs. Nintendo Life in particular claimed the large cast of unique characters gave the game variety, allowing the player to switch between different playstyles. IGN and Official Nintendo Magazine agreed, but argued that some characters ‚Äî specifically Holinger-Z ‚Äî were unbalanced. GamePro stated that the artstyle felt like a mix between Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi and The Powerpuff Girls, posing a cute, bright-looking game. IGN said that it \\"comes with the usual Japanese quirkiness and charms\\", praising its soundtrack for the multiple different genres and its cartoonish nature. They also liked the game's implementation of support for the GameCube controller and Wii Classic Controller, as well as its lack of \\"forced in\\" motion controls. GamePro and IGN both recommended the game to those who had never previously played a Mr. Driller game before, with IGN concluding their review with: \\"If you've never played this arcade action game it might be worth a download to see why it's been popular for a decade. But the previously anointed probably don't need another version with fewer features.\\" Retrospectively, Retronauts said that it didn't have anything particularly unique about it, and that it lacked the high-definition visuals and amount of content as its Xbox 360 predecessor Mr. Driller Online.

His highest rank was komusubi. He is now the head coach of Chiganoura stable. Career Kanao practised judo in elementary and junior school, where he also excelled at painting and artwork. Because of his large size he also took part in team sumo competitions at school and regularly placed the team in the top three. Upon his graduation he joined Futagoyama stable in March 1976. It was a prestigious heya to join, as it was run by former yokozuna Wakanohana Kanji I and contained a number of top division stars including popular ozeki Takanohana Kenshi. Initially fighting under his own surname, Kanao adopted the shikona of Futagonishiki in 1977 but switched to Takamisugi two years later. In January 1981, after five years in the unsalaried divisions, he reached sekitori level upon promotion to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division, and he made the top makuuchi division just three tournaments later in July 1981. He initially struggled with injuries and after a number of setbacks, including a short spell back in the third makushita division, he made a top division kachi-koshi at the third attempt in January 1984, and established himself in makuuchi. He dropped back to j≈´ry≈ç in January 1987 but was re-promoted after winning the j≈´ry≈ç championship or yusho in March with a 13‚Äì2 record. In November 1987 he defeated Onokuni in the latter's debut tournament as a yokozuna to earn his only kinboshi or gold star. Takamisugi remained a rank-and file maegashira for nearly all his top division career. Although he reached komusubi twice, in January 1991 and January 1993, he recorded a losing score on both occasions. He holds the record for the most top division tournaments without ever winning a special prize, at 71. In 1993 his stable merged with Fujishima stable and he became a stablemate of ozeki (later yokozuna) Takanohana Koji, whom he had fought eight times previously without beating. In November 1995 he fell into j≈´ry≈ç once more and announced his retirement at the age of 34 after losing his first three matches. Retirement from sumo He remained in sumo as a coach at Futagoyama stable (later renamed Takanohana stable). Unable to purchase toshiyori kabu or elder stock, he borrowed elder names instead. He was known as Fujishima (until the retirement of stablemate Wakanohana Masaru), then Otowayama (until the retirement of Takanonami) and then Tokiwayama Oyakata. Along with five other oyakata (Magaki, Onomatsu, Otowayama, Otake and Futagoyama), he was forced to leave the Nishonoseki ichimon or group of stables in January 2010 after declaring his support for his former stablemate Takanohana's unsanctioned bid to be elected to the board of directors of the Sumo Association. In April 2016 he took over the running of the Chiganoura stable upon the retirement of the previous head, ex-sekiwake Masudayama, and is now known as Chiganoura Oyakata. In October 2018 he became the head coach of Takakeish≈ç and other wrestlers formerly of the defunct Takanohana stable. Takakeish≈ç won the tournament championship in November 2018 and was promoted to ≈çzeki the following year, although he had to pull out of his ≈çzeki debut tournament in May 2019 with an injury. Chiganoura apologized to the Sumo Association for Takakeish≈ç's decision to re-enter the tournament only to have to withdraw once again, and made sure Takakeish≈ç did not appear at the stable's end of tournament party. Personal life He has a fine singing voice and is often called upon to display his talents at sumo functions. His nickname when active was Doraemon because of his facial resemblance to the popular manga/anime character. His wife is a former disc jockey. Fighting style Takamisugi liked a solid frontal pushing attack, and relied almost exclusively on oshisumo and tsuppari (thrusting). The push out or oshidashi was the winning kimarite in nearly half his sekitori matches. He usually lost if his opponents were able to grab hold of his mawashi or belt. He very rarely employed throwing moves; his most common throw was the beltless kotenage, or armlock throw.

Galizische Carl Ludwig-Bahn (CLB), Polish: Kolej galicyjska im. Karola Ludwika) was a railway system, named after Archduke Charles Louis of Austria. It was built in the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia in the second half of the 19th century, under management of Prince Leon Sapieha, with licence granted to him by Emperor Franz Josef on April 7, 1858. Works on the system, carried out by the Association of Charles Louis Railway were not completed until 1892. Once finished, the line crossed whole Galicia from west to east, joining main urban centers of the province - Krak√≥w, Tarn√≥w, Rzesz√≥w, Przemy≈õl, Lw√≥w (Lemberg) and Tarnopol. It started in Krak√≥w and ended at the border rail station of Podwoloczyska (today Pidvolochysk), where it was connected over Zbruch with railroads of the Russian Empire at Volochysk. Apart from the main, west-east line, the system was made of secondary importance connections, such as: * Krak√≥w - Wieliczka, * Krak√≥w - Niepo≈Çomice. Further west, the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis was connected with rail system of Bohemia and Austria at the junctions of Cieszyn and Bohumin. Also, in 1884, the Tarn√≥wStrozeJas≈Ço line was completed, which connected the Archduke Charles Louis Rail with network of the Kingdom of Hungary. Currently, the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis is part of Polish line number 91, which goes from Krak√≥w to the border crossing of Medyka near Przemy≈õl.

In essence, fringe search is a middle ground between A* and the iterative deepening A* variant (IDA*). If g(x) is the cost of the search path from the first node to the current, and h(x) is the heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal, then , and h* is the actual path cost to the goal. Consider IDA*, which does a recursive left-to-right depth-first search from the root node, stopping the recursion once the goal has been found or the nodes have reached a maximum value ∆í. If no goal is found in the first threshold ∆í, the threshold is then increased and the algorithm searches again. I.E. It iterates on the threshold. There are three major inefficiencies with IDA*. First, IDA* will repeat states when there are multiple (sometimes non-optimal) paths to a goal node - this is often solved by keeping a cache of visited states. IDA* thus altered is denoted as memory-enhanced IDA* (ME-IDA*), since it uses some storage. Furthermore, IDA* repeats all previous operations in a search when it iterates in a new threshold, which is necessary to operate with no storage. By storing the leaf nodes of a previous iteration and using them as the starting position of the next, IDA*'s efficiency is significantly improved (otherwise, in the last iteration it would always have to visit every node in the tree). Fringe search implements these improvements on IDA* by making use of a data structure that is more or less two lists to iterate over the frontier or fringe of the search tree. One list now, stores the current iteration, and the other list later stores the immediate next iteration. So from the root node of the search tree, now will be the root and later will be empty. Then the algorithm takes one of two actions: If is greater than the current threshold, remove head from now and append it to the end of later; i.e. save head for the next iteration. Otherwise, if is less than or equal to the threshold, expand head and discard head, consider its children, adding them to the beginning of now. At the end of an iteration, the threshold is increased, the later list becomes the now list, and later is emptied. An important difference here between fringe and A* is that the contents of the lists in fringe do not necessarily have to be sorted - a significant gain over A*, which requires the often expensive maintenance of order in its open list. Unlike A*, however, fringe will have to visit the same nodes repeatedly, but the cost for each such visit is constant compared to the worst-case logarithmic time of sorting the list in A*. Pseudocode Implementing both lists in one doubly linked list, where nodes that precede the current node are the later portion and all else are the now list. Using an array of pre-allocated nodes in the list for each node in the grid, access time to nodes in the list is reduced to a constant. Similarly, a marker array allows lookup of a node in the list to be done in constant time. g is stored as a hash-table, and a last marker array is stored for constant-time lookup of whether or not a node has been visited before and if a cache entry is valid. init(start, goal) fringe F = s cache C[start] = (0, null) flimit = h(start) found = false while (found  false) AND (F not empty) fmin = ‚àû for node in F, from left to right (g, parent) = C[node] f = g + h(node) if f > flimit fmin = min(f, fmin) continue if node  goal found = true break for child in children(node), from right to left g_child = g + cost(node, child) if C[child] != null (g_cached, parent) = C[child] if g_child >= g_cached continue if child in F remove child from F insert child in F past node C[child] = (g_child, node) remove node from F flimit = fmin if reachedgoal  true reverse_path(goal) Reverse pseudo-code. reverse_path(node) (g, parent) = C[node] if parent != null reverse_path(parent) print node Experiments When tested on grid-based environments typical of computer games including impassable obstacles, fringe outperformed A* by some 10 percent to 40 percent, depending on use of tiles or octiles. Possible further improvements include use of a data structure that lends itself more easily to caches. References * Bj√∂rnsson, Yngvi; Enzenberger, Markus; Holte, Robert C.; Schaeffer, Johnathan.

It was founded by entrepreneur Shai Reshef in 2009. History University of the People was launched by educational entrepreneur Shai Reshef in January 2009. Although the university has no campus due to its online distance learning nature, it uses a shared office in California as an office of admission. The first UoPeople students began classes in September 2009, studying for associate and bachelor's degrees in business administration and computer science. At that time, the school had no accreditation and did not charge any fees or tuition. In February 2012, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded the University of the People a grant of $613,282 for the purposes of helping the university earn national accreditation. This work paid off two years later when the university gained accreditation for degree-granting programs through the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC).Accrediting Commission - Grant of Accreditation, DETC, February 13, 2014 Report from the Accrediting Commission - Renewal of Accreditation, DEAC, February 27, 2017 In March 2016, the university began offering an online MBA, with the course itself beginning in September 2016. The MBA is not accredited by any business school accreditation bodies (e.g. AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS). In 2017, the University of Edinburgh partnered with the school so that graduates of the University of the People could complete a bachelor's or postgraduate degree at the University. That same year, Olympian Simone Biles became a student and a spokeswoman for the school, and in 2018 she set up a scholarship fund to help financially struggling students. In January 2019, International Baccalaureate partnered with the University of the People to offer a Master's of Education in Advanced Teaching. In April 2019 it was announced in the World Economic Forum that the University of the People will be also launched in Arabic. Beginning in January 2020, International Baccalaureate offers scholarships to students who are interested in attending the UoPeople M.Ed. program. In September 2020 UoPeople in Arabic was launched. Accreditation University of the People is nationally accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC). It is also approved by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. Rankings In July 2020, University of the People was ranked 5,822 in the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, which ranks institutions based on the volume, visibility, and impact of their web presences. Fees University of the People charges no tuition fees, but students must pay some administrative fees to cover course assessments. These include processing fees for applications and final exam assessments; however, students who cannot afford the administrative costs may be eligible for scholarships. Furthermore, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees the University of the People offers scholarships for refugees.

His two grandfathers Hector Turnbull and William Sandeman had jointly developed linen bleachfields in Luncarty. Initially largely schooled by his older sister Mary, George in 1819 from age 10 rode a pony to Perth Grammar School. In 1824 he attended Edinburgh University learning Latin, Greek and mathematics.George Turnbull, C.E. 437-page memoirs published privately 1893, scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007 Career in England In 1828 he sailed from Dundee to London to train under the famous civil engineer Thomas Telford building St Katharine Docks. In 1830 he became Telford's draughtsman and clerk, living in Telford's house in 24 Abingdon Street. He became an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers at age 19 and eventually the oldest member.George Turnbull, C.E. 437-page memoirs published privately 1893, scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007 In 1832, he helped survey the options for supplying water to London both from the north and south, gauging the north-side rivers Colne, Gade, Lea, Odess and Ver; and on the south side the River Wandle. He was involved in 1833 with experiments for fast passenger canal boats on the Paddington Canal with Cubitt, Dundas and other prominent engineers. In 1834 Telford died: Turnbull (Telford's clerk) made arrangements for his house and correspondence and was involved with his burial in Westminster Abbey. George Turnbull, 1835, Bute Docks, Cardiff, Wales Turnbull was promoted to be resident engineer building the Bute ship canal and Bute Dock (now West Bute dock) in Cardiff, reporting to William Cubitt and meeting Lord Bute regularly. In August 1836 George was in Bristol to see the 1¬Ω-inch bar drawn across the river at Clifton for the future suspension bridge. Brunel visited him at the Cardiff works in 1839. Amongst other journeys, Turnbull's January 1837 diary records travel from Cardiff to his parents' Perthshire home: the mail coach to Bristol (with no Severn Bridge or tunnel of course); all the next day Bristol to London \\"on Cooper's coach, sitting on the box seat outside with the coachman\\" (there was snow 10 feet deep near Marlborough); the steamer Perth for the 41-hour journey to Dundee; and then overland to Huntingtower, near Perth.George Turnbull, C.E. page 27 of the 437-page memoirs published privately 1893, scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007 From 1840 to 1842 Turnbull built Middlesbrough Dock which was later bought by the Stockton and Darlington Railway. In 1841 he travelled through deep snow to Stirling to agree a contract to supply sleepers for the railway. In 1843 he was resident engineer for William Cubitt for the railway line from the Shakespeare Tunnel along the shore to Dover station (he entertained the Duke of Wellington, \\"pale, old and shaky on his legs\\", who visited the works) and built a pier and landing stages at Folkestone. In 1845 he was the engineer in Birkenhead for the complex Seacombe Wall sea defence that helped drain the marshes behind the town of Seacombe. In 1846-9 he was the resident engineer for the Great Northern Railway making cuttings and the South Mimms, Copenhagen and three other tunnels for the first 20 miles out of London, and making the first plans for King's Cross station. East Indian Railway East Indian Railway built by George Turnbull First train of the East Indian Railway, 1854 In 1850 he was appointed Chief Engineer of the East Indian Railway building 1851‚Äì1862 the first railway 541 miles from Calcutta to Benares (on the route to Delhi), 601 miles including branches. He designed Calcutta's terminus at Howrah which now has 23 platforms and the highest train-handling capacity of any station in India. The monsoon-ravaged Ganges tributaries such as the wide Sone River were particularly challenging to bridge: a major constraint for Turnbull was the lack of both quality clay and brick-building skills resulting in the change to importing much ironwork from England for the many bridges and other structures (all rails were imported from England as no Indian steel works existed).

His parents came from Jarkovac, Serbia, and settled in Truax, Saskatchewan, in 1910. Biography Of Serbian ancestry, Jim Trifunov began his career as a newsboy in Regina, later he took up wrestling at his local YMCA in 1922. One year later he had won his first of nine almost- consecutive Canadian bantamweight championships, missing only the 1931 edition due to an injury. His successes sent him to three editions of the Olympic Games, the most notable of which was in 1928, when he captured a bronze medal by overcoming Harold Sansum of Great Britain in the match for the bronze medal. He also won a gold medal in the bantamweight division at the inaugural 1930 British Empire Games by defeating Joseph Reid of England. He retired from active competition following the 1932 Olympics and resumed his career with Regina's Leader-Post. In 1936 he was sent by the Sifton Publishing Company from Regina to Winnipeg to work with the city's Winnipeg Free Press, where he would remain for the rest of his life. While there he took up coaching and sports administration, eventually serving as president of the Manitoba Wrestling Association for a quarter of a century.

It begins with a 40 ft. drop over the first mile as it proceeds into downtown Bath. Miles 2-4 are relatively flat allowing runners the opportunity to establish a rhythm. The first hill is located at the 4.75 mile mark where there is approximately a 40 ft. uphill climb. Over the next four miles the course passes through the countryside dotted with fall foliage and farmland. In this section, there are two small hills to climb despite an overall drop in elevation of 90 ft. Runners then enter the town of Savona where the first Team Relay zone is located. Exiting Savona runners again pass through the countryside with the course continuing its slight downhill slide, approximately 40 ft. over the next 4 miles before reaching the mid-way point located in Campbell. After leaving Campbell the course rises 30 ft. at mile 14. The next 4.2 miles show another slight drop in elevation totaling 80 ft. until the runners come into Coopers Plains, site of the second Team Relay exchange. Two miles out the runners enter a small park just inside the town of Painted Post and continue on with a route through a residential neighborhood. At mile 22.5 the runners come to a bike path and from there it is a virtually a flat course to the finish. The participants pass through Riverside and downtown Corning.

The facility is located about 100 km south-east of Springbok, in the Northern Cape. It covers an area of approximately 10,000 hectare, measuring 16,5 km from east to west and 6,5 km from north to south at its narrowest point. Approximately 1,000 hectare is occupied by sites developed for low- and intermediate-level waste, an interim spent nuclear fuel storage facility, housing, roads, power lines and an airstrip. Vaalputs lies between the Namaqualand in the west and the Bushmanland in the east. During 1978 a programme to select a suitable site for the disposal of nuclear waste was commenced over large parts of South Africa. The programme leader had to keep a variety of socio-economic and geology related parameters in mind. Pioneer investigations indicated that the Northern Cape was the most feasible area. Supplementary studies showed that a place approximately 100 km southeast of Springbok was ideally suited for the disposal of low- and intermediate-level wastes. In 1983 three farms were acquired by the state on behalf of the NECSA, which now constitute the Vaalputs Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility. The first low- and intermediate-level waste arrived from Koeberg in October 1986. Initially, silos were envisaged for dry storage of spent fuel from Koeberg. However the spent fuel from Koeberg is stored in reactor pools on the Koeberg site. These pools have been re-racked in order to facilitate lifetime storage of spent fuel. Low and intermediate waste was buried in 10 meter deep trenches, which were filled with compacted soil, whereafter the surface was rehabilitated by planting local flora. In June 1997 it was revealed that some uncovered containers had rusted and were leaking radioactivity. The National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) temporarily suspended operations, until the licensing conditions were met by the operators. The NNR established communication with local communities in September 2003.

Between 1859 and 1901 Ordronaux published at least fifteen books and articles about subjects as diverse as heroes of the American Revolution of 1776, military medicine, medical jurisprudence, mental health, United States constitutional law and historical treatises. He left an estate worth $2,757,000 much of which he gave in endowments to several US universities and other institutions. He did not marry. Early life Johh Ordronaux was born in New York City on August 3, 1830. He was the only son of Captain John Ordronaux (a notable privateer of the War of 1812), and his wife Jean Marie Elizabeth Ordronaux (n√©e Charretton). This is supported by the younger Ordronaux's will which mentions a bequest to his sister Florine, and to his nieces Clara and May Molan, matching genealogical information prepared by an Ordronaux family member.Pedigrees provided by Captain Charles Reader, Corps of Engineers, Dept. of Military Science & Tactics, The Johns Hopkins University for the Bureau of Navigation, US Navy Department on February 8, 1940 and December 9, 1941. Capt. Reader was the great grandson-in-law of Dr Ordronaux's father. Ref. Nav-2-LM DD617/S6-2(1) He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1850, from Harvard Law School in 1852, and from the National Medical School in 1859. In 1859 he published his first book, a Eulogy on the life and character of Rev. Zachariah Greene, who, before taking Holy Orders, had fought under Washington in the revolution of 1776 at the age of seventeen.Ordronaux, J. Eulogy on the life and character of Rev. Zachariah Greene. Baker & Godwin, 1859. In 1860 Ordronaux became a Professor of medical jurisprudence at Columbia Law School, a post that he held until 1887. Since 1861 he had also been a lecturer at Dartmouth College, The University of Vermont and Boston University. American Civil War During the American Civil War Ordronaux served as an army surgeon stationed in New York. He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks on the health of armies,Ordronaux, J. Hints on the preservation of health in armies. Appleton, 1861.Ordronaux, J. Hints on health in armies. D. Van Nostrand, 1863. and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits.Ordronaux, J. Manual of Instructions for Military Surgeons on the Examination of Recruits. D Van Nostrand, 1863. In the introduction to the latter, which was written for the United States Sanitary Commission, he said, > The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized > importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures > in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be > done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been > formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all > sufficient for this purpose ; and that officers and men could go their way > free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score.

In 1863 he wrote a historical treatise in French (with Reinaud) on the commercial and political relations between the Roman Empire and the countries of Oriental Asia.Ordronaux, J. (with Reinaud, J.T.). Relations Politique et Commerciales de l'Empire Romain avec l'Asie Orientale. Imprimerie imperiale, 1863. In 1864 he wrote a second report for the United States Sanitary Commission. This concerned pensions for the war wounded and was subtitled, \\"On a system for the economical relief of disabled soldiers, and on certain proposed amendments to our present pension laws\\".Ordronaux, J. Report to the U.S. Sanitary Commission. Sanford, Harroun & Co., 1864. After the war After the war he returned to Columbia Law School and began writing again. Between 1867 and 1871 he produced a book on preventative medicineOrdronaux, J. Prophylaxis, an anniversary oration. Bailli√®re brothers; London, 1867. and two textbooks on medical jurisprudence.Ordronaux, J. The jurisprudence of medicine in its relation to the law of contracts, torts, and evidence. T. & J.W. Johnson, 1869.Ordronaux, J. In re William Winter. s.n., 1870. He also translated into English verse the medieval Latin text of Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum, the medical encyclopedia of the Scuola Medica Salernitana.Ordronaux, J. Translation into English verse of Regimen Sanitatis Salerni. Scuola Medica Salernitana. Lippincott, 1871. This school in Salerno, Italy was the pre-eminent medical school in Europe in the 11th century. This was not the first English translation but an attempt to make a medically accurate one. He appears to have done this as a tribute to former members of his profession and in an introduction to his work he said, > Regimen Sanitatis Salerni was a work of transcendent merit. Though written > in the early twilight of the Middle Ages and in inferior Latin, it at once > took its place alongside of such classic productions as the Aphorisms of > Hippocrates. No secular work, indeed, ever met with more popular favor, nor > infused its canons so radically into the dogmas of any science. It was for > ages the medical Bible of all Western Europe, and held undisputed sway over > the teachings of its schools, next to the writings of Hippocrates and Galen. Work on mental health Ordronaux developed an interest in mental health and between 1872 and 1882 he was a member of the New York State Commission in Lunacy writing two books on the subject.Ordronaux, J. The proper legal status of the insane & feeble-minded. McDivitt, Campbell & Co., 1875Ordronaux, J. Commentaries on the lunacy laws of New York. J. D. Parsons, Jr., 1878. The second of these books mentions the opening of a ground breaking mental hospital and in his preface to the book he says, > The recent establishment of a department of Lunacy supervision by the State > of New York, has turned public attention to it as a source for consultation, > in the application of our Statute and Common Law to the legal relations of > the insane......Insanity is a subject which touches our civil rights at so > many different points, that it may be said to have a place in every problem > involving human responsibility. It begins with man in the cradle, and > follows him to the grave. It is often part of his physical heritage, and may > become a qualifying element in all his civil acts. To collect and embody in > one treatise the principles of law by which courts govern their > adjudications in questions of mental incapacity, and to expound through > commentaries both the philosophy of these decisions and the rules of > procedure under which they are rendered, is the object aimed at in this > manual of Lunacy practice. Ordronaux's activity as a Commissioner was frequently mentioned in the press. In 1875, he was called in to adjudicate whether a man, who was under sentence of death for murder, was insane. The same newspaper reported again on January 7, 1876 how Ordronaux had found that Kings County Lunatic Asylum was being mismanaged by the charity commissioners (17). He also investigated complaints from two inmates in Buffalo asylum of abusive behaviour by their carers. In his report Ordronaux upheld the complaints and recommended the discharge of the two staff involved. By 1882 his forward thinking and outspokenness had made him some enemies and in 1882 his salary of $4000 as Commissioner in Lunacy was temporarily opposed in debate in the finance committee of the New York State Senate. U.S. Constitution Ordronaux's work on State law in New York led him to consider its relationship with Federal law, and in 1891 he published what may be his most important book, on the relationship between the powers of Congress and State legislatures.Ordronaux, J. Constitutional legislation in the United States. T. & J.W. Johnson, 1891. About this book of more than 600 pages, Ordonaux said in the preface, > The accompanying work is an attempt to present in a concrete form the entire > system of Federal and State legislation, as practised under a written > Constitution in the United States. Its object is to expound those > administrative powers which, in our dual form of representative government, > are sovereign within their several spheres of action.....A written > Constitution is a political grammar to whose rules administrative laws must > conform, in order to give them judicial validity.....The government of forty > four independent States, dwelling in harmonious relations under a > supervisory Federal sovereignty, would seem, therefore, to justify the > treatment of Legislation as a department of jurisprudence meriting more > textual consideration than it has yet received.....the present treatise has > been prepared to meet the wants of those who, desiring to practise or > interpret the canons of representative government in the United States, may > seek to master the secrets of its architecture through a study of the labors > of its founders, and to trace its genesis and development to a providential > origin in the Spartan Commonwealths of our colonial period. Later life In 1898 Ordronaux wrote a biography of a Leonice Sampson Moulton,Ordronaux, J. Memoir of Leonice Marston Sampson Moulton. C.A. Hack & Son, printers, 1898. a presumed relative of his foster father, possibly his foster mother. She was born in 1811 and descended from the original Mayflower settlers to America. As Miss Sampson, she was sent on a secret mission to the US embassy in Buenos Aires to enquire into the sovereignty dispute between Great Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands. She is interesting according to Ordronaux for, among other things, keeping a very detailed diary which was far more comprehensive than the logs of the ships upon which she travelled. On June 27, 1901 Ordronaux addressed the graduate students of The University of Vermont.Ordronaux, J. Address delivered to the medical graduates of the University of Vermont. Free Press Association, 1901 Reading like a tribute to his own life's work he says, > A strange feeling possesses me as I rise to address you......I am here to > perform, with much surprise to myself, the same duty which devolved upon me, > on a similar occasion, thirty six years ago.......I stand in the presence of > two distinct periods with all their differing and startling results.

Ordronaux died of \\"apoplexy\\" at his home, Glen Head, in Roslyn, New York on January 20, 1908. His estate was initially valued at nearly $1,000,000. A large part of his bequests were to hospitals, universities, churches and other public institutions. These included $30,000 to Dartmouth College and $10,000 each to Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, The University of Vermont and the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island. However, the New York Times reported on 8 August 1908 that Ordronaux's total estate amounted to $2,757,000, the bulk of which was left to his three surviving sisters.

They play an experimental, highly technical style of black metal. The band has released nine studio albums and three EPs, most recently the LP Mass Cathexis on August 7, 2020. They have been described as \\"one of the most interesting, engaging black metal bands to emerge in recent years\\" and \\"one of the most important bands in modern black metal\\". History Krallice was by formed by Colin Marston and Mick Barr in 2007. Barr said in an interview that \\"Colin and I had talked about trying to do a black metal record together with no real plans of making it sound good or even releasing it, but as we were writing the music we kind of let it take its own shape. And we liked it more than we expected to.\\" They later recruited Lev Weinstein on drums and Nicholas McMaster on bass and second vocalist. They released their debut full length album Krallice in 2008 through Profound Lore to critical acclaim. Bass on this album was performed by Barr and Marston, while McMaster learned the bass parts and performed additional vocals. They released their second full-length album Dimensional Bleedthrough in November 2009 through Profound Lore and Gilead Media. The album received critical praise and was featured on a number of end-of-year lists. Around this time, Marston joined the Canadian death metal band Gorguts, Barr was working on music with Barr-Nevai, and Weinstein began working with Bloody Panda. They returned with their third full-length album Diotima in April 2011, to overwhelming critical acclaim. AllMusic wrote that \\"At their best, they're an overwhelming sonic force, and Diotima is their best album to date.\\" Later that year they released a single titled Traditional, as well as the cover EP Orphans of Sickness. Krallice independently released their fourth full-length album Years Past Matter in August 2012. Pitchfork described it as the most \\"relentless\\" and \\"unforgiving\\" album to date, and \\"a daunting, rewarding hour that calls for complete immersion.\\" Invisible Oranges wrote that the album \\"incorporates the playful and bleak elements from their previous two releases to showcase a newfound restraint that speaks to a group perfecting their craft. The complex melody lines still carry their signature density but are delivered with the discovered finesse of a seasoned and well- maintained machine. There‚Äôs an obvious scaling back, most notably on the intro to ‚ÄúIIIIIIIIII‚Äù, but their unerring tug-of-war between obscure chaos and blissful resolution seems even more heightened than previous efforts.\\" Following a period of quiet as the band members pursued their other projects, the band released their fifth full-length album Ygg Huur on July 30, 2015. The album's release was not announced in advance, and was named after a three- piece suite by Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi. The album received extremely positive reviews from many music critics. SPIN gave the album 8/10, describing it as \\"the band‚Äôs most outwardly tortured material since their 2008 debut, when their take on black metal structures was still relatively straightforward.\\" The album's style has been compared to Gorguts, Deathspell Omega, and Altar of Plagues. They followed this with the EP Hyperion on January 1, 2016. The material for this EP was written in 2013 for a split release that never materialised, and has been noted to represent a stylistic middle-ground between Years Past Matter and Ygg Huur. Musical style Krallice plays a form of progressive, highly technical black metal somewhat similar in style to that of Weakling and Wolves in the Throne Room. The band's music features dense multi-tracked guitars often performing fast, precise tremolo-picked guitar passages. The band make frequent use of long, complex song structures. The earlier material drew more heavily on early black metal bands such as Burzum, Gorgoroth, and Ulver, though over time the band have significantly expanded their sound beyond those early influences. While they originally opted for a lo-fi approach to production (as is traditional in black metal), Colin Marston said that \\"Our music was too dense to come across successfully with a low-fi approach. So instead, I decided to do a full-on 2\\" tape, everything multi-mic'ed, layered, and carefully mixed production.\\" Members * Mick Barr ‚Äì vocals, guitar * Colin Marston ‚Äì guitar * Lev Weinstein - drums (2008‚Äìpresent) * Nick McMaster - bass, vocals (2008‚Äìpresent)  Discography  ;Studio albums * 2008: Krallice (Profound Lore) * 2009: Dimensional Bleedthrough (Profound Lore) * 2011: Diotima (Profound Lore) * 2012: Years Past Matter (self-released, Gilead Media) * 2015: Ygg huur (self- released, Gilead Media) * 2016: Prelapsarian (self-released, Gilead Media) * 2017: Lo√ºm (self-released, Gilead Media) * 2017: Go Be Forgotten (self- released, Gilead Media) * 2020: Mass Cathexis (Gilead Media) ;EPs * 2011: Orphan of Sickness (self-released) * 2016: Hyperion (self-released, Gilead Media) * 2019: Wolf (self-released) ;Singles * 2011: \\"Traditional\\" (self- released) References External links * Krallice in Full Bloom Village Voice; May 4, 2011 Category:American avant-garde metal musical groups Category:American black metal musical groups Category:American progressive metal musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from New York (state) Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Musical groups from New York City ","title":"Krallice"},{"id":"21596066","text":"A sign with the image of Qasim taken down during the coup The Ramadan Revolution, also referred to as the 8 February Revolution and the February 1963 coup d'√©tat in Iraq, was a military coup by the Ba'ath Party's Iraqi-wing which overthrew the Prime Minister of Iraq, Abd al-Karim Qasim in 1963. It took place between 8 and 10 February 1963. Qasim's former deputy, Abdul Salam Arif, who was not a Ba'athist, was given the largely ceremonial title of President, while prominent Ba'athist general Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was named Prime Minister. The most powerful leader of the new government was the secretary general of the Iraqi Ba'ath Party, Ali Salih al-Sa'di, who controlled the National Guard militia and organized a massacre of hundreds‚Äîif not thousands‚Äîof suspected communists and other dissidents following the coup. History Background Some time after the Homeland Officers' Organization, or \\"Al-Ahrar\\" (\\"The Free\\") succeeded in toppling the monarchy and transforming the Iraqi government into a republic in 1958, signs of differences between political parties and forces and the Homeland Officers' Organization began when Pan-Arab nationalist forces led by Abdul Salam Arif and the Ba'ath Party called for immediate unification with the United Arab Republic (UAR). In an attempt to create a state of political equilibrium, the Iraqi Communist Party, which opposed unity, tried to discount cooperation with the UAR in economics, culture, and science rather than political and military agreements. Gradually, Abd al-Karim Qasim's relations with some of his fellow members of Al-Ahrar worsened, and his relationship with the unionist and nationalist currents, which had played an active role in supporting the 1958 movement, became strained. As for conflicting currents in the Iraqi Communist Party, they were aspiring for a coalition with General Qasim and had long been extending their relationship with him. Qasim thought that some of his allies in the Communist party were coming close to leapfrogging the proposition, especially after the increasing influence of the Communist party in the use of the slogan, proclaimed by many Communists and government supporters during marches: \\"Long live leader Abd al-Karim and the Communist Party in governing great demand!\\"Monsour, Ahmed and Aaraf Abd Alrazaq. 2002. Interview. \\"Witnessing the Age.\\" Al-Jazeera Television. Qasim began to minimize the Communist movement, which was poised to overthrow the government. He ordered the party to be disarmed and most of the party leaders to be arrested. However, the party retained Air Commander Celalettin Alaoqati and Lt. Col. Fadhil Abbas Mahdawi, Qasim's cousin. An overlapping set of both internal and regional factors created conditions conducive to the overthrow of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim and his staff. Some historians have argued that the overthrow can be attributed to the blundering individualism of Qasim and the errors committed in the execution of leaders and locals as well as acts of violence which arose from the Communist militias allied with Qasim.Pachachi, D. Adnan. Recorded Program. Al-Sharqiya Satellite Channel. Also to blame may be an increasingly forceful disagreement with Field Marshal Abdul Salam Aref, who was under house arrest. Qasim also made statements reiterating his support for Syrian General Abdel-Karim and Colonel Alnhlaoi Mowaffaq Asasa, with a view to executing a coup to divide Syria, which was alone with Egypt as part of the United Arab Republic. Coup Qasim's removal took place on 8 February 1963, the fourteenth day of Ramadan. The coup was therefore called the 14 Ramadan Coup. The coup had been in its planning stages since 1962, and several attempts had been planned, only to be abandoned for fear of discovery. The coup had been initially planned for January 18, but was moved to 25 January, then 8 February after Qasim gained knowledge of the proposed attempt and arrested some of the plotters. The coup began in the early morning of 8 February 1963, when the communist air force chief, Jalal al-Awqati, was assassinated and tank units occupied the Abu Ghraib radio station. A bitter two-day struggle unfolded with heavy fighting between the Ba‚Äôathist conspirators and pro-Qasim forces. Qasim took refuge in the Ministry of Defence, where fighting became particularly heavy. Communist sympathisers took to the streets to resist the coup, adding to the high casualties. On 9 February, Qasim eventually offered his surrender in return for safe passage out of the country. His request was refused, and on the afternoon Qasim was executed on the orders of the newly formed National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC).Marr, Phebe; \\"The Modern History of Iraq\\", p. 184-185 Qasim was given a mock trial over Baghdad radio and then killed. Many of Qasim's Shi'ite supporters believed that he had merely gone into hiding and would appear like the Mahdi to lead a rebellion against the new government; to counter this sentiment and terrorize his supporters, Qasim's dead body was displayed on television in a five minute long propaganda video called The End of the Criminals that included close-up views of his bullet wounds amid disrespectful treatment of his corpse, which is spat on in the final scene. U.S. involvement While there have been persistent rumors that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate there was no direct American involvement, although the U.S. had been notified of two aborted Ba'athist coup plots in July and December 1962 and its post-coup actions suggested that \\"at best it condoned and at worst it contributed to the violence that followed.\\"Longtime CIA officer Harry Rositzke later claimed \\"the CIA's major source, in an ideal catbird seat, reported the exact time of the coup and provided a list of the new cabinet members,\\" but this remains unverified. See Despite evidence that the CIA had been closely tracking the Ba'ath Party's coup planning since \\"at least 1961,\\" a CIA official working with Archie Roosevelt, Jr. to instigate a military coup against Qasim, and who later became the head of the CIA's operations in Iraq and Syria, has \\"denied any involvement in the Ba'ath Party's actions,\\" stating instead that the CIA's efforts against Qasim were still in the planning stages at the time. By contrast, Brandon Wolfe-Hunnicutt states that \\"Scholars remain divided in their interpretations of American foreign policy toward the February 1963 coup in Iraq,\\" but cites \\"compelling evidence of an American role in the coup.\\" Although it may not have organized the coup, U.S. officials were undoubtedly pleased with the outcome, ultimately approving a $55 million arms deal with Iraq and urging America's Arab allies to oppose a Soviet-sponsored diplomatic offensive accusing Iraq of genocide against its Kurdish minority at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. It is also widely believed that the CIA provided the new government with lists of communists and other leftists, who were then arrested or killed by the Ba'ath Party's militia‚Äîthe National Guard. This claim originated in a 27 September 1963 Al-Ahram interview with King Hussein of Jordan, who‚Äîseeking to dispel reports that he was on the CIA's payroll‚Äîdeclared: > You tell me that American Intelligence was behind the 1957 events in Jordan. > Permit me to tell you that I know for a certainty that what happened in Iraq > on 8 February had the support of American Intelligence. Some of those who > now rule in Baghdad do not know of this thing but I am aware of the truth. > Numerous meetings were held between the Ba'ath party and American > Intelligence, the more important in Kuwait. Do you know that ... on 8 > February a secret radio beamed to Iraq was supplying the men who pulled the > coup with the names and addresses of the Communists there so that they could > be arrested and executed? ... Yet I am the one accused of being an agent of > America and imperialism! According to Hanna Batatu, however, \\"The Ba'athists had ample opportunity to gather such particulars in 1958-1959, when the Communists came wholly into the open, and earlier, during the Front of National Unity Years‚Äî1957-1958‚Äîwhen they had frequent dealings with them on all levels.\\" In addition, \\"The lists in question proved to be in part out of date\\", which could be taken as evidence they were compiled well before 1963. Batatu's explanation is supported by Bureau of Intelligence and Research reports stating that \\"[Communist] party members [are being] rounded up on the basis of lists prepared by the now-dominant Ba'th Party\\" and that the Iraqi Communist Party had \\"exposed virtually all its assets\\" whom the Ba'athists had \\"carefully spotted and listed.\\" On the other hand, Nathan J. Citino notes that two officials in the U.S. embassy in Baghdad‚ÄîWilliam Lakeland and James E. Akins‚Äî\\"used coverage of the July 1962 Moscow Conference for Disarmament and Peace in Iraq's leftist press to compile lists of Iraqi communists and their supporters ... Those listed included merchants, students, members of professional societies, and journalists, although university professors constituted the largest single group.\\" Furthermore, \\"Weldon C. Mathews has meticulously established that National Guard leaders who participated in human rights abuses had been trained in the United States as part of a police program run by the International Cooperation Administration and Agency for International Development.\\" The U.S. provided $120,000 in \\"police assistance\\" to Iraq during 1963-1965, considerably less than the $832,000 in assistance that it provided to Iran during those years. Soviet tank \\"scandal\\" The Kennedy administration officially advocated a diplomatic settlement to the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War, but its provision of military aid to the Ba'athist government emboldened Iraqi hardliners to resume hostilities against Kurdish rebels on June 10, after which Iraq requested additional emergency U.S. assistance including napalm weapons. President Kennedy approved the arms sale in part on the recommendation of senior adviser Robert Komer and the weapons were provided, but an offer by Iraqi general Hasan Sabri al-Bayati to reciprocate this gesture by sending a Soviet T-54 tank in Iraq's possession to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad for inspection became something of a \\"scandal\\" as Bayati's offer had not been approved by al-Bakr, Foreign Minister Talib El- Shibib, or other senior Iraqi officials. Ultimately, the Ba'ath Party leadership reneged on that part of the agreement, fearing that handing over the tank to the U.S. would irrevocably harm Iraq's reputation. Shibib subsequently recounted that the incident damaged Iraq's relations with both the U.S. and the Soviet Union: \\"On the one side Iraq would lose the Soviets as a source of intelligence. On the other the United States would see us as a bunch of kid swindlers.\\" Soviet involvement Throughout 1963, the Soviet Union actively worked to undermine the Ba'athist government, supporting Kurdish rebels under the leadership of Mustafa Barzani with propaganda and a \\"small monthly stipend for Barzani,\\" suspending military shipments to Iraq in May, convincing its ally Mongolia to make charges of genocide against Iraq at the UN General Assembly from July to September, and sponsoring a failed communist coup attempt on July 3.  Influence on Syria  That same year, the Syrian party's military committee succeeded in persuading Nasserist and independent officers to make common cause with it, and successfully carried out a military coup on 8 March. A National Revolutionary Command Council took control and assigned itself legislative power; it appointed Salah al-Din al- Bitar as head of a \\"national front\\" government. The Ba'ath participated in this government along with the Arab Nationalist Movement, the United Arab Front and the Socialist Unity Movement. As Batatu notes, this took place without the fundamental disagreement over immediate or \\"considered\\" reunification having been resolved. The Ba'ath moved to consolidate its power within the new government, purging Nasserist officers in April. Subsequent disturbances led to the fall of the al-Bitar government, and in the aftermath of Jasim Alwan‚Äôs failed Nasserist coup in July, the Ba'ath monopolized power. Aftermath The Ba'athist government collapsed in November 1963 over the question of unification with Syria and the extremist and uncontrollable behavior of al-Sa'di's National Guard. President Arif, with the overwhelming support of the Iraqi military, purged Ba'athists from the government and ordered the National Guard to stand down; although al-Bakr had conspired with Arif to remove al-Sa'di, on 5 January 1964, Arif removed al-Bakr from his new position as Vice President, fearful of allowing the Ba'ath Party to retain a foothold inside his government. After the November coup, mounting evidence of Ba'athist atrocities emerged, which Lakeland predicted \\"will have a more or less permanent effect on the political developments in the country‚Äîparticularly on the prospects of a Ba'athi revival.\\" Marion Farouk- Sluglett and Peter Sluglett describe the Ba'athists as having cultivated a \\"profoundly unsavory image\\" through \\"acts of wanton brutality\\" on a scale without prior precedent in Iraq, including \\"some of the most terrible scenes of violence hitherto experienced in the postwar Middle East\\": \\"As almost every family in Baghdad was affected‚Äîand both men and women were equally maltreated‚Äîthe Ba'athists' activities aroused a degree of intense loathing for them that has persisted to this day among many Iraqis of that generation.\\" More broadly, the Slugletts state that \\"Qasim's failings, serious as they were, can scarcely be discussed in the same terms as the venality, savagery and wanton brutality characteristic of the regimes which followed his own.\\" Batatu recounts: > In the cellars of al-Nihayyah Palace, which the [National Guard's] Bureau > [of Special Investigation] used as its headquarters, were found all sorts of > loathsome instruments of torture, including electric wires with pincers, > pointed iron stakes on which prisoners were made to sit, and a machine which > still bore traces of chopped-off fingers. Small heaps of blooded clothing > were scattered about, and there were pools on the floor and stains over the > walls.

Controversy The song caused controversy as it was seen to contain political references to Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin in the lyrics. \\"Put in\\" is sounded alike with Putin. It's thought to have been negatively loaded against Russia as a result of the previous year's Russo-Georgian armed conflict. The words \\"put in\\" are sung with accented pronunciation as \\"poot een\\", which is how the Russian prime minister's name is pronounced. Eurovision Song Contest In the face of the pressure to make alterations to the lyrics from some of Russia's and Georgia's cultural and political figures (including Diana Gurtskaya, 2008 competitor from Georgia, and David Gamkrelidze,Gazeta.ru leader of the New Rights Party of Georgia), the official Georgian Eurovision spokesman said on 20 February 2009 that the song would not be amended. On 10 March 2009, the European Broadcasting Union ruled that the song lyrics \\"do not comply with Section 4 Rule 9 of the Rules of the 54th Eurovision Song Contest, and cannot take part in the competition as such\\", which meant that Georgia would have had to rewrite the song or choose another entry. A spokesman for the EBU said, \\"No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted.\\"Eurovision axes 'anti-Putin' song  Withdrawal of Georgia  On 11 March 2009, Georgia withdrew from the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, refusing to change the song lyrics and alleging that the decision to ask Georgia to revise its entry came about as a result of pressure from Russia,Georgia pulls out of Eurovision after controversial song is banned.
